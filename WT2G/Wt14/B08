						October 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> ADVISOR BRIEFS  <p> By Elizabeth Macdonald and Maxwell G. Dale  <p> Nuking Card Fraud <p>Been scammed on your plastic lately? Take heart the Department of Defense is on the case. To fight the $486 million it loses annually to credit card fraud, MasterCard has hooked up with Los Alamos National Laboratory, a government-owned research center in New Mexico, known for its top-secret nuclear-weapons research. The result? A neural-net computer program designed to learn a cardholder's spending pattern through genetic algorithms. The computer determines how cardholders typically spend their money and in what amounts. Any anomalous charges, and the program will alert bank officials to possible fraud. "The computer actually tells the bank in real time when there is a discrepancy," says MasterCard spokeswoman Nancy Elder. "It's a major advancement in fraud detection."  <p> Student-loan Lifeline?  <p>Over the last five years, college tuition costs have risen 7 percent annually, with no signs of abating. Many students cannot qualify for loans, leaving cash-strapped parents with little recourse. To assist these families, the National Collegiate Trust, a New York City nonprofit made up of private colleges and universities, recently introduced the Guaranteed Access to Education, or GATE, loan. The loan has no cap and carries an average fixed rate of 8 percent. The downside: It's a balloon loan. Students make interest-only payments for the first five years of payback, thereby lengthening the loan's term and fattening costs. So far, 23 schools have signed on, with another 14 scheduled to join by the end of this year. Currently, the trust has pulled together $50 million in available funds backed by privately placed bonds rated AA by Moody's Investor Service. Last year, the GATE program granted $7 million in loans to 3,000 students. For information, call 800-895-4283.  <p> Pricing Cheap Insurance <p>Pricing insurance isn't every family's idea of fun. With that in mind, Quotesmith Corp., an insurance-information company based in Darien, Illinois, recently introduced a hot line that offers consumers free price comparisons for more than 2,000 policy variations, based on Quotesmith's database of more than 400 insurers. A typical report will show the insurer's latest claims-paying-ability rating, the policy's guaranteed initial rates, and premiums ranked by price. Quotesmith offers information on six different types of insurance, including long-term care, but not on auto or homeowner policies. "The time is right for this kind of information service," says Quotesmith president Robert Bland. "Consumers need to be as informed as possible." Interested? Call 800-431-1147.   <p> Buddy Up <p>If you're thinking of entering a partnership, here's a big carrot: Auditing business partnerships has proved a no-win job for the Internal Revenue Service. According to a recent General Accounting Office report, the IRS audits relatively few partnership returns. When it does, odds are one in three that no taxes, penalties, and interest will be assessed. Moreover, change is not in the offing. "The IRS would have to begin now if it decides to have a partnership document-matching program in place by 2001," the report says.   <p> Capital gainers <p>Might it be that, contrary to common wisdom, the middle class would benefit most from a capital-gains cut? A recent study by the conservative Manhattan Institute for Policy Research says wealthy investors can "for the most part avoid the tax through well-known and commonly used techniques." For one, wealthy individuals typically have large and diversified investment portfolios, in which losers offset winners, thereby shrinking capital-gains taxes. The affluent also typically hold on to their assets, bequeathing them to heirs without incurring any capital-gains tax. Middle-class families, in contrast, often must sell an investment to pay for a large expense, such as a home or a college education. Having realized the gains, these folks are then hit by the taxes.  <p><p>

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>READING YOUR WAY TO RICHES
Whether you invest according to lunar cycles or modern portfolio theory, there's a newsletter out there that will sell you advice.<p>By Nick Ravo<p>Surely, somebody out there subscribes to the Hanover Intermediate Term Trader, Whitfield's Utility Letter, the F.X.C. Newsletter, or Bob Carver's Market Clues. And doubtless scores of investors won't make a move without the latest issue of Russ Kaplan's Heartland Adviser, which offers "in-depth Omaha-style analysis as popularized by Warren Buffet [sic],'' according to the promotional literature.
"Omaha-style analysis"?<p>Ah, the tip sheets (also known as newsletters, or market letters, if you want to get formal). Whimsical, occasionally wise, and often amazingly wrong, market newsletters number in the hundreds--500 is a common estimate. <p>Even the august Wall Street Journal began, in 1883, as the Customers' Afternoon News Letter. But the golden age for these publications dawned in the 1970s, when deregulation of the brokerage business prompted people to make more of their own financial decisions. Today, there's something out there for almost everyone. The choices range from The Moneypaper's general economic prognostication, personal-finance advice, and model stock portfolios to The Option Advisor, which deals exclusively with options strategies, to the Dick Davis Digest, a newsletter that samples other newsletters.<p>Newsletters appear weekly or monthly, run between 8 and 16 pages, and cost a lot--$69 to $250 per year is typical, and much higher fees are not unusual (though free or cheap trial subscriptions are quite common). The big ones, like the Value Line Investment Survey and the Standard & Poor's Outlook, have tens of thousands of subscribers. Others, like Harmonic Research, which uses solar and lunar eclipse cycles to "confirm its technical analysis," have perhaps a few hundred.<p>But are they worthwhile investments? After all, anyone with some newsletter-publishing software, a roll of stamps, and a hunch about the market can put one out. <p>"The proportion of newsletters that beat the market over the long haul is about the same--between 20 and 25 percent--as it is for mutual funds and professional money managers,'' says Mark Hulbert, publisher of the Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter based in Alexandria, Virginia, that ranks the performance of financial newsletters.<p>Newsletters are often a valuable source of information, according to Hulbert, whose digest, published since 1980, has become the Consumer Reports of comparative newsletter performance. Newsletters cover sectors often avoided by mutual funds and money managers, like micro-cap stocks, special situations (usually mergers and acquisitions), and medical technology. And unlike brokerage houses and sell-side research analysts, says Hulbert, newsletters have little or no vested interest in the stocks they recommend. They can be very useful, too, for investors who have a strategy and simply need the discipline of a model portfolio to follow it.<p>"That may be the major benefit,'' Hulbert says, "helping investors focus on a single strategy through thick and thin.''<p>Hulbert derives his rankings from model portfolios created from the advice offered by the newsletters. While he cautions that investment records sustained for less than five years are not a predictor of future results, long-term performance, particularly ten-year returns, appears to be more predictive, as the luck factor evens out over time.<p>He also cautions against combining the strategies of various newsletters. "I am less inclined to think that mixing and matching makes much sense even though you would think, in theory, that it would,'' Hulbert says.<p>The best-performing market letter by Hulbert's ten-year return criteria--by a wide margin--is Louis Navellier's MPT Review, up almost 1,000 percent in a decade. Navellier, a quantitative analyst, uses modern portfolio theory and computer programs to bet on inefficiently priced "high-alpha" stocks (stocks rising faster than the market). He also offers an unusually high number of stock recommendations.<p>Navellier, 37, became enamored with modern portfolio theory while studying for his M.B.A. at California State University at Hayward. The theory, based on research by Nobel Prize winners William F. Sharpe and Harry Markowitz, holds that it is possible to maximize return while minimizing risk, based on a belief that the market is efficient and that index funds are the best way to invest. Navellier, however, uses the theory to show that the market is only about 84 percent efficient. He looks for stocks in the other 16 percent by screening about 21,000 stocks each week before whittling the buy list down to about 400.<p>Besides his 14-year-old newsletter--which costs $225 annually and has 7,000 subscribers, about half of them brokers or institutional investors--Navellier also runs a money-management business with more than $1 billion in assets.<p>"My motive was different from a lot of people who put out newsletters,'' Navellier says. "I was an academic, and I just wanted to establish my theory.''<p>The worst ten-year performer according to Hulbert, also by a wide margin, is the Granville Market Letter, which lost 96.7 percent in the decade ended April 30, 1995. Joseph Granville, who charges customers $250 a year for his weekly newsletter, which has been around since 1963, has long been a critic of Hulbert's ranking technique, especially the averaging of various model portfolios to create one total return for a newsletter.<p>Granville is best known for having divined that the market was about to plummet and advising his readers on January 6, 1981, just as the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke 1000 for the first time in years, to "Sell everything!'' Thousands did, and the resulting flood of orders was widely credited with causing the Dow to fall 24 points. Unfortunately, those investors who stuck with the bearish Granville in the following years missed out on the historic bull market of the 1980s.<p>Interestingly, there appears to be no correlation between investment strategy and success or failure. "Almost any method, in the right hands, can work,'' Hulbert says. "And, in the wrong hands, almost any method can't work.'' In other words, a precious-metals newsletter is as likely to perform well or poorly as one devoted to value investing or penny stocks.<p>But one detailed study did demonstrate that market-timing newsletters were about as accurate as flipping a coin. Campbell Harvey of Duke University's Fuqua School of Business and John Graham of the University of Utah's Eccles School of Business studied the recommendations made according to 237 market-timing strategies in 100 letters between 1980 and 1992. <p>The study, released last May, found that the market rises only 48 percent of the time after market-timing letters recommend increasing equities and decreasing cash in asset allocations. The market falls only 51 percent of the time following a call by market-timing letters to reallocate portfolios with more cash and less stock.<p>"If the choice is between a buy-and-hold strategy and listening to asset-allocation recommendations in these newsletters, you are better off with buying and holding,'' Harvey says.<p>Not only was the overall performance of market-timing letters poor, but just eight newsletters in the study, which was published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, had substantial positive performance. "That number is, statistically, what one would expect if the strategies [employed by the letters] were randomly selected,'' Harvey says.<p>The winning market-timing newsletters were The Chartist's Actual Cash Account; Investors Intelligence's Switch Fund; Overpriced Stock Service; Switch Funding Timing's Conservative Strategy; No Load Select's Timing Strategy; Closed-End Funds IV; National Trendlines' Stock Timing Strategy; and Bob Nurock's Advisory, which had two successful strategies, TMI: Shorting and TMI: No Shorting.<p>At the bottom of the survey was, once again, The Granville Market Letter (Traders), which lost an average of 0.4 percent annually over the 12-year period.<p>"This is, in my opinion, remarkably hard to do,'' Harvey says, referring to Granville's performance. "Just putting your money in a savings account would beat that, and it compares quite unfavorably to the annual return for someone who bought and held the Standard and Poor's 500 over that period.''<p>In any case, market-timing letters are not the current rage in the notoriously faddish newsletter universe--mutual fund letters are. Some of them cover a single fund family, such as Fidelity Insight, Fidelity Monitor, and similar publications focusing on the Vanguard and T. Rowe Price funds. "When I started, only 2 of the 36 letters I followed were about mutual funds,'' says Hulbert, whose own monthly newsletter has 15,000 subscribers and costs $135 a year, with a five-month trial subscription available for $37.50. "Now half of the about 170 I follow do.''<p>There are also letters devoted to esoterica like sector rotation, Elliott wave theory, New Zealand stocks, even astrology. "J.P. Morgan used to keep an astrologer on staff,'' says Arch Crawford, a former<a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> analyst, now a "financial astrologer" and publisher of the 18-year-old Crawford Perspectives, which has about 1,000 subscribers who pay $250 a year to read about how the stars and the moon (along with a little technical analysis) may affect Wall Street. "[Morgan] also said that millionaires don't use astrologers but billionaires do,'' Crawford says.<p>The Granville-induced nosedive of 1981 is almost unthinkable today, in part because of the surfeit of market information now available at low cost on cable television, online, and in personal-finance magazines. However, newsletters--which have been reducing subscription prices since the crash of 1987 because of slow or no circulation growth--can still have quite an impact on individual stocks and mutual funds.<p>In January, for example, Wall Street Strategies, with a circulation of about 5,000, said that The <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab Corp.</b></a> was about to be bought by Goldman Sachs. The deal never materialized, but Schwab shares rose 5 percent on January 16 following the newsletter's prediction. The next month, shares of <a name="NASD:ERTS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14059"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Electronic Arts</b></a> soared 10 percent over two days because of a Wall Street Strategies tip--once again wrong--that the software company was about to be taken over by DreamWorks SKG, the motion picture studio formed by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and David Geffen.<p>"Even though the takeovers didn't happen, both of those stocks exploded anyway,'' boasts Charles V. Payne, the owner and chief editor of the four-year-old Wall Street Strategies. Schwab's stock went up 86 percent between January and early July, while Electronic Arts rose 45 percent between the rumor of its takeover and early July. "Ninety-nine percent of the rumors don't work out, but that doesn't mean you can't make money in rumors. If you can get something before Business Week or Dan Dorfman, you are going to make money.''<p>Sometimes, however, the rumor mill is correct. For example, Payne's letter reported in its April and May issues that Lotus Development Corp. was a takeover candidate. This was before <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>'s hostile offer for the company at the beginning of June. <p>Payne, a former broker and analyst, charges $2,250 a year for a subscription that includes a monthly newsletter and updates faxed four times daily. Roughly 90 percent of the subscribers are brokers, which Payne calls "a huge testimonial since their firms already provide them with millions of dollars of information for free.''<p>Wall Street Strategies also watches for technical bounces and undervalued stocks, but, says Payne, "It's the takeovers where we are making a reputation.'' He adds that about 70 percent of the newsletter's calls this year have been correct.<p>Such self-promotion is mild compared with some of the advertisements seen every day in Investors Business Daily, Barron's, The Wall Street Journal, and elsewhere. Claims of quadruple-digit returns and No. 1 rankings from obscure publications are not uncommon, especially for commodities, futures, and options newsletters. <p>The Journal didn't accept newsletter ads until the late eighties, in part because their claims were--and are--often difficult to prove. In May, for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Stephen Leeb, a fund manager and investment advisor based in New York, and KCI Communications, an Alexandria, Virginiabased publisher of several newsletters, with using Leeb's letter, The Big Picture, to promote a fraudulent investment strategy as part of a coordinated marketing effort to solicit investments in Leeb's fund.<p>In ads for The Big Picture, according to the SEC, Leeb said an investor using his market-timing program, Master Key, could have turned $10,000 into more than $39 million from 1980 to 1992. But the SEC claims the results could have been obtained only by retroactively applying a constantly updated version of the program. According to the SEC, many strategies included in the constantly updated program were not developed until after 1980. Thus, no one could have realized the advertised gain--even hypothetically.<p>Performance puffery, though, is common in the market-letter business, so caveat subscriber--this is a largely unsupervised market. In June, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission requested that commodity and financial-futures letter writers register as commodity trading advisors, even though the Supreme Court has ruled that market letters are bona fide publications, which suggests that such licensing or registration would constitute an unconstitutional infringement on free speech. Only if the publishers are also investment advisors, as defined by the SEC, must they register as such with the commission.<p>Still, Peter Brimelow, a senior editor at Forbes and author of The Wall Street Gurus: How You Can Profit From Investment Newsletters (Minerva, 1986), says that most newsletter publishers "are not getting any commission, and they only succeed if they make money for the subscriber.'' <p>He's right, at least insofar as his description holds. But some publishers try to have it both ways. George Chelekis's Hot Stocks Review, one of the few financial newsletters available on the Internet (<a name="NASD:AMER"></a><b>America Online</b>'s popular Motley Fool stock forum is also available online), focuses on small Canadian stocks and derives some of its income from research fees paid by some of the companies he writes about, often glowingly. By law, such interests generally must be disclosed, which Chelekis does. Nonetheless, in the eyes of some, this would make him a stock promoter rather than a newsletter publisher. <p>In the end, says Mark Hulbert, "People should subscribe--but they should be skeptical.'' <p>Nick Ravo is a reporter for The New York Times.

						July/August 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> THE NEW BOOK ON BOOK VALUE  <p> By Jonathan Butler  <p> When Benjamin Graham and David Dodd published their landmark investment book Security Analysis in 1934, they laid the foundation of what has become known as value investing. Over the past six decades, value investors like Warren Buffett have consistently earned strong returns picking stocks based on three criteria: low price-to-earnings ratios (the price of a stock divided by the current year's earnings per share), high dividend yields, and low price-to-book ratios a measure based on book value. Ofthe three, the price-to-book ratio has become the most vexing to use in valuing a stock.   <p> Book value (also referred to as common shareholders equity or net asset value) is simply a company's total assets minus liabilities. It provides "a snapshot of the worth of the company at any given time if you were going to close the doors and cash in everything that the company had," says John Cleland, chief investment strategist at Security Benefit in Topeka, Kansas.  <p> Investors usually look at either book value per share (book value divided by the number of shares outstanding) or price-to-book ratio (share price divided by book value per share). If a company's current price-to-book ratio is below its own historic level or below the current levels in its industry group, it can be a sign that the stock is cheap.  <p> Using book value to pick stocks is a proven formula for success, says Christopher Browne, a general partner at Tweedy, Browne in New York City. Browne cites a study by the Yale School of Management that divided companies on the New York Stock Exchange into ten groups, from highest to lowest price-to-book. The cheapest decile returned 14.4 percent per year between 1967 and 1984, while the most expensive decile returned only 6 percent per year. "Buying assets at a discount generally leads to superior returns, "Browne says. "If you cover the downside, the upside will take care of itself."  <p> The problem is that this historical evidence may not be valid for the future. Book value, says Cleland, was created at a time when manufacturing companies that had invested heavily in plants and equipment both easy to value were dominant. But the U.S. economy has shifted toward technology and service companies whose book value does not accurately reflect their breakup value the cash a company could raise after all of its assets were sold and its debt repaid.   <p> Compare software giant <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> with <a name="NYSE:IP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10800"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>International Paper</b></a>. Microsoft's current market value of about $50 billion is five times that of IP, but Microsoft's book value is roughly one third smaller.Why? Because the market value of Microsoft's stock reflects a larger portion of intangible assets a highly educated workforce, programming expertise, and market dominance. These intangible assets aren't counted toward book value. This helps explain why the U.S. equities market now trades at 3.5 times price-to-book, about double its historical average. "Book value meant liquidation value, and it just doesn't anymore," says Chris Davis, comanager of the <a name="FUND:NYVTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NYVTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>New York Venture Fund</b></a> and the <a name="FUND:SLASX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SLASX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Selected American Fund</b></a>. <p> The lofty market valuations of growth stocks like Microsoft or semiconductor maker <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a> also reflect expectations of earnings growth. "Using book value to look at something like a semiconductor company is meaningless," says Jeremy Biggs, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Company in New York. The same holds true for other burgeoning industry sectors such as biotechnology and entertainment.  <p> Book value also can be misleading because of the way companies value assets on their balance sheet normally based on acquisition cost minus depreciation. Accounting rules do not permit companies to appreciate the value of most assets. Thus, during times of inflation, the assets on a company's balance sheet may sharply understate their true value.   <p> Rising commodity prices can have a similar effect. If, for instance, the price of oil doubled overnight, <a name="NYSE:XON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10537"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Exxon</b></a>'s stock would skyrocket. And so would the value of all of its assets. But its book value would be unchanged, so the stock would suddenly appear much more expensive on a price-to-book basis, despite a share price rise based on a real increase in the value of the company.  <p> Although corporate management cannot raise the price of an asset on the balance sheet, it can decrease it. The restructuring of corporate America over the past ten years has resulted in many such write-downs. This has also decreased the utility of book value.   <p> In 1992, <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> took a $1.2 billion restructuring charge and a $33.1 billion charge to cover retirement benefits. As a result, the book value per share fell from $43 in January to almost $8 by the end of the year. Was GM really worth a fraction of its former value? Not at all. Over the same period, the stock price rose modestly from $29 to $32, not an uncommon reaction to such fiscal house cleaning. "By removing the uncertainty surrounding a festering situation, a write-off can be good news for a stock," says Brian Berris, a partner at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.  <p> Book value can be especially useful in analyzing finance companies, public utilities, and many foreign firms. The holdings of securities firms, investment banks, and brokerage firms consist mostly of marketable securities, the one asset type whose value can be marked up on a balance sheet. In the case of public utilities, their rates, set by regulatory agencies, are usually based on the original value of their underlying assets, generally equal to book value. So a utility's book value helps estimate future rate increases and hence, earnings increases.  <p> Outside the U.S., says Jeremy Biggs of Fiduciary Trust, book value remains "very relevant." The reason is that many countries require that hard-asset values be written up to reflect inflation. In Latin America, this accounting difference has kept price-to-book ratios in line with historic levels, even with recent declines in stock prices.  <p> The elegant simplicity of book value will not be replaced easily. In a recent letter to the shareholders of ,<a name="NYSE:BRK.A"></a><b> Berkshire Hathaway</b>, the investment company he runs, Warren Buffett suggested using "intrinsic value" as a measure of a company's true worth. Intrinsic value the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a company during its lifetime is in essence the price a reasonable person would pay to acquire it. Because it takes into consideration earnings, dividends, future prospects, and quality of management in addition to assets, intrinsic value "is the only logical way to evaluate the relative attractiveness of investments and businesses," Buffett says. Unfortunately, it is also "impossible to pinpoint."  <p> Another measure of a company's underlying worth is replacement book value. To calculate this, analysts estimate a current market, or replacement, value for all its tangible assets. According to Goldman Sachs, the S&P 400 now sells at 1.03 times replacement book. This number peaked at 1.9 in the mid-1960s and sank below 0.5 in the early 1980s, foreshadowing the flood of corporate stock repurchases, mergers, and acquisitions that followed.  <p><p><p>

						June 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> STOCK TIP:  E PLURIBUS UNUM  <p> By Jonathan Butler  <p> Pity the investor trying to do his due diligence. Well over150,000 U.S. stock recommendations are made by equity analysts each year; some stocks are followed by 40 or 50 investment firms at a time. Even the most omnivorous reader can't stay abreast of it all.  <p> To help investors get an overview of how a company is regarded by Wall Street, Standard & Poor's now produces an average qualitative opinion rating, part of its new Analysts' Consensus Estimates database. The AQO calculates the consensus recommendations of more than 2,200 market analysts from 210 firms covering 5,400 stocks. In addition to "evening out the static from corporate-finance relationships, trading, and market-making relationships," says Tom Elliott of Research On Line in San Francisco, one of the developers of the AQO, "the rating lets you see what the whole forest looks like instead of just a few trees."  <p> To compute the AQO, S&P assigns a numerical weighting to every outstanding market analyst recommendation according to the following scale: Buy is assigned a 2; buy/hold, 1; hold, 0.5; no opinion, 0; hold/sell, -1; sell, -2. These scores, tallied and averaged, yield the AQO. Greater than 1 is a buy, less than 0 a sell. For example, Pepsico, at 1.17, is a buy, while Salomon, at -0.57, is a sell.  <p> While the idea of looking at a consensus opinion is fairly new, the long-running debate over the effect of equity analyst recommendations on stock prices provides a useful backdrop for evaluating the AQO. The most recent voice in this debate is that of Kent Womack, a professor of finance at the Amos Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. In his 1995 study of more than 1,500 recommendations made from 1989 to 1991, Womack found that strong buy recommendations led to an average 5 percent rise over the market in just a one-month period. Strong sells have a longer effect on stocks and cause bigger moves in prices: Stocks getting sell recommendations underperformed the market by 14 percent over six months.  <p> Womack's work contradicts other research, such as a 1994 study by University of Chicago professors Jennifer Francis and Leonard Soffer suggesting the effect of buy recommendations is at best negligible and at worst negative. But most academics agree that sell recommendations have greater predictive power than buys. One reason? Analysts are under pressure not to jeopardize investment-banking relationships by giving a damaging review of a client company hence brokerage-house buys outnumber sells by as high as 10 to 1, and the AQO on the S&P 500 is 0.88, much closer to 1, a buy, than 0, a sell. Considering their relative rarity and the collateral risks an equity analyst takes with negative opinions, sells have more credibility in the marketplace.  <p> Unlike an individual recommendation, which is an absolute and time-bound judgment, the AQO is most useful for evaluating a company relative to its own record. "The changes in rating over time are what really have power," says Andy Ratoff of Zack's Investment Research in Chicago, which offers a similar product called Analyst Watch. The lesson for investors using the AQO, says Womack, is to watch for stocks with extreme ratings that are shifting greatly. "If you start to see a change in a very positive or very negative consensus view, it's very likely there's some money to be made," he says. Or saved.  <p> This strategy would have worked well this past year for investors in Players International, a California-based gaming company. Stockholders keeping an eye on Players' AQO last September could have avoided the 28 percent drop in stock price that occurred before the end of the year. Throughout the summer of 1994, the company's AQO remained at a lofty 1.85 while its stock price climbed from 15 to 23. By the end of September, the stock wasat 24.25, but the AQO had changed direction, dropping to 1.57 still a buy but reflecting a 15 percent move in the wrong direction. Over the next three months the AQO slid to 1.35 in November whilethe stock hit a low of 17.50 in December. At the end of January, with the stock at 20.50, the AQO turned back up, strengthening the buy signal. By mid-March the stock was back above 26.  <p> The AQO is also a good way to see how a company stacks up against its industry competition, which Michael Dougherty, an independent broker at Linsco/Private Ledger in Denver, says often leads him to revise his investments. "If I like a company that doesn't have such a high AQO rating, I'll go look at other ones in its industry with higher ratings to see if I'm missing something and perhaps find a better candidate," he says.  <p> Where there is a consensus, there is also a contrarian view. The contrarian reasoning goes like this: If every market analyst out there is saying sell, then all the smart money will already be out of the stock and the only way for the stock to go will be up. These folks look to buy stocks with negative AQOs for several months running, long enough for all the pessimism to be reflected in the price.  <p> This can be a lucrative strategy, says Christopher Ma, a vice president at Investment Research Co. in Chicago and a former professor of finance at Texas Tech University. After studying more than 4,000 consensus opinions since 1989, Ma concluded recently that while the strong buy stocks outperformed the market by 3.1 percentage points over a 12-month period, the strong sell stocks did even better, beating the market by almost 4 percentage points."If the market becomes one-sided, it can be wrong," he says."In this case, when the consensus tells you to sell, it looks like you should buy." Or as James Mallett, an associate professor of finance at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida, puts it, "Once all the good news is out and the rating is as high as possible, where else can the demand come from?"  <p> The AQO is available to anyone with access to S&P Research Reports. Individuals who don't want to subscribe directly to the $425-a-year online database (800-438-1032) can get individual reports mailed to them for $10 apiece by calling 800-642-2858. They can also try requesting company reports from their broker. Useful as it is, Elliott cautions that the AQO should not be the only analytical tool investors rely on. "Sticking rigorously to this system without engaging your judgment hurts performance," he says. <p><p><p>

						June 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor   <p> KEEP YOUR OPTIONS COVERED <p>Stock options aren't alchemy. Properly understood, they're a safe, sane way to make money or guard against risk. <p>  <p>By Nick Ravo  <p> It's easy to see why derivatives frighten most investors. After all, a cardinal rule of investing is never buy something you don't understand. And how many investors can define a recon, a tranche, or a strip?  <p> There is, however, one derivative that investors can master with a little effort: stock options. And there is, as well, a conservative way to invest in them.  <p> Buying stock options confers the right but not the obligation to buy or to sell stock at a set price (the strike price) by a set date (the expiration). The buy option is a "call," the sell optionis a "put," and both can be purchased or sold through a broker. It's an investment arena that has experienced explosive growth since 1990, with the number of equities traded in the U.S. that could be optioned rising from 800 to more than 1,550 in 1994. Many more trade on foreign exchanges.  <p> "People shouldn't be afraid of options,'' says Bernard Schaeffer, senior editor of The Option Advisor, a newsletter based in Cincinnati. "They can be useful for insuring a portfolio, or for speculation, or for adding income.''  <p> The idea of trading commodity options insuring a supply of, say, wheat at a given price has been around for centuries. Similarly, as long as there have been stockbrokers, they have been selling de facto options as well as the stocks themselves. In the United States, options are as old as Wall Street. Until 1973, however, they were private transactions between "put and call'' brokers who concocted their own prices and wrote the options and investors.That year, options were listed for the first time, just like stocks, which allowed investors to sell puts and calls as easily as they could buy them.  <p> Selling options, particularly call options on stocks one already owns (a practice known as writing covered calls), is the conservative way to play the options market. But most investors prefer to buy options and risk the loss of their entire investment. Why? Potentially phenomenal returns.  <p> Options provide investors with an opportunity to leverage their capital to participate in the price movement of a large amount of stock for a relatively small amount of money. For illustration, let's say that instead of buying 100 common shares of XYZ Corp. for $10,000 (at $100 a share), you purchase one 30-day call contract for XYZ common with a strike price of $105 a share. You pay "1,"or $100, for this contract, the right to buy or sell 100 shares. Contract prices vary widely but can cost far less than a single share of stock. As a general rule, call premiums are more expensive in relation to the stock price when the market is rising and put premiums are more expensive when the market is falling. <p> Now let's suppose that sometime during the next 30 days, the price of XYZ springs from $100 a share up to $110 a share. XYZ's common shareholders have just cleared a paper profit of $10 a share, or $1,000 on 100 shares a very nice 10 percent gain in less than a month.  <p> But now let's look at how well you would have done with your XYZ options contract. Because of the movement in the price of XYZ's stock, your option entitles you to buy 100 shares of a $110 stock for only $105 each. Essentially, it's become a ticket to cash in on a $1,000 move, and it's worth much more than the $100 you paid for it.  <p> Alternatively, you could sell the option anytime before it expires to someone who wants to buy XYZ stock or to another option buyer. The option that you paid 1 for would be worth at least 5, or $500. Or, upon its expiration, you could exercise the option and keep or sell the shares yourself.  <p> Your final profit, either way, will be slightly less than $500 though, because of commissions and the price of the option. Still, you could end up clearing about $365 on the transaction a return of about 250 percent on your initial risk money.  <p> The catch, as we mentioned, is that you could and probably will lose your entire upfront investment. Call options become worthless if the stock closes under the strike price on the expiration date (less than $105 a share in the XYZ example). In fact, according to most studies, stock options expire worthless to the buyer 70 to 80 percent of the time.  <p> The reasons for this have to do with how options premiums are structured, a subject we will deal with shortly. Even when you win, however, the likelihood of making a killing is small, as stocks seldom appreciate 10 percent in a single month, as XYZ did.  <p> If option contracts expire seven or eight times out of ten, then somebody must be raking in all those bets, which are called premiums. The folks who do are the option sellers, usually referred to as writers. Instead of trying to break the bank, these more conservative investors prefer collecting premiums of 1 and 2 percent of the money they are risking (sometimes more) everyone or two months. That's where selling covered calls comes in. <p> Writing covered calls is the easiest and most cautious way to sell options. "Covered'' means that stocks you own back the options, like collateral.  <p> It works like this: Let's say you bought 300 shares of <a name="NYSE:TWX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11482"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>TimeWarner</b></a> on April 7 for $38.38. That same day, you could have also sold three covered-call contracts (remember that one contract equals 100 shares). Depending on the strike price and the expiration date you chose, you could have collected a premium ranging from4 1/8 (for a call option expiring in June with a strike price of 35) to 1 1/8 (for a call option expiring in June with a strike price of 40) to 1/8 (for a call option expiring in May with a strike price of 45).  <p> Now let's say you sold the middle option. You would collect $337.50 in premiums, about $300 after the broker's commission. If the price of Time Warner hasn't exceeded 40 by the third Friday in June, you keep your stock and the premium.  <p> If the stock "strikes'' 40, you retain the premium but are obligated to sell the shares at that price, which still leaves you with a gain of 1 5/8 points, or $487.50. If the stock goes to 42, however, or shoots up to 60, you still must sell at 40.  <p> The premium may sound measly, but $300 is 2.6 percent of the $11,512.50 that 300 shares of Time Warner cost you. Since the option was about two months long, multiply that return by six and that's the equivalent of an annual return of 15.6 percent. And that's just the premium. The stock itself may increase in price.  <p> Writing covered calls isn't a great all-weather strategy, though it worked very well in 1994, when many stocks traded in a narrow range. In a flat market, the risk of having your stock called away is lower, but so are the premiums.  <p> There are two major risks with this options play. First, should your stock shoot up past the strike price say, because the company is a takeover target you will not share in the run-up. Second, the stock could decline by an amount larger than the premium you collected.  <p> "It works great in nonvolatile markets," says Lawrence G. McMillan, president of McMillan Analysis Corp., an options consultant and publisher in Morristown, New Jersey. "But you are giving away upside potential and still have downside risk."  <p> But assuming you invest only in stocks you believe in and wish to hold, you would have experienced this loss anyway, and the options premium you collected at least cushioned the blow. (You can also buy back the option and then sell your stock if you are worried about the share price falling even further.) "With writing covered calls, investors should expect to enhance their performance in an up market and cushion their losses in a down market," says Richard Schmidt, president of Stellar Management, a money-management firm in Naples, Florida. "But it's not a foolproof strategy. It won't make you money in a down market unless you are a great stock picker."  <p> Generally, the longer to expiration, the bigger the premium you can collect (and the greater the risk the stock will move above the strike price or lose more than you earn on the premiums). An option that has 90 days until its expiration might have a premium of two points, but two days before expiration the premiummay have declined to an eighth of a point.  <p> In addition to its so-called time value, a premium's size depends on its intrinsic or cash value, as well as the perception of investors on how likely the contract is to finish in the money. The key terms used to describe this cash value are in the money, at the money, and out of the money.  <p> For a call option, if the stock is selling at a higher price than its strike price, it is in the money. That's because the option could be instantly exercised.  <p> That doesn't mean the buyer will make a profit. Premiums for in-the-money options are generally slightly greater than the spread between the stock price and the strike price. For example, if CBS were selling at 63 and the strike price is 60, somebody could simply buy the stock at 60 with an option and then sell it at 63. But the cost of this option would probably be at least 3 1/8 points even more if there is a long time until expiration or if the stock is unusually volatile.  <p> Sellers of covered calls face an analogous dilemma: The premiums can be quite large with in-the-money options, but unless the stock was purchased at a price below the strike price, much of the profit will evaporate if the option is exercised. And within-the-money options, the odds are very good that it will be. Of course, the CBS stock could fall below 60. Then it would be out of the money, enabling the option seller to keep the premium and the stock.  <p> An option is at the money when the strike price and sale price are identical. If it expires at the money, you keep the premium and could be called to relinquish the stock at the strike price, though that is unlikely, since the option holder could get the same price in the equity market.  <p> Most professional investors advise amateur covered-call writers to stick with options that are slightly out of the money and expire in one or two months, at least in the beginning. That's because these options are the least likely to be called away. <p> Most investors use covered calls to pick up a little extra income on stocks that have already appreciated somewhat but may be stagnant. Developing an entire portfolio around covered-call writing requires a lot more technical knowledge, training, monitoring, and trading skills.  <p> Puts, too, can be covered. Their sale can be offset by "shorting" the same stock selling borrowed shares in the expectation that the price will fall, allowing you to buy the shares back at a lower price and pocket the difference. Or you could simultaneously buy and sell a put on the same stock.  <p> If a put is exercised, or "put" to you, it is a cash transaction. You buy stock at the strike price instead of handing over stock you own.  <p> As an example of this, imagine you own 300 shares of <a name="NASD:AMER"></a><b>America Online</b> and you sold three puts for a premium of one with a strike price of 70. If the stock should happen to fall to 40, you lose. The person who bought the put option makes you buy 300 shares of America Online at 70. You are out $30 a share, or $9,000,with only the negligible solace of keeping the modest premium. <p> If you do want to write puts, your broker will scrutinize your trading history and financial wherewithal before allowing you to do so. (All option traders, even those writing covered calls, have to sign an options agreement with their broker stating that they understand the risks.)  <p> Stories are legion about investors who were wiped out in October1987 after writing puts. They had been collecting fat premiums, betting that the strong market would run forever. When the market crashed, however, the puts were exercised, and the buyers forced the sellers to buy stock at precrash prices.  <p> These investors, however, were selling on margin, also known as writing "naked" puts. They didn't have the cash to buy stock put to them. The same thing can also happen with calls that aren't covered. For example, you sell a call option on a stock you don't own, and that stock shoots to the moon. If the option is exercised, you'll have to buy it at the new stratospheric market price so it can be called away from you at the much lower strike price. <p> The clear lesson here is that naked writing leaves a naked investor. Keep your puts and calls covered.  <p> For those who wish to learn more about options and there is a lot more to learn, there are many places to turn. In addition to newsletters like The Option Advisor, the Value Line Options Survey (800-535-9643) is a weekly service offered by Value Line describing various options strategies, for beginners in the option market as well as advanced investors, and providing specific recommendations for covered-call writing. The Options Institute (800-OPTIONS), the educational arm of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, has lots of how-to information for investors. An easy-to-follow introductory book on options is How the Options Markets Work (New York Institute of Finance Press), by Joseph A. Walker. <p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - -  <p>Nick Ravo is a reporter for The New York Times. He can be reached by E-mail at nravo@aol.com. <p><p>

						By Andrew Gluck  <p> Adjustable-rate mortgage funds, among the hottest mutual fund products of the early 1990s, may be about to join the ranks of other fad funds. ARM fund assets, which peaked at $22.2 billion in September 1993, plunged to $9.9 billion by the end of1994. <p> This phenomenon is not without precedent in the mutual fund industry. In the early 1980s, "government plus" bond funds raised yields by writing options on their portfolios. Gone. In the late1980s it was option income funds, now extinct. Short-term world multimarket funds enlivened the early 1990s, mixing foreign government bonds with cross-hedged currencies. The strategy foundered when international-currency relationships broke down in 1992, and the funds that remain have returned 1 percent annually over the last three years.  <p> ARM funds may be next on the list of casualties. On March 31,         T. Rowe Price, the no-load fund family that manages $60 billion, turned its ARM fund into a plain short-term bond fund. "We found that the ARM concept just didn't work," says Steven Norwitz, a company vice president. And Geoff Bobroff, president of Bobroff Consulting, an East Greenwich, Rhode Island, mutual fundconsulting firm, says, "There probably will be no ARM funds five years from now."  <p> ARM funds promised money marketlike safety with about two percentage points higher yield. In fact, they've returned 2.01 percent annually over the last three years, compared with 3.31 percent for money market funds. Of course, any fund category can go through a slump, but ARM funds don't make sense for the average income investor. When asked whether there is such a thing as a good ARM fund, newsletter publisher William E. Donoghue says, "That's like asking which foot I'd like to have stepped on. ARM funds are not worthy of consideration."  <p> ARM funds sound great. They invest at least 65 percent of their assets in adjustable-rate mortgages. Unlike conventional bonds, ARM yields typically reset, or adjust, at least annually. Payments also eventually rise, providing an inflation hedge that is unique for a fixed-income investment. And because ARMs eventually reset their rates to the current yield, a long-term investor should ultimately get back all principal.  <p> Franklin Advisers, the San Franciscobased load-fund giant, rolled out its first ARM fund in October 1987. By mid-1991, yields on safe money market funds and CDs were at lows not seen in ageneration. Yield-hungry investors poured $100 million a week into the Franklin fund, pushing assets to $1.5 billion. Other firms scrambled to offer their own ARM funds, which numbered 75 by the end of 1993.   <p> The seeds of the ARM funds' demise were sown just as their appeal peaked. Fixed-rate mortgage rates fell in 1991 and 1992, hitting 30-year lows in 1993, and homeowners refinanced out of adjustable-rate mortgages in unprecedented numbers. When a homeowner prepays an adjustable-rate mortgage, the fund that owns the mortgage gets its money back sooner than expected and reinvests at lower interest rates.   <p> In 1994, mortgage rates jumped 2.5 percentage points, ARM coupons couldn't reset upward fast enough to maintain their price, and the average fund lost 2.2 percent. But even if the market gyrations of recent years do not repeat themselves, the case for investing in an ARM fund remains weak.   <p> Newlin Rankin, portfolio manager of the <a name="FUND:BARGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BARGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Benham Adjustable Rate Government Securities Fund</b></a>, rated above average by Morningstar and a rare no-load in the category, argues that his fund is a good choice for anyone who is parking cash for three years and wants a higher return than a money market but less risk thana short-term bond fund. Rankin projects that an investor could earn an annualized total return of 6.90 percent over three years. "Now, you have to ask yourself, Is it worth it?" he says.  <p> The answer is no. If an investor put half his cash in a money market fund at 6 percent and the other half in a three-year Treasury note at 6.8 percent, he or she would get a blended return of 6.4 percent just 53 basis points less than the ARM fund but with virtually no risk and lots of liquidity.  <p> Any investor who does want to invest in an ARM fund should find out whether it holds derivatives or illiquid mortgages, both of which have caused big losses for these funds. The ARM-fund investor should also determine how often a fund's mortgages reset and what type of index most of its portfolio is pegged against.  <p> Finally, all but 25 of the 85 ARM funds carry sales loads or12b-1 fees, according to Lipper Analytical Services. They range from a 5 percent front-end load to 12b-1 fees below 1 percent and will lower any return.  <p><p><p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> DEAR COMPUTER, I NEED A JOB  <p>Why a machine might read your next resume  <p> By Kathleen Pender  <p> Job hunting--already impersonal and dehumanizing--is getting more so. The latest development: Companies are using computers to screen resumes for key skills, degrees, credentials, and experience. <p> Last year, when UPS Airlines said it would add 145 jobs, the largest private employer in Kentucky got 2,910 resumes in ten days. "We put them all into our computer system and responded in three or four days," says Pat O'Leary, the human resources manager at UPS.  <p> The Association of Human Resource Systems Professionals, a Dallas trade group, says that 10 percent of companies with more than1,000 employees now use resume-scanning software. "We are going to run into this in all the Fortune 500 companies," says Martin Yate, the author of Resumes That Knock 'Em Dead (Bob Adams, 1995). Current users include <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:XRX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11657"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Xerox</b></a>, Salomon Brothers, Cornell University, <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:JNJ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10824"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Johnson & Johnson</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:NU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11088"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Northeast Utilities</b></a>, and Bank of America.  <p> The software programs flash through resumes looking for keywords. Those with the most "hits" bubble to the top of the electronic pile. When Disneyland needed to hire a mechanical engineer to keep Pirates of the Caribbean and other rides running, its computer program searched resumes for the keywords theme park, down time, Audio-Animatronics, HVAC, fluid mechanics, and ride and system design, says Mark Neynaber, senior professional staffing repat Disneyland. When hiring a pilot, UPS Airlines plugs in words such as "727, 767, airline transport pilot's license, and 10,000 hours flight time," O'Leary says. "If we're doing minority hiring, we might add OBAP [Organization of Black Airline Pilots]."  <p> The growing use of computers in resume screening requires a change in approach for job hunters. The old rules called for lots of verbs--created, developed, launched. But the new software looks for nouns--vice president, marketing, Spanish speaker. A computer scanner sometimes will kick out or misread resumes that aren't printed in a common typeface and plain text on white paper, or ones that use gimmicks like underlining and italics. <p> Joyce Lain Kennedy, author of Electronic Resume Revolution, suggests adding a "keywords" section--a long paragraph that simply lists every skill, degree, credential, job title, and previous employer you can legitimately claim. (Help-wanted ads are a good place to hunt for possible keywords.) The rest of the resume, she says, should follow a traditional format.   <p> When Marc Portner went looking for a new job in information systems, he included in the middle of his resume a keyword section that listed, among other things, <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple</b></a> Macintosh, <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM </b></a>PC, DEC Microvax, HP 3000, HP 9000 Unix series, client server, Cobol, Fortran, <a name="NASD:ORCL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14337"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oracle</b></a>, PeopleSoft, and 20 other software languages."I put in everything I've ever worked on, learned or touched," says Portner.  <p> A headhunter forwarded Portner's resume to Vanguard Group, the mutual fund company based in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. Tom Howard, a project manager with Vanguard, was searching the company's electronic resume database for a systems analyst with at least a bachelor's degree and experience with People Soft software, project management, and computer networking. Portner's resume hit every one of those words, and within 72 hours, he had been invited in for an interview and hired.  <p> Companies that use resume software say that job hunters benefit too, because it's easier to store resumes electronically than in paper files, and it's easier to search the database when jobs open up in the future. Also, the computer gives equal attention to all applicants.  <p> Says Disneyland's Neynaber: "Before, our recruiters had two and a half hours' worth of resumes to read every night. There's no way the person on the bottom got the same attention as the one on the top." Companies that invest in resume software use it for almost every job, from office assistants up to senior management.   <p><p>

						February 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> BIG PLAYS FOR SMALLER INVESTORS <p>Institutional clients have long gotten the best deals on Wall Street. Now the little guy has a crack at them too.  <p> By Gretchen Morgenson  <p> Among all the arcane practices of Wall Street, the one that has caused the most consternation for individual investors may also be the one that has been the most entrenched: the bigger the account, the better the treatment. For retail investors, separate and unequal is the way that the financial world has always worked.  <p> Who gets first grab at hot initial public offerings? Big, institutional clients, who often leave nothing for small fry. If a broker offers an individual a crack at an IPO, you can bet it's because no one else is buying.   <p> Who can participate in those lucrative leveraged buyouts? Only the big bruisers. Ditto for sophisticated equity-hedging strategies,such as short-selling, and access to privately held real estate turnarounds.  <p> Although a couple of mutual funds have begun dabbling in short-selling and some real estate investment trusts claim to be turnaround experts, pure plays in these areas are very tough to find for folks with less than $1 million to invest.  <p> These investments fall into one of two categories: outright private placements and deals that are typically offered only to institutional clients. Spotting the good ones requires a combination of serious spadework, a deep understanding of the industry involved, and extreme patience--not to mention access. Unlike mainstream Wall Street analysts who are basically spoon-fed information by the companies they follow, the top-drawer professionals who survey the investment scene for undiscovered gems are independent thinkers who reject the conventional wisdom. They pride themselves on research that is proprietary.  <p> But before investors can even think about venturing into this exclusive arena, they usually have to get a foot in the door of a firm's private client group. Doing that at Goldman, Sachs requires $5 million in securities held in the account. At <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>, high rollers typically have $5 million of investable assets in their accounts. Once they're inside, however, a world of investment alternatives opens up, including equity arbitrage, real estate deals, privatizations, leveraged buyouts, even derivatives. <p> Over the years, smaller investors have grown so used to being left with the financial equivalent of table scraps that most have accepted it as the way business is done. Yet some of the barriers are finally breaking down. A few firms and investment professionals are blazing the way. As these firms prove to the rest of the Street that more sophisticated deals can be done for retail folk, and done well, others may follow.  <p> For those early to the game, the timing couldn't be better. After getting hammered in equities and bonds last year, investors are searching for profitable alternatives. Financial assets have had such a run for so many years--stocks have returned a compound average of 14.4 percent for the past ten years while Treasurys have averaged 9.8 percent--that now may be a very good time to consider diversifying into newly available private investments. <p> "With the stock market perceived by many as overvalued now, private deals are a way to get higher returns," says Jeffrey Lynford, chairman of the Wellsford Residential Property Trust, a real estate investment trust listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Lynford has spent years in the private-investment arena. Early on, he was backed by former Treasury secretary William Simonand investor Ray Chambers, two men credited with starting the LBO movement in the 1970s with their company Wesray Capital. <p> But diversifying from plain-vanilla financial assets is tricky. For one thing, investors must find a professional or firm that specializes in the obscure and risky environs of LBOs, equities just out of bankruptcy, private companies, or distressed real estate. Stock pickers--whether at your local brokerage, favorite mutual fund, or neighborhood bank--are a dime a dozen. Tougher to locate are professionals who know how to do the research necessary to navigate the choppy waters of short-selling, distressed bank debt and mortgages, and other off-the-run issues. These are investments whose merits--and shortcomings--are not always evident to the untrained eye.  <p> Firms now at the forefront of the private-investment arena are providing clients with genuine opportunities identified by hardnosed research analysts, not the tax-avoidance tricks that characterized private deals in the past. Happily, too, the minimum account size required of investors has been reduced in some cases, widening the field. Today, at Dabney/Resnick Inc., a Beverly Hillsbased leader in giving individuals access to private deals, the minimum account size needed for decent diversification is $250,000. At Trilling Partners, a division of Paine Webber in Los Angeles that offers sophisticated equity-hedging strategies to individuals,the account minimum is $100,000. Hedge funds that specialize in shorting usually require $250,000 to begin.  <p> Because LBOs, real estate deals, and other private placements remain largely the purview of institutional clients or extremely wealthy individuals, information about them remains scarce. Billionaire investors like Revlon owner Ronald Perelman and Hollywood's Merv Adelson employ scores of staffers to hunt down assets worth acquiring and companies to buy, but smaller investors have no one to perform this due diligence.   <p> Yet it is just this niche--providing proprietary and what was once purely institutional research to retail customers--that a few firms are now trying to fill. Both founders of Dabney/Resnick--chairman and chief executive Judy Resnick and president Neil Dabney--are escapees from Drexel Burnham Lambert's high-yield institutional sales department. Of her experience there, Resnick says, "We saw extremely wealthy clients being offered all the good stuff and making very good returns and thought, Why couldn't individuals get this too?" So they left Drexel and set up their own shop. That was in July 1989; seven months later Drexel collapsed. <p> Another bit of good timing by Dabney/Resnick came in late 1990, when the junk bond market went into free fall. The firm was among the first to call the turn in high-yield securities, its specialty. The next few years saw junk bonds surge in value. Between May '91 and September '94, Dabney/Resnick Asset Management returned 70 percent for its clients. That translates to a 20 percent compounded annual return. The numbers are audited by accounting firm BDO Seidman.  <p> Trilling Partners, a boutique within the Paine Webber brokerage, is another group that brings institutional research to individuals. Headed by veteran broker Stan Trilling, the firm's five professionals scour the equity markets for small-capitalization stocks to buy and sell short, creating hedged portfolios that historically outperform long-only or short-only accounts in both good and bad markets. A broker since 1969, Trilling established his boutique in 1988 and has $85 million under management. Of that, $35 million is dedicated to small-cap longs and shorts. "I began offering my proprietary short ideas to institutions only in 1987," he says. "Now I have a 50-50 split between institutions and retail. "Between November '92 and February '94, one of the most woeful periods for short-sellers, Trilling's portfolio of ten picks and pans was up 169 percent.  <p> What are these firms recommending to clients now?   <p> LBOs. Since 1991, Dabney/Resnick has done ten LBOs of smallish companies. After the firm has toured company facilities, put management through the wringer, and pored over the financials, it uses client money to buy an equity stake in the outfit, typically investing between $1 million and $5 million. The firm takes a seat on the board and goes over budgets with management each week.   <p> Glenn Boschetto, head of Dabney/Resnick's LBO group, says: "We look for high current yields of between 11 percent and 13 percent and a kicker on the end when we sell the company. Total returns should be around 30 percent a year."   <p> Example: The buyout of Technicarbon, a manufacturer of carbon paper, in 1992. Dabney/Resnick invested some $3 million in retail investors' funds in the company, then sold it in 1994. Investors earned total returns of 29 percent a year.  <p> Surprisingly, the firm has little competition in the small end of the LBO market. Boschetto explains: "Most LBO funds have $200 million in assets and are looking to invest no less than 10 percent in each deal because they can't be spread too thin. These institutions won't look at an equity investment of less than $5 million, which works well for us." Investments are made with four- to five-year holding periods in mind. No short-term money is allowed.  <p> Clients' costs in a typical Dabney/Resnick LBO are roughly 1.5 percent of the value of the deal. The firm also invests some of its own money alongside investors'. This gives it exactly the same goals as its investors; the higher the returns, the better the payout.  <p> DISTRESSED REAL ESTATE. A newer area of opportunity for investors: office buildings in foreclosure or held by owners who want out. Dabney/Resnick's clients have bought four buildings in Florida and eight in Los Angeles, and the firm is looking to buy another three buildings in L.A. early this year. One of the deals, involving three office buildings in California, was conducted in December1993 for $46 million, with close to 90 percent financing by the sellers. Two of the structures were in foreclosure, and the other was held by a partnership eager to exit. Dabney/Resnick bought the buildings along with a new management team and almost immediately began increasing occupancies. One building, only 80 percent rented when the deal was done, now has more than 90 percent occupancy. In one year, the cash flow on it jumped from $2.8 million to $3.2 million.  <p> Jason Reese, who runs the firm's real estate group, says: "We're already in negotiations to sell for about $11 million a building we bought in the deal for roughly $8 million. Our annual rates of return should be 25 percent."  <p> The fees levied on investors in real estate come out this way: Dabney/ Resnick gets 7 percent of the money it raises from investors, but this money ends up being such a small percentage of the total deal size, almost all of its investors' funds go to work for them. Before any profit goes to the operating sponsor, the firm's investors must receive a full return on their capital and a 10 to 15 percent annual yield on top of that. When annual rates exceed 15 percent, the management partner that runs the buildings begins to participate in profits, on a sliding scale. If investors get, say, a 20 percent annualized return, the operating sponsor gets 20 percent of any profits on top of that. "That way," says Reese, "we align investors' interests with the operating sponsors'."  <p> DISCOUNTED BONDS. Because interest rates have gone up, a lot of high-yield bonds that were trading at 100 now trade at 70 or 80 cents on the dollar. Not all of them deserve such treatment, says Neil Dabney. Example: Trump Castle, whose bonds are trading around 50. With a coupon of 11.75 percent, the bonds' yield to maturity in 2003 is 26 percent.  <p> Dabney recommends them to his firm's clients because their prices declined precipitously on bad news. "The news on Atlantic City has been known for a year--that increased competition from Philadelphia gambling may hurt business," he says. "All of a sudden, the herd woke up, panicked about gaming in Pennsylvania, and got out."Why do the bonds look good? Pennsylvania gaming is no sure thing; it may come to ballot and be voted down, as happened last November in Florida. Even if gaming comes to Pennsylvania, Dabney believesthe Trump Castle bonds will recover from current levels if only because investor selling has been so overdone. Meanwhile, an almost 12 percent coupon, translating to a 23 percent current yield, is hard to beat.  <p> BACK-END EQUITIES. Citicasters, a TV-and radio-station company that has come out of bankruptcy, is another Dabney/ Resnick idea. The firm recommended Citicasters to clients last June when nobody on Wall Street followed the company; its stock--known as a back-end equity--was then trading around $18 a share. Now, First Boston is publishing favorable reports on Citicasters and the stock is around $22.  <p> Back-end equities, so-called because they come out of the end of a bankruptcy proceeding, can be good propositions because they're usually unfollowed by Wall Street and unloved by investors. Citicasters used to be known as Great American Communications, a company acquired by financier Carl Lindner in 1986. Enormous debt forced the company into bankruptcy negotiations in 1992. While there, it sold assets, turned a lot of its debt into equity, and reduced its borrowings from $640 million to $120 million. Most radio-station companies trade at 10 to 11 times broadcast cash flow; Citicasters trades at 7.5 times. For this reason, and because advertising at radio stations is up some 14 percent this year, the shares could trade between $30 and $34 per share in 18 months.  <p> SHORT-SELLING AS AN EQUITY HEDGE. The folks at Trilling Partners are well acquainted with the perils of short-selling; that's why they've spent the past ten years honing a system that limits the downsides in shorting while allowing for plenty of profits. "You can't let your ego get in the way about being right on a short," says Trilling. "You've got to have hard-and-fast rulesto limit your losses." Such as? If a stock goes against Trilling by 20 percent, he'll eliminate his position or buy equal amounts of the stock to "box" his trade. "Years when my performance was hurt were when I didn't protect myself from overzealous bulls," he says.  <p> Trilling's short and long picks are his own, not Paine Webber's. On the short side, he looks for stocks brought public by underwriters with a history of launching troubled deals; he also hunts for what he calls incongruities. These may include companies in an industry underwritten by firms with no expertise in a particular area or turnover in management just before an offering. "A company called Education Alternatives had a chief financial officer in its preliminary prospectus but no CFO in its final offering statement," Trilling says. "That looked suspicious." For this and other reasons,Trilling's clients began shorting Education Alternatives; the stock hit $48 in 1992 and is now $18.  <p> Trilling won't short a stock unless he can identify a trigger event that will force it to decline by 50 percent within 18 months. This makes him an "investing short" rather than a "trading short" and has helped protect his clients from the whipsaws experienced by other short-sellers in what has been a mighty dicey market. <p> Just over a decade ago, big firms were much more involved in offering private deals to investors than they are today. Oppenheimer & Co. and <a name="NYSE:BSC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10191"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bear Stearns</b></a> were two of the key players in the field, raising money among investors in private placements. But as with many investments in the early '80s, these deals were driven by the need to reduce investors' taxes, not by especially promising returns. As a result, all manner of questionable real estate, equipment leasing, and oil and gas investments were created. Most ended up causing clients and firms big losses.  <p> This time around, things are different. The investment opportunities are genuine, not tax tricks. Best of all, smaller investors are no longer excluded.  <p><p>

						November 1994
Worth magazine/Advisor<p>GET A YEAR-END FINANCIAL CHECKUP
Keep your wallet healthy, wealthy , and wise<p>By Bruce Upbin<p>As another year draws to a close, it's easy to let money matters get lost in the shuffle of holiday excitement. Now is a better time than later to straighten up your financial house. We asked the experts for their best year-end tips. Follow these and save:<p>-> REVIEW HEALTH BENEFITS. Most companies circulate forms that let employees adjust benefit plans by a Thanksgiving deadline. Pay attention. It may be the last time workers can take advantage of one of today's most cherished benefits -- employer-provided flexible spending accounts for health care costs. Many large corporations let employees set aside as much as $3,000 in pretax salary to pay for non-reimbursable medical expenses. By using pretax dollars for physicals and even the cost of traveling to the doctor, workers can cut non-reimbursed medical expenses by 40 percent or more. These plans are particularly advantageous if you are expecting your medical bills and insurance copayments to increase in 1995, but keep in mind they do not cover payments for elective cosmetic surgery. Although health reform, which would have killed these plans, looks to be dead in the water, Congress is still angling to eliminate this $31 billion perk.<p>Individuals should sit down with their checkbook, add up how much they spent on medical costs this year, and sock that amount away in a flex plan for 1995. "If you want to switch from your employer's indemnity plan to its health maintenance organization or preferred-provider plan, you'll probably want to lower your flex-account balance because you won't be paying as much for office visits," says Martha Priddy Patterson, chief employee-benefits analyst at KPMG Peat Marwick in Washington, D.C. Also, be sure to spend whatever is left in the 1994 flex account -- leftover balances cannot be rolled over into 1995 plans once the year is out. <p>Two-earner households should also consider having one spouse sign up for the other's health plan if each is now covered separately. Many companies who let employees drop company-provided health insurance will refund a portion of unused benefits back to employees. According to a 1994 survey of 489 companies by Hewitt Associates, a third of these employers refunded an average $618 annually back to those employees who waived their medical coverage; one in five reimbursed those who ditched their dental coverage an average $105 annually. Before exiting, however, workers should make sure employers will let them reenter, in the event of a layoff, divorce, or death. A company's benefits department can give more details about this option, but workers should be ready with proof that a spouse's plan will cover them.<p>The self-employed should tally up their health care costs and get set to write them off. Hill watchers agree that the 25 percent deduction for self-employed individuals' insurance costs, which expired at the end of 1993, will be reinstated for 1994 tax returns, thereby saving these taxpayers $2 billion. <p>-> BOOST RETIREMENT SAVINGS. As Senator Bill Bradley hollers that inadequate retirement savings is a "major security issue for Americans," Congress continues to take aim at retirement savings accounts, as it has for the last ten years. From limitations on IRA contributions to the new 20 percent withholding rule on certain plan distributions when taxpayers leave their place of employment, retirement accounts have gotten whacked. The latest blast: A little-known wrinkle in the Retirement Protection Act, a pending bill that is supposed to fix underfunded pension plans, may restrict 401(k) contributions.<p>If this bill passes, it would limit annual cost of living increases for 401(k) contributions. Frank McArdle, a partner at Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm in Washington, D.C., explains: "Under current rules, if inflation increases to 4 percent, 1995 maximum contributions to 401(k) plans would increase to $9,609 from $9,240. The proposed new law would cap them at $9,500, which means a $109 increase in taxable income compared to current maximums." Barring that threat, put away the maximum allowed in these plans, and consider after-tax contributions as well. Also, explore other retirement-savings accounts such as SEPs or Keoghs if you earn income from projects separate from your job.<p>-> REDUCE YOUR INSURANCE PREMIUMS. Don't wait until a policy is up for renewal to begin cutting insurance costs. Insurance agents often slash premiums for home improvements or reduced auto usage before a policy's anniversary. "Installing new wiring or a burglar or smoke alarm can slice 2 to 5 percent off your premium," says Loretta Worters, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute in New York. "More sophisticated alarm systems can get you a 15 to 20 percent discount." Car poolers and home-office workers should also negotiate cheaper automobile insurance by arguing that they have a shorter than typical commute.<p>-> UPDATE FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS TO ACCOUNT FOR FAMILY CHANGES. Marriages, divorces, deaths, and births all should be properly reflected in financial paperwork. "Double-check trusts, wills, life insurance policies, and pension forms to ensure that all intended beneficiaries are listed," says Jeff Saccacio, a partner with Coopers & Lybrand in Los Angeles. And indicate children by their full name to avoid mix-ups from remarriages and adoptions. <p>-> STOP PAYING HIGH FEES FOR BANK SERVICES. Sky-high bank fees continue to silently suck up depositor money. Since 1990, the percentage increase in regular checking-account fees has risen three times the rate of inflation, according to a 1993 study done by U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a consumer-watchdog organization in Washington, D.C. "Recent bank mergers spell even higher costs for consumers because larger banks charge more for their greater variety of services," says Edmund Mierzwinski, a U.S. PIRG spokesman. Many bankers are eager to lower or eliminate fees for customers who consolidate several accounts at their bank. Also, consider using a mutual fund that gives check-writing privileges for monthly checks amounting to $250 or more, but watch out -- these checks can carry a $2-per-check fee and create a tax bill since they represent shares sold. <p>-> CONSIDER A FAT HOLIDAY GIFT TO KIDS. Now is when many parents consider shifting wealth to their more lightly taxed offspring. The IRS lets taxpayers give $10,000 each to as many people as they wish, tax free. It's a smart way to keep estates under the $600,000 mark, after which assets are taxed from 37 percent to as high as 60 percent. Trustees who make annual gifts to existing irrevocable life insurance or education trusts must mail beneficiaries a notice stating that a contribution was made on their behalf and specify the amount, or they won't qualify for the exclusion.<p>-> RETHINK INVESTMENTS. High-income taxpayers should take advantage of the spread between their top tax rates and the 28 percent capital-gains tax by investing in top-shelf growth stocks or growth funds. New York financial planner Norman Dawidowicz also suggests that investors ask fund managers or their bankers to pay out interest on liquid accounts, such as money markets, every six months instead of quarterly. While the interest income won't be immediately available, making this move by November 1 means the payout would be scheduled for April 1995, effectively shifting tax owed to next year.<p>-> CONSOLIDATE YOUR DEBT. Borrowers who pay 15 percent interest in dealer financing for a $25,000 car, or 18 percent or more on a $10,000 credit card balance, should consider cutting that cost by consolidating this debt into a 8.5 percent home-equity loan or credit line. Cardholders who roll over balances, as 65 percent do, will save $950 transferring a $10,000 card balance at 18 percent to a home-equity loan at 8.5 percent (not including loan fees). Also, up to $100,000 in home-equity interest is still tax-deductible. <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Experts<p>BUY AND HOLD: THE REST OF THE STORY
You can do better than just holding tight in a bear market -- and it doesn't make you a market timer. Just a smart investor.<p>By James B. Stack<p>We all make a lot of our decisions by creating a pair of alternatives and choosing between them. In a political debate, one side might say, "The United States either supports Boris Yeltsin or lets the communists resume power." A friend having a career crisis might say, "Either I go back to college or I'm trapped in this dead-end job forever." Many an argument about investing comes down to this kind of choice, too: Either pursue a buy-and-hold strategy, staying fully invested in the market through all its ups and downs, or try to time the market, moving out near predicted tops and back in near bottoms.<p>Unfortunately, it's easier to make bad decisions than good ones this way. Too often the alternatives are described inaccurately -- for example, does college really guarantee a flourishing career? And almost inevitably, other viable choices are ignored.<p>The argument between buy-and-hold and market-timing strategies usually goes astray in just such a way. First, most studies supporting one strategy or the other are fantasies that have little to do with the way either works for real investors. Second, thinking in terms of these two choices blinds investors to a third way, one that I practice in my portfolio.<p>In a black-and-white, two-choices-only world, I'd be classified as a market timer. And in at least one way that's accurate: I do think buy-and-hold strategies contain major flaws. But I don't manage my portfolio in the hope of predicting market tops and bottoms, so I guess I'm not a market timer either. The Hulbert Financial Digest calculates that my published mutual fund portfolio has outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 Index by 44 percent from 1986 through the end of 1993. My results, I believe, come not because I've invented some market-timing system that lets me call tops and bottoms but because my system lets me control risk by increasing the cash portion of my portfolio when I think the market has become too dicey.<p>The best way to demonstrate why the either/or choice between buy and hold and market timing is so misleading is to look at some of the studies that argue this side or that. Let's examine one that's been reported in many sources, including Worth (see "Stock Plays: Overcoming the Bear Market Blues," July/August 1994; to find it, download the file "July/Aug94 Advisor" in Worth Online's software library). According to this study, $5,000 invested in the S&P 500 Index at the stock market's peak each year for the past 20 years would be worth $465,397 at the end of 1993. A market peak is the worst time to buy, yet look at the results. Buy and hold, the study says, works.<p>But what exactly does this study prove? Almost nothing, it turns out. First, the study really says very little about the superiority of either market timing or buy and hold. Instead, it's an endorsement of dollar-cost averaging, a proven investment technique that virtually everyone on either side of the market-timing debate endorses. In dollar-cost averaging, an investor sets aside the same amount of money every month or every year and ignores market gyrations. In the case of a new investor building a portfolio, it can be an excellent strategy -- if that investor has many years to wait before needing his or her money.<p>Second, the study doesn't accurately describe the two alternatives. The period of the study -- the past 20 years -- is itself a source of distortion. It's common knowledge that the past decade hasn't been representative of the long-term profits available from the stock market. Returns have been much better than average, while bear markets have been infrequent and mild. Compared with the previous 40 years, stock market profits over the past two decades have been 49.4 percent above the historical norm. Bear markets (defined as a decline of 20 percent or more in the S&P 500 Index) have been just half as frequent and only two thirds as severe. <p>The timing of those bears is just as important as their frequency. Suppose the study had begun in 1955 and run for 20 years, so that the period ended rather than began with the steep 1973-74 bear-market decline. The outcome would be shockingly different. In this case, the investor's total profit would be only 36 percent. Imagine saving and investing regularly for 20 years and ending up with less than you could have earned from a savings account yielding 3 percent.<p>Buy and hold does make sense for the new investor. But the closer an investor is to retirement or to needing his or her investment capital, the more dangerous a buy-and-hold strategy becomes. The numbers are very clear.<p>Take a hypothetical investor who sets aside $5,000 a year. At an annual growth rate of 11.3 percent (the average return of the S&P 500 Index over the past 60 years with dividends reinvested), the investor's portfolio would be worth $369,826 in 20 years. Even if that investor had encountered a severe bear market like that in 1973-74 in the first year of his investment plan, the 44.6 percent loss from that bear would have had little effect on his ending portfolio.<p>But what if a 1973-style bear market struck in the last year of his investment plan? It could wipe out half his portfolio. Imagine how that could dramatically change retirement plans.<p>A student of bear markets can point to other flaws in buy-and-hold studies. For example, most buy-and-hold arguments and historical studies use blue-chip averages like the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average in calculating bear-market risks and losses. Both are large-company indexes that ride through market downturns very differently from small-company indexes, like the Nasdaq or Value Line indexes.<p>Of course, it's one thing to point out the problems in these pro-buy-and-hold studies and another to prove that market timing is a superior, or even valid, strategy -- especially when most studies in favor of market timing are seriously flawed in their own way. To prove that market timing works, these studies often assume an ability to get in and out of the market at bottoms and tops. Market timing of this sort is virtually impossible.<p>But consider a third alternative. Most healthy bull markets share certain characteristics. These include declining or stable interest rates, broad participation and strong leadership among stocks, and an identifiable uptrend in market indexes. The more characteristics like these you can identify, the more aggressive an investment strategy you should employ. The fewer you see, the more cautious a course you should steer.<p>Merely knowing that the Federal Reserve had started to raise interest rates, or that the bellwether Dow Jones Utility Average was hitting a new 12-month low in January, both while the Industrial Average was frolicking at new all-time highs, should have been strong confirmation that the first half of 1994 would not be good to investors.<p>When indicators like these start pointing to danger, I move to reduce the risk of bear-market losses by shifting some of my portfolio out of the markets. Most investors who use portfolio allocation only shift their assets between stocks and bonds, staying totally invested at all times. But that doesn't reduce risk when, as was the case in the first half of 1994, bonds fall at the same time as stocks. And as we saw in the inflationary decade of the 1970s, bonds can tumble even further than stocks.<p>There is a better option, one that treats cash (90-day T-bills or a money market fund) as a viable investment alternative at specific times. <p>Let's look at how this kind of investment strategy would have worked over the past 40 years. Choosing such a long period avoids one problem I criticized in the buy-and-hold studies. To avoid overestimating an investor's ability to know when to make a move, we'll pick a very simple rule as a guide. We'll use a moving average to gauge the market's long-term trend. For example, let's use a 150-day moving average of the S&P 500. We can calculate that average by taking the closing prices of the S&P 500 Index on each of the last 150 days and averaging them. Then, we use this indicator to read the market. If today's close of the S&P 500 Index is greater than that average price, then we can conclude that the market is in an uptrend. If instead today's S&P Index is less than the moving average, the market is in a downtrend.<p>Now suppose we buy a mutual fund approximating the S&P 500 Index when the index is trading above the 150-day moving average. Suppose also that whenever the S&P Index falls below the moving average, we shift our portfolio into the safety of T-bills or a money market fund. <p>Over the past 40 years, such a strategy could have more than doubled an investor's total return from the stock market. For example, a single $10,000 investment made 40 years ago and never moved -- the consummate buy-and-hold strategy -- would have grown to $676,035 by June 30, 1994. If instead an investor used the moving average to determine when to step into cash, he would have a portfolio worth $1,341,448. That's about twice the profit. <p>The results come from risk management, not from picking tops and bottoms. Someone using a buy-and-hold approach over the past 40 years would have lost more than 20 percent on seven different occasions, with two losses exceeding 35 percent.<p>Meanwhile, the individual using the 150-day moving average to determine when to sit quietly on the sidelines in cash wouldn't have avoided all down markets. But the worst-case loss would have been a 15 percent loss. This strategy would have avoided every one of those 20 percent and 35 percent losses.<p>In 40 years this indicator never caught the exact top or bottom of the market. It merely introduced sensible risk management to this portfolio.<p>At my company, InvesTech, I use a combination of indicators that have a much broader scope than the simple 150-day moving average. Today, they indicate that the stock market is on a more tenuous footing than at any time in the past four years. For example, sentiment indicators, such as last January's record cash inflows to mutual funds, are convincing evidence that the bullish bandwagon is overcrowded. In addition, most market indexes have spent much of the year below their long-term moving averages. And our indicators of monetary conditions turned negative in the first quarter of this year, saying to me that for the first time since 1990, Federal Reserve policy is no longer investor friendly. Bottom line: This is a high-risk market in which capital preservation should be emphasized. That's why two thirds of my portfolio has been in cash since January.<p>There are alternatives to a blind buy-and-hold strategy. The wise investor knows that the best strategies don't just seek the highest possible return -- but the highest return with the lowest risk.

Worth magazine/Cover<p>WHAT DISCOUNT?
That's what investors ask when a supposedly cut-rate broker hits them up for a hidden fee or executes a trade at a ridiculously high cost. The way to avoid these traps is to be a discriminating consumer. Here's how.<p>By Manjeet Kripalani<p>It's been roughly ten years since discount brokerages began making serious inroads on Wall Street, stealing business away from established, high-profile firms like <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> and Smith Barney. The opportunity to trade stocks at cut-rate commissions drew investors first in a trickle, then a flood. Today, more than 13 million individuals -- roughly a third of all investors in the U.S. -- execute stock trades through discounters. According to the Securities Industry Association, discount brokers snared 14 percent of retail investors' commission dollars last year. That's up from 8.6 percent five years earlier.<p>The rise of discounters, however, hasn't necessarily made life easier for investors. Faced with higher costs, many cut-rate firms now charge for services that investors once got free. These fees, plus high execution and clearing costs, add up -- sometimes even negating the advantage of low commissions. At the same time, full-service brokers have responded to the competition by cutting their own prices. Some now offer their better customers commissions as low as those advertised by discount shops.<p>Amid all this is a confusing array of come-ons, multiple-fee structures, hidden charges, and bait-and-switch price gouging. Industry advertising even acknowledges the trend. "No hidden costs. Now there's a radical idea," trumpets an ad for Brown & Co., an affiliate of <a name="NASD:CHFC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12961"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chemical Bank</b></a>. Ads paid for by StockCross, a Boston-based discount broker, ask, "What do you call an investor who uses a deep-discount broker to save money on trades, only to lose more on poor execution?" Answer: "A philanthropist."<p>Investors looking for a good deal -- or just trying to avoid being taken for a ride -- must be more discriminating than ever when shopping for a broker. It is important not only to know how the costs of trading add up at different firms but also to understand how these expenses can vary depending on specific needs. An investor who wants to dump ten shares of stock he got as a birthday gift may find his interests better served at one firm, while an active trader may discover a better deal somewhere else.<p>Commissions -- what a firm charges to execute a trade -- are still the most important thing to look at. According to a study conducted by New York investment firm Mercer, Inc., a trade of 200 shares of a $30 stock -- described as a typical trade -- will likely cost $151 at a full-service broker, $95 at a discounter, and $35 at a so-called deep-discount firm.<p>Next on the list are fees. Many discount brokers levy a host of supplemental charges for administrative services -- such as delivery of stock certificates, redemption of bonds when they come due, and mailing copies of past account statements or Value Line research reports. These services vary greatly among firms; full-service firms generally charge nothing for them. A few discounters and deep discounters also provide them gratis. Others bill for everything but walking in the front door.<p>The third critical area of investor costs is the trickiest to quantify. Unlike the out-of-pocket fees that show up on a statement, these costs become evident only when it comes time to tote up profits or losses on a trade. They are the sometimes-onerous costs associated with executions of stock trades on the over-the-counter or Nasdaq market.<p>Although performance in this area can also vary widely from one brokerage to the next, full-service firms generally outperform the discount or deep-discount houses. This isn't a major concern when it comes to trading shares on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange. Both of these markets have specialists who match sellers with buyers and try to get the best price on a stock for investors. But the over-the-counter markets have no specialists to match trades. That makes the spread between the bid and asked prices fair game. Some brokers pocket the difference; others pass the savings on to their customers. It's not unheard of, either, for some brokers to pad their profits by moving trades of New York Stock Exchange- or American Exchange-listed shares to the Nasdaq market. This little trick lets them nick their customers on the spread rather than allowing them the chance of getting a price between the bid and asked.<p>In many ways, recent events in the brokerage business resemble what happened in the mutual fund business not so long ago. Early in the 1980s, there were two varieties of funds -- no-load and front-end load. Then various hidden charges crept into the equation -- so-called 12b-1 fees that went to pay a fund's marketing costs, back-end loads, even declining back-end loads. What was simple became complex and more costly.<p>Even an investor's haggling skills can now make a difference in the choice of broker. That's because many of the full-service shops today will negotiate their commissions. How big a price break will they give? It may take some perseverance -- maybe even a threat or two -- but most will eventually come through with price breaks of between 25 and 50 percent for a good client. On 200 shares of a $30 stock, a 25 percent discount reduces a full-service commission from $151 to around $114. That's only $20 more than the commission on a similar trade levied by discounters like <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab</b></a> or Fidelity Brokerage, the two largest discount firms. <p>Another comparison: Fidelity's minimum commission on a trade of up to 100 shares or $2,500 is $30 plus 1.7 percent of principal. That adds up to around $72 on 100 shares of a $25 stock. Ditto for Charles Schwab. A full-service broker charges a nondiscounted commission of $85 for the same-size transaction, $63 if marked down 25 percent.<p>What about life with the so-called deep discounters? Terrific, assuming you trade often and in large size or you have a sizable credit balance in your account. To get the lowest rates offered by Fidelity's Spartan, an investor must have at least $20,000 to invest initially must make at least 40 trades a year. Such a player would pay flat-rate commissions of $25 to $30 per trade regardless of transaction size. At Kennedy, Cabot in Beverly Hills, customers must trade in lots of 5,000 shares to pay a 2-cent-per-share commission, versus the 5 cents per share on 100-share orders (with a minimum commission of $30).<p>But deep discounters aren't altruists. They make up for their generosity by charging substantially higher service fees, up to $25 to wire funds, $25 for bounced checks, and $5.95 for a copy of an S&P company report.<p>An investor who can cajole a full-service broker into providing a discount of 25 percent or more deserves a pat on the back. It's a good deal, because most full-service firms don't charge for administrative services such as dispensing company research reports and past statements or providing safekeeping for certificates. And working with a trustworthy broker can also save an investor from making an expensive investment mistake, such as buying on a hot tip or selling a stock too soon.<p>Choosing a discounter, on the other hand, can be like ordering dinner at a sushi bar -- everything has a separate price tag. Within the industry, the practice of soaking customers on a wide array of fees even has a nickname: "harvesting."<p>Harvesting an investor's money can include charges for past statements, the delivery of stock certificates, the execution of legal documents like stock powers or powers of attorney, and the transfer of an account to an heir. Customers can even be billed for inactivity in their accounts.<p>An investor who wants to transfer ownership of a stock certificate to someone else -- an heir, for example -- pays nothing at full-service broker Prudential Securities. But deep discounters like Fidelity's Spartan Brokerage or Sherwood's National Discount charge $35 and $25 respectively per security. At Oppenheimer, charges for a bond redemption are zero; at discounters, the fees can be as much as $50. Customers who like to read up on company or mutual fund reports published by S&P, Value Line, or Morningstar also must pay for the privilege. Charges vary from $3 to $5.95 apiece.<p>Discounter Olde charges $2 for extra monthly statements; Schwab charges $2.50 for back copies. Schwab proudly says it can retrieve stock quotes going all the way back to the original Woodstock at $3 per. Both these services are free at most full-service or discount brokers. Although almost all brokers charge customers some sort of fee for wiring funds from the firm to the client's bank, full-service brokers bill exactly what the bank charges, usually $15. Discounters charge up to $30 for each transfer. <p>Commissions and fees alone, however, do not tell the whole story. Unless an investor trades only blue-chip stocks listed on the NYSE, it's also critical to know something about how brokers execute trades.<p>How much of a difference can execution make? According to Perrin Long, a veteran brokerage-industry analyst at First of Michigan, the typical individual investor trades eight times a year in an active market. Let's look again at that typical trade of 200 shares of a $30 over-the-counter stock: Bid at 30, offer at 30.50, which means if you're a buyer, you'd pay $30.50, and if you're selling, you'd get $30 for your shares. <p>On the basis of these estimates, a broker who could routinely execute OTC trades at the middle of the bid/asked spread -- $30.25 a share -- would save about $400 for a typical customer over the course of a year. That $400 in savings would very nearly offset the difference in commissions charged by a nondiscounting full-service broker (about $1,208 annually in this example) and a discount broker (about $760 annually). Throw in two research reports and a couple of stock tender offers, and your discount broker has become more costly than the full-service firm. <p>Last year, Charles M.C. Lee, assistant professor of accounting at the University of Michigan's School of Business Administration, published a study in the Journal of Finance quantifying the excess costs borne by investors when their trades are executed on Nasdaq rather than on the New York Stock Exchange. Using a sample size of 332,121 matched buy executions in 1989, Lee found that in total dollars, the additional costs for investors executing off-Big Board trades was between $36 million and $47 million.<p>Most times, a good full-service broker will do a better job working stock trades for customers, getting prices that fall between bid and asked. With a discounter, investors almost always pay the asked or higher side of the market when they buy and get the bid or lower side of the market when they sell. <p>Some discounters assure their customers that they will, in fact, shop between the bid and the asked prices in an OTC stock on both limit and market orders. But, says Charles Schwab & Co. spokesman Hugo Quackenbush, "we do not generally shop around." He claims that during the time it takes to shop, the market might move against you. Barry Boyte, vice president for marketing at deep discounter Jack White & Co., says, "For a small order, say 100 or 200 shares, there's not much we can do. For a large order of 8,000 to 9,000 shares, we'd try to work the trade."<p>Discounters who refuse to work a trade probably do so because they own their own market-making firm and like the high margins associated with earning the spread on a trade. Discounters who don't own their own trading firms, or who don't trade in a specific stock, cannot work the bid/asked spread. Instead, they must give customer orders to larger firms for execution. They get paid for these orders -- roughly 2 cents a share -- by firms that execute them, a practice known as payment for order flow.<p>Proponents of this system claim investors aren't hurt by it. But opponents say payment for order flow encourages brokers to direct orders to markets where they will be most lucrative -- in other words, where spreads are wider. As Lee points out, "In light of these price differences, the broker's primary responsibility could potentially be compromised by order flow inducements."<p>Few investors realize that their equity orders have any value to market makers. That's because the amount of money a firm earns on its customers' orders is never revealed on statements or trade confirmations. It may not seem like much, but being paid to trade a stock is a way for brokerage firms to make money on investors' transactions. Although it isn't a cost that investors pay directly, it is certainly not returned in the form of a rebate.<p>Last October the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a rule change regarding payment for order flow; it proposed that firms disclose to customers whether any payment for order flow has been made, the amount, and the brokerages involved. The proposal is currently being reviewed by the SEC's Market Regulation Division.<p>How can investors avoid paying a high price for a low commission? A good way to start is by asking other investors about their experiences with local brokers. Whom do they trust and why? Who has given them a good deal on trades?<p>When talking to a broker, there's nothing wrong with listening to the pitch about the firm's ultra-super-rock-bottom commissions. But afterward, ask for a complete accounting of the firm's fees. Question the account representative who answers the phone about payments for stock safekeeping, research reports, fees for wiring funds, and other charges.<p>Next, it's important for investors to consider how their own needs match what the broker has to offer. How often are they likely to use the different services? What will their year-end bill look like? If it seems too high, investors should try negotiating prices down before moving on to another prospect.<p>It's also a good idea to find out whether a broker is a market maker on a particular stock. If you are trading an OTC stock through a broker who is also a market maker, there's a very good chance the broker is earning money on both the spread and the order flow. Use this knowledge to try to negotiate a lower commission on such trades. On a listed security always specify that your trade be executed on the New York or the American Stock Exchange.<p>One indication of good faith is for a firm to include its Central Registration Depository number along with the 800 number for the National Securities Dealers' Investor Services Department in its literature. This allows investors to check whether a firm or its employees have ever had any disciplinary action taken against them.<p>Selecting a broker isn't the end of the battle. When making trades, it's important for investors to specify the type of order they want to make, limit, or market. Someone who wants in or out of a stock at any price should be prepared to lose the spread.<p>For large orders, it also helps to instruct the broker to execute it in one lot and not in batches of two or three. When the broker splits the trade, as it's called, it can mean paying commissions twice and three times over. <p>There may not be a lot of outfits out there that will work an investor's trades and provide good discounts. But they do exist. One example of such a firm is the midsize Dallas Research & Trading, founded in 1990, with offices in Dallas and Tampa. The firm negotiates on commissions, charges minimal servicing fees, provides detailed research, and never trades in issues for its house account that conflict with its customers' accounts. DRT also welcomes customers to its trading floor in Dallas to watch its brokers working orders on Selectnet, an automated order system that gives a price between the bid and asked.<p>Knowledgeable investors can get similar treatment not far from home if they spend enough time shopping around.

Worth magazine/Cover Story<p>A SKEPTICAL GUIDE TO FINANCIAL ADVISORS
We left no spreadsheet unturned when we set out to produce a list of America'sbest financial advisors. We even checked their personal credit records.<p>By Robert Clark <p>Ask yourself this: are you totally satisfied with the state of your finances? If you answered yes, congratulations, and see you later. You don't need to read this story. <p>But you probably answered no, or maybe you just sort of sighed. If you're a typical working American, preoccupied with a family, a career, or both, the complexity of personal finance today threatens to overwhelm you. It's almost impossible to master every single money issue that can crop up.<p>Taxes. Insurance. Mortgages. Credit cards. Mutual funds. Stocks. Company benefits. Retirement plans. Estates. Wills. Trusts. The list of concerns is long, and nothing about it is becoming simpler. In 1993, the American Association of Retired Persons commissioned a detailed study of financial planning in the U.S. The report, written by Barbara Roper of the Consumer Federation of America, concluded that consumers "are now faced with a highly complex financial landscape, creating a greater need for expert assistance."<p>What sort of expert assistance? Certainly there are plenty of people out there who would be delighted to help: bankers, stockbrokers, accountants, etc. But not all of them have the experience, training, and scruples to deserve your trade. This is a field full of credentials and initials, and literally anyone can solicit business as a financial advisor (see "SIDEBAR: What's in a Name? What Isn't" further down in this file). If you distrust more would-be advisors than you trust, you'll rarely be disappointed.<p>Yet people do need help, and that's why we conducted a search for the best financial advisors in the country. We compiled a list of 60 professionals who overcame our skepticism and met our criteria (see "LIST: America's 60 Best Financial Advisors" further down in this file). The table is organized by state to help readers find an advisor near their homes. We've also provided phone numbers and a rundown of the advisors' credentials.<p>You'll note that the list is heavy on generalists. Our advice is to use salesmen in specific areas only when you need to conduct business that requires their help. Use a stockbroker, in other words, to buy stocks and bonds, not to plan your investment portfolio. Use an insurance agent to buy insurance, not to arrange your estate to minimize taxes after your death.<p>A good generalist will have areas of particular expertise. But he or she can look at all parts of your financial situation to determine what needs attention. Should you be paying off your mortgage faster? Do you need to diversify your holdings? Is your insurance coverage adequate? Will you have enough savings to fund your retirement?<p>Most of the advisors on our list typically call themselves financial planners, and many have acquired the title certified financial planner. Consider this at least encouraging, for it does reflect a certain degree of training as well as some commitment to a code of ethics.<p>But don't think of any credential as a guarantee. Not all financial planners, including some CFPs, are the independent thinkers that they pretend to be. Most receive commissions for the insurance, mutual funds, and other products they sell. Remember the tax shelters, limited partnerships, and high-yielding insurance products that went bust during the 1980s? All were sold by financial planners who got paid for doing so. We recommend that you seek out fee-only planners or at the least use great care when choosing a planner who accepts commissions as a salesperson.<p>We believe that the planners on our list are both enlightened and ethical and that they worry about what's right for their customers. We believe that there are plenty more where these came from, too. Yet it never hurts to remember that for almost all financial advisors, there are powerful financial incentives pushing in exactly the wrong direction. Buyers must beware.<p><p>Who Are These People?
---------------
We produced our list of 60 top advisors by first soliciting 300 nominations from 30 highly regarded financial specialists across the country. We then quizzed our nominees about their fees, potential conflicts of interest, education, professional experience, and specialties. We asked for their form ADV, which the Securities and Exchange Commission keeps on file for advisors who make securities recommendations. And we asked to see an actual financial plan prepared for a real client (with the client's name removed, of course).<p>After reviewing all this material carefully, we insisted on a crucial test: a review of each candidate's personal credit report as compiled by TRW. The best financial advisors, we felt, should practice what they preach, and to the best of our knowledge, all 60 advisors who made our list do just that. (Unlike the one prominent advisor was carrying more than $80,000 in credit card debt, with balances spread across 32 different cards. That kept this person off our list.)<p>We also looked carefully at our advisors' educational backgrounds and industry credentials. Not all the advisors we selected turned out to be certified financial planners. But most of them did. To qualify as a CFP, a financial advisor must pass an exam administered by the CFP Board of Standards, a nonprofit organization based in Denver and composed of representatives of all areas of the financial-services industry, including the College for Financial Planning.<p>Finally, we looked at each advisor's policy toward fees, with a particular emphasis on how they handle potential conflicts of interest. One of the things we wanted to learn more about was how advisors manage their personal financial interests when they conflict with those of their clients. We found a variety of approaches. Most of the advisors on our list work for fees only, rather than charge commissions. That's the cleanest and simplest approach. Many fee-only advisors readily concede, however, that cutting out commissions doesn't fully eliminate the potential for conflict. For instance, an advisor who charges clients a 1 percent annual management fee makes less when he or she tells a client to use money to buy insurance or build an addition on the family home. The best advisors who accept commissions assert that full disclosure is the key. And it is.<p>Advisors who work for commission had a tough time making our list, but five succeeded. The most impressive approach to conflicts from an advisor charging commissions was that of Madeline I. Noveck, a financial planner in New York City. Noveck told us that she sets a fixed fee for her advice. Then, if she recommends products that pay her a commission, she reduces her fee accordingly.<p><p>The Heart of the Matter
---------------
The crucial part of the evaluations, of course, were the financial plans the advisors submitted. Some of these were surprisingly shoddy; some were quite impressive. All the good plans had a summary page up front that listed the client's particular circumstances and goals, followed by specific recommendations. No boilerplate, no caveats, no legalese. Just an outline of present circumstances, future plans, and strategies. One plan we especially liked contained a timetable that listed the specific duties of both the planner and the client.<p>We had less regard for planners who appear to rely excessively on canned, computer-generated financial plans that were short on specific advice tailored to the client. Reams of spreadsheet analysis of retirement scenarios and college-funding projections left us unimpressed. All good financial advisors do them, but they're pretty incomprehensible to clients. The best plans, when they included such projections at all, used them as supplements to the more crucial and more easily understood main presentations.<p>In many cases we were pleased to see small signs that the advisor was really paying attention and taking the task as seriously as a client deserves. Several planners, for example, analyzed homeowner and auto insurance policies and recommended money-saving switches.<p>Overall there was more good planning than bad, but there was certainly some bad. We dumped several candidates because we thought they made unrealistic assumptions about future investment returns. One plan, for example, drew up a portfolio that was essentially conservative, yet assumed annual returns of 12 percent. The more impressive plans based projections on after-tax, inflation-adjusted rates of return. These sorts of calculations appeared most grounded in reality.<p>We didn't know whether to chuckle or weep over one plan. It included a meticulously projected retirement portfolio that ran out of money before the client even reached age 80. Another plan left the insurance proceeds in an estate, where it would be taxed -- a glaring error in most situations. We even saw a plan that showed a current negative cash flow but failed to even note the problem.<p><p>Cost and Value
---------------
A good advisor begins work with you as a new client by taking a complete financial inventory. The advisor will cover the basics: income and expenses, assets, and liabilities. Then he or she will look at things like insurance policies, pension plans, and tax returns. If you own your own business, you'll need to talk about that. The advisor will also inspect mortgages, auto leases, credit card debt, lines of credit, wills, and trusts. Your investment portfolio should also receive careful attention.<p>Next the advisor will ask you to envision your future. Do you want to buy a bigger house? Send your kids to college? When do you want to retire, and on how much? Together, you and your advisor will draw up a set of goals. Finally, your advisor will give you a list of recommendations on how to reach those targets. <p>How much is all this service going to cost you? It depends, of course, on the complexity of your situation. It also depends on whether the advisor charges by the hour or establishes a set fee for a particular task and whether he or she charges commissions. Commissions, as we've said, open the door for possible conflicts of interest, so although there are more commission-oriented advisors than fee-only advisors, we advise you to stay with the latter group.<p>Fees vary by location and according to the experience and skills of the advisor, but hourly charges generally run between $100 and $250. Fixed rates for financial plans can range between $500 and $10,000. Fees to manage assets should fall between 0.5 percent and 1 percent annually.<p><p>On Your Own
---------------
Eventually, you may need to conduct your own search for a financial advisor. Once again, some skepticism is called for.<p>Keep in mind that the industry is unregulated. Anyone can call himself a financial planner, hang out a shingle, and charge people for advice without having credentials, training, or oversight of any kind. Only if such a person doles out securities advice must he file form ADV with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Even then the requirements for registration are minimal: A registered investment advisor has to pay a fee of $50 and meet certain disclosure and record-keeping requirements, and will have to sit through a visit from an SEC examiner every ten years or so.<p>If you can't find an advisor on our list that's right for you, the financial-planning trade associations will offer recommendations. Contact the International Association for Financial Planning at 800-945-4237, the Institute of Certified Financial Planners at 800-322-4237, and the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors at 800-366-2732. You're going to have to evaluate these people yourself, however. These services can't do much more than provide a local listing of members. (For a list of questions to ask a prospective advisor, see "SIDEBAR: Do-It-Yourself Skepticism" further down in this file.) <p>Experience should be one of your primary considerations. Most of the advisors on our list have been around at least ten years; don't accept much less. An advisor's lengthy tenure in a community can be another good indication of stability and competence. People with community ties are less likely to treat their neighbors unscrupulously than are fly-by-night operators. <p>Look for good references, but don't get them from the advisor's clients. A good reputation among local nonplanning professionals -- lawyers, CPAs, and others -- is more difficult to earn and more valuable.<p>In short, your evaluation of a prospective advisor should be as rigorous as our tests were. And you might add one more important question: Is this someone you can learn from?<p>For when all is said and done, it isn't smart for anyone to transfer ultimate responsibility for his or her financial affairs to someone else. There's a crucial difference between getting a professional's help and completely handing over the reins.<p>Stay involved with your own finances -- at least enough to have a basic understanding. Know the rudiments of investing, taxes, insurance, and banking. The advisors we've endorsed understand the importance of this and are committed to educating their clients as they advise them. That's what makes the relationship work for both parties -- but especially for the client, whose financial future, after all, is on the line.

What's in a Name? What Isn't?
---------------
Tips on understanding terms
and credentials.
---------------<p>How do you qualify as a financial advisor? You start selling advice, simple as that. That's why it's important to understand what an advisor's experience and credentials qualify him or her for. Here are the people most likely to be hanging out the ADVISOR shingle and what they are best at.<p>CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (CPAs) are educated in either taxes or auditing. Accountants who do financial planning usually either hold the personal financial specialist (PFS) designation or are certified financial planners (CFPs). Accountants generally charge only fees. Sometimes they won't recommend specific investments or insurance policies. <p>STOCKBROKERS are trainedin securities laws and selling techniques. They are not required to register as investment advisors because they are salespeople working for brokerage firms. They earn commissions from selling products. Brokers are most valuable, of course, to investors who need help choosing stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.<p>INSURANCE AGENTS analyze how much insurance clients need and what type, and are trained in the principles of underwriting. Sometimes they hold licenses to sell securities as well. A chartered financial consultant designation (ChFC) is the insurance industry's financial-planning degree. These days, however, many agents who have become serious financial planners prefer to get the CFP. <p>ASSET MANAGERS or PORTFOLIO MANAGERS direct money into stocks and bonds or more esoteric investments. They usually charge a percentage of the assets they manage, typically between 0.5 percent and 2 percent. They are usually not concerned with other aspects of their clients' financial lives, such as insurance or taxes.<p>FINANCIAL PLANNERS are the all-arounders of the advising community, and the best typically are CFPs. CFPs are trained in insurance, taxes, retirement, estates, and investment planning. Most planners charge fees for financial planning and commissions for the products they recommend. But a growing number of the best advisors charge only fees for planning and sometimes a percentage of the assets they manage. For people who need comprehensive advice about their finances, fee-only financial planners are a good place to start.<p>-- by Robert Clark<p><p>------------------------------------------------------------<p>SIDEBAR:
Do-It-Yourself Skepticism
---------------
Questions to ask a
prospective advisor.
---------------<p>Before you start answering questions from a financial advisor, you should ask some yourself. Try these questions on at least two or three candidates and compare the answers.<p>HOW ARE YOU COMPENSATED?
Fee-only compensation is the simplest and best option. Advisors who work for commission will sometimes agree to advise you on a fee-only basis. If an advisor works only for commission, insist that he disclose up front how much he'll make on each product recommended.<p>WHAT'S YOUR HISTORY AS A FINANCIAL ADVISOR?
Look for someone who has worked with people in circumstances similar to your own for ten years or more.<p>WHAT IN YOUR EDUCATION QUALIFIES YOU
TO GIVE FINANCIAL ADVICE?
The designation certified financial planner indicates a broad education in issues of personal finance. Sometimes a specialist, such as a lawyer or an accountant, is more appropriate for a particular problem, and a good CFP will acknowledge that with a referral.<p>HOW MANY CLIENTS DO YOU HAVE?
HOW MANY NEW CLIENTS DO YOU ADD EVERY YEAR?
The best advisors have fewer than 100 clients and don't need to add more than 5 or 10 per year. Heavy turnover of clients is a bad sign.<p>CAN YOU GIVE ME THE NUMBERS OF TWO OTHER
FINANCIAL PLANNERS I COULD ASK ABOUT YOUR REPUTATION?
The local financial-planning community is usually rather small and knowledgeable about its own members.<p>WILL YOU SHOW ME YOUR CREDIT REPORT?
Make sure advisors practice what they preach; it's best to avoid those under their own financial stress.<p>CAN YOU GIVE ME THE NAMES OF ATTORNEYS
OR ACCOUNTANTS WHO REFER CLIENTS TO YOU?
Other professionals are particularly choosy about whom they recommend to their clients.<p>ARE YOU INVOLVED IN PROFESSIONAL
FINANCIAL-PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS?
At either the national or local level, professional involvement indicates a commitment to continuing education and up-to-date advice.<p>HOW LONG HAVE YOU PRACTICED IN THIS AREA?
Ties to the community are an indication of performance and commitment.<p>ARE YOU OR YOUR FIRM AFFILIATED WITH
ANY OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS?
Watch out for planners that represent themselves as fee-only but maintain a relationship with other commission-earning ventures. <p>--by Robert Clark<p><p>

						Who dares, wins -- and lowers overall portfolio risk at the same time. These eight aggressive plays could return 40 percent a year.<p>The retreat in stock and bond markets that marked the first half of the year has prompted many investors to rethink their portfolios. Should I ditch my risky investments and batten down the hatches? Or should I stay put and ride it out?<p>On Wall Street, at least, the conventional wisdom appears to favor caution: The easy gains are gone, so this is no time to be aggressive. Stick to rock-solid stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, and avoid the chancy stuff. At some point, the market will turn around. It always does. <p>Two things trouble us about this advice. First, as we pointed out in our last issue (see "New Strategies for Tough Markets," the cover story from Worth's July/August issue; you'll find it in the "July/Aug94 Cover Story" file in Worth Online's software library), there's a good chance that it may be some time before the markets regain their former vitality. With inflationary clouds still blowing in from the horizon, pressure continues to mount on the Federal Reserve Board to further hike interest rates. Meanwhile, foreign investors are showing less and less interest in dollar-denominated investments, reducing the overall demand for U.S. stocks and bonds. <p>Second, Wall Street's timid advice ignores one of the great paradoxes of investing -- that conservative strategies meant to reduce risk often end up doing just the opposite.<p>More than 30 years of research on building portfolios that increase return and lower risk won Harry Markowitz and William Sharpe the Nobel prize for economics in 1990. Among other things, their work demonstrated how cautious investors, in an effort to get out of risky stocks and bonds, can end up leaving entire slices of the investment pie out of their portfolios. The result, they found, typically increased -- rather than limited -- an investor's exposure to risk.<p>We all know, for instance, that the stocks of big dividend-paying companies, such as utilities, are individually less risky than other types of investments. Yet a portfolio composed only of utility stocks can be very risky indeed. Just since the beginning of this year, in fact, the Dow Jones utility index has lost about 20 percent of its value; a portfolio composed only of "safe" utility stocks would have been hit quite hard.<p>At the same time, a portfolio that had invested in the rise of the yen against the dollar by buying options in early January could have earned a 500 percent return by mid-July. Adding this riskier investment to a portfolio of utility stocks would have produced a much safer combination than utility stocks alone.<p>If the markets remain stagnant in the months ahead, the only way for investors to earn solid returns will be to increase their portfolio's exposure to risky asset classes. This doesn't mean leaping at the latest fad, or taking wild chances with big chunks of the family nest egg. But it does mean rethinking the role of risk in a portfolio.<p>With this in mind, Worth set out to identify a number of alternative investments that might serve this purpose. At the beginning of our search, we assumed investors would want to keep at least 90 percent of their portfolios in common stocks and bonds issued by established companies or governments. The remaining 10 percent, though, could be reserved for higher-risk investments whose potential performance wouldn't correlate closely with the rest of the portfolio. This allocation scheme helped establish our parameters for risk and return. <p>First, since this part of the portfolio is supposed to help reduce overall risk, we ruled out all instruments that come with an unlimited downside -- such as commodities plays that can end up losing more than the size of an investor's original investment. If things went truly sour, we wanted to lose no more than the 10 percent of the portfolio set aside for high-risk investing.<p>Second, we looked for investments that require $50,000 or less to play. Ideally, we hoped investors would be able to add more than one high-risk, high-reward candidate to a portfolio, a move that would provide even better diversification. For the same reason, we also wanted to avoid investment schemes that eat up huge amounts in commissions.<p>Third, we wanted to see potential for a big payoff. No sense taking a big risk for an extra one or two percentage points in performance. So we turned to the professional venture capitalists' definition of an investment home run as our benchmark: Each investment had to have the potential to return ten times the original capital in seven years. That's an effective annual return of 40 percent -- enough to make a big difference in the overall performance of any investor's total portfolio. <p>Fourth, we combed the landscape for investments in asset classes that aren't found in most portfolios. Adding more stocks, bonds, and mutual funds wouldn't do much to improve the diversification of most of our readers' portfolios. So we went looking for investments in currencies, real estate partnerships, venture capital, options, and other instruments that don't march in lockstep with garden-variety bonds and equities.<p>Last, we looked for pricing opportunities. Many of the individual asset classes mentioned above made strong moves this year. When the move was downward, we checked to see if lower prices had eliminated some of the risk while giving us more upside. As a well-known French contrarian adage of the 19th century says, "Achetez aux canons, vendez aux clarions." (Buy on the cannons, sell on the trumpets.)<p>We ended up with eight choices, and our menu is nothing if not eclectic. We found ways to earn this kind of potential annual return by buying busted real estate partnerships or shorting the recently all-powerful Japanese yen. In the battered field of emerging markets, we discovered a way to leverage Mexican bonds that could return 50 percent, as well as a way to bet on the recovery of the Hong Kong equity market. In Arakis Energy we found a company whose fortunes are closely tied to international politics and not the stock market as a whole. We even turned up two private deals that give an investor a way to share in the kinds of returns earned by professional venture capitalists. Finally, we found a way to transform bread-and-butter U.S. Treasury bonds into high-powered plays on the course of interest rates that could produce fivefold returns on invested capital -- in just a few months.<p>These eight plays aren't the only high-risk, high-reward deals that the inquiring investor will be able to find. And this list isn't meant to be the end of an investor's search for that one big payday. Instead, we hope that investors will use it as a guide in thinking about risk and reward -- in all probability the least understood part of investing -- and attempt to go beyond these eight examples. Even if you never put a single dollar into one of these deals but instead just use this article to think about the role of risk in your portfolio, you will already have earned a high return on your investment. <p>-- by Scott McMurray<p><p>PLAY 1:
LEVERAGING MEXICAN BONDS
---------------
TYPE OF PLAY: International bonds
PRICE: $20,000 buys $100,000 worth
POTENTIAL UPSIDE: 50 percent return in nine months, if the peso holds its ground
POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE: A currency devaluation eats up all the interest payments
CRUCIAL DUE DILIGENCE: Check the fallout from the August 21 presidential elections. A weak government could break the budget -- and the peso -- to buy domestic peace.<p>Anyone who likes volatile markets will love Mexico. This year, rebels revolted in Chiapas, the leading contender for the national presidency was shot, and the historically invincible Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) handled the investigation of the assassination so badly that it looked like the party could actually lose the presidency. Among the results: Mexico's peso plunged 9 percent, and the country's bond market got hammered as yields on government bonds soared to more than 16 percent.<p>So now, if Mexico remains true to form, it may be time for the pendulum to swing the other way.<p>Mexican Treasury securities, or CETES, are the most liquid of Mexican investments. CETES are auctioned weekly by Mexico's central bank in maturities of a few weeks to two years. Interest rates on three-month CETES hit 19 percent earlier this year, dropped to 9 percent, and then settled at around 16 percent.<p>To increase returns even more, investors can buy CETES bonds on credit by making something that's known as a forward purchase. This allows a 20 percent down payment, with the remainder of the price due at maturity.<p>Although not all brokers and dealers will arrange forward purchases, investors with established banking relationships in the U.S. should have little trouble. Other investors must hunt for a stockbroker who is willing to help.<p>Under ideal circumstances, a forward purchase of CETES would go something like this: An investor plunks down $20,000 to purchase a three-month, $100,000 note. The investor then rolls the note over three times while interest rates remain fairly stable (admittedly a bold assumption). In the process, the investor collects $16,000 of interest, paid in pesos. Borrowing costs, at 7.5 percent, run to $6,000, reducing the purchaser's net to $10,000, or a return of 50 percent in nine months. <p>Is there a catch? Of course. As events in the first half of 1994 proved, in Mexico everything can go wrong.<p>At the moment, the PRI faces a fight in the August presidential elections but should overcome internal bickering, troubled policies, and challenges from the right and the left to win. Despite the PRI's problems, there is no mandate for a change in economic policies. Economists argue that as long as the government holds its course, Mexico could earn an investment-grade rating on its debt in 1995.<p>A bigger risk may lie in the value of the peso. Mexico pegs the exchange rate of the peso to the dollar, which has worked effectively for several years to stabilize the Mexican currency. But as a result of this year's political uncertainty and the first effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the country is running a large trade deficit in goods and services. That deficit will put pressure on the new president to devalue the peso, some say by as much as 10 percent. <p>That's by no means a certainty, however, and economists are divided on when and whether the peso will tumble. A steady currency has been one of the underpinnings of Mexico's economic performance of the past six years. The central bank appears determined to support the peso. But currency traders could dump pesos and overwhelm any governmental efforts at stabilization.<p>The bullish case for Mexico assumes the government will hold its own against currency speculators. After 12 years of heroic effort, Mexico won't lightly abandon the economic policies put in place by Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his predecessors. Economists who believe that, including Ken Ackbaalii of First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles, argue that the Mexican economy will revive and the peso won't be devalued suddenly. "The prospects for Mexico look fairly good," Ackbaalii says. "We think the cross-rate between the dollar and the peso should remain fairly stable." <p>An investor putting money into the country now also has at least one major advantage over investors who did so in 1993: The market has already discounted a lot of bad news. "A year ago Mexico was a country that could do nothing wrong," says Nancie Dupier, a vice president at the Chase Manhattan Private Bank. "The markets are much more sensitive now" to bad news and, therefore, much more reasonably priced.<p>Even if the bulls are wrong, the downside in a bet on CETES is less than on many high-risk investments. If the peso is devalued 10 percent, the interest earned on the CETES over the course of a year will more than offset the peso's fall. Barring a radical political event in Mexico, the downside is a little bit better than breakeven. If the bulls are right, the upside could be spectacular. <p>-- by Gary Hector<p><p>PLAY 2:
UNDERWRITING NEW PRODUCTS
---------------
TYPE OF PLAY: Venture capital
PRICE: $30,000 for half a unit
POTENTIAL UPSIDE: Dividends of $25,000 to $43,750 year after year
POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE: No sales, no profits -- no exit
CRUCIAL DUE DILIGENCE: Run the numbers. What's the return if this is just a niche product?<p>When the stock market hits the skids and prices of public companies fall, many investors start scanning the quotes looking for cheap deals on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. Truth is, it's an even better time to look for bargains among privately held companies.<p>Privately held companies, of course, don't trade on the public stock markets. Experienced venture-capital investors, however, know that the price of private companies is normally pegged to public valuations. When the comparables go down, so does the price of private shares. <p>Right now, Reynard CVC Inc. of Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, may present just such a bargain, especially considering that its founders have already rejected offers from two professional venture-capital firms who wanted to take too big a hunk of the pie. <p>Reynard is fairly far along for a venture-capital deal. It's not a company made up of two guys, an idea, and a garage. Its 36-year-old founder and president, Arthur Herr, invented and patented a superior package for compact discs. Both The New York Times and PC Magazine have provided big endorsements by calling Herr's Laserfile a dramatic improvement over the jewel box. The jewel box is the pesky plastic case invented by Philips that currently houses most CDs. It is particularly difficult for children, older people, and certain financial writers to negotiate. What's more, its flimsy hinges have a propensity for breaking when the box is dropped.<p>That's where the Laserfile comes in. It does away with breakable hinges, relying instead on a sliding drawer. When halfway out, the drawer can be bent downward, allowing a user to grasp the disc by the center hole and easily remove it.<p>Worldwide, the jewel-box market is enormous (2 billion units per year and growing fast). "That should rise to about 5 billion by the year 2000, with much of the increase coming from CD-ROMs," says Herr. If Reynard snatches just 5 percent of the market, Herr and his partner, Henry D. Sedgwick, project that the company would generate pretax profits of 20 percent to 35 percent on annual sales of $25 million.<p>To date, Reynard has sold 250,000 Laserfiles to an emphatically eclectic group of customers. They include late-night infomercial habitue Tony Robbins, the Acoustic Sounds music label, Macmillan Publishing (for medical CD-ROMs), and the United States Marine Corps (for CD-ROMs describing, appropriately enough, the use of CD-ROM technology during the gulf war).<p>Want a piece of the action? Reynard is trying to raise $500,000 to $1 million from private investors who, the company hopes, will want less than the venture firms demanded. Much of the proceeds would go toward marketing as well as toward producing molding equipment to be used by subcontractors who would make the Laserfiles.<p>For $30,000, investors can get the equivalent of about a 0.5 percent stake in the company, meaning that Herr and Sedgwick currently value Reynard at $6 million or so. That ownership stake will translate into a proportionate share in the company's distributable income. (Reynard will retain some earnings for working capital and other needs.) If the company ever gets to $25 million in sales and 20 percent to 35 percent in pretax profits, dividends (0.5 percent of annual profits) would come to about $25,000 to $43,750 a year on each $30,000 unit. Year after year.<p>Still, Reynard may never reach its targets. As the founders of many a bankrupt company can testify, producing a better product doesn't necessarily produce sales. Skeptics and competitors doubt that the company's product offers enough benefit to get customers to switch from the current jewel-box design. Unfortunately, it costs the same 10 cents to 11 cents to produce one Laserfile that it does to make a standard jewel box. Since the existing packaging doesn't seem to be driving compact-disc purchasers away, why should the industry switch?<p>"It's going to be hard to supersede the jewel box," says a spokesperson for Ivy Hill Corp., a printing and packaging subsidiary of Time Warner. Even with Time Warner's clout, Ivy Hill's own alternative CD package -- called the Fliptop -- has sold only 5 million units since its debut 18 months ago. "That's spectacular," says the spokesperson.<p>Reynard CVC (201-567-8998) is looking for 10 to 20 investors. Individual investors interested in finding other private companies can try one of the many venture-capital networks, such as the Technology Capital Network (617-253-7163) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which holds regular venture-capital evenings that match investors and companies. <p>-- by Andrew Feinberg<p><p>PLAY 3:
DRILLING FOR OIL IN SUDAN
---------------
TYPE OF PLAY: Penny stocks
PRICE: $569 per 100 shares
POTENTIAL UPSIDE: A $5.69 stock could become a $75 stock in five years.
POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE: All the oil stays in the ground.
CRUCIAL DUE DILIGENCE: The civil war isn't over; will the rebels play ball?<p>Is Arakis Energy just another "story" stock -- you know, the kind the market has been hammering lately? Or is it a real blockbuster in the making?<p>Earlier this year, Arakis, a tiny oil-development company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, acquired a license to develop oil in a south-central patch of Sudan. This area is generally thought to contain at least 300 million barrels of proven oil reserves. Star stock picker Lawrence Auriana, comanager of the $1.2 billion Kaufmann Fund, believes the 12.2 million-acre area could ultimately prove to hold 600 million barrels of oil. Independent international oil consultant Daniel Johnston, who first looked at the potential of this project in 1983, agrees. "If there are 600 million barrels there," adds Auriana, whose small-company growth fund owns 250,000 shares in Arakis, "this could be a $75 stock in five years." <p>Auriana's numbers seem plausible, especially in light of the Triton Energy story. The development of a single spectacular oil field in the nation of Colombia -- the largest find in the Western hemisphere in over a decade -- propelled the Triton stock from $4.62 a share in 1990 to $52.50 a share in 1991. That field was bigger, at 2 billion barrels of proven reserves, but Triton owned only a 24 percent stake and the Colombian government was entitled to half of Triton's revenue. <p>Then why was Arakis (listed as AKSEF on the Nasdaq small-cap market) trading at a measly $5.69 a share on July 18? The answer has to do with transporting oil out of Sudan, torn by a bloody and intractable 11-year-old civil war. The war pits Muslims in northern Sudan against Christians in the south. Although the fundamentalist Islamic military government firmly controls the north, the south is devastated by war; more than 1.3 million of Sudan's people have died as a result of the fighting and the accompanying starvation. The 11 years of war have also created at least 1.8 million refugees, according to a U.S. Committee for Refugees report. The 1983 census, the last one done, put the population at 21 million.<p>This was why Chevron, which negotiated the original concession on the Arakis field in 1974, threw up its hands and walked away, despite spending more than $1 billion developing the huge finds. In November 1992, as the civil war dragged on, Chevron sold the license to an Islamic entrepreneur, who sold it to privately held State Petroleum. On January 25, 1994, State, headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, and owned by a group of Muslim businessmen, signed a share-exchange agreement with Arakis that made it a wholly owned Arakis subsidiary.<p>Until that time, Arakis was developing natural-gas reserves in southeastern Kentucky and had no international oil-exploration experience. Its revenues for the eight-month period ended December 31, 1993, were only $2,295,478. Investors in State received 6 million new shares of Arakis at $2.80 a share, about 32 percent of the company. <p>Arakis officials don't see the Sudanese war as much of a problem. In fact, they assert that it isn't even being fought. Lutfur Khan, the president of State Petroleum, who negotiated the company's oil-production-sharing agreement with the Sudanese government, flatly says, "There is no civil war right now." Khan says the government has entered into a peace agreement with rebel Christian forces.<p>Is this so? U.S. ambassador Donald Pettersen says in a telephone interview from Khartoum, "Of course the civil war is still going on." The multilateral peace negotiations involving Sudan's neighbors "have not produced anything yet," he says, adding that "in the absence of a negotiated settlement in which it is clear how resources will be allocated in the country, I don't believe rebel forces would be agreeable to exploitation of the oil." <p>Other experts on the situation in Sudan, however, see things differently. "The Heglig/Muglad area deep in Southern Kordofan, where the oil wells are located, is not affected directly by the war," says Peter Verney, editor of London-based Sudan Update. "A pipeline could be built without passing through any area of rebel conflict, but it would present a target for sabotage nonetheless." <p>Oil consultant Johnston notes that Triton Energy was able to develop its Colombian field despite guerrilla attacks that blew up one oil rig. A Colombian army garrison is stationed at the drill site, and last year guerrillas averaged one sabotage attempt per week on oil operations there. "Dealing with guerrillas, in a way, is just another cost of doing business," says Johnston. Arakis, meanwhile, says it is moving ahead full speed. It projects that it will be producing 65,000 barrels of oil a day by early 1996.<p>-- by Andrew Gluck<p><p>PLAY 4:
JOINING DISTRESSED PARTNERSHIPS
---------------
TYPE OF PLAY: Depressed real estate
PRICE: Less than $600 for two partnership interests
POTENTIAL UPSIDE: Up to 153 percent with current yield and very, very long-term appreciation
POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE: Long waits and the risk that you've picked the wrong property
CRUCIAL DUE DILIGENCE: Pick properties, not simply markets.<p>Although the best days of real estate investing had already come to a close by 1986, a visitor to the Chicago headquarters of JMB Realty Corp. wouldn't have guessed it. At the time, JMB was one of the country's largest and most successful sponsors of real estate partnerships. Pictures of skyscrapers that its early partnerships had helped finance lined the walls of its sumptuous offices.<p>Yet an investor who paid $1,000 for an interest in JMB's Carlyle Real Estate Limited Partnership XIV back then would today own a piece of paper worth just $10 to $115. Similarly, partnership interests in Carlyle XIII that originally sold for $1,000 traded for as low as $10 each last July.<p>Of course, not all 1980s-vintage real estate partnership interests would make a good swap for a rookie baseball card. But it's the cents-on-the-dollar partnerships that present real opportunities. At current prices, these partnerships come with built-in leverage that could give patient investors very attractive returns. <p>How attractive? According to Jon Hale, a broker at Securities Service Network in Sarasota, Florida, it's relatively easy to find partnerships in the secondary market that now pay annual yields of 9 percent to 11 percent. Ross Bowler, president of 2nd Market Capital Services, of Madison, Wisconsin, asserts that even higher returns, up to 20 percent, can be found among obscure partnerships where there are few market makers -- as opposed to the myriad deals put together by the likes of formerly aggressive partnership marketers like Merrill Lynch and Prudential Bache.<p>Want to really go for broke? Then consider so-called broken partnerships. These are deals that have gone so sour they aren't making any current payments to investors. Still, many own valuable assets -- assets that must sit in place, possibly appreciating, until the partnership is liquidated. <p>Unfortunately, waiting for liquidation to take place can turn an investor gray. These deals offer general partners huge disincentives to liquidate -- management fees that get paid each year even if the partnership isn't making any money -- and their official life may be as long as 50 years. Indeed, many partnerships offered in the 1980s won't liquidate until after the year 2030 -- making them the ultimate in buy-it-and-forget-it investments.<p>Still, the potential for a big payoff is there, says Ronald Baker, a principal at Invenex, an investment company that buys partnerships. Suppose that back in the 1980s, an investor bought ten units in partnerships for $1,000 each. Also suppose that those units were now available for $30 apiece. <p>Typically, the general partners and brokers would have taken up to 25 percent of the original investment at inception to cover selling, administration, and marketing expenses. They would have used the remaining $7,500, leveraged with borrowed money (typically two borrowed dollars for every dollar in capital), to purchase the equivalent of $22,500 in real estate.<p>Today, this real estate is probably still worth at least $15,000, the amount of the original debt. If it wasn't, the lenders would have foreclosed on the property. Thus, for $300 an investor can reclaim ten units and gain more than 95 percent leverage.<p>Now suppose that the property appreciates at 5 percent a year from here on out. At this rate, the total value of the asset controlled after year one will be $16,065. That's a 255 percent return on the original $300 investment. (A more conservative 3 percent appreciation produces a first-year return of 153 percent.) <p>Similarly, after four years, an investor would record a tenfold return. Over 40 years, the appreciation of the property would more than overwhelm the original debt. Note: It's very important to find limited-partnership units that don't carry huge passive tax liabilities. In worst-case scenarios, these can wipe out any gain. Have an accountant check out any deal.<p>Brokers at the few firms that deal in the secondary market for limited partnerships open their conversations with a chorus of bewares: No two partnerships are alike; their assets and income flows have to be studied carefully; some are tax-liability bombshells; good ones are hard to find. This is all generally true. Don't ignore the caveats.<p>A good way to research specific limited partnerships is with The Limited Partnership Locator, a directory of currently active public partnerships and investor contacts available for $200 through Partnership Consultants, Inc. (800-881-4188) or at a good business library.<p>-- by Ted C. Fishman<p><p>PLAY 5:
SHORTING THE YEN
---------------
TYPE OF PLAY: Currency
PRICE: $1,200 per option contract
POTENTIAL UPSIDE: An 11-fold gain within a few months, if economic fundamentals finally overcome politics and perception
POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE: Timing is everything. In three months $50,000 could disappear.
CRUCIAL DUE DILIGENCE: Follow Japanese politics. Government weakness keeps the yen strong.<p>Here's a chance to beat famed hedge-fund manager George Soros in the currency markets. All any investor needs is impeccable timing.<p>Early in 1994, believing that the Japanese government was about to lower interest rates, Soros bet that the yen would tumble. Instead, the yen strengthened and the dollar swooned. Soros, who had shorted the yen, took a $600 million loss that quarter at his offshore Quantum Fund. <p>Many experts still believe that Soros was right, just premature. The Japanese economy began showing signs of recovery in late spring, and the wilting dollar has put pressure on the Japanese government to lower rates. A strong argument can be made that, based on economic fundamentals alone, the dollar should not have fallen to a 50-year low against the yen this summer.<p>At least that would be the view of those who subscribe to the theory of purchasing-power parity, which compares the real purchasing power of individual currencies. For instance, Haruo Shimada, an economist at Keio University, calculates that at 100 yen to the dollar, the yen is 40 percent overvalued in comparison to the U.S. currency. <p>The Economist's "Big Mac" index -- a measure of what it costs to buy a Big Mac in various countries around the world -- also suggests the yen is overvalued by more than 60 percent. Although short-term factors like politics, trade deficits, and interest rates can heavily influence currency valuations, economic fundamentals usually assert themselves over the long run. This means that sooner or later, according to purchasing-power-parity theory, the dollar will rise and the yen will sink.<p>The big question is: When? <p>"I'm a dollar bull relative to the yen," says Eric Nickerson, an international economist at BankAmerica. "But we're probably not going to see the dollar strengthen against the yen until the fourth quarter." A major reason the yen is strong, Nickerson argues, is that the Japanese economy is weak. Japanese exporters can't get enough credit, so they are dumping dollars as soon as they get them. That's because they need yen to cover operating costs. As the economy strengthens and banks start making loans again, exporters will be able to borrow. They'll hold on to their dollars longer, and demand for dollars will rise, Nickerson says.<p>Based on this theory, Nickerson looks for the dollar to trade in a range of 105 to 130 yen for the next few years. With the dollar recently trading below 100 yen, that's a potential move of at least 5 percent to 30 percent -- enough to produce a high reward for investors.<p>Those who believe the dollar will strengthen against the yen can place their bets in the options market. (Most stockbrokers can execute this trade.) The place to start is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which offers options on yen-futures contracts. <p>A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a fixed quantity of yen, corn, pigs, or any other commodity at a specified price on a specific date. As the price of the underlying commodity fluctuates, the value of the futures contract, with its fixed price, changes as well. Obtaining an option to buy or sell the yen-futures contract is a step further removed. <p>A three-month option to sell (known as a put) 12.5 million yen -- worth about $120,000 -- costs about $1,200. If the yen drops below the price specified in the options contract (called the strike price), the investor who owns this put option will profit. <p>In this way, using just $50,000 in cash, an investor can control about $6 million worth of yen. A 10 percent drop in the yen would produce a gain of about $600,000, or a return on the initial $50,000 of around $550,000 -- 11 times the money at risk.<p>The flip side, of course, is that if the yen should rise by just 1 percent, the $50,000 investment evaporates entirely, since the right to sell at a price below the market is valueless. Yen options are an exotic investment. Even understanding the listings in the daily press takes some practice. The Mercantile's contracts are set not in yen per dollar, but in dollar per yen. A contract with a selling price of 105 yen per dollar translates to 0.95 cents per yen and would be listed as a 95 contract. <p>Options expose investors to the normal market, country, and currency risks. In addition, they add a time risk. Being right isn't enough. You must be right at the right time. The market recognizes that by making shorter options contracts (contracts that give an investor less time to be right) cheaper to buy. While a three-month yen option costs about $1,200, a nine-month option will cost from 20 percent to 300 percent more.    <p>-- by Gary Hector<p><p>PLAY 6:
DEVELOPING A VIDEO GAME
---------------
TYPE OF PLAY: High-tech 
PRICE: $35,000 to $50,000
POTENTIAL UPSIDE: $120,000 over three years, if your title hits 
POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE: A run-of-the-mill product returns $12,000 of a $50,000 stake.
CRUCIAL DUE DILIGENCE: Hang around software stores. What sells, and why?<p>Investors in the information highway took a bumpy ride over the last 12 months. Many publicly traded highfliers headed to the garage for an overhaul. Electronic-game maker Electronic Arts, for example, geared down from a 52-week high of $42 to a low of $12.75. 3DO, a company that may or may not revolutionize the quality of video games, flopped from $48.25 to reach as low as $9. <p>Nevertheless, the crash in high tech has created bargains in the private equities market for new media. The entry fee is a lot less than the $500,000 to $1 million minimum needed to play in most venture-capital deals.<p>Modeled on the Hollywood movie partnerships that did so well for early investors in the 1980s (and not so well for latecomers), these deals allow investors to buy a piece of an individual CD-ROM title in development for $35,000 to $50,000. The hope is that one of these titles will hit it as big as Rebel Assault, the best-selling CD-ROM title ever -- more than 500,000 units sold at retail, with about $25 to $30 a unit going back to the developer.<p>Although the Silicon Valley-Hollywood axis is currently awash in CD-ROM development deals, one company's plans will illustrate the opportunity for investors. Viridis, a Los Angeles- based company founded by Lee Barnes and Christopher Thompson in 1990, develops interactive products -- in effect acting as a digital studio for companies or individuals with ideas. For example, three Viridis projects for late 1994 release involve IVI Publishing of Minneapolis, the producer of the successful Mayo Clinic reference CD-ROMs. Sales of the most successful volume in that three-title series are estimated at 650,000. Other recent and current Viridis clients include Electronic Arts, 3DO, Philips Interactive Media, Nintendo, GTE, Trimark Pictures, Doubleday, and The Los Angeles Times.<p>Investors in Viridis deals get anywhere from 30 percent to 80 percent ownership, depending on the ultimate cost of producing a title (typically somewhere between $500,000 and $1 million). The stake translates into a comparable piece of the developer's gross from retail sales. Normally, a developer gets between 7 percent and 20 percent of the suggested retail price, so the investor could wind up with royalties of anywhere between 2.1 percent and 16 percent of retail. On a CD-ROM that sells 100,000 units at $30 each, the developer -- Viridis, in this case -- would get, say, 20 percent of $3 million, or $600,000, and an investor might get 20 percent of that, or $120,000. (A successful game can bring in other revenue too, maybe 10 cents a unit for a toy based on one of its characters.) Returns are spread over a number of years. A $120,000 return on a $50,000 investment, for example, would typically break down into $40,000 in the second year and $80,000 in the third.<p>"The investors would know upfront what the title is," Thompson says. "They would get a full treatment and understand the budget, the schedule, everything." <p>It's critical, then, to find a company that's capable of developing a hit game and to pick the specific product that will break out of the list of about 4,000 existing CD-ROM titles, most of which sell only 5,000 to 10,000 units. At that sales level, a $50,000 investment brings in royalties of $12,000. <p>"The key to investing in these companies is looking at the people behind them," explains Ted Hoffman, who runs the Seroti Group, a San Francisco-based investment-banking firm that specializes in financing interactive-multimedia companies. Hoffman also says that investors participating on a per-title basis should carefully check out quality, content, and the licensing deal. To determine quality, Hoffman recommends taking a look at the demo yourself, passing it around to friends who have an interest in the subject matter, and even conducting full-blown focus groups for feedback from proven CD-ROM consumers. <p>Also important to consider is whether or not a developer can attract quality partners with good ideas and names that have market clout. Viridis recently announced an alliance with ZM Pictures -- a Universal Studios-based production company doing interactive projects requiring film and video production. Its Sesame Street Numbers, a 3DO title, is slated for inclusion in the interactive-television test being conducted in Omaha, Nebraska, by U S West. <p>Viridis has signed up Geoff Workman of Sausalito Digital Partners (415-989-3552), a California-based fund that provides seed money for new media entrepreneurs, to coordinate this program for small investors.<p>-- by Curtis Lang<p><p>PLAY 7:
BETTING ON DEBT OPTIONS
---------------
TYPE OF PLAY: Interest rates
PRICE: $250 per option (approximately)
POTENTIAL UPSIDE: A fivefold return, if long rates move up half a percentage point
POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE: A move in the wrong direction, or no move at all, and the options are worth zero.
CRUCIAL DUE DILIGENCE: Perceptions count: Does the economy look like it's overheating?<p>Burned by rising interest rates and falling bond prices? Here's a way to get revenge.<p>Buy a put option on Treasury-bond futures. This way, you'll score a big gain if interest rates rise again. How big? Suppose that back in June, an investor believed interest rates on 30-year bonds were headed to 8 percent from 7.5. At the time, this investor could have purchased a put option on September Treasury-bond futures carrying an exercise price of 96. The cost of this option would have been about $250. Yet its value would have risen to $1,609 if rates had behaved as predicted. The downside risk, meanwhile, was merely the initial purchase price. Had rates held steady or moved the other way, the investor would have let the option lapse at its expiration date in the third week of August.<p>To rack up a big return in the options market, then, all that an investor has to know is which way interest rates will move and when. <p>Unfortunately, this information is not posted in advance for all of us to see. Markets that set interest rates are probably the most active and most efficient in the world -- meaning that at any given time the prices pretty accurately reflect the odds that rates will move up or down. Under such conditions, outguessing or gaining an edge is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for an individual investor. "The odds of winning on a trade like this are much less than 50-50," says James Florsheim, a senior vice-president of Chicago Corp., an investment bank and brokerage.<p>That's certainly true when these types of options are used solely as a speculative tool. But there's another reason why an investor may want to participate in this arena -- as a way of hedging a bond-laden portfolio. Using options to make a risk-heavy bet on a move in interest rates is an effective method for reducing interest-rate risk -- sort of like having insurance. (Remember: The value of a bond goes down as interest rates go up.) <p>The $1,359 profit described above would have offset the actual recent three-month total return of negative 3.89 percent on almost $35,000 in long bonds. A $500 put bet would have produced a $2,708 profit and a positive 3.89 percent return on the same portfolio. On the other hand, had rates moved the other way, the profits on the appreciation of the bonds would have cushioned or overwhelmed the losses on the options.<p>The chances of further interest-rate hikes loom large at the moment. The yield on Treasurys with a 30-year maturity hit 7.67 percent on July 14, and the consensus among economists is that the upward trend in rates will continue. The only real disagreements about this have to do with when the increases will happen and exactly how large they will be. When the Federal Reserve didn't boost rates at its July meeting, many economists immediately began predicting that the next rate hike would come at the Fed's August 17 meeting. Others said it wouldn't happen until September. A few expected two increases -- one in each month. Former Federal Reserve Board member Wayne Angell, now a Bear Stearns senior managing director, has commented that the current 4.25 percent Fed funds rate (the rate at which banks borrow overnight funds from each other) needs to be hiked to 5 percent. An increase of that magnitude would certainly push the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond above 8 percent.<p>The decisions of the Federal Reserve Board, however, aren't the only factors driving U.S. interest rates at the moment. The dollar was down almost 8.8 percent versus the yen and 7.7 percent against the German mark in the first six months of the year, more than wiping out any interest Japanese and German investors would earn from 30-year bonds. Figures from the U.S. Treasury Department show that foreign private investors bought just $1.8 billion more than they sold of Treasury notes and bonds in this year's first quarter. That compares with net foreign purchases of $12.9 billion in the same period last year. Only higher U.S. rates would entice these investors, a major source of financing for the U.S. national debt, to buy more.<p>Investors who agree with this view, especially those who are already heavily invested in bonds, should buy a put option. (For a description of put options, see "Shorting the Yen.") Right now, the option to consider for making a bet on a rise in long-term rates would be the October serial put option based on the December bond-futures contract. This option, which started trading on August 15, will expire in the third week of September, so investors buying this instrument are hoping that long rates rise before that time. Any stockbroker should be able to execute such a trade. <p>-- by Scott McMurray<p><p>PLAY 8:
BUYING HONG KONG WARRANTS
---------------
TYPE OF PLAY: Foreign stocks
PRICE: $447 for 100 warrants
POTENTIAL UPSIDE: A 20 percent rally would double investors' money in the next 12 months.
POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE: No rally, and the Hong Kong warrants expire, worthless, in a year or two.
CRUCIAL DUE DILIGENCE: Pay attention to what's happening in North Korea.<p>Up 116 percent in 1993. down 27 percent in the first six months of 1994. That's Hong Kong, where when China hiccups, the stock exchange develops appendicitis.<p>Buying or selling the Hong Kong stock market is basically a bet on the future of mainland China. Nearly all the companies included in the Hong Kong index, the Hang Seng, do a significant amount of business with mainland China, so their prospects are closely linked to the Chinese economy and Chinese politics. Part of this year's swoon, for example, resulted from frictions in U.S.-China trade caused by the battle over human rights and the extension of China's most-favored-nation status.<p>China's double-digit growth rate of the past few years helped propel Hong Kong stock prices higher in 1993. Earlier this year, however, investor concern about rising inflation sparked by that growth caused prices to fall. And with aging leader Deng Xiaoping expected to join Mao Zedong in the Communist hereafter before too much longer, it's impossible to predict how accommodating China will be toward Hong Kong's capitalists over the next few years. The British colony reverts to control by mainland China on July 1, 1997.<p>Still, the pullback earlier this year may have created a buying opportunity in a market likely to rally well into 1995. Firms such as PaineWebber and Bear Stearns predict that such a rally could take the market up 20 percent in the next 12 months. <p>If this is correct, however, why settle for 20 percent? Buying Hong Kong Stock Index warrants could turn a 20 percent move into a 120 percent gain.<p>A warrant is an artificial security, or derivative, created to let investors bet on a specific market move or to hedge another investment in the same market. The American Stock Exchange offers warrants that are based on an index of 30 Hong Kong stocks. They are listed on the exchange (under the name of the brokerage firm or other issuer) with a single quote price and can be bought and sold just like common stocks through any stockbroker.<p>For one and a half or two years (depending on their expiration date), warrants give the holder the right to buy or sell the cash value of the Amex Hong Kong Index at a specific price, called the strike price. Warrants that confer the right to buy, referred to as calls, usually increase in value if the index rises above the strike price. Warrants that confer the right to sell, called puts, work in an opposite direction -- they usually become more valuable as the index goes down.<p>The stock-exchange listing is almost the only thing the Hong Kong warrants have in common with common stocks. This derivative was constructed with leverage in mind, and no one should buy these warrants thinking that they are just another name for a basket of stocks. The five- or six-to-one financial leverage built into the warrants means that by buying certain call warrants, for instance, an investor could more than double his or her money based on roughly a 20 percent rise in the underlying Hong Kong Index. Of course, a similar move in the opposite direction and the investor holding call warrants is out of luck -- and money. Bad joss, as they say in Hong Kong.<p>Six different call warrants (each of the six is actually a series with various expiration dates) and four different put warrants trade on the American Stock Exchange. Investors willing to bet that the Hong Kong market is poised to rebound in this year's second half would buy call warrants, since calls appreciate as the index value exceeds the preset strike price. Put warrants are for investors who think there's still plenty of air to be let out of the Hong Kong market. Considering Hong Kong's slide so far this year, call warrants look like the smarter bet.<p>Call warrants that were issued by <a name="NYSE:PWJ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11148"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PaineWebber</b></a> last October -- with a strike price of $440.09 -- and expire in October 1995 currently have the lowest strike price of the calls that trade on the Amex. These calls were trading at $4.63 at midyear. For every point gain in the value of the index, the cash value of the warrant increases about 6.5 cents. (The terms of a warrant series vary depending on when the warrants were issued and by which issuer. Each warrant offering has its own prospectus.) This means that if the index rose 88 points, the value of the warrant would jump about $5.72 in cash value (88 times 0.065) to $10.35 -- a 123 percent gain. On July 18, the Amex Hong Kong Index closed at 459.60.<p>Prospectuses on each series are available from the issuing firm.

Most of us, lately. But they still make a certain sense.<p>By Liliana Nealon<p>By definition, "hedging" means taking steps to reduce possible losses on a bet, risk, or speculation by betting or speculating on the other side of the equation. Despite their name, most so-called hedge funds don't really do this. It's more common, in fact, for hedge-fund managers to operate like speculators who take big, unprotected risks.<p>Witness the recent setbacks of some of the dominant global players like George Soros and Michael Steinhardt. These two had both been on a roll since 1987, but in the first half of 1994, both got badly burned by markets that didn't do what the hedge-fund managers thought they would. Soros dipped badly before a recent recovery and Steinhardt's fund is down 31.3 percent on the year, mostly on bets that European interest rates would decline, causing bonds to rise. Many hedge-fund players also gambled that the dollar would grow stronger, particularly against the Japanese yen. The opposite happened instead.<p>Even worse was what happened to David Askin, the hedge-fund manager of Askin Capital Management. Askin was forced to close his doors last spring when the $600 million he was managing for clients vanished with the implosion of fixed-income derivatives, in which he had invested heavily. <p>The press attention heaped on Askin and other such debacles may have chastened many investors about hedge funds. But some of these fears may be exaggerated. <p>According to MAR/Hedge, a monthly study published by New York-based Managed Accounts Reports, the median hedge fund lost around 2.5 percent in the first five months of 1994, the most recent figures available. That performance compares with a 1 percent decline in the S&P 500 and a 5.9 percent decline in the Nasdaq index of over-the-counter stocks.<p>A longer-term look also sheds a favorable light on hedge funds. Peter De Cicco, president of Portfolio Management Resources, a Fairfield, Iowa, investment-consulting firm specializing in alternative investments, says that in general, hedge funds have outperformed mutual funds since 1987. They have also fared better than their mutual fund counterparts in down markets: In 1990, when the median of hedge funds returned 9 percent, the S&P 500 declined 3.1 percent and mutual funds dropped by 4.8 percent.<p>The median of 49 "global macro" hedge funds (essentially the most freewheeling funds) tracked by MAR/Hedge returned more than 10 percent a year from 1991 to the end of 1993. The top quarter of managers returned better than 35 percent in 1993, better than 23 percent in 1991, and no lower than 19.9 percent since 1990. <p>With that kind of a track record, it still probably makes sense for investors with at least $100,000 to invest to consider hedge funds as a way to balance their holdings and propel returns. Before doing so, however, such investors need to take some cautions to heart. <p>For starters, remember that many hedge funds use leverage. This means that when someone invests $100,000 into a hedge fund, the money at play in the account can be many times that amount. Leverage heightens potential returns but also makes it easier to lose everything. <p>If a $100,000 investment is leveraged five times, for example, and the market drops 10 percent, the result will be a $50,000 loss, or half the initial investment. Since many hedge funds allow withdrawals only quarterly or biannually, or even annually, it's imperative that investors understand the risks associated with leverage in a fund. Any more than 2 to 1 leverage is ill-advised.<p>Another worry is "manager risk" -- very simply, the possibility that the fund is not in capable hands. De Cicco analyzed the performance and risk of 250 hedge funds over seven years and found that hedge funds offer lower market risk but higher manager risk than traditional investment vehicles. Therefore, De Cicco warns potential investors to check on a manager's background, years of experience in implementing a strategy, and a fund's organizational structure and risk control guidelines. <p>He also advises investors to rely more on managers who have part or all of their personal net worth invested in the fund. Most of this information should be available in a fund's disclosure document. If not, it's up to you to get answers to your questions. <p>Finally, check not only the overall size of the fund, but the speed at which it has grown. Studies show that funds that take on too much too fast have trouble digesting their new money, leading to reduced performance and difficulties in completing their new larger trades successfully. Moderate growth is often preferable.<p>Picking managers and funds that meet the above prerequisites may limit you to those managers with strong historical performance, missing the so-called "emerging managers" who may become the stars of the future. For the truly adventurous looking for the star manager of tomorrow, MAR lists new and emerging managers and conducts monthly reviews of their trading styles.<p>Keep in mind that hedge funds' historical double-digit returns do not come easy. The lackluster performance of 1994 could get worse before it gets better. Investors in hedge funds should have the stomach to lose it all. <p><p>

What do the top financial advisors tell their wealthiest clients, and what can the rest of us learn from it?<p>By Robert Clark<p>Personal finance has become a huge industry, but private bankers still command the top rung. They offer a variety of attractions: jumbo loans, platinum credit cards, good-natured check cashing, plus the occasional opera tickets and hunt-club luncheons. Yet there's a far more important reason why rich people flock to these gurus on high: Performance. Private banks offer a premium level of expertise in money management.<p>Getting access to all this financial acumen requires a fat wallet. United States Trust Co., the oldest trust company in America, recommends a client have at least $1 million of investable spare change. Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. requires a portfolio of $2 million. Union Bank of Switzerland, perhaps the world's largest private banker, turns up its nose at anything less than $3 million. At J.P. Morgan, it's $5 million. But even J.P. Morgan is a piker compared with the Wealth Management Group at Chicago's Northern Trust. There, getting past the receptionist requires a family worth of $100 million.<p>OK, suppose you've only been reading Worth for a few issues and so haven't quite reached multimillionaire status. Is there anything that goes on inside private banks you should know about? Well, they certainly don't peddle whole life insurance. And they aren't too keen on impressing their clients with a handful of supposedly hot stock tips. In fact, even though private bankers have access to the best securities research that money can buy, they place comparatively little emphasis on trying to identify highflying stocks. <p>The reason: Private bankers, by and large, are big fans of modern portfolio theory, which asserts that overall investment performance is far more dependent on the mix of asset classes in the portfolio than it is on the mix of individual stocks. Put another way, portfolios gain or lose largely because of factors that affect entire classes of investment. Economic and interest-rate trends are among the most familiar of these factors. <p>Individuals with less-than-institutional capital can and should take the same perspective. You may not have $100 million to entrust to Northern Trust, but you can manage what you do have in a manner similar to Northern Trust's. The key is setting the right goals. Private bankers start with where their clients want to go, financially speaking, and then they tailor-make standards by working backward. <p>For people with hundreds of millions of dollars in assets, the goal may be the conservation or increase of capital for several generations to come. Too distant for most of us, of course, but no matter. Setting a goal requires us to examine why we're investing in the first place, a useful and revealing exercise. A goal may be buying a bigger house, sending the kids to college, or securing a retirement. <p>Goals help put risk into some meaningful perspective. Many helpful-looking financial guides begin by asking investors how much risk they are willing to incur. But that gets the whole thing off on the wrong foot because there is really only one appropriate answer to that question: as little as possible. By setting the distance you need to travel, goals help you to figure how much risk you need to get there.<p>Private bankers excel at shrinking that risk through portfolio diversification. If you need and can tolerate high risk, a well-diversified portfolio of growth stocks will bring you a superior return, at times, without exposing you to the scariest prospect of all, losing a big chunk of your stake. A portfolio that mixes common stocks, mutual funds, and bonds entails smaller risks but also less generous returns. Private bankers usually allocate assets among investment classes according to sophisticated projections of economic growth and the direction of interest rates. Lacking their sophistication, other investors can mimic it by keeping emergency cash on hand, by dividing a portfolio between equity mutual funds and bonds, and by rejiggering it every six months to maintain the balance.<p>One guideline to follow for setting the mix: Make the percentage of bonds in such a portfolio equal to your age. If that seems too conservative for older people or too risky for younger folks, 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds is another way to go. Over the long term, this mix has thrown off a return of about 7.5 percent a year. Does your goal require more than that? Then your only chance of reaching it is to up your risk taking. Increase the stock proportion or buy riskier stocks. Historically, portfolios invested fully in small-capitalization equities have returned about 12 percent.<p>Private bankers are also high on foreign securities these days. Global diversification can increase return and reduce risk, promising the best of all worlds, or so it seems from historical experience. Buying heavily into the latest hot market, however, isn't the kind of diversification that is calculated to produce the best of both. This year's hot market is usually next year's dog. Next year's dog may be worth buying. Next year.<p>Private bankers and other professionals try to get ahead of the flow of money instead of following it. Patrick Moriarty, chief investment officer at Bank Julius Baer, believes that Asia remains the growth market of the '90s. Yet he has no money in Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, or Korea. Because they are hot, he believes that they're overvalued. He has put client money in such currently unpopular markets as Hong Kong and Japan. <p>Topflight advisors also try to avoid the things that gnaw away at wealth. Among them: Inflation, taxes, and advisory fees. These advisors know that the longer an investor needs to preserve capital, the more inflation becomes a concern. At only 3 percent a year, the buying power of a portfolio will have shrunk by nearly half in 20 years. And few private bankers expect such a low rate of inflation to continue. On the other hand there has been no 20-year period in this century in which stock prices shrank by even 1 percent, let alone 50 percent. For long-term investors, then, inflation is far more dangerous than bear markets. <p>A corollary: Investors can increase the market risk in a portfolio a lot before it equals the inflation risk. This generally means taking more risk than most people might consider wise. Growth companies, including those with small capitalizations, will increase market risk but disproportionately reduce inflation risk. Junk bonds and venture financing can also help defeat inflation. Many great family fortunes own diversified portfolios of startup companies. Northern Trust puts its clients in touch with venture-capital specialists who can help them find high-growth opportunities. Emerging equity markets, besides providing global diversification, also serve as inflation hedges. Private banks advise keeping about 10 percent of an investment portfolio in emerging-market securities.<p>Fees can be just as destructive as inflation. A highflying fund with an expense ratio of 2.5 percent or 3 percent a year won't return as much as slightly less dazzling performers with fees as low as 0.19 percent of assets a year. The difference could achieve or defeat your purpose in investing. Choose low-cost funds over high-cost funds.<p>Rich people also don't like taxes. Neither, of course, do the rest of us, but the rich have advisors to help minimize them. An old-fashioned and rewarding way of doing so is to keep portfolio turnover low to avoid the continual realization of capital gains and consequent taxes. Mutual fund investors should seek out funds that don't realize capital gains with distressingly taxable frequency.<p>Probably the best advice the wealthy get has to do with evaluating their money manager's performance. Simply put, measure it not by what he is paid but by what you are paid -- your net investment return after adjustment for expenses, inflation, and taxes. The wealthy are usually pleased to get a net real return of 2 percent to 3 percent a year. That's a true increase in wealth that they keep. The wealthy are not overly impressed by their portfolio performance compared with a market index. If the index drops 20 percent and you're only down 10 percent, you've beaten the market. But you've still lost money. You can't pay the mortgage with minus 10 percent. Or hire private bankers, either.

						Forget everything that the great bull market taught you about investing. Here's how smart investors will react to rapidly changing conditions.<p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p>This year, the financial markets have changed course so quickly and so radically that investors may be forgiven for feeling a bit of whiplash. But it is not okay to think that the recent white-water ride in stocks and bonds is just a brief stretch in the river, scheduled to end around the next bend. The fact of the matter is, we've started a whole new adventure, one that will bear little resemblance to anything we've experienced lately.<p>How should securities investors respond? Strategies that worked so well over the past five years are now outmoded and need to be jettisoned. The market will punish investors who are slow to grasp this. Henceforth, careful fundamental securities analysis -- not investing with the crowd -- will carry the day. The largest gains will go to investors who resist initial public offerings, sector funds, and most bargain-basement losers. New inflationary expectations, higher interest rates, higher taxes, and an anomalously weak dollar have changed everything.<p>In short, it ain't gonna be easy any longer.<p>The changes have already begun. Markets are rarely static, but the turbulence in the financial arena since January should be your clue that the rules of the game are being revised. And in this game, Yogi Berra notwithstanding, it's not going to be deja vu all over again.<p>After years of stellar returns, stocks are taking back some of their rewards. Is it a full-fledged bear market? The debate makes lively cocktail chatter, but it is unenlightening. Will the bull resume after a short break in the action? Another question that misses the point.<p>Higher ground than where we are now may in fact be achieved by the stock and bond markets in the coming months. But don't be fooled: The heights will not be gained in the same manner -- or in the same types of stocks -- as in 1992 or 1993.<p>Veteran money manager Charles Johnson has seen many different kinds of markets over the years. Almost 40 years, in fact, have passed since he began running the nearly $3 billion Franklin Utilities Fund. "It is a different market," he says. "This year's rising interest rates, higher taxes, and weak dollar create a reluctance to buy U.S. securities." <p>Research by Mark Hulbert, editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest, which tracks the returns of market-advisory newsletters, shows just how different today's investment terrain is and how difficult it is to prosper in. Comparing the performance of almost 200 newsletter portfolios in the first quarter of 1994 against their returns for the past five years turned up this fact: Fewer than one in four of the strategists Hulbert tracks beat the market both in the past five years and in the first quarter of 1994. Stated simply, what worked in the past works no more.<p>Why? Fundamental factors that drove the market ever higher have disappeared: low and stable inflation rates, interest rates that only went down, and a flood of foreign money into U.S. securities. These factors supported a three-year bull move in stocks and bonds.<p>The bulls, at times, went manic. IPOs ran hot and heavy, bringing big gains to those investors lucky enough to get in on the new shares. Taking a flier on whatever stock or sector the crowd was currently stampeding into -- investing with the herd -- became the winning technique. <p>That technique will be a loser over the duration.<p>The funny thing about markets is, the more they rise, the more risk investors believe they can take. Such was the case in 1993 and early 1994. As the stock market scaled new heights, investors felt more comfortable swinging for the fences, going for the long ball.<p>One measure: The amount of money investors borrowed from their brokers to buy stocks -- margin debt -- exploded to $61 billion in January. That's more than double the $28 billion indebtedness investors had outstanding at the end of 1990. <p>Meaning? Margin debt is a tip-off to how bullish investors are. Folks who borrow from their brokers to buy stocks are betting that equity prices will rise fast and furiously. That's because margin, like most kinds of borrowing, works its magic only in up markets. <p>Another indication of euphoria: Equities now make up the biggest portion of invested assets. For the first time since 1972, the percentage of assets invested in stocks exceeds the percentage in cash -- bank deposits, checking accounts, money markets. Even during the big bull market of the '80s, Americans kept considerably more cash in their portfolios than stocks. In 1993, the balance tipped the other way.<p>This is significant on two counts. One, it shows a commitment to stocks among investors that hasn't been seen since just before the hideous bear market of 1974. Two, it suggests that the U.S. investor is nearly tapped out where stocks are concerned. With almost 40 percent of their invested assets held in equities today -- a percentage not seen since 1973 -- investors aren't likely to move lots more into stocks.<p>Counting their gains, investors were comfortable with their stocks and bonds when 1994 rolled in. Then, without much warning, the market showed its dark side. <p>If the old market's winning ways had to do with lower inflation and interest rates, big foreign investment in U.S. stocks and bonds, and increasing corporate efficiencies, then the less-than-jovial ways of the new market have to do with rising inflation and interest rates, rising personal income taxes, and the flight of foreign capital. That all adds up to a marked slowing in demand for U.S. stocks and somewhat less of a hit for bonds.<p>Start with the specter of rising inflation -- bad news for financial instruments because inflation eats away at investors' real returns in both stocks and bonds. Increasing interest rates cause similar damage. Higher borrowing costs cut into corporate profits. New, higher-coupon bonds look more attractive than equities or lower-yielding bonds. Why take a risk in stocks, whose dividend yields are now 2.9 percent, when you can buy a low-risk two-year Treasury note and bag almost 6 percent? (For more about what you should do with your fixed-income investments, see the sidebar "Bond Market's New Climate" at the end of this file.) <p>Interest rates will almost certainly rise further. Traders look to the federal-funds futures market for clues. This market is one of the best indicators of what professional investors believe the future cost of money will be. Right now, the market in fed-fund futures says short money rates will be between 5 percent and 5.5 percent by year end. Present rates are 4.25 percent. <p>Foreign investors are also playing a big role in the market's current transformation. In 1993, overseas investors bought more than $110 billion in U.S. stocks and bonds, an all-time high. Most of this money poured into fixed-income investments -- especially U.S. agency securities -- but $21.5 billion of it, roughly one fifth of the total, went into stocks. <p>This is not small change. By year end, the $21 billion-plus placed in U.S. equities accounted for 3 percent of the rise in market value during the year on the New York and American Stock Exchanges and Nasdaq. <p>But now it looks as though foreign investors' ardor for American securities has cooled. Although figures for the first quarter's international money flows were not available at press time from the Commerce Department, anecdotal evidence says that foreigners are fleeing the U.S. markets. <p>Dan Dorrow watches the world scene as an international economist at <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>. He says that today's market reminds him of 1990, when foreign investment in the U.S. plunged after years of growth. Right now, he says, "if the Dow meanders, you won't see a lot of foreign buyers. Most firms overseas are recommending underweighting in the U.S. I don't see (the flows) turning around." (For foreigners' views on the American market, see the sidebar "Overseas Views On The U.S." at the end of this file.) It doesn't help that many overseas investors view President Clinton's ship of state as rudderless both in foreign and domestic seas.<p>Moreover, global investing isn't a one-way street. Now more than ever, U.S. investors are sending their money to foreign shores in search of better returns. According to the Securities Industry Association, U.S. investors bought almost $68 billion in foreign equities last year. That number exceeds the foreign purchases made by Americans during the entire decade of 1980 to 1990. Americans sending more dollars abroad and foreigners keeping them there add up to only one thing: bad news for U.S. stocks. <p>This across-the-board reduction of demand for U.S. stocks and bonds is a new phenomenon. During the entire 1980s, the U.S. was a net-capital importer. Every year, more money flowed into U.S. securities than flowed out.  Investors thought U.S. markets promised higher returns.<p>But the 1990s have changed that view. In the first year of the decade, the U.S. saw a net investment outflow of $12 billion, and the S&P fell some 7 percent. Then, last year, the outflow increased to $17 billion. In 1994, the shortfall is likely to be even greater. <p>That is a major reason for the dollar's paradoxical weakness. When interest rates go up, as they have done since February, the dollar usually gets stronger. This is because investment funds flow to instruments paying the greatest returns. So each increase in U.S. interest rates should, theoretically, increase the appeal of U.S. bonds. To buy bonds, foreigners must first buy dollars, effectively pushing the dollar higher against other currencies.<p>This, however, is not happening. After rates had gone up almost a full percentage point, the dollar was the lowest it had been against the Japanese yen since World War II, and at death's door against the deutsche mark. Only a dollar-buying spree by U.S. and foreign central banks in early May put a temporary stop to the slide. Even so, the dollar still looks sick.<p>A weakening dollar in declining stock and bond markets is a phenomenon that has occurred only three other times in the past two decades, according to Anthony Kolton of Logical Information Machines, a market-information company in Chicago. Kolton says these episodes took place in October 1987 during the crash and twice in 1990 -- in late February and early May. The most recent occurrence was on April 4. <p>In two of the periods before the most recent one, the stock market wound up significantly lower seven months after the weakness in the dollar, stock, and bond markets converged. The one time that the market recovered quickly, oddly enough, was during the 1987 crash. But twice in 1990, when the dollar, bonds, and stocks were all weak, seven months later the S&P 500 had weakened, too.<p>This leads Kolton to believe that stock prices will remain under pressure until well into the fall of 1994. The effect of rising income taxes on spending and productivity will also hurt. Stephen Moore, director of fiscal-policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington, D.C., and John Skorburg, an economist in Chicago, penned a study last fall estimating the economic implications of President Clinton's 1993 tax increase. Moore and Skorburg set out to assess what effect $265 billion in new taxes over the next five years would have on jobs, gross domestic product, and economic growth. <p>What they found: Through 1997, increased taxes will result in a $190 billion loss in gross domestic product. (Last year's GDP was $6 trillion.) In addition, the economic growth rate through 1997 will be 0.7 percentage points lower than it would be without the tax increases. Between 1994 and 1998, say the researchers, real GDP growth will likely average 1.2 percent, versus 2.6 percent in 1993. Such a performance, says Moore, "would be the worst turned in during any five-year period since the Second World War." <p>The stock market likes higher taxes no more than higher inflation. It may get the worst of both worlds. The last time taxes went up -- the 1990 increase that probably cost George Bush a second term -- the market fell 7 percent on the year.<p>Small wonder that stock prices are weak. Yet many investors seem to believe that if they just sit tight, stocks will resume their straight-up climb. The good old days -- 1989 and 1991, for instance, when the S&P made 27 percent and 26 percent, respectively -- are sure to return. <p>We'd love it if they did. But repeat performances are not what the stock market's all about. Still, we're not going to recommend putting your money in the mattress. All the news on the economic horizon isn't dreary. It's just that what good news there is won't benefit all stocks; it'll benefit the chosen few.<p>For instance: The economy is perking along at a roughly 3 percent growth rate. This type of moderate growth, if it can be maintained, is much healthier for U.S. stocks than a cyclical rebound of, say, 7 percent. The slower growth scenario that we're seeing now, says John Neff, manager of Vanguard's Windsor Fund since 1964, means that stocks could show three to four years of upward moves in response to earnings growth of 8 percent to 10 percent. <p>Corporations are certainly in fine competitive shape today -- another bit of good news. Whittling down their costs boosts profit margins. And more American companies than ever are operating globally, well positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery going on right now in Europe. <p>Indeed, sooner or later, stock prices will recover. Yet even if that happens tomorrow, capitalizing on it will require an investment strategy quite different from the past's. Looking in the rearview mirror may help improve your driving, but it won't add much in the way of gains on your tax return.<p>"Looking backward is not much of a guide," says Gail Dudack,  managing director and strategist at S.G. Warburg, an investment firm in New York. "But there is a greater risk of doing that now than there has been in years." Although investors may like to think that the markets of the 1980s will return, she observes: "The 1980s were very different; competitiveness was different, inflation was different, consumption was different."<p>What, then, will pay off in the new market? Here's our take on the new rules an investor should follow:<p>-> Avoid initial public offerings. No longer are IPOs likely to shoot straight up after they begin trading. Weak stock markets are, for the most part, inhospitable to new equity issues. Their after-offering trading reflects this shift in investors' psychology. <p>Of a group of 23 issues brought to market in the first weeks of April, roughly half were trading above their IPO prices by mid-month. That's not a bad ratio, but the gainers showed relatively modest increases: an average of $1.60 a share. Now that the market is less embracing, individual investors are more likely to be allowed to buy new offering shares. Stay away.<p>-> Steer clear of sector funds. Robert Markman, a Minneapolis money manager, believes that only two sectors are likely to move up for an extended period of time in the coming months: real estate and gold. "Every other sector looks ready for a fall," he says.<p>-> Find companies that will compete in and survive industry shakeouts. This advice comes from market strategist Dudack. She hunts for what she calls predator companies, those that will compete successfully in a world where prices of basic goods are coming down and profit margins get squeezed. Predator companies will also come through the many shakeouts that Dudack expects to hit various industries during this decade. "We ended the 1980s with a situation where the consumer is overstored, overcerealed, and oversupplied," says Dudack. "The likelihood is that not all these stores will exist at the end of the decade."<p>To become a predator, Dudack says, a company must be able to sell its goods both domestically and abroad and show sustained unit-volume growth in markets where profit margins are pressured. Companies that meet Dudack's criteria include <a name="NYSE:CPQ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10381"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Compaq</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>, and software supplier <a name="NASD:ORCL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14337"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oracle</b></a>. <p>-> Buy companies that look good because of internal performance and not merely because their stocks are attracting touts and speculators. So says Paul Ullman, executive vice president and money manager at Cortland Associates in St. Louis, a firm with $140 million under management. Ullman has survived tumultuous markets since 1953 with his reputation -- and record -- intact. For the past six-year period, ending in March, his firm's equity portfolio turned in a 14.1 percent annual return.<p>Ullman is a classic value investor who says he has walked away from the stocks of more than 100 companies this year simply because the prices were too rich. What he looks for: "Companies with cagey management that are modestly leveraged, with niche markets, good research and development, and distribution control. They should also know where they're going over the next five years and be growing at between 10 percent and 12 percent." <p>For companies that meet these standards, Ullman is willing to pay a slight premium, say, between 12 and 14 times earnings. He's had to avoid most candidates because they're trading at prices much higher than that, such as 27 times earnings. But he thinks that prices will get more reasonable as the year wears on.<p>-> Find stocks that will participate in the coming surge in capital investment. Another industrial shift that smart investors can profit from: American corporations and -- to a lesser degree -- those around the world are increasing their capital spending. The 1980s saw an explosion in the supply of consumer nondurables such as apparel and foods. American corporations fell behind in capital investments in machine tools, computers, and other heavy equipment. Now companies are playing catch-up. Some heavy capital investors now are machine- tool maker Giddings & Lewis, chip maker <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:GE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10634"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Electric</b></a>.<p>-> In mutual funds, smaller is better. If you believe, as many market observers do, that the months and years ahead will reward stock pickers more than sector pickers, then you might want to switch your focus to smaller fund managers. That way, you're apt to get a bigger bang for your buck. <p>Money manager Markman says, "Whenever you have a selective stock market, smaller is better." That's because a pip-squeak fund with a $300 million market capitalization can buy both <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> and, say, Wholesome & Hearty Foods, the top performer on Nasdaq last year. The giant fund with a $3 billion market cap, on the other hand, can buy IBM, but not Wholesome & Hearty. Small stocks don't have enough shares outstanding to attract big investors. But small-fund managers can get in and gain.<p>We're not saying that the stock and bond markets are going to get less volatile or tricky any time soon. But these strategies should help you maneuver through any mayhem that comes along and position yourself for the eventual resurgence. Remember: Nostalgia for the good old days is okay among friends. It's not, however, okay in the markets.<p>Yet many investors cling to the beliefs and strategies of yesteryear for the very reason that they paid off well in the past. What are some of those outmoded methods? Here are the critical ones we think investors should avoid:<p>-> Buying stocks in anticipation of pleasant earnings surprises. Brokers and money managers today say investors continue to buy stocks that they believe will soon issue better-than-expected earnings reports. Last year, positive-earnings surprises, as they are known, generally made stock prices jump. Today, this kind of good news is greeted with yawns or selling. (See "Mauled by the Good-News Bears.") In the new market, traders sell on good news even when it is unexpected.<p>On April 4, for instance, semiconductor-chip maker <a name="NYSE:AMD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10037"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Advanced Micro Devices</b></a> reported record sales and operating earnings for its first quarter. The stock, which was trading around $31 the day the earnings came out, sank to $30.25 the next day. A month later, the shares were changing hands at $25 each. Betting that big moves will follow good earnings reports no longer works. <p>-> Shopping the "new low" list for cheap stocks. This strategy may have worked when the tides of a rising market eventually lifted all ships. It is a dangerous practice when prices are weak or static. Stocks often trade at new lows for reasons that have more to do with company fundamentals than with an overall market malaise. In a weak market, it's low today, lower tomorrow.<p>-> Waiting to sell a stock that's fallen because "it'll come back." Investors in Media Vision Technology, a computer-add-ons stock that was big with the momentum-investing crowd, probably used this excuse to avoid selling their shares in early March when the stock was trading around $30. After all, hadn't the shares hit $46 just months earlier? <p>Indeed they had. But waiting for Media Vision's comeback has proved costly; the stock is now around $2.75, and the company is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Lesson: Stocks don't always come back to prices investors would like to be able to sell them for.<p>-> Buying shares with low price-to-earnings ratios. Usually, this is an admirable exercise. Late in a bull market, it can be frustrating and costly.<p>Take the case of <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford Motor Co.</b></a>, a healthy company that's selling cars like gangbusters around the world. Ford's earnings in the most recent quarter were awesome -- $1.66 a share, more than 60 percent above the same period a year earlier. Because the blockbuster numbers didn't boost Ford's stock much, its p/e fell a bit, to 12, significantly lower than the overall market p/e of 19. A good buy, right?<p>Maybe not. Back in 1988, Ford had smashing earnings of almost $11 a share and a p/e of less than 5. Yet investors who bought the shares on the strength of those numbers were soon disappointed. Although the stock traded around $55 in early 1989, it sank to around $25 in 1990.<p>What the Ford case demonstrates is this: Just because a company's shares carry a low p/e, that doesn't necessarily make them a good buy. Indeed, history teaches us that some stocks -- like Ford -- should be bought not when earnings are high but rather when they are in the pits.<p>Consider: After earning almost $11 in 1988, by 1990, Ford's earnings had declined to less than $2 a share. Then, in 1991, the carmaker showed a loss of almost $5 a share. Perversely, this was when smart investors should have been buying. The shares ended 1991 under $30 and never looked back, almost doubling to $50 by mid-1992. <p>-> Swinging for the fences. Emotional investors tend to increase their tolerance for risk in investments as markets move higher. Yet, in the interests of capital preservation, the opposite behavior should hold. By ratcheting down their portfolio's risks as the market skyrockets, investors would be doing the smart but tough thing: selling high. <p>Instead, investors often go for the long ball even though a bull market is in extra innings. This type of behavior includes making a speculative investment -- such as a position in an emerging market or a sector fund -- your portfolio's core holding. Or retirees buying aggressive-growth-stock funds. <p>Investment manager Markman has seen these behavior patterns. They worry him. "It's important to look not just at what will make it through a tough market, but what will emerge when the market turns up," he says. In this more selective market, he says, truly imaginative stock pickers are the only ones who'll thrive.<p>That's it: back to mind-bending industry research and the old-fashioned stock picking that Graham and Dodd made famous. Rescues by greater fools and capital gains on riskless Treasurys are no longer in the cards.

SIDEBAR:
The New Climate For Bond Investors<p>Bond investors take heart: the worst is probably over. Not that the ride hasn't been traumatic of late. Bondholders used to the steady gains of the recent past -- total returns on U.S. Treasury 30-year bonds averaged 10.54 percent annually from 1989 through 1993 -- suddenly found their investments in a freefall. During this year's first quarter alone, the total return on the 30-year long bond came to a stunning minus 7.83 percent. Among the major bond funds, the carnage was only a tad less severe. In the span of three months, 20 funds with top ratings by Chicago-based Morningstar lost 6 percent or more of their value. <p>What happened to these supposedly safe instruments? <p>The broad picture, at least, is fairly simple to explain: We are now at the end of another interest-rate cycle. The decline in rates hit bottom last year. The Federal Reserve's decision to raise the federal-funds rate in February officially ended the cycle.<p>The recent behavior of the market, the wild rallies and drops, is exactly what happens in the typical transition between cycles, says Stan Carnes, chief portfolio strategist for the financial-services division at Lehman Brothers. Carnes sees the rest of 1994 as "a coupon-clipping type of year," one where bond returns consist of interest payments only and capital gains are virtually nonexistent. Actually, such a market is much closer to the historic norm than the last decade was. In the long run, ten-year Treasury notes return about 2 percent over inflation, says Carnes.<p>Here are some things bond investors should keep in mind: <p>-> Ignore the current popular advice to "move to quality" -- a notion favoring bonds that carry little credit risk. "The higher the grade (of a bond), the more it gets hurt" when rates go up, notes Eric Ryback, manager of the Lindner Dividend Fund. That's why Treasury bonds have gotten socked harder than junk bonds lately.<p>-> Readjust your expectations. Two-year Treasury notes, currently yielding approximately 6 percent, are a screaming buy, says Carnes. "If you're truly bearish on inflation, (you believe) it might go up to 4 percent. So the notes yield 2 percent real." That's still roughly equivalent to the historic yield on ten-year Treasurys.<p>-> For higher yields, consider bonds with longer durations. Risk increases with duration, but so does yield. Five-year Treasury notes pay more interest than Treasury bills  -- which pay off interest and principal in 90 days. If the bond market eventually comes to believe that the Fed has inflation under control, long rates may come down and investors holding notes with long durations could see some capital gains. At the same time, says Carnes, there's almost no payoff in yield for buying a 30-year instead of a 10- or 12-year bond. "It doesn't make sense to go out real long," he says.<p>-> In a coupon-clipping world, investors can manage interest-rate risk on their own just fine, without the help (and added cost) of a bond fund. The sure way to preserve principal is to purchase bonds you are willing to hold to maturity -- matching the duration of the bond with your investment horizon. "Laddering" is another tried-and-true technique. To create a 12-year ladder, for example, an investor would divide the amount that he wants to allocate to bonds into 12 equal parts and invest the first twelfth in a one-year note, the second twelfth in a two-year note, etc. Each year, as the shortest bond matures, that sum is invested in a new bond with a current 12-year maturity. Eventually, all steps of the ladder will hold bonds with the yield of 12-year instruments. But since the investor is holding them to maturity, he has no interest-rate risk.<p>-> Bond funds with unique strategies offer investors the best return on the fees they pay. Investors seeking yields above those offered by governments will need to look at lower-grade instruments from companies that are using the current period of economic growth to improve their credit ratings. That gives investors a chance to collect some capital gains as credit ratings improve. A good fund manager should be able to offer protection against higher credit risk through due diligence and by putting together a diversified portfolio. <p>-> Rethink the fees you are willing to pay. Expense ratios on funds in Morningstar's government Treasury category range from 1.25 percent annually for Midwest Leshner Treasury T/RA to 0.11 percent for Dreyfus 100 Percent U.S. Treasury Short-term. Midwest Leshner also carries a 4 percent front-end sales charge. Remember, we're looking at a future where returns are likely to be closer to 8 percent than 15.<p>-> Consider alternatives to bonds. Lately, Ryback says he has been buying convertible preferred stock. This hybrid security pays a big yield like a bond but is convertible into a company's common stock. The upside is thus a combination of yield and capital appreciation since the convertible goes up less than but along with the price of the common stock. Ryback has recently bought AMC Entertainment Preferred (AEN Preferred), which yields 8.2 percent and trades at $21, and Tosco Preferred (TOS Pr. F), which yields 6.8 percent and trades at $64. Both preferreds trade at a premium to the underlying common stock, but the premiums are only 21 percent and 2 percent, respectively. "That's not very much as long as the company is showing solid earnings growth," Ryback says. --Jim Jubak---------------<p>SIDEBAR:
Where Have All the Foreign Investors Gone?<p>We conducted an opinion poll of foreign investment houses in Asia, Europe, and Latin America. What kind of advice are they giving their clients about investing in the U.S. stock market right now?<p>Stay out. Contrary to the benchmark <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley</b></a> Capital International World Index, which recommends that portfolios be weighted most heavily in favor of the U.S. at 35. 8 percent (followed by Asia at 32.6 percent and Europe at 27.5 percent), most polled have the U.S. underweighted. Just one -- Union Bank of Switzerland, with $178 billion in assets -- has a 40 percent overweighting in the U.S. <p>"The U.S. is in a bear phase of a bull market," says UBS international strategist Tim O'Dell. "Increased bond yields and reduced confidence in the short term is upsetting the U.S. equity markets." O'Dell believes the U.S. market is much more sound than others. But while unconcerned about the weak dollar (UBS is fully hedged), O'Dell is puzzled by what he sees as one of the main causes for its weakness. "It's the U.S. institutions themselves that have been investing abroad so heavily," he says. "They've been overweighting their foreign portfolios." Here's what overseas players are saying about us.
-- by Manjeet Kripalani<p>"We're underweighted in the U.S. There're better opportunities elsewhere. The rest of Europe is moving into the investment-cycle phase, and the valuations aren't so stretched." 
-- Mark Tinker, market strategist, James Capel (U.K.)<p>
"Investing anywhere else (other than the U.S.) will give handsome returns over currency and equity markets."
-- Richard Griffiths, European equity strategist, Swiss Bank Corp. (Switzerland)<p>
"We would only play the U.S. markets through European stocks that have U.S. interests." 
--Christopher Clark, Credit Lyonnais (France)<p>
"The U.S. economy will be slowing down considerably. A lot of the tax hikes are threshold hikes; they'll bite in the second half of the year. Like FICA (federal insurance contributions). Now the risk is the U.S. will stop getting foreign investment flows."
-- Robert Brusca, co-chief economist, Nikko Securities (Japan)<p>
"Are we seeing U.S. earnings peak in the next four quarters? We see an upside of 10 to 12 percent, and then when you compare, there's better money to be made in Germany, France, the Netherlands. Europe is in the early stages of an earnings recovery."
-- Mark Spellman, Deutsche Bank (Germany)<p>
"The biggest problem is currency. It affects U.S. asset value when the dollar is devalued by the yen. We've been reluctant to invest in the U.S. right now."
-- Takeshi Abekura, fund manager, U.S. equity portfolio, Dai-ichi Mutual Life (Japan)<p>
"The tax issue is a lingering problem with the U.S. people and is perceived as something that will keep them from investing that extra dollar. I don't think people have realized that change. The administration has a credibility problem; that could be a wild card. The Dow is not indicative of the broad market; it's made up of all the companies that have been acting terrifically. For the first time, people are getting hurt by buying dips (securities with momentarily weak prices). Stick to cash this year. Capital preservation is important. The worst yielding thing used to be a cash position; now it's the best."
-- James Haber, portfolio manager, Tendentia Overseas Fund (Brazil)<p>
"The Mexican stock market has been very high, so investing in the U.S. stock market has not been very attractive. In foreign markets, the Far East is attractive."<br>
-- Bernardo Labarthe, international treasurer, Banco Union (Mexico)<p><p>

Short-interest ratios are getting harder to interpret.<p>By Bruce Upbin<p>Short interest never was much of a guide to the future of stock prices. The surprising thing is that so many investors still rely on it. Our advice: Don't.<p>The short interest in any security is the number of shares that have been sold short -- borrowed, then sold -- but not yet bought back. Of course, one reason investors sell a stock short is that they believe its price will go down. If their prediction comes true, they can buy the shares back at a lower price and pocket the difference. <p>However, if a stock continues to move up in price, the shorts often try to wait it out or even add to their positions. Other shorts may join in the fray. These things can show up in the form of a rising total short-interest position in a company's stock. Eventually, though, the short sellers will have to buy the shares back to replace the ones they sold -- to cover, in Wall Street parlance, their short positions. Thus, the theory goes that when the short interest in a security sharply increases, it presages a sharp increase in demand for the security and a sharp increase in price. It doesn't matter whether the stock is a dog or a dynamo.<p>If that were always true, short sellers would always be wrong. They're not.<p>The theory survives partly because, like any and all speculative theories, it occasionally bears fruit. When short sellers blow it, they can blow it big; their potential losses are theoretically unlimited. Short squeezes still occur, when short sellers can't find sufficient shares to cover their shorts at market prices and are forced to go into the open market and bid up the stock's price to boost the supply. <p>This most often happens with hot stocks in extremely bullish markets, stocks that everybody but the buyers agree are overvalued and must come down. But bulls keep bidding the price up, reluctantly abetted by bears who are forced to cut their losses by covering their shorts. That makes short selling in hot markets a dangerous game and supports the theory that heavy short selling is bullish. <p>Philip Erlanger, president of Phil Erlanger Research in Acton, Massachusetts, cites a short-seller favorite, Biogen. Twice over the past three years, the stock doubled after big jumps in short selling. When the bears retreated and short selling shrank, the stock fell by 50 percent. The shorts were caught out, selling low and buying high.<p>Conversely, Erlanger says, "Very little short interest tells me there are too many bulls there" -- and a stock may fall. Even so, it usually takes a sharp overall market setback to send such stocks tumbling.<p>Short-interest figures lack reliability as market indicators today because hedging, arbitrage, and tax-deferral strategies account for a steadily increasing share of short selling. Suppose, for example, investors who already own a stock decide to sell an equal number of shares short. That increases the short interest, but the investors never need to buy shares to cover their shorts; they already own the shares. Some investors "short against the (safe-deposit) box," as the practice is commonly called, as a hedge in periods of extreme market volatility. <p>Then there is the tactic known as pairing longs and shorts -- buying <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a>, say, and shorting Ford as a hedge in an uncertain auto market. How can you tell whether pure bearishness, or hedging, accounts for an increase in short selling? "I'm as close to short information as you can get from the outside, and I can't even tell," says Michael Long, a short-sale watcher and general partner of Rockbridge Partners, an investment partnership in Charlotte, North Carolina.<p>The New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, and Nasdaq each report the short interest in securities traded in their markets once a month. Both the NYSE and Amex lists indicate securities that may have had significant short selling through arbitrage or hedging. But nobody knows how much is attributable to those motives. Steven Bloom, chief economist at the Amex, thinks it may be as much as 25 percent of short selling.<p>Does the motive for it matter? Yes. Well-hedged short sellers, unlike out-and-out bears, lose neither sleep nor equity when their shorts lose. They won't panic and push prices up.<p>If short interest is unreliable on individual stock-price trends, how about the overall market? "Back in the '60s, '70s, and early '80s, the theory was that if short interest got to two times (average daily) volume on the New York Stock Exchange, you would get market advances," says Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> in New York. Yet in recent years, the ratio has run between 3 times and 5.7 times the Big Board's average daily volume, through good markets and bad. <p>The ratio recently stood at 4.5, a bullish sign if judged by the old theory. Few experienced Wall Streeters believe that now. "The data no longer reflects whether people are bullish or bearish," says McCabe. If the bulls prove right, it won't be because of short interest.<p><p>

						Why one pro thinks mid-cap shares will shine.<p>By Manjeet Kripalani<p>Mid-cap stocks -- companies with market values between $200 million and $5 billion -- have been riding a wave of popularity in recent years. With reason: In 1993, they returned almost 14 percent, versus the 10 percent gain shown by the Standard & Poor's 500 and the 11.3 percent earned by the Wilshire 5000 index of smaller companies. But it was not until this year that Lipper Analytical Services started ranking mutual funds that invest in these mid-range concerns. <p>Among the top performing funds in this category is <a name="FUND:BMCGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BMCGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bhirud Mid-Cap Growth Fund</b></a>, a $10 million portfolio run by Suresh Bhirud, former chief strategist at First Boston and Oppenheimer. A longtime bear who has recently been reborn as one of the market's more vocal bulls, Bhirud, 45, sees mid-caps as a great buy. "They're cheaper than the big-cap universe and have the same growth prospects as small stocks -- but without the volatility," he says. Last year he returned 12.2 percent, below the 15.6 percent average for the group. But in the dicey first quarter of 1994, he outperformed the S&P 500 by 5 percentage points, putting him second in the mid-cap category at 0.81 percent.<p>When shopping for stocks, revenues are better numbers to analyze than earnings in many cases, Bhirud says, because they are an absolute. Earnings involve more uncertainty, more room for management's maneuverings in areas like executive salaries, stock options, and other administrative expenses. Revenue growth can also point to turnaround situations. Bhirud looks first for yearly revenue growth of 10 percent to 15 percent, then checks for earnings increases of 20 percent or more.<p>Right now, Bhirud likes technology companies. He feels the sector is relatively cheap and will benefit as global demand for computers -- especially in Europe and developing countries like China -- picks up. Technology companies recently traded at an average price-to-revenue ratio of 2. As a comparison, the drug sector trades at three times revenues -- too dear in Bhirud's eyes.<p>Bhirud also favors cyclical companies in the steel, chemical, and copper industries, because he believes they'll benefit from the increased capital expenditure planned by many corporations. "We are in the third year of the economic recovery," says Bhirud, "the right time to pick these stocks." His choice in the sector is <a name="NYSE:WHX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11631"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wheeling-Pittsburgh</b></a> (NYSE: WHX, recent price $15.88), one of the few integrated steel companies now starting a turnaround. In the black after a year of losses, Wheeling still sells for less than half its per-share revenue. <p><a name="NYSE:CMZ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10340"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cincinnati Milacron</b></a> (NYSE: CMZ, recently $21) and <a name="NYSE:FLR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10594"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fluor</b></a> (NYSE: FLR, recently $49.25) are Bhirud's choices for companies that will benefit from increasing capital investment among automobile manufacturers and infrastructure industries. Machine-tool maker Cincinnati Milacron took $100 million in losses for accounting and cost-cutting charges in 1993; revenues still rose 30 percent. Among its largest customers is <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a>. Bhirud estimates the company -- which was in the black for only two of the last five years -- will see positive earnings this year.<p>Fluor, an engineering and construction company, trades at half its per-share revenues. Fluor grew at an 18 percent clip in 1993, and Bhirud expects 20 percent annual growth in the near future. The 15 percent (and growing) annual expenditure on domestic infrastructure and the weak dollar make Fluor a top competitor for its only rivals, the Japanese, according to Bhirud.<p>Selections in semiconductor stocks include <a name="NYSE:LSI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13932"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>LSI Logic</b></a> (NYSE: LSI, recently $22.38) and <a name="NYSE:NSM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11058"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>National Semiconductor</b></a> (NYSE: NSM, recently $20.75). This latter chip maker broke into the black in 1993 after four years of deficits. With 53 percent of its revenues made overseas, the company is positioned to benefit from European and Asian economic recoveries. Its shares trade at only one times revenues, versus two to six times for a typical mid-cap. Smaller LSI Logic in Milpitas, California, which makes custom integrated circuits, trades at 0.7 times revenues. Annual sales growth is a healthy 16 percent for this company, which services the telecommunications and computer industry; Bhirud expects current earnings growth of 23 percent to gallop to 50 percent this year.<p>Also on Bhirud's list is <a name="NYSE:ODP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14308"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Office Depot</b></a> (NYSE: ODP, recently $34.88), the country's largest office-supply superstore chain, with an efficient distribution system that he says will contribute to 40 percent annual earnings growth over the next five years. At 47 times earnings, it's not cheap, but the stock is still just 1.3 times per-share revenue. "It's the same concept as <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a> but in a different industry," says Bhirud.<p><p>

						Why standing fast in stocks is often the wisest approach.<p>By Gerald Perritt<p>For more than three years the stock market steadily marched to higher ground. Then, in February, the Federal Reserve Board, fearful of a return of inflation, began to curb monetary growth and raise interest rates. That set off the stock market's first significant downdraft since the Persian Gulf War started in 1991. Now nervous investors are wondering: Should I stay in stocks, or should I go?<p>During market declines, emotion tends to overtake reason and large numbers of investors make the biggest mistakes of their investment lives. The overpowering urge is to dump stocks or equity mutual funds and retreat to the safety of money market funds and bank accounts. These urges are understandable. However, investors who act on them often lock in losses and miss profit opportunities when stocks eventually rebound. <p>Instead of selling during market slumps, history suggests that investors should put their fears aside. If anything, it's a good time for an investor to start bargain hunting, with the intention of making an even bigger commitment to stocks. Riding out a bear market certainly can be painful. But the rewards of moving to safer ground -- even when it's done with impeccable timing -- are far less dramatic than is generally supposed. What's more, standing pat can be far less damaging to a portfolio than the cost of missing a major upward move in stock prices.<p>Want proof? Let's consider an imaginary investor with flawless timing skills, one who was able to switch his money from stocks to Treasury bills during each of the market's five worst years from 1940 through 1993. We're assuming this investor exited the market completely and then put 100 percent of his portfolio back into stocks the following year. This strategy, requiring perfect foresight, would certainly have beaten the performance of the Standard &Poor's 500 index. But not by much. For all his brilliance, our investor would have earned a compounded annual return of 13.9 percent, compared with an 11.7 percent return for the S&P 500.<p>Now let's look at what would have happened to an investor who missed the market's biggest upswings -- switching his money out of stocks and into Treasury bills during each of the market's five best years. This unfortunate soul would have earned an average annual return of only 8.7 percent. <p>The lesson: There is more to lose by missing a bull market than there is to be gained by dodging a bear. And the easiest way to capture the profits provided by future bull markets is to remain fully invested in stocks over the long term. "Time cures a lot of things, including volatility," says Carl Gargula, managing director at Ibbotson Associates, a Chicago investment-consulting firm.<p>Still, the biggest fear investors have now is that if they were to buy stocks, they'd be plunging in at or near the top of the market. What could be worse than buying equities a day or two before the onset of a bear move?<p>Although it may seem counterintuitive, data show that buying at market tops is not as destructive to a portfolio's health as investors might think. Since 1940, the stock market has declined by 5 percent or more on 45 occasions. Thirteen of those declines exceeded 15 percent, and four exceeded 25 percent. In all, the stock market has spent 28 percent of that time in significant retreat. These declines have typically lasted four months, with share prices tumbling an average of 12.5 percent.<p>Here's where it gets interesting: The folks at the American Funds Group, a mutual fund firm in Los Angeles, recently did a study that illustrates what would have happened had an investor bought at the peak of the market not once, but every year for the last two decades. Consider a investor's portfolio in which $5,000 was invested in the S&P 500 index during each of the last 20 years on the day the market peaked for that year.  Each investment essentially lost money almost immediately after it was made as the market fell -- the ultimate in a worried investor's nightmare.<p>The surprise is that after 20 years, this star-crossed investor's portfolio fared pretty darn well. Nobody's wrong all of the time, but even our hopelessly unlucky investor would have earned a 13.7 percent compounded annual return. According to American Funds Group, the $100,000 this hypothetical investor would have put into the market over the 20 years would gradually have transformed itself into a portfolio valued at $465,397.<p>Given the astronomical odds against an investor buying at precisely the wrong moment 20 years in a row, you can bet that your own stock market performance would be even higher than this. <p>Of course, it's disturbing to see the value of a portfolio drop during a stock market correction. However, since stock market corrections are a fact of life, investors must learn to live with them. Avoid the urge to cut and run. It may seem like the safe thing to do at the time, but the long-term risks of missing an upturn are even more dangerous. Individuals who have the financial resources to do so should use stock market declines as opportunities to add to their portfolios, seeking out high-quality stocks for sale at discount prices. In the end, those who do will be much wealthier for their fortitude.<p><p>

This reality check might change your mind.<p>By Liliana Nealon<p>Newspaper headlines describing big paydays in currency trades have given many investors the idea that they too can venture profitably into the world of currencies. They could not be more wrong.<p>The almost $1 trillion-a-day currency markets are dominated by a few players, understood by even fewer. The average trade here is $20 million, making it difficult, if not impossible, for individual investors to make money in currencies. Unlike other securities, currencies don't just follow domestic economic trends; they also react to political and global events. Neither are they closely correlated to other markets. Currency markets behave chaotically and are incomprehensible to many. <p>What novices in this market often forget is that when you buy one currency (say, the Japanese yen), you always and inescapably short the currency you're investing with (the U.S. dollar). Investors who would never sell short a stock happily short a currency, believing they are just long deutsche marks or yen. In truth, they're selling dollars, risking a short position in one of the world's wildest markets.<p>To prove how wild and difficult to navigate these markets are, study the action in currencies during the month of March 1994. As February ended, traders expected that the Federal Reserve Board would raise interest rates (good for the dollar), Germany might again cut its rates (good for the dollar), and that trade friction with Japan would escalate. The dollar opened March trading at 1.6970 against the deutsche mark and 104.38 against the yen. <p>March 1 brought a two-month low for the dollar against the D-mark, a sell-off sparked by expectations that the Fed's tightening would not be as severe as expected. Given this new scenario, an investor might want to buy dollars against the D-mark, as the interest rate differential between the two currencies narrows in favor of the dollar, and sell dollars against the yen. Japan's growing trade surplus is a reason to bet on the yen even though the country's in turmoil with low interest rates and a sick stock market. A higher yen is the only way the U.S. can balance trade.<p>As the month proceeds, the dollar remains soft, against both the D-mark and the yen, losing even more ground against the mark when a member of the German Central Bank says no to further rate drops. <p>Now an investor would want to be short the dollar, long yen and the D-mark. During early March, those would have been profitable positions. But on March 4, the dollar rallies on news of stronger-than-expected nonfarm payroll growth in February, possible U.S. trade sanctions against Japan, and big dollar buying by the Bank of Japan. The buck closes 105.75 against the yen and 1.7186 against the D-mark. <p>With this volatility, most small investors would have been automatically closed out of their short dollar positions with substantial losses. Institutional dollar players didn't fare any better; large losses befell hedge-fund folks George Soros, Mike Steinhardt, and others.<p>Enter Whitewatergate. On March 9, the dollar drops to 1.7000 against the D-mark. It holds up against the yen at 105.25. By the ides of March, we're back where we started the month in both currencies. But low inflation numbers send the dollar down to 1.6885 against the D-mark. OnSt. Patrick's Day, the dollar drifts back up to 1.6920 against the D-mark until the Bundesbank says it won't cut rates. The buck falls to 1.6768. <p>On March 22, rumors that the Fed will indeed raise rates boost the buck. When the Fed actually signals its rate hike, traders buy, then quickly dump dollars, guessing incorrectly that the Fed is fibbing. Against the yen, the dollar goes to 105.80; against the D-mark, 1.6875.<p>On March 24, the dollar gets trashed, falling to 1.6640 against the D-mark and 104.28 against the yen. Traders now sell dollars as U.S. rates climb. Weren't these guys selling a few weeks back because they thought the Fed wouldn't tighten?<p>April 1 at last. During March, the dollar traded in an almost 4 percent range against the D-mark and a 4.3 percent range against the yen. But today, the dollar opens at 1.6744 against the D-mark and 102.65 against the yen, 1.3 percent lower and 1.7 percent lower, respectively, than it was on March 1. <p>Given the volatility of this market, most investors would have been scared in and out of their positions at exactly the wrong moments. You're better off in a money market fund.<p><p>

						Think electric-utility stocks still mean easy money? You may be in for a shock. Here's how to play this evolving sector.<p>By Manjeet Kripalani<p>Last October, shares in <a name="NYSE:UEP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11542"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Union Electric</b></a>, a utility based in St. Louis, were trading at $44, just under their all-time high. For the first time in 40 years, the stock had surpassed $40. A broker suggested to a client that she sell her 700 shares of Union Electric and lock in a not insubstantial profit.<p>After much back and forth, she agreed. A couple of days later she telephoned the broker, audibly upset, and ordered him to cancel the trade. She had owned Union Electric for years and just couldn't part with it. "How can you tell me to sell that?" she asked. "It's a great company." He canceled the trade. A month later, the stock dropped to $38. It was recently at $36.13.<p>"People are locked in with their utility stocks," sighs the broker. "They love them. It's like a religion." <p>Worshiping stocks can be hazardous to investors' health. Think of the folks who clung to <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> shares, all the way from $100 in 1992 to $52 today.<p>Nowhere in the stock market is this reminder more timely than in the arena of electric utilities. Investors still cling to these shares for the same reason they always have: steadily increasing income and stable stock prices. Electric-utility stocks are portfolio basics for conservative investors. In fact, according to the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), the Washington, D.C.-based association of investor-owned electric utilities, 6.5 million Americans own utility stocks.<p>But the rude truth is, electric utilities aren't what they used to be. The business of generating and selling power to American homes and businesses is changing dramatically; gone are the days when utility companies were simple monopolies that built and operated power plants, then recovered their costs with rates of return guaranteed by state regulators. Demand is growing far more slowly, and the number of suppliers has increased. The industry now finds itself in a competitive arena in which some companies will thrive and others will not. <p>Indeed, last fall, for the first time ever, Standard & Poor's changed its rating for 47 electric utilities from stable to negative, citing fears of a long-term decline for the group. Add to this the recent increase in interest rates, and it becomes exceedingly clear that investors must reassess their utility holdings. Immediately.<p>"There is no historical precedent to this period," says William Tilles, a utility analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. "The only time the industry saw such upheaval was in 1935, when the Public Utilities Holding Companies Act was passed." (With PUHCA, the huge interstate holding companies were broken up. The law was amended in 1992 with the Energy Policy Act.) As with any industry in flux, there will be winners and there will be losers. The trick is telling one from the other.<p>The forces of change short-circuiting the electric-utility industry date back some 16 years, to the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, which required local utilities to buy power from unregulated power generators, known as independent power producers, if the independents produced electric power more cheaply than the utilities could. Independents now account for 10 percent of the new capacity added annually.<p>That single law began the transformation of the utility business. Before 1978, utilities made money by building power plants; state regulators would then almost automatically figure the cost of that plant into the rate base. That meant rates would rise to allow the power company to earn a fair return on the new plant.<p>But in 1978 electric utilities were dragged, kicking and screaming, into a new world where they had to demonstrate that they were efficient producers of power. If a utility could buy power more cheaply than it could produce it, regulators demanded that the utility buy it. That cut down on the need for utilities to build new plants. Utilities couldn't simply grow larger by building another power plant, either. They now had to manage their assets. In some cases this had the desired effect of making the company financially stronger and lowering rates. But many electric utilities found themselves locked into unproductive long-term contracts, sometimes with pipsqueak independents. Desperate to get out of these arrangements, utilities entered into endless, expensive battles with the independents and state utility commissions. <p>At the same time, the steady growth in demand for electric power began to slow, further reducing the need for new power plants. Some of this decline was due to the increasing number of conservation programs utilities put in place over the last decade. Under pressure from state regulators, some utilities discovered that persuading their customers to use power more efficiently--by running plants and household appliances at off-peak hours or using energy-efficient lightbulbs--was more profitable than erecting new plants. In general, over this period, power-company revenues have declined, but earnings have grown. EEI estimates place that growth at 9.7 percent (excluding write-offs) in 1993. <p>Slower economic growth will also hurt utilities. According to the EEI, demand for electric power grew at a rate of 3.5 percent last year; for the next six years, the group expects demand growth to drop to 2 percent annually. And this comes at a time when the industry's average return on equity is already slipping. It fell from an annual rate of 13 percent five years ago to 10.5 percent currently.<p>There are no signs that any of these trends are about to reverse, either. Even if the much-discussed electric car gets off the ground, it is unlikely to produce much demand growth--just 2 percent of the vehicles in 14 states are mandated to be electric by 1998. Moreover, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act in 1992, which granted access on the nation's electric grid to wholesale generators--meaning independents and regulated utilities could both now sell their power to other utilities beyond their service territories. It is entirely possible that unregulated independents will soon be allowed to sell power directly to utilities' industrial customers. <p>These recent changes in laws and the economics of the business are so seismic that investors must rethink their investment assumptions. "No longer are utilities strictly owners of assets; they have become buyers of power," says James Doudiet, formerly chief financial officer at Northern States Power and Northern Indiana Public Service and now an independent utility consultant in Minneapolis. So utility investors must ask new kinds of questions. How efficient is management? Does the company have too many workers? Are old plants, especially aging nuclear-power plants, adding too much costly overhead?<p>So confusing is the scene that even the so-called experts can't agree on what investors should do: <p>-> Drop electric-utility stocks altogether, some advisors say. This option certainly can be a shock to investors who have long considered utilities the most dependable investments in their portfolio. And if they've owned utility stocks for a long time, investors may have a hard time facing the tax consequences of a sale.<p>-> "Hold," says Dean Witter, employing the bafflegab Wall Street is famous for. The brokerage firm believes the market has overreacted to the sharp recent rise in interest rates. The selling in utility stocks, it says, has been consequently overdone.<p>-> Ignore apocalyptic statements about the industry's demise--and buy, says Roger Conrad, editor of The Utility Forecaster in Alexandria, Virginia. "Electric utilities are good defensive stocks right now," he says. <p>-> Switch from utility stocks to electric-utility funds, says Edwin Bragdon, portfolio manager of the Eaton Vance Traditional Total Return Fund, which has $631 million in assets. Instead of being forced to choose between one or two stocks, investors get safety in numbers. Bragdon seems unworried about the effects of increasing competition in the utility industry. "We've had competition for 40 years, and it'll stay with us. It's the new buzzword that scares, just like nuclear was in the '80s," he says. <p>Last year utility funds beat the S&P 500's total return of 10.08 percent with an average total return of 14.7 percent. But Chicago-based Morningstar, which ranks thousands of mutual funds, believes that performance isn't sustainable. That's because roughly 10 percentage points of last year's gain came from price appreciation, and the remaining 4 came from dividends. And now that interest rates have started to rise, the prices of utility stocks are headed downward. Faced with nothing but mixed messages, investors have a right to be confused. <p>Begin any reassessment with a clean slate. Forget, first of all, about investing in utilities for the long term. Consultant Doudiet says that to make money in utility stocks today and in the future, investors must shorten their time horizon and invest for the medium term--a three- to five-year span. <p>Also forget about sky-high dividend yields. A focus on generous dividends has served investors exceedingly well in the past, but from now on they'd better concentrate on sustainable dividends. That's because companies that spend almost all of their profits making dividend payouts will in many cases be the least likely to succeed in the increasingly competitive energy arena. (For more on this, see "Stocks With Juice and Some Shocks to Avoid.") And ultimately, they won't be able to sustain those high payouts.<p>Here's why. Since demand growth for power is declining, utilities' sales growth will have to come from other operations. Utility companies most likely to prosper in the future are already diverting some of the cash that would typically go to shareholder dividends and putting it into other, nonregulated businesses. Note that these businesses are, in the most promising cases, energy-related. Utility companies learned their lessons from disastrous 1980s diversifications into unrelated areas like insurance and real estate.<p>Traditional utility investors looking solely for high current income should consider the utility's preferred stock, says St. Louis money manager David Eidelman. These issues are more like bonds than stocks; a company struggling to cope with diminishing cash flows may cut its common-stock dividend, but most are loath to cut preferred-stock payouts. <p>It is still early enough in the shift from income-only utility investing to an income-and-growth focus that investors can take advantage of the change. The industry's average dividend-payout ratio--the percentage of earnings a company pays out to shareholders--remains at a very high 82 percent. In contrast, the oil industry's historical dividend-payout ratio, for example, ranges from 50 percent to 55 percent. Look for electric companies with dividend-payout ratios around 60 percent--or, since numbers like that are still uncommon in this sector, ratios that are headed down. This information is easily found in annual reports.<p>Next, look for electric utilities that serve a wide geographical area--like Columbus, Ohio's American Electric Power Co., which serves customers in seven states. Companies that operate in several states are less susceptible to the rate-cutting whims of a single state regulatory body. <p>Avoid utilities that have a large nuclear exposure. Very few companies have the necessary reserves to withstand huge decommissioning expenses--what it costs to take apart a nuclear reactor at the end of its useful life and safely dispose of the radioactive pieces. Coal-dependent utilities also face a risk that's difficult to quantify: Federal clean-air rules could force the purchase of expensive equipment to reduce pollutants that cause acid rain.<p>But do be on the lookout for utilities with smart and aggressive managers. Without the comfort of regulated returns, these companies must be run more like highly competitive consumer-oriented firms. <p>Which companies are well placed to ride out the waves of change? <a name="NYSE:NI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11040"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>NIPSCO Industries</b></a>, a utility holding company in Hammond, Indiana, is one. A turnaround story, NIPSCO suspended its dividend in 1986 thanks to a nuclear plant that had to be written off and a payout rate that exceeded earnings. It now has a reasonable 59 percent payout ratio and several nonregulated businesses that will provide new growth. It owns, for instance, the 14th-largest gas-distribution business in the U.S. and co-owns a recently opened facility in the United Kingdom that will generate power by burning worn-out tires.<p>New Orleans's <a name="NYSE:ETR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10524"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Entergy Corp.</b></a> is a well-diversified utility covering four states in the South. It has a 61 percent payout ratio and is sitting on $564 million in cash. It recently completed a $2.3 billion merger with neighboring Gulf States Utilities, giving Entergy geographical dominance. Gulf States' coal-based generation will also increase Entergy's capacity by about 30 percent and help reduce its heavy nuclear dependence. Entergy took a write-off of approximately $1 billion on its nuclear operations in 1989. <p>Entergy is one of the few utilities investing in technology as part of its conservation program. The company has put several million dollars into developing the "smart meter." This will allow customers to monitor their energy usage more efficiently and will eliminate the need for meter readers. <p>Other utilities are following Entergy's lead into add-on services for utility customers. The smart meter and other new technologies will allow utilities to increase revenues even while rates decline, much like the telephone companies have done with extras like call forwarding and call waiting. <p>Like many U.S. electric utilities, Entergy went global last year, investing $90 million in three consortia of recently privatized Argentine electric power companies. With construction in the U.S. virtually at a halt, electric companies are stacked with excess manpower and expertise looking for projects. <p>But even the best can falter here. Most of the opportunities are in newly industrialized countries with limited infrastructure and high political and currency risks. The 25 percent returns that U.S. companies were counting on when they ventured abroad last year are now expected to be more like 16 percent--a mere 5 percent over domestic rates. That seems like a thin reward for taking on these added risks.<p>Eighteen U.S. power companies have invested abroad so far. Investors should stick with utilities that operate and build, rather than own, plants overseas. Kansas City, Missouri's UtiliCorp United was the first to go abroad--in Canada in 1987. The country's only family-run electric utility currently operates--but doesn't own--facilities in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand--all stable, English-speaking countries with business cultures similar to that of the United States. "We prefer not to venture beyond our area of comfort or knowledge," says Frank Costanza, vice president of the company's unregulated subsidiary, UtilCo. Foreign operations bring in 12 percent of net income.<p>In California--which sometimes is best viewed as a foreign country--San Diego Gas & Electric's innovative management has maneuvered ably through the state's troubled waters. SDG&E benefits from the presence of independent power producers: It buys 50 percent of its power on the open market. Last July, it sent a proposal to the California State Utility Commission to adopt performance-based rate making. This system would base SDG&E's allowed return not on capital invested but on its ability to keep prices competitive. If prices stay below a specific benchmark, stockholders and customers benefit; if not, both share the costs. The commission is scheduled to decide on the proposal this month. <p>Another criterion for today's utility investors to consider: Companies should be low-cost producers of electricity. Two of the best in this regard are Richmond, Virginia-based Dominion Resources and Portland, Oregon-based PacifiCorp, according to Ernest Liu, utility analyst at Goldman, Sachs. Conversely, Consolidated Edison Co., SCEcorp, Oklahoma Gas and Electric, Centerior Energy, and Texas Utilities are high-cost producers. Centerior recently cut its dividend.<p>Entergy, which otherwise seems a model investment, also sells power at an above-average price. At 6.8 cents per kilowatt hour, Entergy's industrial rate is far higher than the national average of 4.9 cents. But this cost should come down, thanks to smart acquisitions of nonnuclear energy providers.<p>Price wars between utilities won't do investors any good, either. Last year, Public Service Gas & Electric in Newark, New Jersey, won away a customer from Delmarva Power, considered the lowest-cost producer in the region, by offering a discount to win the business. Obviously, that discount ultimately cuts into Public Service's profits--and the amount of cash available for distribution as dividends to investors, too. Such price cutting also puts pressure on margins at low-cost producers, which are forced to lose the business or match the discount. Over the long term, investing in the low-cost producer is a better strategy, but that doesn't mean that investors won't feel some short-term pain as the utility industry works through its new economics.<p>Another warning: A utility with high exposure to industrial customers can be trouble. These big customers are the ones getting the discounts and are very good at cherry picking for the best deals among competing utilities. But be careful not to use this screen too simply. Long Island Lighting, for instance, has almost no industrial customers. However, high unit costs (16 cents per kilowatt hour) leave it vulnerable to municipalization, the political equivalent of a hostile takeover by the utility's customers. When this happens, the town becomes the owner.<p>While the economics of the power business have been changing, so too have some of these companies' chief executives. Members of the new breed are likely to be young--like UtiliCorp's 40-year-old head, Richard Green--and come from outside the industry. LG&E Energy's Roger Hale came from the telephone industry--first AT&T, later BellSouth. Western Resources' John E. Hayes came from Southwestern Bell five years ago. SCEcorp's John Bryson is a former lawyer and state water-utilities regulator in California.<p>Prior to joining Entergy in 1991 as its new chief financial officer, Gerald McInvale was CFO at Frito-Lay, a subsidiary of PepsiCo. Although his consumer-goods background may seem out of place, it is appropriate in today's complex utility arena. As McInvale says: "We don't count on regulators anymore. We expect to earn our way through the market. Instead of growth through a regulated return on equity, we'll have growth through cash flow."<p>Power sold like potato chips? Don't bet against it. What was once a corporate backwater is fast becoming an industry every bit as competitive as consumer packaged goods or personal computers. Investors should behave accordingly.

Worth magazine/Features<p>Mortgage Wars
When mortgage lenders battle over market share, home buyers can find great deals.<p>By Andrew Feinberg<p>Ready! Fire! Aim! The mortgage industry is going to war, and it's a fight that will benefit consumers. Examples: In the 12 states in which it operates, customers of Home Savings of America can now put down as little as 5 percent on a $300,000 mortgage, and Home Savings will waive the normally required mortgage insurance. Its rates start as low as 6.6 percent.<p>In Greenbrae, California, a mortgage lender recently offered a broker at Pacific Guarantee Mortgage a rebate of one full point - that's 1 percent of the mortgage loan amount, or $2,000 on a $200,000 loan - to get the firm's business. Other lenders have offered rebates of a quarter point to a half point.<p>In Fairfax, Virginia, George Mason Bank is offering home-equity credit lines at prime minus half a point for a line of $50,000 or more. The annual rate: 5.5 percent on owner-occupied homes.<p>Wait a second. ...  Aren't these developments contrary to the recent news about rising interest rates?<p>Well, yes, they are. Back on October 15, 1993, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was just 6.83 percent, according to HSH Associates of Butler, New Jersey, which tracks mortgage rates nationally. By March 18, the rate was 7.85 percent, and the prognosis is for more of the same. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages will be 8.1 percent by the end of the year, predicts David Lereah, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association.<p>Yet at the same time, mortgage lenders have stepped up efforts to gain, or hold on to, market share. They know that rising rates inevitably will slow new financings and bring an end to the boom that saw more than 10 million mortgages refinanced in 1992 and 1993. So they are striking back with a sale just in time for spring, the traditional peak of the home-buying season.<p>Unlike the deals that got the savings and loans into trouble in the 1980s, the mortgage industry this time around is trying to practice restraint. Thus, most of the bargains that lenders are offering focus on upfront terms rather than on cutting interest rates on 30-year loans. Lenders are stretching out payments and reducing the amount buyers must put down  - in some cases, to zero. Lenders have slashed introductory rates and then slashed them again. Points, the cost of getting a new mortgage, have in many cases disappeared. <p>Comparing all the new packages is time consuming, but certainly worth the effort. The skirmishing in the mortgage industry has also given borrowers more leverage. "Today's consumer is much more in the driver's seat than he has been in recent years," says Keith Gumbinger, an analyst with HSH Associates. "Especially if you have triple-A credit, you should ask, 'What can you do for me that's better?' Play one lender off against another. Realize that six months ago, there were 500 people at the lender's door ready to write contracts, and now there are only four or five."<p>Before plunging into the complicated task of comparing mortgage options, buyers should keep a few things in mind about the state of today's real estate market. Yes, home-sales activity has picked up, but clearly, housing prices haven't yet run away from would-be buyers. So there's reason for patience. Nationwide, the median price of existing homes rose just 3 percent last year, to $106,800. The median cost of a new home crept up 3.7 percent to $126,000. Prices will move up another 3.5 percent and 5 percent, respectively, in 1994, predicts Lereah.<p>Of course, national numbers don't always apply. In hot markets like Richland/Kennewick/Pasco, Washington (up 21 percent in 1993); Green Bay, Wisconsin (up 11.8 percent); Salt Lake City/Ogden (up 11 percent); and Boise, Idaho (up 10 percent), it may seem as if prices are leaping 3 percent a month. In Los Angeles (down 7.1 percent in 1993); Orange County, California (down 6 percent); and Hartford, Connecticut (down 4.1 percent), the bottom, apparently, hasn't yet been glimpsed.<p>A potential borrower who hasn't been in the market for a decade faces a bewildering array of new mortgage sources. For example, in 1987 the U.S. survived with only 7,500 mortgage brokers. By the end of 1993 there were 18,000. And in contrast to ten years ago, the industry is a lot less local. In 1984, S&Ls, by and large small local lenders, controlled 53.5 percent of all mortgage lending for one- to four-unit properties. But their share eroded to 19 percent by the end of 1993. Aggressive mortgage bankers, such as Countrywide Funding, which often operate on a national rather than local scale, now control 52 percent of the overall mortgage market. All those lenders mean that no market is too small for cutthroat competition.<p>"I was surprised how badly the lenders seemed to want my business," says a Maryland man who recently closed on a new home. He shouldn't have been; the battle lines are clearly visible - especially in realtors' offices.<p>"Every week now, 50 different lenders try to call on me," says Joan Reilly, manager of Coldwell Banker Realty Pros in Potomac, Maryland. "They're getting more aggressive about offering gourmet lunches, setting up cocktail parties, or just stopping by to drop off food."<p>And, of course, cheap money. "If Countrywide notices on a certain day of the month that we haven't done our normal amount of volume, they'll be on the phone saying, 'We miss your business,' and offering rebates," says Bob da Costa, president of Indian River Mortgage, a Vero Beach, Florida, lender. <p>Smart home buyers should take advantage of all this. "These days," says John Lucas, vice president with ARCS Mortgage, a Bank of New York company headquartered in Calabasas, California, "everything is negotiable." But everything is much more negotiable with some lenders. Generally speaking, it's easier to wheel and deal with mortgage bankers and mortgage brokers than with large banks and S&Ls.<p>Adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, are a place, however, where S&Ls are likely to be aggressive. Surviving S&Ls see rising rates and the end of the refinancing frenzy as their best chance to regain market share for ARMs, traditionally their strongest product. Adjustable mortgage rates are likely to stay artificially low this year, and the spread between adjustable and fixed mortgage rates has widened by an average of more than three eighths of a percentage point. <p>Borrowers looking for a bargain on rates might also check out home-equity loans. During 1992 - 93, home-equity lending lost market share to refinancings. In response, lenders have actually dropped home-equity rates. Instead of offering credit lines at the once prevailing rate of prime plus one and a half percentage points, many lenders are now dangling lines at prime.<p>The industry has also introduced a crop of exotic mortgage options designed to pull in business without cutting profit margins too severely. Some of these may actually be great opportunities for specific home buyers.<p>For example, a 40-year mortgage, a product just reintroduced in many markets, makes a home slightly more affordable in the short term by reducing the monthly mortgage payment. But the added cost over the life of the loan makes sense only for buyers who don't plan on staying put long and need the extra cash flow now. The monthly payment on a $200,000, 30-year, 7.75 percent fixed-rate mortgage is $1,433. For a 40-year deal it's $1,353. Over the life of a 40-year mortgage, however, the home buyer will pay $133,000 more. <p>Borrowers who want to keep their monthly payments down might also consider another alternative, the delayed first-adjustment ARM. These can lower the initial interest rate by 0.375 to 0.5 percentage points. Then, after a specified period, the fixed rate on this mortgage becomes adjustable. For example, a borrower might pay a fixed jumbo mortgage rate of 7.375 percent for ten years, after which the interest rate becomes adjustable at one-year intervals. On a $275,000 loan, using this alternative (called a ten-one because it looks like a fixed mortgage for ten years and then becomes an adjustable-rate mortgage with a rate that changes once a year) could save $13,800 over the first ten years - a great deal for a home buyer who can predict when the family will be moving on to another house.<p>A no-equity refinancing is another option that may be a good deal for the millions of homeowners who have the worst of both worlds: a high-rate mortgage and a house that has declined in value. Many of these homeowners lack the 20 percent equity stake traditionally required to refinance.<p>No-equity refinancings cost about one point more than prevailing 30-year rates, and while refinancing at 8.75 percent isn't everyone's idea of a great offer, it might be a godsend for people stuck with higher-rate mortgages.<p>Interest rates aren't the only rates that matter. Income taxes need to get factored into any decision about how big a mortgage to take, how little to put down, and what rate is best. Rising income-tax rates mean that carrying tax-deductible debt, such as a mortgage, costs less than it did last year. Making a somewhat smaller down payment makes sense, since the value of the mortgage deduction is greater this year. A buyer can actually afford a little more house because of changes in the tax code. Those same changes slightly diminish the appeal of 10-, 15-, and 20-year mortgages. But the tax code still hasn't made a 40-year mortgage a good deal for most home buyers. <p>No matter how how many numbers you've crunched, don't forget to check out the lender. Doing business with an obscure outfit offering a seemingly miraculous package may be asking for trouble. One quick way to check on a lender is to call your state banking department to find out about any recent complaints. (Checking out a mortgage broker is more difficult in the 13 states that don't require a broker to obtain a license.) Once the lender survives this initial screen, ask for the names and phone numbers of satisfied clients. Then roll up your sleeves and get ready to drive a hard bargain.<br>

Don't follow the so-called experts--they're lost, too<p>By Jonathan D. Pond<p>As an investment strategy, market timing has proved to be a loser. Yet it seems as winning as ever, pitched by self-professed market timers in newsletters, mutual funds, and timing services. These folks claim to have a system that spots market bottoms and market tops. It makes you wonder why they haven't left the timing business years ago and retired to their yachts on the Mediterranean.<p>Here's why: They can't afford to. According to data gathered by a publication that rates the timers, The Hulbert Financial Digest, only 2 market-timing newsletters out of 65 were able to beat the Wilshire 5000 index over extended periods in the 1980s. In 1993, timers did slightly better overall than the S&P 500, according to Hulbert, because of the large gains in gold, favored by timers. Still, most individual timers still lagged the index. <p>But, the timers respond, if they merely pull you out of the market in time to avoid large losses, your investments will profit accordingly. Even should they call the bottom right only half the time, they say, it'll save you from half the bear markets that ravage investors. Market timers make bearishness a specialty; as the saying goes, they've foreseen nine of the past four bear markets. <p>One fundamental truth has made buying and holding securities a sounder strategy than market timing: Over the long term, securities prices have increased. The market has concluded business down in only nine of the last 40 years. This means that if you did nothing but hold, you would be right three years out of four.<p>Selling at the wrong time--trying to time the market, in other words--could have proved disastrous. For instance, $1,000 invested in stocks over the past 40 years would have grown to $86,550, contrasted to only $8,670 if the money had been kept in Treasury bills. If you had missed the 34 best months for stocks, however, your $1,000 investment would have amounted to only $4,492; even T bills would have been better, according to Ibbitson Associates, a Chicago-based investment-consulting firm.<p>Does that seem like a risk-averse strategy for investing? That's how the market-timing services promote it; but investors who entrust their money to market timers probably will pay a stiff price for mediocre results. These services move you in and out of mutual funds depending on the dictates of the timers' systems. Typically, it will cost you 2 percent of the assets under management. Half of the fee generally goes to the market timer, who does all the work. The other half goes to your financial advisor, who initially selects the timer and subsequently has to explain why the performance is so poor. In addition, your money pays the usual mutual fund expenses.<p>But let's hear from a market timer. Here's a January 1994 memorandum, with performance statistics (above), sent by one market-timing service to financial planners who had steered risk-averse clients to it:<p>"Well, as you can see from the attached performance numbers, 1993 was a bummer of a year. Your clients' quarterly statements will be in the mail the last week of the month.<p>"Not much more can be said that hasn't already been said. We trust and fully expect that 1994 will get us back on the right path. The long-term performance numbers are still very good and we remain fully confident and committed to our market-timing program. <p>"The long-awaited correction has yet to occur, but we are confident that it is imminent. You may find some comfort in the fact that, from the few numbers I have seen so far, our 1993 performance is not out of line with other market timers. Although most have numbers slightly better than ours, none are anywhere close to the buy-and-hold numbers. It was just not a good year for market timing. It is interesting to note that in almost every case when our program had a poor performance year, the following year was a very good performance year. We can only hope and pray!"<p>Actually, smart clients can do more than that. They can take their money out.<p><p><p>

Indecisive investors love them. Successful investors don't.<p>By Justin Mamis<p>Investors in the stock market all too often try to win the brilliance prize: Buy at the bottom eighth, sell at the very top tick. Ironically, this need to be correct on the market or on a stock often leads to behavior that practically guarantees that the investment will go wrong.<p>An example: The use of stop-loss or limit orders when either selling or buying stocks. Investors in search of perfection use limit orders when they would like to buy a stock but don't want to pay the going price for it. When it comes time to get out of a stock, investors place stop-loss orders to sell their shares above the market price. Both actions are all about being right in the market - buying beneath the market and selling above it. The perfect trade.<p>Limit orders to sell appear particularly attractive now, given investor skittishness over high stock prices. This is ironic because limit orders tend to result in deeply imperfect trades. <p>The use of limit orders characterizes an indecisive, insecure investor. Is this the right time to sell? Is this the best price? No investor wants to be wrong, so hedging and hesitancy take over. Limit orders become the escape. <p>This is particularly harmful to investors' health on the sell side. When you miss a stock that you wanted to buy because you placed a limit order beneath the market, you have experienced only an opportunity loss. But when you miss out on selling a stock because it never quite reaches the price you want, you will encounter actual losses.<p>Late last fall, stockholders of <a name="NYSE:LTD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11471"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Limited, Inc.</b></a>, the retailing giant, might have noticed a few days of sagging action in their shares. The stock kept running out of steam just shy of its previous rally high of $24. Worried about this apparent weakness, an investor could have done one of two things: Sell outright, at the market, or place a limit order to sell on the next bounce, at $23. <p>As it turned out, there was no next bounce. The stock had been lagging for a reason: Sales were slowing at Limited stores. A few days later, the stock opened at around $17. It hasn't risen above $20 since. The investor using a market order to sell his Limited shares could have gotten something north of $22 per share. The investor using the limit order would still be holding the shares and carrying a loss.<p>By limiting the price at which he'll sell, the investor has compromised with his anxiety about not being right on the market. He has also let his fear of ending the transaction keep him where he doesn't want to be - in a weakening stock. This is equally true whether the reason for selling is to take a loss or to lock in a gain. Taking a loss is to surrender all hope. Turning a gain from potential to realized profit is to surrender potency. Once he has sold, an investor no longer possesses the powerful feeling that owning a rising stock provides. The act of selling becomes a form of dying, as the Elizabethan poets wrote. If die we must, why not do it at the exact top tick in the stock?<p>Why is it dysfunctional behavior to place a limit order to sell above the current price? Because the order will be executed only if the stock still has the ability to rally, a characteristic that makes it a stock worth holding. You can see in the Limited example how much downside vulnerability can fester in a stock that is unable to go up just that little bit more. <p>Missing a stock on the buy side is also dumb. You want to buy a particular stock, but you're not sure if you should act now. Is this the low? Should you wait for a dip? Entering a buy order under the market requires a desired stock to turn weak or to become even weaker than it has already been. It isn't smart to buy a weak stock. Using a limit order, you're guessing that you can pick the exact moment when a weak stock will revive. Not likely.<p>Some investors have a fetish about buying a stock at its low. It's as if they know something the entire universe of professional traders, money managers, and analysts doesn't: that such a stock has on that very day and price hit bottom. This can be disastrous. Think of how much money was lost, over the years, by investors thinking they were getting the low in <a name="NASD:WANG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12443"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wang Laboratories</b></a>, a stock that went from almost $42 to 25 cents. Instead, investors should pursue strong stocks. And these will probably not come back down to accommodate anyone's lower-than-market limit price. <p><p><p>

						For less than $3,000 you can bring Wall Street to your desktop. Here's how, in seven easy steps.<p>Edited by Jim Jubak<p>Every morning at 8:30 Tulsa time, as the new York Stock Exchange opens for business, a pajama-clad Bill Moore treads across the green shag carpet that covers the floor of his son's former bedroom and sits down at his <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> 486 computer with a cup of black coffee. He squints at his screen and logs on. <p>Moore hits F3 for news stories that might affect his portfolio. F4 brings up the prices of the 50 securities he watches during the day: short positions first, then long positions on gold, oil, medical, and other stocks. Another key connects him to Prodigy's on-line brokerage service. Moore, a 56-year-old entrepreneur and former CPA, performs this early-morning ritual faithfully. He calls it "saying grace over each stock." His daily devotion has earned him an average 14.6 percent annual return over the last three years on the $150,000 stock portfolio he manages electronically.<p>Welcome to the next revolution in investing. Wall Street doesn't have to be in New York anymore; it's just as easy to execute a trade or generate reams of analysis from a desktop in Manhattan, Kansas. After spending less than $3,000 on computer hardware and software, any investor can look at the same numbers the professionals do. "Whatever flag gives them the signal to buy or sell," Moore says, "I try to see it--and act on it--the same day they do. "The first generation of investing software brought mass-market products such as Quicken and Managing Your Money, two programs that let you put your checkbook on a computer, record stock purchases and sales, and calculate the value of a portfolio. But it's the second generation of software that promises to create the real revolution. Unlike the earlier programs, which did little more than help people keep track of their finances, these new programs are designed to make the user a better investor. They can create a portfolio and then test the mix to improve performance. They can search the universe of U.S. mutual funds looking for just the right balance of risk and reward or tear apart the trading pattern of any stock to find the right time to buy or sell. They can be programmed to follow a stock until it finally hits an investor's price-to-earnings target and then flag the stock as a buy. Right now, only a small percentage of all investors use these more powerful programs, but they've made a big impression among more experienced practitioners. More than 35 percent of the American Association of Individual Investors' 160,000 members use computers to manage their portfolios; more than 17 percent use them to analyze mutual funds.<p>Software programs like these once would run only on the powerful workstations that crowded the desks of brokerages on the Street. But the sinking price of computer power means that these programs will now run on almost any recently purchased IBM compatible or Macintosh. Consider what this means for the individual investor with the right software. No more buy or sell signals missed waiting for an investment newsletter. No more finding out crucial news only after the professionals have made their moves. No more thumbing through the stock tables in the Wall Street Journal to follow the price movements of individual stocks and then charting them by hand. <p>Performing any of these tasks is easy with the right software. But the number of choices is mind-boggling. There are more than 500 different investment programs for IBM compatibles on the market, nearly twice as many as there were two years ago. Macintosh users don't have such a broad range of choices; they have to make do with just 81.<p>We set out to fight our way through that jungle, separating programs that will make you a better investor from those that are badly designed, overhyped, too simple or too complex for the task at hand, or just plain wrong in the advice they give. This is the first time, we believe, that anyone has reviewed investment programs both as software and for the quality of their advice. Our team of four reviewers spent three months running more than 100 software programs. We measured each one on a portfolio of stocks, bonds, and funds to see which packages gave us an edge.<p>What follows is a step-by-step approach to becoming a computerized investor. Beginners can start with the simplest of the seven steps on the next page and discover software that will make them better investors right now. More experienced computer users and investors can dip into later stages to find more advanced help. We think even Bill Moore might learn a trick or two. 
--Carla Koehl<p><p>STEP 1: Getting started
Buying a computer is not unlike buying clothes for a two-year-old. At that age, kids are growing so fast that parents with any foresight buy clothes just a little bit bigger than their child needs today. It's the same with computers. Nobody wants to pay for power that will never be used, and no one wants to buy a machine that's just right now but might be too small in the near future.<p>So where do you start? Rule one: Don't base your hardware-buying decisions on the small print on software boxes. The program you want to run may specify that it "requires an IBM AT with 640K of memory, a hard disk, and DOS 3.0 or higher." That doesn't mean you should buy a machine with those precise specs. You'll need more power, and you'll want more speed.<p>Just ask Richard Maturi, who reviewed some software programs for this story. Maturi is an experienced computer user. He runs word processing, database, and spreadsheet software programs daily. We sent him only software that, the boxes said, would run on his machine. But two of the programs refused to load. The error messages kept saying his machine needed more memory. Why? Software manufacturers aren't out to deceive you, and they certainly don't want to sell you software that won't run when it gets home. But they also don't know anything about what software you already might have installed on your machine. In all probability, at least some of that software is using part of the available active memory (called RAM, for random-access memory), the kind that's called into use when you run a program. For example, almost every computer in the country now runs a screen-saver program--when you leave your computer idle for a while, flying toasters or swimming fish magically fill up your screen. Well, there goes some available RAM.<p>No machine works very well when pushed to its performance limits, and computers are no exception. Unless you really want to spend a lot of time loading and unloading programs and reconfiguring the machine's memory, get more RAM than you expect you'll need. It won't cost you significantly more, and you won't have to upgrade your computer when the next generation of memory-gobbling software comes out.<p>The hardware we recommend will cost about $2,000. If you are buying an IBM compatible--and the financial world is oriented toward the PC--go for a 486 that runs at a speed of at least 33 megahertz. (The first number refers to the generation of Intel chip the machine uses as its central processor; the second refers to the speed of the specific version of that chip used by this machine.) The price differential between a 486 and the slower 386 chip isn't significant anymore. If you are interested in a system you can brag about, buy a machine that comes with one of Intel's brand-new Pentium chips. Although it won't make a significant difference in running any of the software we reviewed, your friends will be impressed, provided you hang around with computer engineers. We suggest 8 megabytes of RAM. The difference between a 486 machine with 4 megabytes of memory and one with 8 is only about $200. <p>Graphics make comparing one investment with another easy, so get the graphics memory to run them--1 megabyte of graphics RAM will do. Buy a 14-inch color monitor--insist on SVGA (for an IBM) with a noninterlaced screen, and don't worry what the jargon means.<p>Get a 200-megabyte hard drive to store all the numbers you'll want to crunch. Nothing is more frustrating than having to reorganize three years of financial records because the data has outgrown the available space. Again, the extra cost for moving up from a 140-megabyte drive is minimal.<p>If you want to buy a Macintosh--not our first choice for investing applications--it will cost about the same. We recommend any Mac that uses a <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a> 68040 chip--that means anything in the Quadra line numbered 610 or higher. <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple</b></a> introduced a significantly more powerful chip, the Power PC, this winter. Anything in the older 68040 line can be upgraded to that chip for about $750. Right now it's important to make sure that the programs you want to run come in Macintosh versions. The Power PC, though, should be able to run programs written for IBMs at reasonable speeds. RAM and hard drive should follow the guidelines for the IBM. Eventually, you will also need to buy a modem--a necessity for downloading stock prices, for example. Same with a CD-ROM drive. But adding these later makes good sense. External add-on drives and modems work just as well as those that come installed in the computer at purchase. And faster devices are coming to the market every day. It's much easier to update an external device than one that's inside the box.<p>As any parent knows, sometimes it's wise to postpone a purchase until a child's a little older.<p>WHAT YOU'LL NEED:
--Computer: IBM compatible 486DX/33 (or faster) with 8 megabytes of RAM, 
1 megabyte of video RAM, and a 200-megabyte (or larger) hard drive, estimated street price $1,500; or Apple Macintosh Quadra 610 (or faster) with 8 megabytes of RAM and a 200-megabyte (or larger) hard drive, estimated street price $1,400.

STEP 2: Choosing a Fund
You've bought the computer and set it up on your desk. Now you want to do something with it. Chances are you've also brought home one of the mass-market financial planning programs that are often bundled with computers these days. In your excitement over the prospect of actually being able to organize all of your various accounts and expenses in one place, you might even be tempted to use one of these programs to make your first foray into computerized investing. Stop immediately. Before any of these programs can be remotely useful, you'll have to spend hours entering data. In fact, if you were as organized as, say, MECA Software's Managing Your Money requires you to be, you might not need the program in the first place. <p>So why not start off with something a little easier and more immediately useful? Like picking a mutual fund. To do this, we suggest one of our favorite programs, Mutual Fund Expert Pro Plus from Steele Systems Inc. No data to type in. Easy to navigate. Within half an hour you'll be digging out stellar investment candidates--and checking up on the funds that you already own.<p>Pop the first of two disks into the floppy drive and hit install. Wait a few minutes, remove the first disk, insert the second, and hit "Enter." When installation is finished, less than ten minutes and ten keystrokes later, the screen will ask you, "Load a mutual fund data file?" Hit "Enter" twice and the first 19 of 4,182 equity and fixed-income funds fill the screen (with data current as of the end of the previous month). Above the name of the fund and columns giving the objective, ratings for return, and risk are commands such as "Locate" and "Rank."<p>You can scroll through the list or ask for a report on a specific fund. How about the Strong Discovery Fund? Hitting "Locate" and then typing in "Strong Discovery" takes the screen to the fund, number 3,681 on the database. At the bottom of the screen, it says, "F7 for single fund." That key puts the entire history of Strong Discovery on the screen. Year-to-date performance: 22.99 percent. The five-year average annual return: Almost as good at 20.45. These are great returns. But look at the year-by-year numbers: That average includes just a 1.92 percent gain in 1992 and a loss of 2.74 percent in 1990. Obviously volatility is an issue here. Steele rates the fund a B on return but a D on risk. <p>That, of course, raises a question: What funds get an A on either return or risk, or both? The program allows you to screen the entire universe of funds. From the "screen" menu highlight "Five Year Average," ">" (the symbol for greater than, in case you've misplaced your old math textbooks), and "20.45." You'll discover that 72 funds beat the five-year return on Strong Discovery. Finding out whether any funds outperformed Strong Discovery and took less risk, as measured by beta, is just as easy. (Beta is a number that compares the volatility--the tendency to move up and down--of a specific stock or fund with the market as a whole. A beta of 1 means the fund is perfectly correlated with the market and rises or falls just as it does. A beta of more than 1 means it's more volatile--and therefore perhaps riskier.) Strong Discovery has a beta of 1.33. Of the 72 funds that bettered its five-year performance, 42 of them show a beta of less than 1.33. <p>Mutual Fund Expert also offers crisp, clear graphics that produce charts as easy to read as any software we reviewed. Pick any fund from the 42 now displayed on the screen, say, the Kaufmann Fund. Moving the cursor down to the name of the fund and hitting "Graph" in the command line brings a new screen into view. It names the fund and then gives two benchmarks. Specifying a five-year time period and simply hitting "Enter" brings up a graph of the fund versus the performance of the S&P 500 and the average aggressive growth fund. The Kaufmann Fund outperformed both indexes every year: $10,000 invested in that fund five years ago would have grown to $32,540 at the end of 1993. The same amount with the S&P would have reached just $19,749. <p>Of course, all you are going to get from the Steele program is a fund's past performance. The program won't give you a clue about when the conditions that led to that return will change. But all you need from this program is one good fund idea to pay for your entire electronic investment.<p>WHAT YOU'LL NEED:

No one program is going to do everything, although software developers keep marketing programs that promise just that. Right now it's pretty common, in fact, for the best program at tackling one investment task to come hidden inside a package that's pretty terrible at most other investment tasks. The best program we found for researching a stock is buried inside one of those do-it-all personal-finance systems that, on the whole, we think is pretty bad. There's an important lesson here, and you're smart to learn it early: When it comes to software, it's sensible to cannibalize. If a program does just one function well, it might be worth owning. For stock research, we suggest Reality's WealthBuilder by Money magazine, a software package that extravagantly bills itself as a "complete financial planning system." They should scrap the planning. That part of the program requires hours of entering needlessly detailed information and, after all that, spits out amazingly wrongheaded advice. It gave one of our reviewers, for instance, the questionable recommendation to put 10 percent in cash for a tax-deferred account, and its manual says, "Traditionally, investment advisors recommended that you keep between 5 percent and 25 percent of your investment capital in gold." Guess we talked to the wrong advisors.<p>Where WealthBuilder comes through is in the wealth of information it offers after you've learned to ignore all the financial-planning parts of the program. The basic version comes with stats on 2,500 mutual funds and 500 stocks (later, after you've bought a modem, you can download data on another 4,500 stocks through WealthBuilder). The numbers come from first-rate sources, Morningstar and Standard & Poor's, respectively. S&P also provides data on thousands of bonds, and Veribanc and the Bank Rate Monitor rate CDs and money market accounts. News comes from Dow Jones, Money magazine, and a wide sampling of other magazines and newsletters.<p>Keeping all this data up-to-date is easy with WealthBuilder, which boasts one of the easiest-to-use communications packages we came across. Clicking on the telephone icon gets a list of items available for update. Click on the arrows next to "Mutual Fund Quotes" or "Newspaper Updates" to tell the program to download the latest info in each category. Then click "Connect" and wait about five minutes. The program automatically dials (you've already given it the necessary information when you set up the program for the first time) and updates the prices on your machine before it hangs up. The program even gives you something to watch while this happens: hourly updates on the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq, along with such basic information as market volume.<p>When you enter the stock database, an initial alphabetical list gives basic information such as price-to-earnings ratio, yield, and stock price. By going to the "View" menu, you can request various other types of data--"Earnings," for example, gives the same alphabetical listing but now emphasizes estimated 1993 earnings per share, actual 1991 and 1992 earnings, the mean estimate among Wall Street analysts for 1993 earnings, and projected five-year earnings growth.<p>From here an investor can go in either of two directions. Interested in a specific stock? Wealthbuilder has access to all the information an S&P or printed analyst's report provides except for industry outlook and a recommendation on the stock. All you do is highlight the stock and go up to the "Research" menu on the command line and click "Report." Going the other way, an investor can sort the universe of stocks looking for buys or sells. For example, clicking just three times results in a ranking of the stock database by projected five-year earnings growth. From this beginning an investor could construct either more complex screens--high growth rates and low price-to-earnings ratios, perhaps--or just look at reports for any of these stocks.<p>For all its particular strengths and weaknesses, WealthBuilder also illustrates three peculiarities typical of investment software. General-purpose programs like this are usually harder to use than specialized software--for example, sorting mutual funds on this software is more difficult than on the best mutual fund packages. Second, while a program like this is limited to relatively basic information--and an experienced investor will want more--it still doesn't explain how to use the data that it does provide very well. For instance, what is the best screen to use for picking stocks? Only the most sophisticated and expensive programs actually spend much time explaining the rules of investing. And third, while the investing part of a mass-market package like this may be harder to use than is necessary, its user interface puts most of the more sophisticated packages to shame. No one will get bogged down loading WealthBuilder, figuring out how to start it, or using the communications software. <p>WHAT YOU'LL NEED

STEP 4: Designing a Stategy
There's obviously more to investing than picking stocks and mutual funds. Like having a strategy. But helping investors work out their investment goals is the weak link in computerized investing. Almost every portfolio manager we tested failed at the basic task of helping an investor define his objectives and figure out how to reach them with the least risk possible. <p>Take the new version of Microsoft Money, which hit the shelves in early February. It offers on-line banking and state-of-the-art features, called "wizards," that are supposed to "simplify savings and retirement planning." And very welcoming graphics: When you open the retirement planner, beach chairs and palm trees fill the screen. The weaknesses show up about six questions into the planner, when the program asks, "What is the current return on your retirement savings?" Once you've entered all your investments into the ledgers in <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>Money, you'll know this, of course, but all that effort won't get you where you need to go. It won't tell you what mix of investments--bonds, small-cap stocks, utilities, etc.--will give you the best chance at earning the return you need with the least risk.<p>To get that part of the answer, we ran two other programs, one from Frontier Analytics called Allocation Master--clearly designed and priced (at $795) for the professional financial planner serving multiple clients--and the other, a subprogram embedded in the 1994 edition of  Managing Your Money ($79.95). Neither is anywhere near as pretty or new as Microsoft Money. But both answer the important questions.<p>Allocation Master begins with a bare-bones first screen. No palm trees here, just a menu bar across the top. Click on "Efficient Frontier" under "Asset Mix," and the screen shows a graph charting risk versus return. A black line represents the points where maximum return meets minimum risk at all levels of return. Moving the red dot, which represents the current portfolio, to new positions on the graph changes a pie chart at the top that shows a recommended asset allocation.<p>The asset-allocation function in Managing Your Money is designed around the same theories of portfolio efficiency as the $795 spread. Someone using this program can't specify asset classes as precisely as in Allocation Master, but it does offer an extremely intuitive way to study market scenarios. <p>For example, we put our entire portfolio into big-cap stocks, then told the program to use data from 1986 to 1992 to analyze that strategy. The program indicated expected returns would range between a high of 40.4 percent and a low of minus 15.4 percent. Resetting the data to the 1972--1977 period--the time of the last great bear market in stocks--suggested investing in something else. The best expected return in that period was just 2.8 percent with a downside possibility of losing 30.1 percent. <p>An investor applying a mix-and-match strategy could use Intuit's Quicken ($69.95) to keep records, WealthBuilder to pick stocks, and Managing Your Money to allocate assets. Since data in each of these programs is electronically portable, you'd only have to input a portfolio once. Such a best-of-all-worlds system would cost only around $200 at current street prices.<p>WHAT YOU'LL NEED

STEP 5: Plugging in the Street
It's time to challenge wall street head on. The steps we've suggested so far should be enough to convince even the most confirmed technophobe that software can make anyone a more effective investor. Now how about running a program that has beaten some of Wall Street's best in head-on competition?<p>In 1992 the Wall Street Journal asked Macro*World Investor to go up against three human (remember them?) analysts in putting together a stock portfolio for the year. The program came in second, with a gain of 47.6 percent. Pretty impressive, but we wanted to find out just one thing more--how much did the human operating this software need to know to tackle this hotshot program?<p>To test Macro*World Investor, a $700 program that works by correlating economic and financial trends with the price history of a stock, we decided to evaluate a single stock in the portfolio of a hypothetical investor: 200 shares of Safety-Kleen Corp., a leader in the business of waste-fluid recovery from dry cleaners and auto-repair shops. Our investor bought her shares at $23.75 in January 1993. In November, the stock was down to $13.75. Should she sell for the tax loss, hang on, or buy more? <p>She's not starting from complete ignorance. From some of the software we've recommended already, she knows Safety-Kleen's recent price performance (down from a high of $29) and the direction of its earnings and revenues. Earnings have dropped, and revenue growth has slowed. This could be a fallen growth stock waiting for a recovery. Or the company could have hit a wall. The annual report claims that environmental violations--since corrected--are partly to blame, along with sluggishness in the U.S. economy and in Europe, where Safety-Kleen has invested in an expensive expansion. Management expects business on both continents to pick up. Should our investor believe management?<p>Macro*World has some advice. In fact, the program has screen after screen of it--seemingly every economic indicator can be crunched, bunched, sliced, or diced. For instance, under "short-term alerts," the first item is "capacity utilization." The program says there's an 88.9 percent chance that this U.S. economic indicator is headed up. As for Europe, industrial production in Germany is running at an extraordinarily low level. But fourth-quarter 1993 could be the low point for real growth in Germany's gross domestic product, Macro*World says. Looks like management could be right.<p>Next, our investor asked Macro*World if any of the macroeconomic factors it tracks have in the past accurately predicted changes in Safety-Kleen's price. It identifed six "leading indicators," ranging from initial unemployment claims to the domestic sales of trucks. Short term, the program was pessimistic on the stock, but the one-year forecast seemed promising: "The long-term trend is increasing over the next 12 months to $23.44."<p>Macro*World isn't a crystal ball. Sometimes, its correlations seem odd--the program found a connection between the exchange rate for the Italian lira and the price of Safety-Kleen--and it gives an investor only hedged recommendations; it never gives a simple "buy" or "sell." In this case, it noted that there was a 70 percent chance that Safety-Kleen would behave the way the program predicted.<p>Oh, by the way, our investor decided to hold on to her position. Safety-Kleen finished the year at $17.<p>WHAT YOU'LL NEED
--Software: Macro*World Investor
--Time Commitment: To install: 20 minutes. To get up to speed: Four to eight hours.
--Technical Requirements: Like most DOS-based programs, this requires very little memory: 512 kilobytes would be sufficient. Worth recommends an IBM 386 with EGA, VGA, or higher graphics card.

STEP 6: Timing Your Moves
Now it's time to wade into the deepest, murkiest waters of computerized investing: technical analysis, a controversial stock-picking method that has spawned a multitude of software packages. <p>Technical analysts, the soothsayers of the modern investment world, study financial entrails. Unlike fundamental analysts, who attempt to forecast stock prices based on such factors as sales and earnings, or econometric analysts, who work backward from the behavior of the economy, technical analysts study the trading patterns of stocks themselves. This method's adherents believe that all the information investors need to predict price movements is contained in past price movements. Detractors say the idea is nonsense. Sometimes, they'll admit, the predictions come true, but only because so many technicians are looking at the same signals. If enough people believe, for instance, that Tuesday's dip in the moving average is a sell signal, well, it becomes a sell signal. It's more reasonable to take the middle ground in this debate. Technical analysis does have its merits--the past movements of a stock's price indisputably contain valuable information about the mass psychology of the market. But technical analysis is certainly not the only method an investor should use. Checking market psychology before buying or selling--decisions that take into account fundamental and econometric factors--seems reasonable to us.<p>But the limitations of technical analysis are not why investors should reject most technical-analysis software. The problem is that most of it is useless to an investor who hasn't made a life's study of the field. What good is it to graph a stock using 80 indicators without understanding any of them? We're convinced that there are so many technical-analysis programs on the market because crunching large quantities of numbers and turning them into endless pretty graphs is exactly what computers are best at.<p>But we did find an exception--Equis International's MetaStock. It's not only one of the most powerful technical-analysis programs we ran, it is also the only one that might actually teach an investor how to use the methodology. MetaStock is scarily large--it eats a lot of memory--and expensive. The core program isn't cheap at $349 for the least expensive version. Add-on programs--Downloader ($195), Pulse ($249), and Technician ($249)--are each as large as any other whole program we tested. The Downloader is the only add-on most investors need to consider.<p>For once, all this power has made a program easy to use. MetaStock's tutorial will have a novice up and running in about four hours. A help feature tells an investor what the 80 predefined indicators that come with this program mean. But MetaStock is not merely for the novice. Users can track moving averages and draw trend lines for individual stocks or groups of stocks, such as all airline stocks. The program can apply any of the standard technical indicators or use one that an investor has created. The explorer feature can search the stock database for investment candidates. A test feature lets the user back-test any system he has designed to see how it would have done in the past.<p>Hindsight may be 20/20, but even so, it's rarely this clear. We decided to graph Merck's recent performance. The picture clearly shows how, from the end of 1992 to August of 1993, it sank from $45 to just below $30. Since then, it's bounced back to $35. The graph also shows that most of this retracing has occurred without any increase in volume. Running the momentum and the moving-average convergence/divergence indicators shows that this stock is currently in a mild upswing. Certainly nothing in these indicators makes the stock a screaming buy now, but an investor who had fundamental reasons for liking the stock would know that the current price is reasonable.<p>The Downloader can fetch price data by modem from CompuServe. Membership in the MetaStock Quote Club--$9.95 a month--gives an investor an 80 percent discount on historical quotes. Of the products that we tested that promised simple downloading from an on-line service, this was one of only two (WealthBuilder was the other) that worked without a glitch.<p>WHAT YOU'LL NEED:
--Software: MetaStock
--Time Commitment: Time to install: 30 minutes. Time to get up to speed: Four hours
--Technical Requirements: No use skimping on the memory or the power here: This needs an IBM 386 (a 486 would make life easier, as would a math coprocessor). Worth recommends 2 megabytes of memory and EGA, VGA, or higher graphics. Get a fast modem (9,600 baud) for updating data. Product comes on both 3.5- and 5.25-inch disks. Help line (801-265-9998) available 10 A.M.-7 P.M. (EST), M-F. 
--Costs: MetaStock comes in two versions--it's $349 for the one that uses end-of-day prices and $495 for MetaStock RT, which uses real-time prices. The Downloader costs $195 for a version that will use multiple data feeds. A version that will work with just one feed (Dial/Data) sells for only $69.

STEP 7: Knowing Your Limits
If, for $3,000, you can have access to all the information and all the processing power of a Wall Street professional, does that mean you'll automatically become an invincible trader? Sorry, it doesn't work that way. Better access to information doesn't necessarily produce better results. No matter how many megabytes you have sitting on your desk, technology will never take the place of brains, guts, and intuition <p>Nothing better illustrates the promise--or the limitations--of computerized investing than Telescan Analyzer. This is the most comprehensive product we tested. A Telescan user has tools to match any Wall Street broker. The product itself isn't expensive at the moment--Telescan is offering it for $12.75 in shipping--but on-line charges run $45 a month, even if you don't sign on until after 8 p.m.<p>Telescan provides both fundamental and technical data --more than 200 variables and screens in all, and an investor can use up to 40 of them simultaneously. Want to find technology stocks with strong cash flow, rapid projected earnings growth, and a recent price breakout? Telescan will provide a list ranked in descending order of attractiveness.<p>Retrieve news items from Reuters, UPI, the Business Wire, and more. Get S&P company reports and S&P MarketScope, which includes features such as "Touted on TV," complete with the latest sputterings of Wall Street Week, Dan Dorfman, et al. Or call up sample issues of 22 newsletters. An investor can even find complete insider-trading filings. Getting quotes, of course, is a snap, and a one-page screen in "Special Reports" provides a technical snapshot of almost any stock. <p>But the software won't tell an investor what to do with all this information. In fact, the glut of available data makes it even more imperative that an investor have a well thought-out and tested system. Otherwise, it's easy to imagine drowning in a sea of prices, services, opinions, and analytical tools.<p>Say you want to use Telescan Analyzer to research chip-maker Intel. You discover that Intel's price-to-earnings ratio has shown wide volatility in the past. Pull-down menus instantly deliver analysts' projections on future earnings. You can analyze fundamentals, such as profit margin, or look at 80 indicators that search for patterns in the movement of the stock's price. In fact, there are almost no practical limits on what you can find out about this stock--except for what it all means. <p>So before you dive in, subject yourself to a brief self-examination. It doesn't require fancy equipment, just a pencil and paper. Write down your top three financial goals and the time frame for each. Summarize your philosophy for picking an investment in a single paragraph. List the three most important rules for buying an investment, and then write down one rule for when to sell.<p>If you can't do these things, read, take classes, talk to more experienced investors, run a mock portfolio, and research why the stocks in it go up and down. Above all, remember that perhaps the only thing that's more dangerous than a little knowledge is an investor who thinks that wisdom comes in the box along with the software.<p>WHAT YOU'LL NEED:

For years, Eddie Trieber thought he was programmed to lose money. Then he learned to trust a computer.<p>By Curtis Lang<p>This is a belief system," says Eddie Trieber, practicing psychologist, attorney-at-law, and electronic investor, peering deeply into the screen of his <a name="NASD:GATE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16706"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gateway</b></a> 486 late one night. He's describing the sheer number-crunching power at his fingertips. "How else are you going to explain risking $10,000 on a couple of squiggly lines on a screen?" <p>Thanks to the numbers and graphs that march across his screen, in 1993 Trieber was up 28 percent, about 10 points better than  the Wall Street pros he hires to manage the majority of his portfolio. But don't think that his computer made him a genius overnight. It took years of hard work and spending too much money on courses, videotapes, investment newsletters, and hot lines before Trieber arrived at his disciplined computerized trading system. His story is a salutary lesson in the power and limitations of computerized investing. <p>"I love trading," Trieber says. "It's a challenge. There is a kind of self-discovery that goes on. It affords some sense of mastery over something that's essentially out of your control. I've got money in the stock market, and I want to feel like I have some relationship to how it's doing. The only way I can do that is with information."<p>Trieber spends an average of ten hours a week analyzing the stock and bond markets. He has systems at his Manhattan home, at the Greenwich Village office where he runs a private psychology practice, and at his Wall Street office, where he consults for corporations interested in enhancing employee performance. All day long, stock quotes come in on a 15-minute delay from Signal, a widely used quote service. At home each night, Trieber inputs the hourly Dow price data by hand into his system, a custom he carries over from the days when real-time data was extremely expensive. He downloads end-of-day information from another quote service, Dial/Data, which takes about ten minutes. <p>Then the real work of stock picking begins. Trieber begins by running through his database, which contains several hundred stocks and bonds and the indexes he follows. He applies nine screens, both to individual stocks and bonds and to representative market sectors and various indexes, between 80 and 100 times in all. "I like to look at the averages," he says, "but I also look at the stocks that make up the averages."<p>His two favorite analytic tools are MetaStock, which analyzes market trends, and TechniFilter Plus, which searches his database for the buy and sell signals he has programmed into his system. <p>When the system's working, it kicks out potential buys like <a name="OTC:WWTK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15134"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b> Weitek Corp.</b></a>, one of Trieber's most successful plays of 1993. At the end of 1992, Weitek, which makes accelerators, processors, and controllers for <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> PCs and <a name="NASD:SUNW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14833"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sun Microsystems</b></a> workstations, was down $1.42 a share for the year. Trieber decided to look at the stock  when it got a recommendation in one of the newsletters he reads.<p>A lot of investors might have decided to make an iffy buy like Weitek based on that mention alone. Trieber went with what his computer told him. When he took a look at the stock in May 1993, he focused first on price patterns and trading ranges. Graphing Weitek's price movement on MetaStock, he noticed that the stock, which had been languishing at around $7 a share, had recently moved up. Then, still using MetaStock, Trieber applied one of his favorite indicators of stock-price momentum, moving average convergence/divergence (MACD), a screen that measures the rate of change of stock prices. <p>When he ran the stock's price history through that indicator, he liked what he saw. "It broke out of its trading range, came back to the breakout point, and then you got a fresh buy signal," indicating a second attempt to move up, Trieber says. He bought the stock at $7.13, assuming that he'd sell in a few months. After starting to get sell signals from the MACD, Trieber sold out on August 17 at $12.50. The stock topped out at $14.38 in mid-September. Recently, it traded at $8.68. <p>Trieber wasn't always such a successful or disciplined investor. In fact, before he discovered the PC in 1986, he regularly lost money in the stock market. He's convinced that he was psychologically programmed to lose. "It started when I was about eight years old," Trieber says.<p>Trieber's father ran a service station in the Bronx. In his family, his mother always handled the family finances. Her forays into the stock market ended woefully; despite the fact that she invested early in such eventual winners as Texas Instruments, she wound up constantly losing money. Her broker regularly churned her account, leaving her with less and less money and leaving Trieber with a lingering feeling that he had to make up for her bad luck.<p>Trieber himself started investing with just $2,000 in 1966, allowing his broker to pick stocks for him for the next four years. "I was convinced I'd lose money, actually," Trieber says. "Just like Mom." But he didn't realize this consciously until a broker pointed it out to him in 1970. The broker, who was racking up small gains for Trieber, told his client that he had a nervous habit of selling too quickly or, more often, too late. It was as if Trieber expected to lose and thus set himself up for failure. The observation rang true to Trieber and angered him. "My mother lost money, so I was determined to make it back," he says.<p>In 1980, Trieber, then 34, began trading intuitively. Unfortunately, his gut feelings tended to produce nauseating drops in the value of his portfolio. For the next five years, he lost $5,000 to $10,000 annually. One year he even speculated on commodities. Three months later, he was down $36,000. By the mid-1980s, he finally decided he needed help. His emotions were getting in the way of his ability to trade wisely, so he turned over the bulk of his portfolio to professional managers. The smaller portion of his portfolio he would manage himself.<p>Around this time, Trieber got to know Gerald Appel through a psychological association that both belonged to. Appel had published articles on the technical analysis of bonds and was developing a system for trading mutual funds. He introduced Trieber to technical analysis and became the first of his instructors on investing. "You develop a system and you follow it rigorously," says Trieber. "I learned that from Jerry."<p>Eight years later, Trieber has come a long way from the days when he constantly panicked himself into bad trades. He still subscribes to numerous investment newsletters and hot lines, and he still takes courses on investing -- not in an effort to discover a new system but out of a desire to hone the one that works so well for him. "I think that people should learn certain basic tools and use them over and over before they go and learn something else," he says. He's also aware that his computer can offer too much of a good thing. "The mistake most people make is they use too many indicators" in an effort to validate their buy and sell decisions, Trieber says. "This is very personal. Everybody has to find their own way."<p>That doesn't mean that Trieber goes it alone, however. Early every morning he calls one of his brokers, Seymour Teman of Bear, Stearns, to compare notes and chart a daily trading strategy. <p>Pretty sophisticated for an investor once programmed to fail.<p><p>

						Seduced by get-rich-quick promises, investors once again are flocking into the volatile world of commodities trading. Heres why most will get...<p>By Scott McMurray<p>The thousands of years in which humankind has speculated in commodities should have (but havent) produced a rule that goes something like this: If it trades in a pit, forget it. As far as ordinary investors are concerned, commodities futures are a losing proposition. The odds of being one of the few who do make a bundle are just too ridiculous. Commodities are the stuff of the investment worlds original less-than-zero-sum game. Think of it this way:  If a futures market consisted of just two traders, one going long against the others shorts, eventually both would end up broke.<p>Unless, of course, fresh money gets thrown into the pit. And that, folks, as Ross Perot might put it, is where you come in.<p>Commodities markets are curious and arcane places. Most people with an interest in money have at least heard about them as arenas where high-stakes bidding takes place over relatively mundane things like wheat, heating oil, pork bellies, and money itself, in the form of contracts to purchase foreign currency or Treasury bonds. Professional commodity traders stand on the steps of pits where the action resembles the inside of a popcorn machine. The traders yell and signal to one another to buy or sell contracts. The contracts set delivery of the commodities for a future date, which is why commodities are also known as futures. <p>Beyond that, however, outsiders often have a great deal of difficulty grasping exactly how these markets operate. In some ways, thats a good thing, because it stops a lot of people from ever even trying to trade commodities in the first place. Others, however, just cant resist the urge. The lure of huge profits or the desire to play with the big boys eventually draws them in. <p>Today, there are three ways individuals can venture into the futures markets. They can use a discount broker, hire a manager to handle their account, or buy into one of several types of pooled funds offered by the big financial-services companies. Which vehicle investors choose essentially depends on whether they prefer quick and dramatic losses or a slower chipping away at their principal. 
Currently, financial marketers are touting the so-called managed commodities (or futures) accounts and fundsthe trendiest way to invest in futuresas the hot new way to get roasted in the markets. They dont say this, of course. They call it the undiscovered investment of the decade. The occasion is the prospect of the first sustained boom in commodities since the early 1980s.<p>This boom has occurred because many investors now believe that the easy money in stocks has already been made, or they have grown impatient with the plodding action in the bond market. So they are increasingly turning to commodities, which at least promise some excitement. Example: In November of 1992, when Dean Witter, Discover & Co. opened its Select Futures fund to new investors, the brokerage firms marketing people thought they might raise as much as $100 million in three months. Five days later, the fund had hauled in $115 million. Over the past three years, the amount of money entrusted to managed futures accounts and funds has nearly doubled, to $25 billion. Managed futures funds hardly pose a threat to the U.S. stock market, capitalized at $4 trillion-plus, but, says Patrick Arbor, chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, Weve barely scratched the surface in terms of the potential growth for managed futures. <p>The growth is taking place despite the dismal track record such funds have had in the past. A few publicly held futures funds were organized in the early 1980s; most lost money and closed, and those that survived have barely hung on. Four public funds started by Thomson McKinnon between March 1979 and December 1982 began trading with total assets of $20.3 million. By the end of last year, losses, commissions, and investor withdrawals had reduced the figure to $1.5 million. <p>Fresh money, however, obviously doesnt pay much attention to history. Some of it is coming from people who think of themselves as investors and are hoping to hedge their securities portfolios. Their thinking goes something like this: Since commodities tend to rise in price when the securities markets fall and vice versa, why not balance their stock portfolios with a futures fund? If inflation jitters push stocks down, commodities will rise because they are among the costs that create consumer price inflation. The problem is that its really not possible to consider yourself an investor and be a player in the commodities markets at the same time. Hedging rationales aside, playing the futures game ultimately boils down to a short-term bet on the direction of prices, up or down. That, by definition, makes anyone who joins the game a speculator, not an investor. <p>DO-IT-YOURSELF LOSSES<p>Dentists may be able to pick the winners among toothpastes, but four out of five dentists in the futures markets get pasted themselves. Most doctors also lose money, and so do lawyers, accountants, architects, self-employed businessmen, farmers, and pensioners. It doesnt matter a whit how successfully they have invested in securities or real estate. Even professional commodities brokers and fund managers will tell you its a suckers game.<p>This is not to say that the government should shut down the commodities markets tomorrow on the grounds that they serve no purpose other than to make their own members rich. The commodities markets play an important, even critical, role in the marketplace, and even speculation in commodities has usually served useful economic ends. For users and dealers in goods as diverse as soybeans, copper, gold, lumber, sunflower seeds, and cash, buying or selling their goods for future delivery permits them to stabilize costs. The gains or losses on their futures contracts offset their gains or losses on the physical commodities they own or will need to buy. Their transaction costs amount to an insurance, or hedging, premium. Speculators provide the grease that helps make these markets work. They help make the hedging possible by taking some of the risk that hedgers wish to eliminate. Far from being an evil, the risk in speculation is the reason for its existence.<p>The risk, however, isnt something that an investor with any instinct for self-preservation should want to take on. Our own numbers show that 90 percent of individual futures traders eventually lose money, says John Frawley Jr., president of ML Futures Investment Partners, a subsidiary of <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>, the nations largest brokerage firm. Its not a pretty picture. <p>Discount brokers who earn much of their income from individual commodities speculators, and therefore have an interest in getting individuals to speculate, share this bleak view. Nine out of ten discount customers in the industry lose money, says Steven Greenberg, president of Alaron Trading Corp. Its very unfortunate. William Mallers Jr., president of the Chicago futures-trading firm First American Discount Corp., says 80 percent to 90 percent of his firms 9,400 customers have lost money trading futures, and they keep losing it. Our customers are mostly hobbyists, says Mallers. They almost ask for these odds.<p>But wait: If there is a winner and loser on each side of a trade in the commodities game, then why arent the odds more like one to one?<p>The answer:  Transaction costs. These are commissions, largely, and they keep the odds in the houses favor. Futures contracts expire and new contracts begin trading every few months; new contracts generate fresh commissions. The market is inherently volatile, and traders have to buy or sell frequently in order to cut losses or realize gains. If a broker is trading an account for a customer, regulators dont consider that the account has been churnedexcessively traded to generate commissionsunless the commissions reach about 18 percent a month of the customers equity. At that rate a customers cash can easily disappear within six months.<p>Commissions take such a huge bite that they can neutralize even a big gain. Last November, for instance, First American Discounts futures customers appeared to have had a great month, trading for an overall gain of $1,041,292 on 28,353 contracts. Before commissions, that is. After commissions, which averaged about $25 per contract, plus other transaction fees and surcharges, the original gain shrank by 76 percent, to $248,768. And First American is a discount broker. At a full-service firm, the commission bite could have run 50 percent to 100 percent higher, in which case the investors would have taken a loss, despite their remarkable success on their trades.<p>If commissions alone dont kill you, leverage will. Futures trading requires sufficient equity to make good-faith deposits of 2 percent or 3 percent up to 15 percent of the value of a contract. Futures exchanges set this requirement in the expectation that it will cover at least a single days change in the value of the contract. In contracts for pork belliesuncured baconthe required deposit is a fixed amount per contract that works out to about 4 percent of the price. Thats a leverage ratio of 25 to 1. Thus, should the underlying commoditys price drop 4 percentsomething that might happen in the course of a normal days tradingthe speculators margin could be wiped out. On the other hand, a 4 percent price jump would double that equity. <p>So who risks these odds? The typical amateur tends to be an investor who has made some money in securities and real estate and decides to put some money in futures, say $50,000. The investor finds the leverage appealing, thinking of it as a tool that could provide huge profits very quickly. The following scenario is hypothetical but hardly atypical:<p>Our speculator isnt necessarily unsophisticated. He has studied several price charts and decided the trends are pretty obvious; no need to pay someone for no-brainer research, so he opens an account with a discount broker and buys 50 pork belly contracts on margin for $1,000 each. Each contract is for 40,000 pounds of uncured bacon. At 55 cents a pound, the contracts are worth $22,000 each, a total value of $1.1 million in contracts secured by his $50,000 equity on deposit.<p>Within minutes of his buying, prices in the pits begin to diverge from the path his charting signaled, and pork bellies end the day down their daily limit of two cents a pound. The bullish trend seems to have ended. Why? Nobody knows for sure. There are rumors that the government has underestimated the number of hogs being readied for slaughter; that, of course, would increase the supply of bacon and bring the price down. Should our speculator sweat two cents a pound? After all, he held on to his real estate for two years before it paid off. But this is different. That two cents a pound means that each contract is now worth $21,200$800 less than at the beginning of the day. Since he owns 50 of these contracts, hes out $40,000. At this point, it would be unwise for our investor to hold his position; another two-cent drop at the opening the next day would wipe him out. So he sells his contracts at the close, paying $1,000 in commissions. His original $50,000 stake has been chopped down to $9,000. All this between 8:45 a.m. and 1 p.m., trading hours in the pork belly pit.<p>Back at his charts, our speculator wonders how he could have been so stupid. Clearly, last weeks chart showed a head-and-shoulders pattern he should have seen before, signaling a turn that he should have waited out. Two days later, convinced that the upward trend has resumed, he buys nine contracts with his $9,000. Again, for reasons that seem hazy, the market plunges and closes down the limit. After a trading loss of $7,200 and commissions of $225, he is now down to $1,575. Of course, if he had instead decided to hold on to his original losing position, he would have been required to deposit $30,000 in additional margin, increasing his potential loss to $80,000.<p>These are very unforgiving markets, says Patrick Arbor. Failure is punished, and punished severely.<p>CANT ANYONE HERE PLAY THIS GAME?<p>Even casual readers of the business press have heard of the megastars of the futures game, traders such as Paul Tudor Jones, John W. Henry, and Monroe Trout. These are the bright lights who have spun fabulous fortunes out of paper-thin margins. So some investors inevitably conclude that the real trick to playing the commodities game is to put their money in the hands of one of these guys. Sound good? <p>One small problem: They probably dont want anything to do with you. Jones and Trout havent taken on any new accounts in a while. Henry will let you in the door, but only if you are willing to risk $1 million of your equity. And then theres a second drawback to professional management, and it makes the first one actually look pretty good: Most professionals cant beat the futures markets over the long term. According to Martin J. Gruber, a New York University finance professor and analyst of the futures markets, a study of past data suggests that at any given time no more than a few dozen of the industrys 2,500 commodities-trading advisors can be expected to have managed a series of consistently winning trades. A trader may have a hot hand for a while and may attract scads of new cash, but sooner or later, the phenomenon of regression to the mean rears its ugly head; the high performers winning streaks turn to averageor worseand new investors feel as if theyve been taken. <p>Take the case of Richard Dennis, the erstwhile mega-trading legend of Chicago. He started with several thousand dollars in the mid-1970s. Within a decade, he was worth nearly $200 million. By 1984, he was so convinced that he had figured out the commodities markets that he began teaching his techniques to neophyte traders, dubbed turtles by their rivals in the pits. <p>In retrospect, one thing can be said for Dennis: He was a great teacher. Among advisors with more than $10 million under management last year, the three top performers were all Dennis protgs. But Denniss own fortunes began to turn in late 1987. By early 1988, two of his funds had taken sickening plunges, losing more than $50 million, or nearly 50 percent of his investors money. After settling investor lawsuits against him for reckless trading, Dennis started trading for customers again in 1991. He had a 42.6 percent gain that year, according to Managed Account Reports, a service that tracks managed futures accounts. Between March and August of 1992, however, the customers money dwindled to $40.5 million from $86.5 million. Then, according to people in the futures business, a large corporate investor withdrew from a Dennis fund. By the end of September 1992, Denniss funds under management amounted to only $2 million, and he ranked 275th out of 284 trading advisors whose performance was tracked by Managed Account Reports.<p>Last year, he recovered somewhat, but only after making his clients swoon. By the end of May, he was reduced to trading just $84,000 in customer money. He ended the year with $261,000 in customer money under management. <p>Robert Kogen, president of L. Lawrence Products, a manufacturer of eyeglass and earring accessories in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, says he lost all of the $10,000 he invested in a Dennis fund in 1988. I knew that futures can be treacherous and volatile, he says. The appeal was that Dennis supposedly had a system that allowed him to limit the downside and maximize the upside. That turned out not to be the case. Kogen has now sworn off futures.<p>LISTENING TO MOMS<p>Are there people with foolproof trading systems? Not exactly, though consistently successful advisors do share one trait: They manage cash as if it were the rarest of commodities, rarely risking more than 20 percent of their customers money at a time and keeping the balance in Treasury bills or other cash equivalents. As a rule, responsible advisors wont chance more than 1 percent of the total they manage in a single position; the less money they leave on the table, the longer they stay in the game. <p>Among the 2,500 trading advisors around, many accept accounts in the $10,000-to-$25,000 range. Most of the established advisors charge management fees of 2 percent to 6 percent of account assets a year, plus 15 percent to 20 percent of quarterly profits, if any. Customers also pay commissions, usually somewhat above the rate charged by discount brokers. To attract customers, however, some managers of small accounts waive a management fee.<p>A firm called Alaron is typical of the industry. Housed in cramped offices above Chicagos Lyric Opera, the firm made its name by specializing in pork belly futures. It is run by two brothers and a sister, Steven, Michael, and Carrie Greenberg, who virtually grew up with pork bellies. Their father, Joel, has traded them for more than 25 years, and he used to talk bellies with the kids around their Winnetka, Illinois, dinner table and hold mock trading sessions in the family hot tub. Steven Greenbergs trader-identification code, which appears on the badge that admits him to the pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, is oink. Last year, it should have read ouch.<p>In less than two weeks last July, the equity in Alarons customers accounts swooned by 57 percent. The Greenbergs had made a huge bet that pork belly prices would fall last summer and sold the futures. When pork belly prices rose instead, several months worth of trading profits were wiped out.<p>The Greenbergs say they learned their lesson. They changed their trading strategies, mainly by expanding their activities in markets other than pork bellies. They also hired a professional meat-industry analyst to help them. A late year-end rally allowed them to recoup customer losses. <p>In a field where even pros like the Greenbergs suffer staggering losses, there is obviously no science to picking a reliable advisor. Nonetheless, the industry wants to help you. Just find yourself a MOMa manager of managers. MOMs provide a variety of accounting, administrative, and other services to traders and advisors. Three such MOMs are Kenmar Advisory Corp. of New York, Rand Financial Servicesa wholly owned subsidiary of Monroe Trouts trading fundand Peters Capital Management of Chicago. Firms like these analyze customers risk tolerance and other characteristics in order to match them with compatible traders. Esther Eckerling Goodman, senior executive vice president of Kenmar, concedes that this process can be hit-or-miss. As an industry, she says, we need to do a better job at predicting future performance based on past results. This is a tough job, considering the unreliability of past results.<p>John Welsh, senior vice president at Rand Financial, educates smaller customers about the risk of losing all their money. As a MOM, he tells them not to put more than 10 percent to 15 percent of their investable assets into futures. Then, if theyre still game, he often encourages them to consider one of the smaller managers that Rand tracks. <p>Fundamental Trading is such a firm, one that Welsh identifies as a rising star. On the 14th floor above the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Jeffrey Kaplan, Fundamentals sole proprietor, keeps an office on one side of a hallway leading to another traders office. He shares a desk in the hallway with two other futures traders.<p>Kaplan, 41, has the gravelly voice of a trader who paid his dues on the Merc trading floor shouting out orders. After 13 years there, a ruptured spinal disc, and a broken marriage, he gave up the pits in 1991 to go upstairs to trade via video screen and telephone (in the securities and commodities markets, traders off the floors and out of the pits are always upstairs, even if they work in a basement). Rand Financial processes his trades and brings him retail customers.
Welsh is high on Fundamental because Kaplan follows one of his favorite maxims: Plan your trades and trade your plan. As the name of his company suggests, Kaplan makes most of his trading decisions based on whats known as fundamental news, ranging from government crop reports to central bank actions to raise or lower interest rates, as opposed to following or trying to anticipate price trends in markets. Last year, assets in Kaplans managed accounts rose by 73 percent; in 1992, they were up 24.5 percent. But a review of Kaplans disclosure document, sent to all customers, shows how rocky the going was. Kaplans accounts were down roughly 60 percent for the year at the end of March, following sizable back-to-back monthly losses. He quickly rebounded and had accounts back to where they had started the year by June.<p>Most of the percentage gains in Kaplans accounts over the past two years came from trading less than $100,000 in customer funds. Additional customers, some provided by Rand and others attracted by Kaplan, boosted the end-of-1993 equity in customer accounts to more than $1 million. Welsh makes no apologies for steering small customers to small traders. Everybody wishes he wouldve put money with Paul Tudor Jones when he was just getting started, Welsh says. Besides, he observes, its a futures-market truism that traders tend to have their best years when they are managing relatively small amounts of money.<p>WALL STREETS ANSWER<p>For as little as $5,000, any one of wall Streets leading financial packagers can put investors in a managed public futures fund, technically a limited partnership. Interests in these partnerships are pooled and placed with one or more professional managers. The partnership structure limits the risk to the money a partner has invested; hell get no margin calls. (Many funds are liquidated automatically if total equity drops to 50 percent of the initial amount placed in the fund.) Another popular type of fund, called a guarantee fund, aims to ensure that investors will at least get their money back.
Sound good? Maybe so, if your idea of fun is to read through mind-numbing disclosure documents that may run 200 pages long. I dont see how any investor can make an informed decision [after reading disclosure documents], says Michael Harkins, a principal at Peters Capital Management, a manager of managers. Its almost as if the government is encouraging public customers to open their own account and speculate in futures.<p>But its not just the disclosure documents that may prove daunting. Wall Streets version of one-stop futures shopping is not cheap. After paying brokerage, management, and incentive fees, investors in the Dean Witter Select Futures Fund, for instance, need to make 12.16 percent a year just to break even. That doesnt count redemption charges of 3 percent, 2 percent, or 1 percent for customers yanking their money out after one year, a year and a half, or two years with the fund.<p>Even though managed futures funds now carry much lower expenses than they did a decade agoyearly charges of 19 percent and 20 percent characterized many of the early fundsthe average futures fund is nonetheless a substandard investment vehicle. Public funds have produced an average annual return of about 9 percent since mid-1984, according to an index of public funds tracked by Managed Account Reports. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, by comparison, has averaged 17.7 percent a year since then, according to Lipper Analytical Services in New York.<p>About three fourths of the futures-fund expenses goes straight to the brokerage houses. Dean Witter Select Futures lets brokerage commissions take as much as three fourths of 1 percent of fund assets a month, or 9 percent a year. This money doesnt leave the Dean Witter fold. The general partner and operator of the Select Futures fundand all Dean Witter fundsis Demeter Management Corp., a subsidiary of Dean Witter, Discover & Co. It pays commissions directly to Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., the broker subsidiary of the parent. Through mid-1993, the fund had generated $10.8 million in commissions and other transaction fees for Dean Witter Reynolds.<p>Like other broker-sponsored funds, the Dean Witter fund acknowledges this and other conflicts of interest, noting in its prospectus: Because both the General Partner and DWR are subsidiaries of the same parent entity, DWRs brokerage commissions outlined above have not been agreed upon in arms-length negotiations. A few pages later the prospectus even points out that most brokerage customers with more than $1 million in assets pay commissions at negotiated rates which are substantially less than the rate paid by the [fund]. To defend such lucrativeand completely legal self-dealing, the prospectus argues that Dean Witter isnt as bad as some of the brokerage firms out there: The General Partner believes that the brokerage commissions charged the partnership are less than the brokerage rates charged certain other public commodity pools.<p>Still, the Dean Witter fees are a bit rich, at least compared with newer public funds. Merrill Lynchs Global Horizons fund, launched in January, charges 7.5 percent a year for commissions. (In return for lower upfront commissions, however, ML Futures Investment Partners gets a share of profits.) Merrill Lynch estimates that the fund still needs to make 10.4 percent in the first year to break even, excluding early-redemption charges, according to the prospectus. Merrill Lynch officials said they couldnt comment on the fund beyond whats included in the prospectus because it remains open for investment.<p>The balance of the annual charges to the Dean Witter fund are about average for recent futures funds. They consist of a 3 percent annual management fee paid to the advisors trading for the fund and 17.5 percent quarterly incentive fees paid to the advisors out of profits, if any, earned in the quarter. Dean Witter is a respected player in the futures-fund business, but the aggregate return after expenses of 13 of its funds last year, including the Select Futures fund, was 5.5 percent, according to figures given to Managed Account Reports.<p>For every Select Futures fund that does well, there are such clunkers as Dean Witters Principal Guaranteed Fund. As its name implies, the guaranteed fundand dozens like it offered by other brokeragespromised that investors would at least get their money back at the end of a certain period, usually five years. The principal-protection feature has made guaranteed funds hot sellers. When the Principal Guaranteed fund was offered in September 1988, it raised what was at that time a record $252 million.<p>Guaranteeing that principal will be protected is no guarantee that a fund will make much money. The Dean Witter fund couldnt even keep up with anemic money market rates, producing a paltry 0.8 percent annual return. As a result, investors had yanked all but about $30 million out of the fund by the time it matured last September and stopped trading as a guaranteed fund. <p>Then there is Prudential Securities Aggressive Growth futures fund. When it was being put together last year, the fund must have looked like an odds-on winner. Its two advisors, Colorado Commodities Management of Boulder and Chicagos Sj Inc. (pronounced show), were respected advisors with enviable records. Yet the Prudential fund began sinking almost from the beginning of trading last August. By year end it lost 18.2 percent. Colorado Commodities dismal performance accounted for most of the loss; a trading program in currency and financial futures lost 31 percent of its value, while Sj lost 3.5 percent in its foreign financial futures program. <p>Colorado Commodities was caught betting that the yen would rise last August when the U.S. Federal Reserve began dumping the currency to bring it down and the dollar up. Colorado Commodities also wagered that the deutsche mark would rise. Then the Bundesbank lowered its discount rate, cheapening the mark against the dollar. Bad luck? In the commodities markets, its happening to somebody all the time.<p>The industry itself views the reemergence of managed futures as a historic development. Bristling at comparisons of the futures pits with gambling casinos, executives of futures exchanges and leading brokerages in Chicago and New York promote futures not as a speculative vehicle but as a means of diversifying stock and bond portfolios and lessening their volatilityand even as assets of a special class. <p>But the industry, which got its start in Chicago 150 years ago, still has some selling to do, even among the futures faithful. Im not sure our customers think of futures as just another asset class, says Mallers of First American Discount. Futures trading is a long shot, and people ought to trade it like its a long shot.<p>The idea of futures as an asset class is absurd on its face, says Andrew Davis, a former futures options trader and now president of Rock Island Securities, a Chicago brokerage firm. Thats like defining casino chips as an asset class."<p><p>

When we siad last year that interest rates were going to start rising, we didn't realize what an opportunity it would be.<p>By Robert Clark<p>With all the uncertainty and volatility in the securities markets, it's probably a good time to invest. Or buy a second home.<p>No, we're not taking our financial cues from Beavis and Butt-head. That's the message the market is delivering.<p>Normally, we would ignore such a message. This magazine takes a long view of investing. For most people, we believe, buying sound investments and holding them has proved to be the best strategy, no matter what the market and the many readers of its entrails seem to be saying at the moment. We deviated just a degree or two from the course last June. In an article called "When Rates Go Up, "we anticipated the interest-rate bump that finally struck this February and suggested what investors could do to prepare and even profit from the rise.<p>Rates will probably continue to rise, by 1 or 2 percentage points over the next year or so, boosting money market yields as high as 5 percent and long-term government bonds above 8 percent. What should investors do about it now?<p>Last June, we recommended conserving cash by keeping it out of long-term certificates of deposit or annuities, by borrowing for necessary big-ticket purchases such as washers and cars, by refinancing high-rate mortgage loans, and by not paying off low-rate mortgage loans early. For investors who haven't done those things already, there's still time, but it's running out.<p>More important, investors can manage their portfolios to exploit the high probability of additional interest-rate increases. Bonds still look like sells. Some stocks look like buys, at least on market dips. Real estate--housing, in particular--looks like the closest thing to a sure winner around. Those who thought that the 1980s housing market had died and gone forever are likely to be surprised by a historic resurrection. <p>Many investors have made large profits on bonds they bought in the past five years, when interest rates were exceptionally low. The market value of those bonds has already dropped with the rise in interest rates and yields. Because rising rates do more damage to the market value of long-term bonds than short-term bonds, it makes sense to sell 20-year or 30-year bonds and buy Treasury notes with maturities under three years. That will greatly lessen the risk of additional capital loss. By late February, the market value of 30-year Treasury bonds had dropped about a percentage point (or $100 on a $1,000 bond) from the 1993 high. Additional interest-rate increases will cause the market value of the bonds to fall further.<p>Profit-taking bond investors should consider putting cash into stocks instead of short-term fixed-income securities. But not necessarily right now; they should buy only on the sell-offs in the stock market that interest-rate increases will provoke. <p>All this presupposes continued economic recovery and a year or more of steady interest-rate increases, but allows for occasional inflation scares that verge on panics. Those are likely to be much more threatening than the one-day sell-off that excited the securities markets when the Federal Reserve Board raised short-term interest rates by a quarter of a point in February.<p>Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's goal is to keep inflation down without weakening the economy. To do both by manipulating interest rates and banking reserves has always been tricky, but it seems to work more or less satisfactorily from time to time. As long as Greenspan and his colleagues at the Fed are successful, corporate earnings should continue to improve. Higher earnings drive stock prices higher--unless unanticipated interest-rate increases knock them down. The stock market seemed to underreact to the Fed's first upward nudge in interest rates in February. Not only was the increase small, but it also had been widely anticipated. A second quarter-point rise has been widely anticipated as well. In the view of the market, inflation has been held at bay, a view that consumer price indexes have seemed to confirm.<p>Any threat to that view, such as renewed inflation or unanticipated interest-rate increases, should cause an overreaction. And such threats are bound to emerge. The consumer price index shows only where prices have gone, not where they're going. Forward-looking indicators, however, show the inflationary factors that will cause actual price increases later (if prices haven't already begun to move). In the fourth quarter of 1993, the economy grew at an annual rate of nearly 6 percent. For nine months running, consumer spending showed solid gains. In February, the Labor Department reported that hourly wages had risen at an annual rate of 8 percent. The proportion of the country's total manufacturing capacity that is being used--perhaps the most reliable pointer to inflation--nearly reached a 14-year high. As increasing demand for their goods forces manufacturers to rely on their less-efficient facilities, their costs--and prices--increase.<p>All told, the index of leading economic indicators took its largest jump in eight years. In fact, in a recent report economist Ed Hyman of the ISI Group noted 28 signs of a strengthening economy. <p>So could the economy overheat, encouraging inflation? With sharp increases in earnings and spending, prices rise. Lenders get repaid in cheapened dollars. To recoup their losses, they'll raise their borrowing rates. Because the biggest borrower of all is the U.S. government, sharply higher interest rates could wreck President Clinton's budget projections, worsen the already huge budget deficit, and once again invoke the early-1980s specter of printing-press government finance and an endless cycle of price increases and interest-rate increases.<p>That's exactly what the Fed is trying to prevent, of course, without snuffing out the recovery. As long as the economy grows, the inflationary potential will remain. Whenever the market becomes overly concerned with it, stock prices will fall. That should provide a buying opportunity for the bullish.<p>If history is any guide, interest rates will rise considerably above the level that the Fed and the bond markets already have set. James B. Stack, a Fed watcher and editor of the InvesTech Market Analyst, tracks Fed decisions and interest rates. In six of the past seven economic recoveries, he says, once the yield on one-year Treasury bills has bottomed and begun climbing (as it has now), short-term interest rates have risen by 2 percentage points within 18 months.<p>As rates move upward, prices on utility shares, which had declined steadily since August, will continue to weaken. Interest-rate increases particularly depress utilities because their share prices, largely determined by their dividend yields, make them move like bonds in the market. Prices on bank and brokerage shares and other stocks whose issuers are heavy borrowers will also weaken as interest costs rise. On the other hand, home builders, retailers, airlines, automobile manufacturers, and others will do well in an improving economy. Because rising interest rates make most investors jumpy, the portfolio dullards--stocks with high per-share earnings and book values--will be less volatile and thus less anxiety-producing than speculative growth stocks.<p>Real estate seems golden. Specialists in real estate predict a good market this spring. The prospect of higher interest rates may persuade buyers to buy sooner rather than wait. With about a six-year backlog on the market, the supply of housing won't vanish. That will continue to put pressure on sellers to keep prices affordable. All this makes the spring market the best buyer's market we're likely to see for a long while. Beyond that, when the housing supply finally shrinks, look for the biggest boom in housing prices since the mid-'80s.<p>Buyers: Don't panic, but buy soon. Sellers: You can afford to wait. Few home sellers will be able to resist the coming opportunity to unload. Those who do resist, like true contrarians, will reap the biggest gains.<p>Robert Clark is a senior editor at Worth.<p><p>

Dwindling returns on truly secure investments have blinded many of  us to the very real dangers of the markets.<p>By Justin Mamis<p>The language of investing, like the English language itself, changes perpetually. Just as Wall Street invents new products for investors to buy and sell, so do the titans of finance invent new words to describe them. <p>Creating words for newfangled Wall Street products is fine. Reinventing or redefining the vocabulary of investing--what's happening today--is not.<p>Particularly worrisome is the redefinition of one of the most basic of investment concepts: the nature of risk. Webster defines risk as "the possibility of loss or injury" or "to expose to hazard or danger." But today, the idea that an investor might actually lose on an investment has been modified by attractive thoughts of the enormous profits. Eager to justify their leaps into investments with greater potential for loss, investors have defanged or detoxified the nature of risk. <p>This often happens after a bull market is well under way. Citizens who previously--and correctly--viewed stocks as more risky investments than, say, bank savings accounts begin to alter their perceptions of risk. As stocks climb higher, they begin to look safer than they did previously. Savings accounts, meanwhile, may begin to look risky on the grounds of lost opportunity. A sure sign this is happening now is the widespread flight from federally backed investments, such as savings accounts and certificates of deposit, into noninsured investments like mutual funds.<p>It's critical to remember, however, that the thinking behind this trend is grounded partly in an illusion. Stocks are never as safe as savings accounts. The level of risk in an investment does not change from one market climate to another. The only thing that changes is the way people view risk. And today they're viewing it much more sanguinely than they should. <p>Think of it this way: Say you're driving on a highway at the 55 miles-per-hour speed limit and everyone around you is going 75. Although you may normally like to drive within the limits, because you know that it's safer to travel at slower speeds, you're likely to feel comfortable about speeding up. Why not? Everyone else is. You know what they say about safety in numbers--suddenly it seems safe to drive 75. <p>Psychologists have studied this behavior in children and adults; it is sometimes known as disinhibition. William Golden, a New York City psychologist and an assistant professor at New York Hospital's Cornell Medical College, counsels people on their approaches to money matters. Disinhibition, he explains, is an outgrowth of several human tendencies. <p>First is the intense need to conform. Golden cites a study in which a group of subjects was given two obviously different sets of lines and asked to identify which of the two were longer and which were shorter. In most cases, the subjects identified the short lines as the long ones when the other folks in the group did too. Says Golden: "We don't want to be different. We will even change reality in order to conform."<p>In the money world, this translates to: Everybody else is rushing into riskier venues. I will too, so I can conform.<p>Another factor that creates disinhibition is something called vicarious learning: If people are rewarded for a certain type of behavior, they will be able to influence many others to do the same thing. Although this is most often studied in children, it is commonly seen in adults. For example, well-behaved children who watched others act aggressively and badly had no trouble mimicking the antisocial behavior if they had witnessed a reward given to the children who did it first. Says Golden: "You see exact duplication of this in adults who invest. Vicarious learning increases the likelihood that others will exhibit the same behavior. "All my friends made money in risky stocks; I should invest in them, too. <p>Disinhibition in the investment world is especially troublesome because such changes in perception usually occur late in the game. That's the reason so many folks want to buy Compaq now that it's $88 a share, even though they rejected it at less than half that price in 1993. And it's why Argentina is now okay investment turf--not so much because of its improving economy, but because the economy of another south-of-the-border country--Mexico--has already soared. From this perspective, the Latin American defaults of less than ten years ago appear not as significant as the events of the last ten months.<p>In the late stages of a bull market, investors may even become numb to warnings of risk. The phrase "past performance is no guarantee of future results," for instance, loses its meaning--just as smokers learn to ignore the surgeon general's warning on cigarette packs. Suddenly, nobody cares to see what's buried in the fine print.<p>But there's a funny thing about markets: They're ongoing, evolving, ever changing. This is their nature, and it's the only thing we can be sure of about them. Obviously, those who invested early on in emerging markets such as Malaysia and Thailand have bagged their profits and deserve our admiration. But should those past gains drive new investors into these markets now?<p>There's nothing wrong with intelligent speculation. However, investments that used to be "more speculative" are now being viewed as "tolerably speculative" at just the time when the odds of losing on these investments are heightened. With so much investment money chasing so few companies and such a limited supply of shares, prices have already soared. When it's time for all these folks to sell, who's going to be buying? "Emerging" markets have been described by some as a large room with a very small door. <p>Where else has risk chameleoned into something safe? Electric-utilities stocks--traditional sources of decent dividend returns--are being pitched as risk-free. Here again, market life is never that simple. <p>Let's say a utility is trading around $20 a share and pays $2 a year in dividends, a yield of 5 percent. Sounds great. But what happens when interest rates go up and utility stocks drop? In just a few weeks last autumn the Dow Jones Utility Average slid more than 10 percent; so now your stock is selling for $18. You're still getting your 5 percent yield, of course, but the fact is, you've lost the equivalent of an entire year's income in the 10 percent decline. Sure, it's only a paper loss, but your net worth has declined and your capital has diminished, all for the sake of current return. <p>You can use semantics to pretend it's not a real loss, but consider this: Had your money stayed in CDs another year, yielding peanuts, and now you bought that utility stock at 18, your yield would have improved to 5.5 percent (not counting the 2 percent you would have earned on your CD). That's certainly better than pretending that you can't really lose by buying utility stocks.<p>Remember: What's safe hasn't changed its nature. Government bonds, bank CDs, insured savings accounts--all remain safe. The problem is they have become undesirable to investors who want higher yields than these investments currently provide. Investments don't change; investors' needs do. But just because your needs have changed doesn't mean that the definition of market risk has. Risk--the potential for loss--is a constant. Same as it ever was. <p>Justin Mamis is a senior vice president at Hancock Institutional Equity Services in New York City. <p><p>

						<p>Outsiders needn't panic when execs dump shares<p>By Kevin Caliendo<p>Conventional wisdom says insiders know what they're doing when they buy and sell their company's shares. And individual investors pay close attention to the activities of insiders when they buy and sell stocks. <p>As it happens, the conventional wisdom is only partly right. Insiders often lose money on their own stocks, and their transactions can be very misleading. What's more, changes in executive compensation and in procedures for reporting insider transactions have made it harder for outsiders to interpret available data. As a result, investors should be choosy about which insider-trading data they watch. <p>Securities laws require officers, directors, and owners of more than 10 percent of a company's stock to file reports outlining their purchases and sales regularly. Transactions in one month must be reported to the SEC by the tenth of the next month. Press and on-line services disseminate these reports. Insider sales shown on these reports__called Form 4s__are ambiguous. Insiders, like most of us, buy securities that they hope will rise. Those who sell may be bears, or they could need cash or want to diversify a portfolios. <p>Insiders often make this claim. George Shirk, research analyst for the Insiders newsletter, says, "They'll tell you anything rather than say they feel the stock is heading down."<p>Insider moves are a less reliable indicator now than they used to be, thanks in part to the proliferation of option grants given to high-level executives. Selling shares acquired by option has become so routine that the trades have lost any value as a bearish signal. Melloan JFYI, Shirk mentioned that his newsletter rates companies based on the amount of insider trading, but they exclude gifts, private placements, and options trading. Executives seem to treat these options as paychecks rather than securities__and cash them accordingly. <p>The purchase of stock through the exercise of options may also be meaningless. "If an insider has the option to buy a stock at $4 a share when it is trading at $8, then it is a good business decision, not necessarily an indicator of where he feels the stock is going," says Shirk. <p>Even when it's clear that an insider has sold, it's not always clear when the sale took place. Consider the sales reported on SEC Form 144, which accounts for the disposition of restricted or privately issued stock. Although it cannot be resold publicly for two years, executives can dispose of their shares privately, at a discount from market value, in agreements with brokers. The brokers hold the shares until the waiting period has ended and then sell them publicly. Form 144 reports the sale but doesn't show when the executive got out and at what price. <p>Another problem with 144 reports: Insiders have up to 90 days to complete their sale. Outsiders are in the dark about the details.<p>Some insider transactions are more meaningful than others. Repeated sales or buys by many insiders usually are more significant than a single transaction. Microsoft's Bill Gates sold 2.6 million of his company's shares in 1992, for example, but he held on to more than 80 million shares, and the stock has risen since. On the other hand, when a slew of executives unload chunks of shares at once, take note. Such was the case last November with Spectrum Information Technology, a wireless-communications concern whose top dogs exercised more than half their options when exApple chairman John Sculley joined the firm. News of the options sale and an investigation into the stock's volatile trading patterns came out in January, and the stock tanked.<p>Before jumping to any conclusions about trading patterns, make sure the company involved isn't one such as Compaq Computer, a well-managed concern that allows insider transactions only within a limited time after quarterly financials are published. Such a rule makes transactions seem more concentrated and significant than they may be. And insider selling following a company's initial public offering may signal nothing more than an insider's need for cash after a start-up's lean years. <p>Keep in mind that insiders__honest ones, at least__are not short-term investors. The six-month rule on buying and selling requires them to hold at least that long. And their bargain-hunting instincts usually encourage insiders to buy early. Robert Gabele, president of CDA/ Investnet, a Fort Lauderdale information-service company that tracks insider trading, says it usually takes three to six months after big insider buying to have an effect on a company's stock. That gives outsiders time to investigate the company before they buy. And, remember, insider purchases in the public market at the public's price are one of the most bullish signs of all.<p><p><p>

						<p>If a broker pitches one of these "strategies," say no <p>By Gerald Perritt<p>There's nothing like a long bull market to turn investing into fun and games. Many investors have done so well in recent years that they're allowing themselves to be talked into playing for thrills as well as money. Unless that's really what you want to do, here are some of the more dangerous games brokers are pushing today that you ought to be wary of:<p>COVERED-CALL WRITING<p>equipment: A portfolio of dividend-paying stocks. The stocks must have corresponding exchange-listed options.<p>object: To earn about 15 percent a year with little risk, in dividends and option premiums.<p>play: It begins with a pitch from a broker. He persuades you to write (or sell) call options against shares of stock you own. The buyer of the options pays you a premium for the right to purchase your shares at a fixed price--usually higher than where the market is currently trading--within the next three to nine months. If the value of your shares never rises to the purchase (or "strike") price, the options expire worthless, letting you hold on to your stock and earn additional income.<p>risks: Stocks that do rise sharply in price will be called away--that is, purchased by the options buyer--depriving you of most of the gain. If prices fall sharply, the loss will wipe out your premium income. In certain phases of a market, options become overvalued, rewarding those who play this game. Today is not one of these times. Over the long term, covered-call writing will produce mediocre returns. But don't expect your broker to volunteer that fact; he's likely to tell you of big returns in writing options. Most of these claims do not include the costs of commissions.<p>LEVERAGE<p>equipment: A margin account and a high tolerance for risk.<p>object: To get rich quick with little capital.<p>play:Start with $2,000 in equity in a margin account. Find a stock that is about to soar and buy it. As the value of your stock increases--called equity--buy more, sell at the peak, and repeat the process until you're rich as Croesus.<p>risks:This is a table-stakes game. If you buy a loser, your equity may be wiped out, forcing you to put up more money or leave the game. If you buy a stock that goes nowhere, you're still a loser because you must pay interest on the money you borrowed. Only if the stock rises quickly will margin work for you. <p>INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS<p>equipment: A full-service (full commission) broker whose firm underwrites hot issues and who feels compelled to do you a favor for all the business you've given him.<p>object: To get in on the ground floor of the next Snapple or <a name="NASD:SBUX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15745"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Starbucks</b></a>.<p>play: Buy as many shares as your broker can get you. Sell at the top, preferably hours after you bought them.<p>risks: It's not the next Snapple or Starbucks because if it was, the big institutions would have gotten there first. Overall long-term returns on new issues are mediocre. Three or more years after their initial public offering, fewer than one in six new issues has outperformed the market; nearly half have lost half their value. Only the big boys have a chance of getting sufficient shares in the few truly hot issues.<p>ACTIVE TRADING<p>equipment: Price and volume charts and a knowledge of technical trading terms.<p>object: To run up lots of small gains on volatile securities.<p>play: Trade frenetically.<p>risks: Recurring commission and other transaction costs erode winners' gains and magnify losers' losses. Even using a discount broker, a trader who turns over his portfolio three times a year will run up transaction costs of 6 percent  of his portfolio's value.<p>CLOSED-END-FUND IPOS<p>equipment: A full-service broker with a firm that underwrites closed-end funds.<p>object: Be the first on the block to own a new fund.<p>play: See IPOs. This game differs mainly in that 1) you can buy all the shares you want, but 2) you shouldn't. <p>risks: Prices on new issues of closed-end funds usually decline in the first 120 days after the offering. The offering price represents the value of the underlying portfolio securities in the fund plus underwriting fees and costs, including selling costs. Those costs amount to a new-issue premium that usually disappears within a few months. Better to wait until the premium has disappeared. <p><p>

These cyclical stocks may be ready to take off<p>By Robert W. Casey<p>For the next round of winners in cyclical stocks, look to basic industries--forest products, chemicals, and metals--and to energy. At this stage of the bull market and the economy's recovery, their time has come. <p>Don't dismiss the autos, yet, even though they always blossom early in a recovery. Auto stocks delivered back-to-back gains of 42 and 62 percent in 1992 and 1993 as the economy finally started to stir from its 1991 low point. Other cyclicals recover later.<p>Sector investing in cyclical stocks looks easier than it is. Business cycles vary notoriously in strength and duration, making timing even trickier than usual. Stock prices usually reflect the most predictable news. Still, there are some opportunities for investors with a medium-term time horizon. <p>Earnings estimates of securities analysts provide some clues on what to expect from cyclicals. Don't pay too much heed to individual company reports or industry roundups. In the aggregate numbers lies a clearer picture. <p>The people at Institutional Brokers Estimate System collect analysts' forecasts, providing useful consensus reports to Wall Street. According to IBES, aggregate forecasts for 1994 earnings growth among basic industries including forest products, chemicals and metals producers, which tend to be highly cyclical, come in at a strong 48 percent, up sharply from the group's 1993 earnings growth of 4 percent.<p>While IBES tracks consensus among analysts, it also tracks disagreement. In the perverse world of Wall Street, analysts' discord creates greater potential for gains than consensus does. When earnings estimates for a stock or industry group cluster close to the average figure, that signals a trend that stock prices already reflect. If estimates vary widely, stocks in the group are more likely to be undervalued or overvalued, creating opportunities for investors and traders. These are called earnings surprises.<p>So where do the greatest disagreements turn up where '94 earnings are concerned? The three leading sectors are energy, basic industries, and consumer durables. Reasons for the varying opinions differ. In consumer durables, analysts argue over whether or not the auto industry--which dominates the sector--will have another banner year. For basic industries and producers of metals and paper, the uncertainty over inflation in raw materials clouds their prospects. It's unclear whether these producers could raise their prices if inflation jumps.<p>Most interesting is the disagreement over energy-industry earnings. "There's usually a lot of divergence among analysts forecasting energy earnings, but this year it's even higher than normal," says Bill Quinn, an IBES analyst. "A good portion of that is just the uncertainty surrounding the price of oil itself."<p>That makes oil an outstanding bet for investors right now. So says Robin Shoemaker, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. His view is that the two-year-old slide in oil prices may soon end. The stock market, he says, is unrealistically skeptical of OPEC's ability to control oil production. But OPEC eventually will force price increases, benefiting U.S. companies such as <a name="NYSE:ARC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10142"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Atlantic Richfield</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:PZL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11164"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pennzoil</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:P"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11182"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Phillips Petroleum</b></a>. The domestic oils also make a good sector play on the business cycle. <p>"The recovery will increase demand for petroleum products," says Shoemaker. "That will boost earnings, particularly in the refining, marketing, and petrochemical areas." The oils will be ripe for a positive-earnings surprise.<p>Should you jump into the other sectors where analysts disagree? Those are tougher calls. Auto demand continued strong in the early months of this year, boding well for all of '94. The prospects for inflation are anybody's guess. But following the Federal Reserve's winter hike in interest rates, you can assume the prices of the cyclical stocks already reflect a modest increase in inflation. If you think that's all we'll see, this may be a good time to buy. <p><p><p>

What does it mean when a laggard starts to rise?<p>By Jim Jubak<p>Does this bull market have legs? The answer may lie in the S&P shoe index. The Dow finished 1993 up 13.7 percent and the S&P 500 climbed 7 percent, but the rising tide was not smooth sailing. As typically happens in a slow-moving economic recovery, one sector booms and then quickly drops back as investors move into the next hot group. In the first quarter of last year, for example, stocks in the building-materials sector ran up almost 15 percent. They dropped back 8.3 percent in the second quarter, while a related group--home-building stocks----climbed 10 percent. In the third quarter, home builders surged again--up 17 percent----while shares in building-materials makers rose almost 8 percent. Also in the third quarter, makers of household furnishings and appliances made the list of top ten performers for the first time. In January, investors continued their love affair with the home front: Mobile-home makers jumped 9 percent.<p>Shoe stocks, in contrast, were the dogs of 1993, down almost 25 percent. In fact, most consumer-goods sectors--retailers, food processors, and toy makers--lagged the Dow. But now they're moving. Shoe shares ranked 11th among industry groups in January. Of course, the stocks had taken such a tanning that perhaps the only way they could go was up. And strong fourth-quarter sales figures at Timberland Co. (up 41 percent) and Nine West Group (up 20 percent) may indicate a simple shift in fashion. <p>Will the surge last? Keep your eye on other consumer stocks; if they start to rise, it would indicate a change in leadership. And that would mean this bull's still got a way to run.--Jim Jubak<p><p>

Stock opportunities in last year's weather reports<p>By Derrick Niederman<p>The "storm of the century" that hit the East Coast in mid-March of 1993 is about to provide a delayed payoff to investors who are paying attention as we near the anniversary of the storm. <p>The key is the yearly changes in company financials. Good year-to-year comparisons tend to push stocks up, and bad comparisons tend to push them down. And that's where the storm comes in. By looking for companies whose sales figures were hit hardest by the storm, we've compiled a list (see table) of companies that are poised to post outstanding yearly comparisons this March. And even though it seems too easy to anticipate, it's a good bet that the stocks of some of these companies will go up after the numbers are released.<p>The storm came on a weekend, when people are inclined to shop and eat out. For companies dependent on consumers spending time outside their homes, it was a disaster. The table shows the storm's effect on "same-store sales" figures. Most stores were down more than 5 percent, and even those that were up (such as <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a>) did worse than expected. The comparisons were particularly poor for regional operations in the storm's path, including discount retailer <a name="NASD:BSMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15162"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Filene's Basement</b></a>, based in Boston (down 7 percent), and <a name="NYSE:SHN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11351"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Shoney's Restaurants</b></a>, headquartered in Nashville (down 8.8 percent). <p>Within six weeks of the storm, the stocks in the table declined an average of 18.5 percent. Why did the market react so strongly to an obviously onetime event? As hard to believe as it may be, many investors react only to the numbers. Instead of taking the weather into consideration, they conclude that the company must have lost its touch. Companies already known to be experiencing problems were hit the hardest. For example, Filene's Basement (whose stock was off 40.3 percent) has struggled in its expansion beyond the flagship Boston store. But the poor comparisons caused by the weather made many investors believe that the growth problem was worse than they had thought. The double whammy made Filene's the biggest loser on the list.<p>Wall Street also punished some companies whose sales remained up, because those results were still below expectations. <a name="NASD:CBRL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13128"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store</b></a>, a family restaurant chain, posted a sales gain of 5 percent but saw its stock drop from 31 to 25 as investors accustomed to 8 percent to 9 percent sales gains bailed out. <a name="NASD:SPLS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14790"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Staples</b></a>, one of the leaders in office-supply superstores, posted flat sales, which didn't sustain the stock's high multiple. Within two months, Staples shares had fallen from 27 to 16.<p>As long as there isn't another far-reaching blizzard this winter, the March sales figures should be better than they were last year, and they should benefit each company on the list. But not all these stocks still have equal potential for today's investors. Staples and Cracker Barrel, for instance, have each staged full recoveries from their declines. Cracker Barrel's rebound was so swift it hit a record high last May, up 36 percent from the April low. It may go up more, but probably not as dramatically.<p>Fortunately, a few laggards remain, and that's where the greatest opportunities lie. The restaurant chains--Shoney's, <a name="NYSE:PIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14429"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Piccadilly</b></a>, and <a name="NASD:RYAN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14624"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ryan</b></a>'s--are all trading within $1 of their pre-'93 storm prices and could be considered rebound candidates even without any "weather bounce." All three have made improvements in their appearance, menus, and pricing strategies, and they are are modestly priced relative to current earnings. All they need is a catalyst to help investors recognize the advances they have made--and favorable March comparisons could be just the thing. <p><p>

						Ranging from college professor to playwrite to horse trainer, these individuals have made successful investing a way of life.  The secret, they say, is in the details, from knowing what to read to learning when to sell.  Their stories show how anyone can play the game and win.<p>By Andrew Feinberg<p>ENJOY THE PROCESS
JACK ROSENZWEIG<p>Jack Rosenzweig--ponytailed vegetarian, Harley rider, gentleman farmer, and CEO--enjoys the stock market. In fact, keeping it fun is key to Rosenzweig's success as an investor. <p>Rosenzweig lives on a 110-acre farm in Glen Summit, Pennsylvania, and is co-owner, with his wife, of a "moderately profitable" $40 million conglomerate called Humbold Industries. That doesn't leave Rosenzweig with much time for anything that feels like work. <p>Rosenzweig's techniques--which might strike some as hopelessly inefficient and outdated--have two things in common. Each ritualistic step is pleasurable in and of itself, and each is woven into the fabric of his busy days. Rosenzweig values the techniques not because they work in the market (although his portfolio is up 30 percent a year since 1990) but because they work in his life.<p>For example, he listens to CNBC for three hours every morning (World Business and The Money Wheel), while dressing and reading his four daily newspapers, and three hours every evening (MarketWrap and Business Insiders), while lifting weights and running on his treadmill. He gets his stock quotes from the ticker and every night charts the progress of each holding by hand. "Sure, software could do it faster, but I work on a computer at the office all day," he says. It takes him just 15 minutes a night to chart his 20 stocks and update his portfolio's progress using a calculator. (He was up $325,000, more than 32 percent, for the first 11 months of 1993.) The charts help test the information that Rosenzweig gathers from a discovery process that begins with all those hours spent half-listening to his television.<p>In October 1993 he became interested in Plum Creek Timber Company Ltd. when it was mentioned positively both in the Wall Street Journal and on CNBC. What attracted him? First, the fact that he had never heard of the company despite its size--it has one of the world's largest holdings of standing timber. And second, its high dividend (then 6.7 percent) and a relatively low price-to-earnings ratio of 11. But what made this a hot prospect? Only one Wall Street analyst followed it. <p>So he called Plum Creek's investor-relations officer and had her FedEx a large package of information. Then he talked to Evadna Lynn of Dean Witter, the lone analyst, for half an hour. Did it really seem like a good story to her? Eventually, he elicited her projection that Plum Creek, then trading at $66, would have more than $7 per share in free cash flow in 1995. Rosenzweig bought 1,000 shares. A month later the stock hit $76.75.<p>A contrarian, he's particularly attentive to negative news about companies. "People panic too fast, and TV helps clue me in to when the crowd's reaction may be overdone," he says. Among his better plays: Buying 1,000 shares of Motorola at an average price of $51.66--virtually its low tick--during the height of the cellular-phone brain-cancer scare. "I'm a former science teacher, and when I saw the stock drop 20 percent to 25 percent in a matter of days, I said, 'This is ridiculous.' Buying when everyone else is bailing out is fun." <p><p>HABITS<p>Time commitment: 17 to 22 hours a week on investing.<p>Portfolio size: $1 million.<p>Reading: The Wilkes-Barre Times Leader and the Hazelton Standard Speaker.<p>Trading activity: 40 to 50 trades a year.<p>Tools: Charts his investments but does not use a computer for tracking or research.<p>Portfolio breakdown: 75 percent of his liquid assets are in stocks; rest of liquid assets in money market funds. <p>Leverage: Does not trade on margin; has never purchased futures, options, gold, or silver. Has never sold short.<p>Won/lost ratio: 90:10.<p>Main reason to buy a stock: "Because I think it will go up. I'm adding to my position in Placer Dome because I think there is about to be a stupid push in gold."<p>Main reason to sell: "Because I've lost faith in the company."<p>In a bear market: "I would keep my utilities and precious-metal stocks. I would probably sell some stocks and move some money into cash."<p>Investment personality: "My investment style is contrarian."<p>PICKS<p><a name="NYSE:PCL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11196"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PLUM CREEK TIMBER CO.

LEARN AS YOU EARN
MARYLIN BAITZ<p>Since Marylin Baitz began investing four years ago--after inheriting a low-six-figure sum from her grandmother's estate--the 40-year-old part-time horse trainer from Cincinnati has concentrated on one thing: her own growth as an investor. Like most novices, Baitz began by buying mutual funds. But after two years, she felt confident picking her own stocks. Now she has the confidence to invest aggressively, with an emphasis on the rigorous analysis of undiscovered stocks. "I was a math major in college," she says. "And I'm very mathematically inclined."<p>Take two recent coups. In August 1993 she bought into an initial public offering of Glenway Financial, a Cincinnati savings and loan that went public at $14. By December the stock was at $20. In September 1993, she bought shares in another obscure local company, the Future Now, a computer reseller with $700 million in revenues, at $11. By December it was up to $13.75.<p>Baitz owns no bonds, no bond funds, no balanced funds, and no asset-allocation funds. She keeps only a small amount in cash. "My goal is to achieve a 15 percent annual return, and you can't expect to get that by buying bonds," she says.<p>The Glenway Financial play perfectly exemplifies Baitz's hardheaded approach. As a rule, she considers IPOs a suckers game that depends on underwriters dumping stocks on unwitting fools looking for quick profits. But Baitz saw long-term prospects at Glenway Financial. "I had been a customer of the S&L for seven years, and I liked everything about it," Baitz says. "They have small, neat branches that are short on glitz, with no evidence that they're spending my money unwisely. Unlike many other places I've banked, they have very low staff turnover, which I take as a positive sign." <p>As a depositor, she bought her shares without paying a commission. Another plus was meeting Dennis Betz, Glenway's president, who came over to chat one day when he overheard Baitz asking a teller questions about the S&L. "I asked him why I should buy his stock," Baitz recalls. "He talked about Glenway's steady growth and its acquisition strategy." Baitz decided to put her money, well, where her money already was. <p>A month later, she went local again with the Future Now. Baitz was struck by the disparity between the computer reseller's impressive sales and earnings growth rates--100 percent and 35 percent, respectively--and its below-market price-to-earnings ratio of 9 (at a time when the market as a whole was trading at a multiple well over 20). <p>Was this a buying opportunity, or was the low multiple warning her away from a turkey? Baitz decided to do some more of her own special brand of research.<p>"They had made 28 acquisitions in the preceding year, which was fine--if they were also generating real internal growth. But a lot of fast-growing companies just use acquisitions as a shell game. That kind of growth can be an illusion." When she checked, however, she learned that the Future Now had an internal growth rate of 28 percent. "I sought candid assessments from some of their local customers," Baitz says. "All were enthusiastic and said they'd do business with the company again." That sold her on the stock.<p>HABITS<p>Time commitment: Spends five to six hours a week on investing.<p>Portfolio size: Six figures.<p>Reading: Better Investing, Standard & Poor's research reports, and Value Line.<p>Trading activity: Averages ten trades a year.<p>Portfolio breakdown: 98 percent of liquid assets in stocks, 2 percent in money market funds, no foreign stocks.<p>Leverage: Doesn't trade options or futures, doesn't sell short, never trades on margin.<p>Won/lost ratio: 85:15.<p>Main reason to buy a stock: "Because I like its earnings-per-share growth record."<p>

MICHAEL KATZ<p>
I'm stunned at the number of people who have potentially profitable information under their noses but don't take advantage of it," says Michael Katz, 50, of Tiburon, California. <p>Rather than blindly follow the advice of analysts, "experts" of dubious lineage, and media tips, he believes in focusing his active trading (about 30 percent of his seven-figure portfolio) on stocks he knows as a result of his more than 20 years in the video game and toy business. His resume? Katz is president of the entertainment electronics division of Triax Technologies, an Albany, New York, maker of enhanced video game controllers. He's also been president of video game maker Sega Enterprises, head of Atari's video game unit, head of new products at Mattel, and vice president of marketing at Coleco of America.<p>In 1993, his trading account rose 50 percent for the first 11 months of the year. On the job Katz talks to retailers, vendors, and venture capitalists--industry people who are suppliers, customers, competitors, or friends. Using this network of contacts, he stays on top of industry events, trends, and players--mostly for work. But it also plays into his needs as an investor. <p>Last spring, for example, the buzz had a software company called Spectrum Holobyte set to merge with rival MicroProse Software. Katz thought the deal made strategic sense, and he knew and respected the managers at both companies. He also knew the smart money was backing Spectrum Holobyte--in this case, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a powerful Silicon Valley venture-capital firm that had already put its money behind such high-profile companies as Electronic Arts, 3DO, and Crystal Dynamics. "I assumed that Kleiner Perkins would improve the management, increase R&D and get other strong investors interested in the company," says Katz. He began buying shares of Microprose (the name of the surviving company) in late June at prices ranging from $6 to $8.50. He sold in October at $14. "The stock started falling back. Video game sales at retail weren't that good. And I didn't want to be a pig."<p>No sector of the market is as susceptible to hype as the video game industry is right now. Katz believes this presents as much opportunity for the canny investor as danger to the unsuspecting. "Hype is very short-lived, and the industry is even more receptive to hype when it's hot, as it was recently," he says. "I always try to gauge the interest level of the investment community, the average investor, and the press." <p>Katz knows that the game must sometimes be played at warp speed. "If there's a press conference about a hot new product that is known in the industry but not yet widely written about, you can expect some upside move [immediately] after the conference," he says. "If you don't get that move, think of bailing out."<p>Case in point: In August 1993, the industry rumor was that Atari would form a joint venture with <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>  to produce its Jaguar video system. Katz bought 20,000 Atari shares at $2.25. When the stock hit $2.75 several days later, Katz sold, figuring that it had made its move. Within a week, the stock hit $5. Had Katz blown it? No. After an October Atari press conference announcing the details of Jaguar, he plunged back in, repurchasing 5,000 shares at $5. The next month he sold at $12. <p>Katz never waits around for the trade press or newspaper business pages to tell him where to put his money. He says both are always too late. For instance, in April 1993, he bought stock in Activision, a video game maker, because he'd heard from acquaintances that Gerard Klauer Mattison, a New York brokerage firm, had agreed to raise money for the company. "Gerard Klauer is pretty knowledgeable and has a very good track record in the industry," Katz says.<p>He also regularly consults his broker of six years--a refugee from Commodore, one of the early players in the home computer and game market--about timing and strategy. And he tries to be aggressive only within clearly defined parameters. The upside should be mouthwatering, the downside limited to a point or two. And he no longer looks for more than a double on any investment. <p><p>HABITS<p>Time commitment: Five to six hours per week.<p>Portfolio size: High six figures.<p>Activity: Averages 20 to 40 trades a year.<p>Tools: Doesn't chart investments, but intends to begin using a computer for tracking and research.<p>Portfolio breakdown: 70 percent of liquid assets in stocks, 30 percent in cash, oil, and real estate; 20 percent of stocks owned are foreign.<p>Leverage: Uses options a lot, sells short occasionally, rarely trades on margin.<p>Won/lost ratio: 60:40.<p>Main reason to buy a stock: "Because I expect fast appreciation within 12 months."<p>Main reason to sell: "It's reached my target, or I sense that it's at a high."<p>In a bear market: "I would try to profit aggressively on the downside.

NARROW THE FOCUS
DICK BRUKENFELD<p><p> For Dick Brukenfeld, nothing concentrates the mind like an investment that returns nearly 1,000 percent. Before 1975, the 60-year-old Westchester County, New York, playwright and former Village Voice theater critic was just another stock market duffer, buying and selling without much strategy and basically breaking even. Then in 1975, he bought some stock in Radiofone, an electronic-paging company of which his cousin was an officer. The $5,000 investment was really just a favor to a family member, but it ended up changing Brukenfeld's life. Over the next seven and a half years, Brukenfeld watched Radiofone stock rise from  $1.50 to $26. The message: Learn one industry; learn everything about it. <p>"I believe in concentration," he says. Now Brukenfeld owns some 25 telephone, cellular, paging, and cable-TV stocks. His holdings are broad enough that when the stocks of BellAtlantic and Telecommunications Inc. soared following their merger announcement in October, Brukenfeld already owned chunks of both. "Ideally, you want to know as much as possible about an industry so you can filter out the BS," he says.  <p>His favorite bell ringer was Mobile Communications Inc., a small cellular-phone company based in Jackson, Mississippi. "I asked about the prospects for cellular," he says. "I wanted a pure play." The stock soared from $4.25 in 1982 to $27.25 in 1989. That year BellSouth acquired the company, kept the cellular assets, and  spun it off as a new wireless entity called Mobile Telecommunications. But Brukenfeld wasn't finished. "I learned that Mobile Communications CEO John Palmer and his team, whom I respected enormously, were staying with the spin-off," Brukenfeld says. He put an additional $100,000 in the spin-off at $4.50 a share. After 18 months he sold two thirds at prices ranging from $5 to $6 a share. But he kept 10,000 shares; the stock's now above $20. <p>"When you concentrate on one area, you're not at the mercy of the market," he says. "If you really know the business and the company, you know when it's the market that's going crazy." A focused investor who knows the fundamental values of the companies in a sector should be able to tell when that sector itself is getting overvalued. "I'm not buying telecommunications in the U.S. now because there's too much hoopla," Brukenfeld says. "I'm concentrating on foreign communications plays."<p><p>habits<p>Time commitment: Seven hours a week.<p>Portfolio size: Low seven figures.<p>Reading: Four financial newsletters: Adrian Day's Investment Analyst, Richard Band's Profitable Investing, Vivian Lewis's Global Investing, and Bob Bishop's Gold Mining Report.<p>Trading activity: Averages ten trades a year.<p>Techniques: Doesn't chart investments or use a computer.<p>Portfolio breakdown: 60 percent of liquid assets in stocks, 30 percent in bonds, 10 percent in cash; 30 percent of stocks are foreign.<p>Leverage: Never sells short; occasionally trades on margin.

ANNE CAREY<p>
 Five years ago, all anne carey really knew about investing was that she and her husband, Joe, were getting lousy returns on their retirement money. After weeks of her prodding, Joe finally said: "Okay, go ahead and lose some of our money. That'll cure you." Since then, her investments in mutual funds and individual stocks have risen more than 15 percent annually. <p>What's her secret? <p>Homework. Carey, a 49-year-old political science professor at Jefferson State Community College in Birmingham, Alabama, did what academics do best: She studied. Her initial syllabus included Richard E. Band's Contrary Investing for the '90s, William E. Donoghue's Lifetime Financial Planner, John P. Dessauer's Passport to Profits, and John Train's New Money Masters--because it included a profile of superinvestor Jim Rogers, who's from Alabama and is a cousin of one of her friends.<p>But books would only take Carey so far. She also needed some classroom time. So she attended a seminar offered by Legg Mason on income investing and enrolled in Investing 101 (yes, that's the course's real name) at Jefferson State. She subscribed to the Value Line Investment Survey for a year without ever acting on any of its recommendations. "Since I didn't have enough time to use it properly, I decided not to use it at all," she says. Unlike many novices, she never relies on friends for advice. "I would take their advice if I thought they studied as much as I did, but they don't," she says. Eventually, she decided to focus on international investing, mixing in some conservative income-oriented instruments with growth stocks and funds. Today, 6 of her 15 mutual funds are international, and her successful picks include T. Rowe Price New Asia and Scudder Latin America, both up more than 50 percent in the first 11 months of 1993. She picked those winners because her extensive reading left her feeling bullish on Asia and Latin America but bearish on Japan. So she sought out a no-load Asia fund without any Japanese holdings. <p>Closed-end single-country funds look like an intriguing next step in international investing to Carey, but not at any price. "I recently began subscribing to Morningstar's Closed End Fund research," she says. "I'm interested in some of the funds, but they are selling at premiums and I refuse to overpay."<p>Carey's husband never got to appreciate his wife's investment skills: He died of cancer in 1991. But she was grateful for the head start she got in finance. It helped her deal with the sudden responsibility of managing an estate in the high six figures. "I knew I didn't want a bank trust department to manage my money because I'd heard and read the horror stories," she says. Some banks actually lost money for clients during the '80s--which took work. She has done much better on her own.<p><p>habits<p>Time commitment: Six to seven hours per week.<p>Portfolio size: High six figures.<p>Reading: The Wall Street Journal, Investor's Business Daily, and Worth.<p>Trading activity: Averages five or six per year.<p>Technique: Doesn't chart investments or use a computer for research.<p>Portfolio breakdown: 50 percent of liquid assets in stocks, 25 percent in bonds, 25 percent in cash; 25 percent of stocks are foreign.<p>Leverage: Never buys futures or options,  never sells short, doesn't trade on margin.<p>Won/lost ratio: 80:20.<p>Main reason to buy a stock: "Because I think it will grow."<p>Main reason to sell: "Because I think it is fully valued."<p>In a bear market: "I will ride it out.

BILLY WILLIAMS<p>
Billy Williams believes in long-term commitments. The average tenure of a stock in his portfolio: Ten years.<p>Indeed, the 56-year-old retired highway designer from Jonesboro, Georgia, says he approaches every stock he buys with the intention of holding it forever. He acquired shares of Ford in 1983 at a split-adjusted $12 a share. The stock hit $50 in 1989, but by 1991 it was back to $25. Williams held on even as Wall Street jilted the stock. "The cycle had turned against Ford, but the company was still fundamentally healthy," he says. Ford recently traded at $64.75.<p>Old-fashioned as his approach may be, Williams's buy-and-hold-forever strategy has driven his portfolio upward at a compound annual rate of 21 percent since 1961. <p>To interest Williams, a prospect must be fast-growing and, ideally, an industry leader. But it can't be trendy or in a business that laymen can't understand. If it passes that initial test, he runs a screen on the company's numbers. Profits must have risen at least 15 percent annually for the past five years, and the last quarter's earnings must be higher than the preceding quarter's.<p>Each month 15 to 20 companies pass the first screen and are subjected to more rigorous analysis. Projecting each company's sales and earnings five years into the future, Williams looks for companies that are growing significantly faster than the market average.<p>The survivors then face another hurdle. Williams calculates each company's average price-to-earnings ratio over the past five years; he will only buy a stock that is currently trading below that average. And he won't buy any stock unless its projected high five years from now (the future earnings projection multiplied by the highest price-to-earnings ratio of the last five years) is at least three times the projected low (future earnings multiplied by the lowest ratio from that period).<p>Once he's done this analysis and made a purchase, Williams is determined not to pay too much attention. His goal is to avoid the second-guessing that undermines so many stock pickers, and so he reviews the prices of his 25 stocks just once a month. <p>Genuine changes in a company's fundamentals--and not a transitory event like a price move --trigger most of his portfolio adjustments. "If one of my companies has disappointing earnings, I'll hold on if the explanation seems justifiable," he says. "The question is always: Knowing what I now know, would I buy this stock today? If the answer is yes, why worry?"<p>Even when his system leads him into turbulence, Williams holds on. Consider his response to the nearly unbelievable ride he's taken with T2 Medical, the home-infusion-therapy company that last year admitted its books were cooked. Williams bought the stock at $3 split-adjusted in 1988, watched it soar to $67, then held on as it nosedived to $5.25. Recently the stock traded at $7. "It doesn't bother me," he says. "I make mistakes, but the system works." <p><p>habits<p>Time commitment: 40 to 50 hours a week.

ISSAC ZISSELMAN<p> Nobody would mistake isaac zisselman, a 52-year-old New York City tax and estate attorney, for an Eastern mystic. When he recommends calm, it's for totally pragmatic reasons. "It doesn't pay to get excited," Zisselman says. Calm, on the other hand, can be very lucrative, especially since Zisselman tries to invest so that he gets paid in cash for staying calm.<p>Nice dividends help keep him from worrying, he's noticed. In 1987, believing that the commercial real estate market had hit bottom, Zisselman established his largest equity position ever by buying into Storage Equities, a real estate investment trust (REIT). Storage Equities is the largest publicly traded operator of self-storage warehouses for individuals and small business--what's called mini storage--in the country. He liked the company's geographic diversity and the low maintenance required by its properties. So he bought the stock at $12.<p>Zisselman didn't worry when the stock failed to move. It helped that he'd noticed that insiders were increasing their stake in the company. But more importantly, he was pocketing more than a 10 percent dividend while he waited. He also didn't worry as the market for commercial properties continued to weaken, or when Storage Equities slashed its annual payout in half, or when the stock tumbled to $9. "Obviously, I had been early," he says. "But I still believed the long-term story. And it mattered that management did, too." <p>Zisselman, in fact, felt so at ease he bought even more Storage Equities shares, lowering his average cost to $11.25. At that new $9 purchase price, and despite the dividend cut, Zisselman was now getting paid 9.2 percent to wait for the upturn. As 1992 ended, the stock was still at $9 and insiders were still buying. Zisselman continued to wait. The turn finally arrived in 1993: REITs became hot properties and Storage Equities finally rewarded its believers. It soared to $15. Zisselman's capital gains came to 33 percent, his dividends to almost as much.<p>"I'm more mellow than almost any investor I know," says Zisselman. It hasn't hurt his mood any that his portfolio has returned 15 percent to 20 percent annually for the last 15 years--and that's another aspect of Zisselman's calm. He aims low. Whereas many investors might expect returns as high as 30 percent a year, Zisselman is happy with 10 percent. In 1993, he bought a large position in Philip Morris at $48, right after the company's announcement that it was cutting the price of its flagship Marlboro brand. The stock had traded as high as the low $80s earlier in the year.<p>The investment seemed all but risk-free to Zisselman. "At the time, the ten-year Treasury bond was yielding 5.7 percent, and Philip Morris was yielding 5.4 percent. So I asked: 'In ten years, which is likely to give me a better total return?'" <p><p>habits<p>Time commitment: Seven hours a week.<p>Portfolio size: Seven figures.<p>Reading: Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and Business Week.<p>Trading activity: Five to ten trades a year.<p>Tools: Doesn't chart investments, doesn't use a computer.<p>Portfolio breakdown: 50 percent of liquid assets in bonds, 45 percent of liquid assets in stocks, 5 percent in cash.

A worthwhile tactic for adventurous investors<p>By Rod Fadem<p>The fear of so-called pink-sheet stocks is well founded. They are obscure issues. They trade infrequently and demand is sporadic. So they certainly aren't for the casual investor.<p>But the pink sheets do offer potentially large rewards for serious investors who carefully select undervalued companies that have a good chance of becoming listed on Nasdaq at a later date. What's more, there's a way to do this type of investing that adds some safety: Pick one or more of the handful of financial stocks currently trading at close to their book value. These are the mother lode of the pink sheets. As their stock rises up the ladder of the over-the-counter market, they also typically rise in price.<p>The pink sheets are on the bottom rung of the OTC ladder, a place where dealers trade thousands of companies without any quotes or volume figures appearing on a quote machine or in the newspaper. Instead, the National Quotation Bureau distributes pink sheets to brokerage firms every morning with quotes and dealer telephone numbers for every stock. These stocks sometimes trade only once or twice a month. <p>The next level up is the "bulletin board": an electronic pink-sheet system in which dealers show only bid and ask prices but no volume. It is more likely that a company on the bulletin board will later list on the largest OTC market of them all--Nasdaq.<p>The National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations System is a nationwide network of computer terminals, where market makers enter their quotes on stocks they trade. There are two levels of Nasdaq, one for small-capitalization companies and one for large. To be listed, Nasdaq's small-cap market requires companies to have $4 million in assets, $2 million in stockholder equity, at least 300 shareholders, and a minimum bid price of $3 a share. The large-cap market--known as the Nation<p><p><p>

						By Curtis Hartman<p>Too often, socially responsible investing is like oatmeal: the right thing to do, but not very exciting. Sure, it's become big business recently, with its own newsletters, mutual funds, and even an index that has been outperforming the S&P 500. But the stock-picking methods tend to focus as much on what companies don't do--pollute, discriminate, or contribute to the arms race, for instance--as what they actually do get accomplished. We decided to take a more positive approach. Here are six companies that meet the screens of the socially responsible investor but are also fueled by dynamic visions. Don't worry: we haven't chosen companies that merely do good, but ones that are poised for real growth. <a name="NYSE:SMD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14839"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sunrise medical</b></a> founder richard chandler didn't set out to reinvent the wheelchair; he was just following a hardheaded business plan to grab a bigger share of the market of products for the disabled. Walter Minnick, CEO of <a name="NASD:TJCO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14873"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>TJ International</b></a>, may argue passionately for preserving the old-growth forests of the pacific northwest, but his altruism has a bottom line: saving these forests forces up lumber prices, creating a bigger market for his engineered-wood products. These are companies built for the future, each an innovator in its growing field. but none of them is a wall street favorite. not yet, at least.
SUNRISE MEDICAL<p>When Richard Chandler started torrance, california-based Sunrise Medical (SMD) in 1983, he had a simple plan. He'd seen the demographics: The country was getting older; demand for wheelchairs, crutches, and bathroom aids for the aged and disabled could only grow. And no one company dominated the market. So he borrowed $4.5 million and bought two dozen small companies that made products for the disabled, hoping to create a mini-conglomerate with national marketing clout and economies of scale.<p>Buying the companies was easy, but getting them to work together wasn't. Sales grew to $140 million a year, but profits shrank. Then he went to Japan and came back determined to copy the best of what he'd seen at companies like Toyota and Matsushita. Since then, Chandler has done for the wheelchair what Nike founder Phil Knight, another student of Japanese management style, did for the running shoe. Sunrise Medical now controls 55 percent of the U.S. market in ultralight manual wheelchairs and has under sponsorship 50 disabled athletes who compete in everything from track and field to tennis, took 44 medals at the 1992 Paralympic Games in Barcelona. <p>THE SOCIAL PAYOFF: <p>Chandler's vision is more altruistic than creating the wheelchair version of $120 basketball shoes. He wants to make an entire range of products that improve the customer's daily life and to make them better, more cheaply, and more efficiently.<p>Wheelchairs used to come one size fits all, in one color, black, and one style, clunky. Sunrise chairs are custom-made, each designed around the specific user's height, weight, and performance choices. Its wheelchairs weigh half as much as standard chairs and are made from the same aluminums and carbon fibers used in high-tech racing bikes. But the company makes more than wheelchairs. Sunrise spends $5 million a year on research and development, churning out 60 new products a year. The biggest triumph: a portable toilet that cost $600,000 to develop. Injection molded and made from lightweight composites, it's more comfortable than the conventional metal product, rust-free, and 20 percent cheaper. <p>PROSPECTS: as the u.s. population gets older and more of the disabled insist on integration into the active mainstream, the opportunities can only grow. What's more, any health-care reform from Washington will favor home and nursing-home care and will play to Sunrise's low-cost, product-driven strategy.<p>Chandler's trip to Japan gave him the vision to turn Sunrise into a company built for the 21st century. He shut down or sold off the non-performers, curtailed new acquisitions, and reorganized his work force into self-directed teams. He adopted just-in-time manufacturing, keeping only the inventory he needed for that day's production and shipping product out as soon as it was finished.<p>It worked. Between 1988 and 1992 sales rose 72 percent, up to $244 million, with a 275 percent gain in net income and a 62 percent increase in earnings per share. By 1992, Chandler was ready to start making acquisitions again, launching an ambitious program of global expansion aimed at making Sunrise a $1 billion enterprise by the year 2000. <p>THE INVESTOR'S PERSPECTIVE: until this year, sunrise was a Wall Street darling, trading as high as $38.25, 40 times 1992 earnings. But today the company is out of favor and trading in the high20s, although fiscal 1993 brought record sales of $315 million and earnings per share rose to $1.20. At that price it's a buying opportunity, according to White Mountain Investment's Harold Janeway, who has been accumulating the stock for the Working Assets Fund. <p>Kidder Peabody analyst Joel Ray suggests Sunrise has been a victim of misguided short-term earnings comparisons. Quarterly earnings reports were down in the first two quarters of 1994 because of dilution from a February '93 stock offering and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. But "the bottom line continued to grow," Ray says. He remains "very optimistic" that earnings comparisons and share prices will come back, too, and sets a price target of $30 within the next 12 months, or 20 times his fiscal 1994 earnings estimate of $1.50 per share.<p>
THERMO ELECTRON
A company that makes companies<p>Although he launched Waltham, Massachusetts-based <a name="NYSE:TMO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11473"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Thermo Electron</b></a> (TMO) as a small lab-instrument maker in 1956, George Hatsopoulos had huge ambitions--to spot emerging trends and develop technologies to meet them.<p>In the 1960s that meant transforming heat to power for space exploration. In the '70s, after the oil embargo, the focus broadened to energy conservation of all kinds, such as testing equipment to increase plant efficiency. In the early '80s, Thermo developed technologies to clean up polluted soil, de-ink reycled paper, and monitor air and water pollution. Then the company hit the wall. By 1983, with $200 million in sales, it was too big to keep its entrepreneurial edge. So Hatsopoulos decided to make the business small again, spinning out its divisions one at a time and selling a minority position to the public. <p>There's nothing in the Fortune 500 like it: Over the last decade 12 distinct companies have flowered from Thermo's roots, 8 of them publicly traded today. Hatsopoulos has built a $1.2 billion business not by developing technologies or products but by creating new companies. <p>THE SOCIAL PAYOFF: Thermo is an innovation machine, a $62 million R&D budget supporting some 560 researchers, all of them looking for the next product and the next potential public company: natural-gas trucks and fluorocarbon-free industrial refrigerators, a microwave camera to help helicopter pilots land in fog, a new digital mammographer to speed the diagnosis of breast cancer. Nothing is wasted. The development of a "cardiac assist device" for heart patients yields a bio-compatible plastic that spawns a $4 million business in catheters and tubing, which, in turn, yields a new scent strip for magazines, odorless until broken open, which debuted in Vogue last spring. <p>PROSPECTS: By 1983 thermo had grown too big to move fast. Stock options didn't motivate the research teams anymore; the company was too big for them to connect their work to financial reward. It was getting harder to raise capital, too, since Wall Street penalized it for the R&D drain on earnings. By spinning off divisions and selling between 10 and 20 percent of the equity to the public, Hatsopoulos solved both problems. <p>Other companies spin off divisions, of course--but generally the weakest parts, with the cash going to the parent. Thermo spins out its jewels--businesses promising a 40 percent return on capital within five years--and gives them the IPO cash. Each company runs on its own, with its own executive team and board of directors. Management compensation is tied, through stock options, directly to the market's evaluation of their performance. Thermo provides strategic planning, cash investment, and shareholder relations for all of them, as well as central administrative and legal support, and holds a majority on the board.<p>The results would please any venture capitalist: ten straight years of sales and earnings growth. Hatsopoulos predicts eight more spinoffs by 2000.<p>THE INVESTOR'S PERSPECTIVE:Wall Sreet has been slow to endorse Hatsopoulos's strategy. As recently as 1992 the stock was down to $37 a share, 17 times then-current earnings. But there was value there; the parent company holds between 50 percent and 85 percent of the the equity in its spin-offs. The stock has risen steadily since then, however, as the spin-offs have been growing a collective 20 percent a year, swelling the parent's operating income. But even today--adjusted for a recent three-for-two split--Thermo still sells at a discount; as the value of its spin-offs grows, so does Thermo.<p>Thermo, analysts say, is for the long term. "This is a company I'd buy personally to put my kids through college," says Lisa Rideout, director of investment for the Private Bank, a division of the Bank of Boston. Before the split, NatWest Securities analyst Paul Knight was looking for Thermo's shares to rise to $75 by the end of 1993. "The best years are still ahead," he says. "They could have a 50 percent increase in operating income this year and next and a 35 percent growth rate over the next five years." <p>SALICK HEALTH CARE
Round-the-clock treatment<p>Back in the summer of 1983, Dr. Bernard Salick was in the middle of the biggest deal of his life. One of the pioneers of for-profit medicine, Salick was negotiating to buy back a chain of 24-hour kidney-dialysis centers he had founded and sold a decade before. Then his six-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, was diagnosed with bone cancer, and his focus changed.<p>The months of chemotherapy and surgery that followed brought the family's life to a standstill: There were appointments to be scheduled all over Los Angeles and, eventually, New York--questions about X-rays and drugs, diet and psychology, endless travel and constant frustration. And the costs were staggering, well into five figures for a single week of inpatient care alone.<p>Salick bought his kidney centers, but they would be only a small part of the company he launched after Elizabeth's recovery. Convinced he could design a system to spare cancer patients the nightmare his own family had gone through and cut costs at the same time, he started opening dedicated outpatient diagnostic and treatment centers. Ten are running today--24 hours a day, seven days a week.<p>THE SOCIAL PAYOFF: As an outpatient facility, <a name="NASD:SHCI"></a><b>Salick Health Care</b> (SHCI) saves insurance companies the cost of an expensive hospital stay and lets patients keep as much of their daily routine as possible. Treatment is available around the clock, before school, after work, or over a weekend, and Salick centers offer every aspect of care under one roof, from radiation treatment and chemotherapy to reconstructive breast surgery and psychological counseling. <p>For-profit medicine remains controversial, so Salick Health Care sets up its centers as long-term exclusive alliances with major institutions like Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles or large academic teaching hospitals like the University of Kansas. Instead of hiring its own doctors, Salick provides facilities for physicians affiliated with the hospitals and takes over all of the mechanical aspects of care, as well as offering advice from internationally known specialists in fields such as breast cancer, bone cancer, and solid-tumor treatment.<p>PROSPECTS: Salick has grown steadily at 32 percent a year for the last 5 years, up to $95 million in revenues in fiscal 1992, with a $6.9 million profit and earnings of 88 cents per share. But it's barely touched the market: 1.1 million new cancer cases are diagnosed each year. And managed-care facilities such as Salick's centers are key to every version of health-care reform currently under discussion in Washington.<p>Salick hopes to start two new centers each year and is currently negotiating with several hospitals, including Massachusetts General and UCLA. "It can be hard to get an academic institution like that to make a decision, though," CFO Leslie Bell says. Salick has to convince medical staff, the administrative staff, the trustees, and the private attending doctors, "and they all start out jealous of their turf, believing they are the be-all and end-all." It's good medicine, Salick tells them--better patient care at a lower cost. And it's a good deal: Salick funds the center's development and pays a percentage of its revenues to the allied hospital.<p>THE INVESTOR'S PERSPECTIVE: salick is a growth stock and a value stock, says Joel Ray of Kidder Peabody, the only analyst who tracks the stock. First offered in 1985 at $10 a share, Salick shares were trading last October at just over $15. Still, Ray thinks Salick has a bright prospects. "Earnings will grow erratically," he says. "It costs a lot to get each new center going. But once they're going, they run very efficiently."<p>Rian Fried has been buying Salick for his Clean Yield Mutual Fund since last year. "When Wall Street turns back to health care, its gaze will eventually fall on Salick and precipitate a well-deserved rise in the stock," he predicts. In the past Fried has avoided for-profit health-care chains "because the incentives to compromise quality in search of a profit is too great." But Salick is different, Fried insists, capable of providing "the highest level of care and a comfortable environment without running in the red."<p>TJ INTERNATIONAL
Knocking Wood<p>TJ International (TJCO), based in Boise, Idaho, is the nation's top manufacturer of engineered-wood products. Unlike conventional lumbering, which saws round trees into rectangular products and converts only 40 percent of a tree into structural lumber, TJ peels, shreds, or flakes logs, converting 75 percent of the wood fiber into structural products like beams and floor joists. Rather than cut down the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest--home to the famously endangered spotted owl--TJ uses scrap wood or small second-growth trees, farmable weed species. <p><p>THE SOCIAL PAYOFF: saving the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest doesn't mean killing the home-construction business. "We represent the supply-side response to the spotted-owl problem," says Walter Minnick, TJ's tree-hugging 51-year-old CEO. "Engineered wood is an example of using technology to help solve a very sharp public-policy issue. In an age of vanishing resources, that's compelling logic." What's more, engineered wood is knot-free and stronger than regular lumber. Wal-Mart recently contracted TJ to build the joists for the roof of its prototype "eco-store" in Lawrence, Kansas. TJ boasts that this job alone saved 87 18-inch-diameter, 120-foot-tall trees.<p>Minnick is an anomaly in both the forest-products industry and the environmental movement: He's served on the board of the Wilderness Society and worked in the Nixon White House. Not surprisingly, there's a large degree of enlightened self-interest behind his environmental activism. The government policies that endanger old-growth forests also make regular lumber far cheaper to produce than engineered-wood products. He wants the government to curtail its practice of allowing private lumber companies to cut on public lands at a loss to the taxpayers and advocates setting aside that land for wildlife and recreation. Minnick even has a '90s-style buzz phrase for his new approach: "reinventing the forest." <p><p>PROSPECTS: A lifelong republican, Minnick, not surprisingly, emerged as a strong Clinton backer. Under the Bush and Reagan administrations, when government policies kept timber prices low, engineered-wood products cost up to 90 percent more than regular lumber. But conventional-wood prices have risen steadily since Clinton's inauguration and drastically cut TJ's price disadvantage. So even though the housing market remains slow, TJ is gaining market share. In the first six months of 1993, sales were up 36 percent over the first six months of '92, even as housing starts rose only 3.4 percent.<p>Those numbers have brought Boise Cascade and Louisiana Pacific into the engineered-lumber business. But TJ has a head start on the competition; the company claims two thirds of the current market, a broad distribution network, and the largest direct sales force in the industry. What's more, TJ's capacity is growing, with three current plants expanding, another scheduled to come on-line in 1995, and one more on the drawing boards. <p>THE INVESTOR'S PERSPECTIVE: <p>TJ's shares are priced relative to lumber, not earnings. As lumber goes up, so does the stock. So the price is volatile, capable of moving from $24 (adjusted for an October 4 split) to $20 and back up to $26 within a few weeks. But with lumber prices potentially doubling within the next two years, there is still room for long-term growth. Dennis Moran, who follows the company for A.G. Edwards, is enthusiastic about TJ's prospects: "It will take three things to make this a $100-a-share company--and the first two have already happened," he says. "They need to be producing at full capacity--and they are running three shifts a day, seven days a week. They need lumber prices to approach parity--and that's happened too. Now all they need is for housing starts to move up."<p>
SHAMAN PHARMACEUTICALS
Antifungal in the jungle<p>Most drug-company scientists work in crisp white coats, rarely leaving their high-tech labs. The doctors and ethnobotanists at <a name="NASD:SHMN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15954"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Shaman Pharmaceuticals</b></a> (SHMN) tend to wear jeans and hiking boots and hump through the rain forests of Ecuador or Thailand's Golden Triangle. Their research techniques are essentially anthropological; they look for medicinal plants by following a native healer through the rain forest, videotaping the root he recommends for a cough or cutting a leaf and stem he says soothes a fungus. <p>There is nothing new about medical drugs from plants, of course. Quinine comes from Peru's cinchona tree and digitalis from foxglove; Eli Lilly annually sells $100 million worth of cancer drugs harvested from the rosy periwinkle. But San Francisco-based Shaman's field-driven method of finding them is unique and cost-effective; it only pursues compounds that have been used in three different geographical areas for similar symptoms. "Major pharmaceutical firms typically screen thousands of chemical compounds to find one marketable drug," CEO Elizabeth Conte says. "We screen 100 plants to get 50 with an indication of activity. And these compounds have a long history of use, thousands of years, so it's more likely they'll be safe and active in the clinical process."<p><p>THE SOCIAL PAYOFF:<p>Shaman is a fulfillment of the dreams of environmentalists: a green business that is also good business. It's not just that Shaman develops drugs; the company also provides a market-driven rationale for preserving rain forests in Southeast Asia and the Amazon. By identifying harvestable products, Shaman gives local people a powerful reason to preserve the rain forests, now being cut at a rate of 129,600 acres per day. <p>PROSPECTS: shaman has had an unprecedented hit rate and today holds "perhaps the richest product pipeline ever created in three years," according to SG Warburg's Kevin Wilson. By 1993 Shaman had screened more than 450 plants, 260 of which showed enough activity to warrant further study. Two products, both patented, were moved into clinical trials in record time: one for viral respiratory infections, with a potential U.S. market of $400 million and an international market of $800 million, and a second for herpes, with a market potential of $900 million. A third product, an antifungal, is expected to enter trials soon. <p>Conte is quick to stress that her company has more to offer investors than just a feel-good story. Shaman has a solid cash position, spends it slowly, and has forged alliances with such industry giants as Eli Lilly, Merck, and Italy's Invernio della Beffa. Last spring Richard Ring came to Shaman as COO after 12 years as vice president for product development at Genentech, hired to help Conte bring products to market. <p><p>THE INVESTOR'S PERSPECTIVE:Shaman may be the most politically correct stock currently being traded, but it's also being touted as a good, though highly speculative, growth play. In January, its IPO was well-received enough that it had to be increased from 2.5 million shares at $14 to 3 million shares at $15. Ten months later, it was trading at a dollar or two below the offering cost. <p>At that price, according to the two analysts who cover the stock, Shaman is a buy--even if the company has no products on the market yet and hasn't announced yet when it will. Since the company has no earnings, the only thing investors have to go on are projections. Joyce Albers of First Boston expects Shaman to introduce its antiviral in 1995 and anticipates earnings of 20 cents per share to follow in 1996. In 1997, she's expecting that Shaman will roll out its herpes treatment. Gazing into a crystal ball, she projects sales of $221 million with earnings per share of $4.73 by 1999. Based on the present value of these projected earnings, she's predicting the stock will be at $30 within the next six months. Warburg's Wilson doesn't expect the company to show earnings until 1997 and consequently sets a lower target price of between $20 and $25 for the next six months. But his long-range projections, which include the introduction of the antifungal drug, push the company to $291 million in sales in 1999 and $518 million by 2001 (we said this was a speculative play), with earnings per share of $8.86 and $16.55, respectively. <p>EDUCATIONAL ALTERNATIVES
Learning the bottom line<p>Chris Whittle wasn't the first entrepreneur to look for profit amid the rubble of America's public schools. While Whittle's vaunted Edison Project begins to look more and more like an Edsel project, another company, <a name="NYSE:EAI"></a><b>Educational Alternatives Inc.</b> (EAI), is already teaching students--and turning a profit. Its founder, John Golle, spent seven years developing and testing a for-profit education model and has been running nine public schools in inner-city Baltimore since 1992. <p>Unlike Whittle, who aims to build expensive new private schools from the ground up, EAI's John Golle works within the system--taking over public schools and making them work by changing classroom dynamics and eliminating administrative waste. In addition to its five-year, $134 million contract with the Baltimore schools, EAI also operates a pilot school in Miami.<p><p>THE SOCIAL PAYOFF: All children are capable of learning well, Golle insists, but only if schools are set up to meet the needs of students, not for the convenience of administrators, politicians, or bureaucrats. Golle's goals aren't just profits. "It's personal," he says. He's driven by the anger and frustration he felt watching his own learning-disabled son struggle unhappily through the public schools in the early '80s. "They tried to change him to fit and took away his self-esteem and his love of learning," Golle says bitterly. "Today my son is a statistic on some educator's chart."<p>Golle made big promises. The Minneapolis-based EAI would go into one of inner-city Baltimore's grittiest neighborhoods and take over eight elementary schools and one middle school, promising to boost attendance, restore order, involve parents, and improve student skills. And they'd do it in the existing buildings, with the existing staff, and just slightly over the school district's budget: $5,549 annually for each of some 4,800 kids.<p>EAI's initial reforms were hardly radical. Golle cleaned the halls, fixed the toilets, and installed cameras and security guards to monitor entrances and halls. Then class size was cut to 15, and classroom walls were taken out; rows of desks were grouped into small clusters and surrounded by computers. Grades and even grade levels were taken out, too. Each student was tested and then given a personal learning plan, developed and reviewed in regular teacher-parent conferences. <p>EAI's trademarked teaching system, Tesseract, costs more per student than the existing system, but the company saves money by eliminating waste elsewhere. Unionized custodians were let go; maintenance was subcontracted to a private service. Unionized teacher's aides were replaced by better trained and less expensive education-student interns. The accounting firm Peat Marwick was hired to provide systems for staffing, purchasing, and finance. It took until last February to get Tesseract into classrooms, but in the program's first three months, the average student advanced almost 90 percent of a full grade level--nearly three times the benchmark. <p>PROSPECTS: The Baltimore superintendent of schools is already looking for ways to give EAI more work. And there are 14,000 school districts in America, all potential EAI customers, "but it's not an easy sell," Golle says. Most public schools are conservative, battled over by school boards, superintendents, politicians, unions, teachers, and parents. <p>Golle says selling is getting easier as glowing reports from Baltimore--and Wall Street--spread. At the end of fiscal 1993, EAI turned its first profit, sending its stock up 50 percent. On the new-business front, EAI is currently in negotiation with school districts in California, Wisconsin, Florida, and Arkansas, with nine potential contracts ranging from $25 million to $225 million each.<p><p>THE INVESTOR'S PERSPECTIVE: eai is a good long-term speculative buy, given "its leadership position in a potentially huge market," says Mitali Shrivastava of Franklin Insight. Initially offered at $5 a share in 1991, by October EAI was trading in the low 30s. Shrivastava predicts 30 percent annual growth over the long term, but EAI is still a volatile stock. Depending on which contracts the company signs, earnings could range from 60 cents to $3.42. <p>Michael Moe of Dain Bosworth compares EAI's prospects to those of a biotech firm. "It's hard to get people to try something new," he says. "But Golle is a visionary. This could be a $1 billion company in five years; I can't think of another company with that potential." <p><p>

The easy pickings may be over for contrary investors, simply because there are now so many of us.<p>By Leo H. Dworsky<p>Nineteen Ninety-four could be a difficult year for contrarians. For one thing, there are now too many of us. Years of grazing off undervalued stocks in a long bull market have fattened our bellies and increased our numbers. Contrary opinion is in favor. We have become a crowd, a bunch of walking oxymorons. <p>What is going to happen? Perhaps the same thing that happens in the natural world when one species becomes overpopulated. Numbers will be winnowed, probably by a combination of harsher climate, insufficient nourishment, and the predation of rival species. <p>The $64 billion question is: Has the practice of buying stocks that are out of favor become the conventional wisdom? And if so, how can contrarians, who normally feed off the conventional wisdom, survive a situation in which they may have quietly become the majority and are, in effect, feeding off themselves?<p>Note the plethora of contrarians in the world today. It used to be that the species was limited to cabdrivers, Vermonters, and curmudgeons of a certain age. Now they (we) are everywhere: in banks, insurance companies, and wherever money is managed. David Dreman, a well-known contrarian, manages billions of dollars for individuals and institutions. Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., another contrarian, was managing $21 billion at recent count. And the Fidelity Contrafund, a relative pip-squeak a decade ago, passed the $5 billion mark this past year. The Contrary Opinion Forum, an annual Vermont event now in its 31st year, had a record turnout last fall. Worst of all, there are now contrary-opinion columns in Forbes, SmartMoney, and, alas, in our own publication. Heaven help us all.<p>There are two possible solutions to this dilemma. The benign solution, which I recommend, would have a significant portion of us volunteer to change spots; if not forever, at least for the time being. We might agree, for the next year or so, not to invest in out-of-favor stocks but to consider instead growth, quality, and uniqueness (even if already somewhat recognized) or perhaps even cash.<p>If we don't do this, a less benign script may unfold. Contrarians, insisting on stocks that are out of favor, may find themselves with stocks that deserve to be out of favor. If there is one major weakness in contrary investing, it is the tendency to buy too soon--on the way down but well before the turn. Contrarians are often too preoccupied with the fact that a stock is unpopular and not sufficiently sensitive to the reality of a changing underlying trend. <p>Let me be specific. Four major stock groups are out of favor in the current market, and probably for good reason. They are retail, tobacco, packaged foods, and drugs. In all four cases I expect the problems to persist throughout 1994 and perhaps well beyond.<p>The retail group has had its stars, but overall the trend has been negative. <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:HD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11470"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Depot</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:MES"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10984"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Melville</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:LTD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11471"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>the Limited</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:DDS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10463"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dillard Department Stories</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:DH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10440"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dayton-Hudson</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:LDS"></a><b>Longs Drug</b>, and <a name="NYSE:DFI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13243"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Duty Free International</b></a>, among many others, have come a cropper during the past year. In my view, the outlook for most of these stocks and for the retail industry in general is likely to deteriorate further. <p>Why? Because the American consumer, upon whom retailers depend, faces three whopping problems in 1994. Problem one: Materially higher taxes in the upper brackets, affecting not only the well-to-do but those who use them as role models. Keeping up with the Joneses is an honorable American tradition, but first the Joneses must buy something. Problem two: The crash in short-term interest rates, which has meant lower income for retirees and others who rely on their capital. Problem three: The double-barreled impact of disemployment--the real impact on the buying power of the unemployed and the psychological impact on those who fear they too will lose their jobs. There's also a trend toward lower-paying jobs. Positions for middle managers are disappearing, while employment for night watchmen, health care workers, and french fry cooks is growing. Whatever else happens next year, I expect consumer spending to be disappointing.<p>The tobacco situation is pretty straightforward: a growing bias against smoking in the United States reinforced by much higher cigarette taxes and an increased concern with smoking-related health costs. Just because <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a> lost nearly half its value in the last year doesn't make it attractive, other than as a tax-loss bounce. It has long-term problems in tobacco and probably also in its giant food business (Miller Brewing, Kraft General Foods). <p>The packaged-food industry is full of stocks that are now out of favor: J.M. Smucker, <a name="NYSE:BCU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10225"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Borden</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:RAL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11254"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ralston Purina</b></a>, Pet, <a name="NYSE:CAG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10388"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Conagra</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:CPC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10268"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CPC International</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:CQB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11551"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chiquita Brands</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:GRB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10650"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gerber Products</b></a>, etc. Even Heinz, <a name="NYSE:GIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10639"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Mills</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:K"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10841"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kellogg</b></a>, blue chips all, have languished for more than a year now. Different companies have different problems, but all of them suffer from the squeeze on consumer income and the growing encroachment of private labels, not to mention increasing competition within their ranks. These stocks could remain out of favor for some time to come. <p>Finally, there are the major drug companies. As is well-known, drug prices increased at three times the rate of inflation during the past decade, which, along with steadily growing demand, produced exceptional earnings growth. Under any government health plan, demand will continue to grow, but the era of pricing freedom is over. Merck, the industry leader, has certified this reality by offering to acquire Medco Containment Services, a cut-rate drug provider, for an incredible $6 billion.<p>Drug stocks may not go down in the next year. They have already been through a two- year wringer. But other than the occasional, unexpected drug blockbuster, there is no reason for them to go up very much. The squeeze on margins will continue to squeeze the p in p/e ratios. <p>About 400 years ago, in Shakespeare's Henry VI, Dick the Butcher declared: "The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers." He might have said "kill all the contrarians" except we weren't a certified guild in those Elizabethan times. If Dick the Butcher exists today, he is in the market itself, ready to kill any orthodox contrarians who blithely come his way. Contrarians should keep this in mind as they wend their way through 1994. Go light on contrary opinion and heavier on some of the other investment styles. Let the other fellow buck the fundamentals.<p>Leo H. Dworsky, an editor-at-large for Worth, has been observing markets--with a skeptical eye--for many years.<p> <p><p>

Worth magazine/Features<p>DOES THE BOSS PAYOFF? 
To canny investors, it isn't how much a CEO makes, but how much he delivers<p>By Graef Crystal<p>The end of the cold war brought tough times to California-based defense contractor <a name="NYSE:ROK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11283"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Rockwell International</b></a>. After rising consistently during the early '80s to a high of around $30 in April 1987, the company's stock had drifted steadily downward. By April 1992 it was languishing at $23.63. Someone needed to pull the stock out of the dumps. Who better for the job than the company's CEO, Donald R. Beall? A 54-year-old engineering whiz who took over at Rockwell in 1988, Beall knew the company--and its problems--inside out. <p>To make sure Beall concentrated on fixing those problems, the board of directors voted him a monster stock option--two grants covering 320,000 shares. Half the shares carried a strike price (what Beall would have to pay to buy the shares) of $24.50, the market price of Rockwell stock on the date of the grant. The other half carried a strike price of $31.50. This meant that Rockwell's stock would have to appreciate by 29 percent before Beall would make any money on this half of his grant.<p>In early April 1993, roughly a year after the grant, Rockwell's stock hit $31.50. In mid-September, the price was hovering near $36. Shareholders had to be pleased. <p>But was Beall's performance worth its cost? After all, in one year, the board had given Beall a little more than $4 million--and he had seen his 320,000 options appreciate as well. Did the Rockwell board--and shareholders--get good value for that money?<p>Pondering that question raises even larger ones. Can investors identify good and bad stocks based on what a company pays its CEO? Are excessively paid CEOs good for shareholders or bad? A return-on-CEO-pay ratio would give investors a way to measure companies much like the more common return-on-equity ratio. After all, it's not the size of a pay package that should concern investors. It's the return on the pay package--the relationship between the pay and the performance--that counts.<p>To see if a return-on-CEO-pay ratio could in fact be constructed, I studied the compensation paid to the CEOs of the country's 200 largest corporations. In each case, I measured the compensation against the performance of the company's stock. My first conclusion: Big compensation packages, by and large, are not closely related to good performance. In fact, some of the best CEOs, from a shareholder's point of view, are underpaid. An investor interested in reaping above-average returns might simply invest in these overachievers. <p>Nor are compensation packages closely related to the size of companies. The disparities among payouts to CEOs in similar circumstances were much greater than I had expected. Indeed, about 89 percent of the variation in CEO pay levels was pure noise; it had nothing to do with company size or executive performance. Clearly, ten years of investors and corporations battling over executive compensation hasn't gotten us far. <p>Yet some big investors have declared victory in the executive-compensation wars. It makes me think of that Childe Hassam painting of Fifth Avenue festooned with American flags: "The fight is over, and we've won!" As proof that the battle is won, institutional investors display the scalps of recently departed CEOs John Akers of <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>, James Robinson III of <a name="NYSE:AXP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10085"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Express</b></a>, and Paul Lego of <a name="NYSE:WX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11627"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Westinghouse</b></a>.<p>But if the war is over and institutional investors and shareholder activists have won, then why did the median pay package for 180  major-company CEOs increase by 21.6 percent between fiscal 1992 and 1993? (All compensation figures are based on a company's fiscal year. For details on what's included in my compensation calculations, see "Calculating Return on CEO Pay.") That 21.6 percent increase far exceeds the median return of 11.4 percent that shareholders in these 200 companies received during the same period.<p>Although this comparison seems clear-cut, deciding exactly who was "overpaid" and by how much in the world of executive jets and multimillion-dollar bonuses isn't easy. The fairest way to judge all these CEOs is against the pay and performance of their peers. To do that, I calculated the average compensation of the 200 CEOs in my study (after doing a little statistical cleanup to eliminate anomalies like the low-paid owner-CEO Warren Buffett and the extremely well-paid Sanford Weill): $3.2 million a head, or $640 million for all 200 heads. I then redistributed that $640 million on the basis of just two factors: company size and company performance. I placed 75 percent of the weight on company performance. That gave me a figure representing what each CEO should have earned.<p>I used that figure to select my ten best CEOs for 1992, those who returned a lot for their pay in comparison to their colleagues. I looked for chiefs who had held their jobs for at least three years and who combined a modest pay package with a performance in the top quarter of the 200-company study group.<p>How about the ten worst CEOs? My first cut yielded a list of executives who performed in the lowest quarter and who had been overpaid by $1 million or more. But five of those, interestingly, are CEOs no longer, and therefore not of much interest to current investors. Four retired, resigned, or were ousted: Kenneth H. Olsen of Digital Equipment, Akers of IBM, Robinson of American Express, and Richard K. Eamer of <a name="NASD:NMFS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=43108"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>National Medical Enterprises</b></a>. The fifth, Theodore Cooper of Upjohn, died.<p>I replaced those unfortunates with five CEOs a little bit further down the overall list; they were in the bottom third in performance and overpaid by at least $750,000.<p>The difference between the two groups--the best and the worst--is pretty striking. The median CEO on the ten-worst list earned $4.2 million last year; the median ten-best CEO earned $2.9 million. Yet, the median CEO on the ten-worst list earned a performance IQ score of 89, 11 percent below average. Of the 200 companies studied, only 17 percent had a score this low. The median CEO on the ten-best list earned a score of 112. Of the 200 companies studied, only 18 percent scored this high.<p>The median CEO on the ten-worst list earned $1.8 million more last year than he was entitled to, based on company size and his (there were no women in my sample of CEOs) return to shareholders. Put another way, he was paid a little less than twice as much as he was worth.<p>As bad as all these averages and medians sound, the actual details--particularly surrounding the ten-worst CEOs--are likely to be even more aggravating to investors. Consider John A. Georges, the CEO of <a name="NYSE:IP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10800"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>International Paper</b></a>. In 1992, he received a grant of 112,632 stock options designed to boost his long-term performance and a grant of contingent shares worth $529,463, again to motivate his long-term performance. Generous?Yes. Generous enough?No. That same year he received $205,494 under a third plan to reward him for his past performance. All this came on top of a hefty annual bonus of $555,000.<p>Clearly, Georges is doing well.But what about his stockholders? Georges, who has been running International Paper for nine years, earned a performance IQ score of 93, putting his performance below all but 32 percent of my sample. How would Georges have ranked if he hadn't been so generously motivated?<p>Some CEOs get fired for performing like Georges. Others receive even greater rewards. <p>Roughly seven years ago William P. Stiritz, head of Ralston Purina, was promised $16 million worth of free shares if he could get his company's stock up to $50 per share and keep it there for ten consecutive trading days. He did so, though he was aided, at least in part, by his decision to buy back more than 50 percent of his company's shares. But a curious thing happened. Once he reached his goal and took title to his $16 million in shares, his company's stock price leveled off and soon began to decline. The stock recently traded near 40.<p>If Stiritz is still hanging on to the $16 million of free shares, they are worth only about $13 million today. Still, that's a nice payoff for performing in the bottom 16 percent of the 200 companies in my study group.<p>The ten-worst list also seems to be pointing to some emerging underperformers. These "faded glories" include pharmaceutical makers <a name="NYSE:BMY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10232"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bristol-Myers Squibb</b></a> and Syntex. What turns a CEO into a faded glory? In both of these cases, a disturbing change in the trend line of the CEO's performance scores. The performance scores for ten-year total return were, respectively, 106 for Richard L. Gelb at Bristol-Myers Squibb and 100 for Paul E. Freiman at Syntex, or slightly above average on a very long-term basis. But for the one-year period ending 1992, both men's scores dropped sharply, to 81 and 73, respectively. <p>If the ten-worst list is dominated by stories of underperformance and overpayment, the ten-best list is full of CEOs who took home comparatively little. John F. Woodhouse, the CEO of food distributor <a name="NYSE:SYY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11423"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sysco</b></a>, apparently doesn't need much of a financial boost to run his company well. His only long-term incentive was an option grant on 4,494 shares. One high-performing CEO, Josh S. Weston of <a name="NYSE:AUD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10148"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Automatic Data Processing</b></a>, received no long-term incentives whatsoever in 1992.<p>In a class by himself is <a name="NYSE:AVP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10152"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Avon Products</b></a> chief James E. Preston. He agreed to cut his annual bonus and to freeze his salary for five years in return for a greater grant of stock options. He won big, but so did stockholders:Avon's shares rank in the top 18 percent of the 200 companies in my study group based on performance.<p>Two other CEOs on our list have also turned in first-rate performances for shareholders over the long term. John H. Bryan has been at the helm of <a name="NYSE:SLE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11323"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sara Lee</b></a> since February 1975. During those 18 years, Bryan has engineered a compounded total return for his investors of 24 percent a year, enough to rank him higher than all but 11 percent of the companies in my study group for this same period. The other star performer is D. Wayne Calloway, head of <a name="NYSE:PEP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11166"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PepsiCo.</b></a> Beginning May 31, 1986, and ending July 31, 1993, Calloway produced a compounded total return of 20.3 percent per year.<p>Two of the CEOs who would have made our ten-worst list had they still been top dog--Kenneth Olsen and John Akers--show how a little knowledge about executive pay can help investors quite a lot. It's neither the absolute amount of the compensation nor even the nature of it that investors ought to consider when evaluating the performance of a company's CEO. It's the pattern that develops over time as a board rewards a CEO.<p>I used to be a consultant to Kenneth Olsen, the ex-CEO of Digital Equipment. If I brought up the subject of bonuses, he became apoplectic. "Annual bonuses pit brother against brother, and they lead to short-term decision-making, which is lethal in our business," he declared. So computer maker Digital relied instead upon base salaries and stock options, the latter of which were supposed to provide a long-term incentive. <p>Nice idea, but it didn't work for Digital. When the 67-year-old Olsen, whose 1992 total compensation came to $5.7 million, announced his retirement in July 1992, Digital was about to announce its third consecutive quarterly loss and a $1.5 billion "restructuring charge" for the layoff of 20,000 workers. Digital's stock had declined below $40 from its 1987 peak of $199.<p>Not that paying bonuses is a guarantee of splendid returns. In fiscal 1992, IBM paid its now-departed CEO John Akers a bonus of $375,000, even though he lost the company $5 billion that year. That gives new irony to the electronic memo Akers circulated to IBM's workers in June 1991. "When everyone realizes that IBM is a business, run by businessmen, and affected by the business environment and not a fraternity or club they've joined with lifetime benefits, then we can parade into the future to reap earned rewards," Akers wrote. If the board of directors is willing to pay $375,000 for a $5 billion loss, imagine the bonus they'd be willing to deliver for breaking even. Small wonder that Louis V. Gerstner jumped at the chance to become Akers's successor.<p>Unfortunately, the directors sitting on the boards of the companies on our ten-worst list seem to reward their CEOs' underperformance. The median CEO on this list received stock options in 1992 that had an estimated present value of $1.5 million--virtually triple that of either the best CEOs or the 180 other CEOS.<p>One proposed accounting rule might change this kind of counterintuitive thinking. The Financial Accounting Standards Board wants to require companies to reduce their reported earnings by the estimated value of stock-option grants. Were underperforming companies required to take a big hit to their earnings every time they tried to bail out a poor-performing CEO, they might change their behavior.<p>Clearly, the battle over executive pay isn't over. And it never will be until the typical CEO starts putting his company's fortunes--and his shareholders'--before his own. In the meantime, investors large and small should consider avoiding the shares of companies that overpay subpar CEOs. Who knows?That might just get their boards' attention.

						 ***NOTE TO AOL READERS***
Due to the technical limitations of AOL, we are unable to upload the charts and tables for this story.  <p>
By Robert Clark<p>Mutual funds were supposed to make investing easier. no more. like fast food and personal pagers, America's favorite investment vehicle is starting to look like another good idea gone berserk. At last count, there were 4,300 funds competing for our savings and retirement dollars, more than the total number of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange combined. Investors trying to choose the best funds are now forced to cut through a beauty pageant of sales pitches and performance claims.<p>The task has become so complicated it's almost tempting to recommend avoiding stock funds entirely. There are just too darn many of them. But $391 billion (the amount that has flowed into mutual funds so far this year) can't be all wrong. And with money market funds and certificates of deposit offering returns that hardly outpace inflation, the mutual fund is unavoidable. <p>But not every fund out there is going to turn up a winner. In the short run, a broad market correction could wreak havoc in the whole industry, making even the paltry gains offered by CDs look good. A 2 percent return is, after all, a lot better than a 20 percent loss. So it's important to pick the right fund and to know exactly what you want to get out of your fund before going in. Understand that mutual funds are long-term tools for building assets. They should be timed in years, not months or weeks. If you want to try for a quick killing, go to the racetrack.<p>If you're serious about investing, the thing you need is a good strategy. Currently, the most popular approach among investors is to pick funds that already have stellar track records and hope the performance continues. Statistics about past performance are readily available in many newspapers and magazines. <p>But while the past is prologue, it is not always the best guide. Suppose a fund's past success has left it with more money than it can now properly manage. Or suppose its strategy works great in one kind of market but not in another. Or suppose the boss who ran a hot fund left his job six months ago only to be replaced by an incompetent fool. In 1989, the <a name="FUND:STIVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/STIVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lexington Strategic Investment fund</b></a> returned 61.2 percent to investors. The next year, it lost 43.3 percent. The year after that, it was down another 18.9 percent.<p>It's also a pretty good bet the next ten years won't look anything like the last ten, when practically everyone turned up a winner. Leading stock funds returned in the neighborhood of 20 percent a year, while the leading bond funds nearly beat the S&P 500 stocks. We can't predict the future, but it's a fairly safe bet those two things will not happen again.<p>Just looking at past performance also ignores other important factors--like the fees and tax advantages associated with various funds. Hefty customer charges can easily turn a winning stock market performance into a mediocre return. Taxes can eat up the rest. <p>Fortunately, there's a much better way to select funds--one that considers past performance but doesn't entirely rely on it, either. Our system begins from a different place altogether: the specific needs of the investor. The most important question we ask is, Why are you investing in the first place? <p>Is it to save up for a house? To build a retirement fund? To send your children to college? Or is it because you need a steady stream of income now? The objective is critical because it suggests a time frame for your investment strategy. And that's the real key to selecting the right mutual fund: the time frame.<p>Why?<p>The amount of time you have is what dictates how much risk you should take or, to put it another way, how much stability you should seek in a fund. Once you understand those factors, you'll be able to make better decisions. It's sort of like knowing what you are going to use a car for before you race off to the dealer to buy one.<p>In general, the shorter the time frame, the less risk you can afford, so the more you'll want a fund that delivers consistent performance. Investors with longer time frames, on the other hand, can usually accept more risk and less stability in order to earn a higher long-run payoff. <p>Suppose you want to save for a down payment on a house. That probably means you'll want to be able cash out in two or three years. That short a period gives you little margin for error--unless you're willing to keep postponing the purchase. The best buy for this type of investment is a fund that will deliver steady upward performance. It also means avoiding funds with large up-front commissions. You won't earn them back. <p>Conversely, funding a retirement that's still 20 years away means neither consistency nor up-front commissions are as big a deal. If year 12 is a bad one, there's plenty of time for the market to recover. Instead, the enemies of long-term investing are consistently poor performance and high annual expenses, both of which can seriously erode a fund's ability to provide compounded returns. <p>Finally, if your investment horizon is somewhere in the middle, say four to ten years, you'll want a fund that offers a balance between both extremes. Solid performance with reasonable consistency. <p>So, with the help of Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, we've developed a rating system specifically designed to identify funds that are best suited to each investment strategy: short range, medium term, and long haul. Our system selects the funds that offer the best chance of meeting investors' specific needs.<p>To do this, we looked at 572 funds from four perspectives. The first is past performance, including three-, five-, and ten-year annualized returns. The second is what the fund charges in the way of up-front commissions and annual fees. Third is risk, which we measure based on the consistency of a fund's performance, as well as its largest loss. Last, we take a look at management. We evaluate this based on a manager's tenure, the size of the fund, and the rate of buying and selling in a fund, called turnover. <p>Probably the most conservative feature of our system is that we only evaluate funds with at least a ten-year history. That way, we can be confident that we've seen how a fund has performed under a variety of conditions. It also helps weed out funds that have succeeded on pure luck. Yes, there are some good funds with less than ten years under their belt. But why take a chance on one of these when there are so many good ones with proven track records?<p>To find out which mutual funds will do best in different time frames, we weight our grades to emphasize different factors. For short-term investors (one to three years), we focus on consistency, the largest one-quarter loss, and the up-front commission. For mid-term investors (four to ten years), we increase the emphasis on performance while decreasing the emphasis on the commission. For long-term investors (more than ten years), we place a heavier weighting on performance and expenses. <p>In this issue, you'll also find a special worksheet that will help you build a custom portfolio, depending on your own specific objectives. It's a personalized approach for investors who know that solutions that are right for others may not be right for them.<p>It's important to keep in mind that you don't need precise projections to plan a portfolio of funds. Instead, you simply need to make reasonable assumptions, save regularly, make solid investments, and monitor your progress. Every couple of years, you may want to make adjustments if the performance of your portfolio has been below expectations or if the costs of your goals have risen faster than expected. When doing so, however, keep in mind that a portfolio that's running ahead of schedule should be treated as a cushion for any down years, not an opportunity to scale back.<p>If you're planning for the long term, the best advice we can give is not to meddle too much once you've adopted a strategy. If you are planning for retirement, assume that you won't be touching this money until you are 65. If it looks like you want out early, there'll be some options. If you work longer, you'll simply have more money. <p>How much will you need? Few people want to retire on less income than they have now. Yet most also find their expenses after retirement are lower. Retirees no longer need life or disability insurance, their mortgage may be paid off, and they won't have to save anymore. Investors should assume they'll need a post-retirement income equal to about 75 percent of current income. (And don't count on help from the government. If you haven't already, it's time to face the fact that Social Security may not be there to help.)<p>To assure that you'll have a portfolio large enough to support yourself at the 75 percent rate, you'll want the equivalent of at least ten times your current income. That assumes that your portfolio will pay an average return of about 7.6 percent a year, which is a fairly safe guess. According to Ibbotson Associates in Chicago, the stock market historically returns about 10.2 percent a year over a long time. And the bond market historically returns 4.8 percent.<p>The only question remaining is how to get there. And that's what our worksheet is designed to help you do. It tells investors how to use the rules of thumb outlined above to calculate how much they need to invest for each goal. And we show you which mutual funds we consider the best for each investment time frame. <p>We also offer a few solutions for investors who find that the savings required by all their goals is more than they can handle. First, we suggest revising their needs and extending the time to meet them. But if that doesn't work, we offer one last alternative: investing in funds that offer the best possible chance for super-high returns.<p>Historically, the only assets that have outperformed the market are the stocks of small companies. The folks at DFA Research tell us that since 1926, the stocks of small companies have returned about 12 percent a year, compared with 10 percent for the S&P 500 stocks. That extra 2 percent may not seem like very much, but over many years it can have a dramatic effect on a portfolio and therefore the amount an investor needs to save from each paycheck to reach a specific goal. But that 2 percent also represents significantly higher risk. For these motivated--and, we might suggest, younger--investors, we offer a fourth grouping: mutual funds that own companies that average no more than $350 million in market capitalization (the total value of a company's stock). There are not many funds that do this well, so we only list five. <p>Our approach to tailoring a portfolio can also be adapted to stock investing, as long as investors buy an array of stocks broad enough to cushion the blow from any serious mistakes. Short-term investing is probably most suited to conservative bonds and preferred or utility stocks, while a mid-term portfolio could also include conservative common stocks, particularly those that pay high dividends. (Zero-coupon bonds are also excellent tools for college investing.) Long-term investing lends itself to placing more aggressive bets on growth or value stocks, where the risk is higher but the potential gains are high enough to outdistance inflation. <p>It's a system designed to take mutual fund investors from their needs through solid planning to specific solutions.<p>-------------------------------------------
Robert Clark is a senior editor at Worth. <p><p>The Ultrasafe Funds<p>Investors are understandably nervous today about where the markets are headed. With stocks reaching new highs regularly, price-to-earning ratios approaching historic levels, bond returns rivaling stocks over the past ten years, and interest rates more likely to go up than down, we're entitled to our jitters. Some pundits tell us that the fact we're nervous is a positive sign--it means we haven't succumbed to the unbridled optimism typically found during the last leg of a bull market. But such assurances don't seem reassuring at all.<p>Nervous or not, people making regular investments to meet their financial needs should stay the course. After all, systematic investing, such as dollar-cost averaging, was designed to see us through trying times like these.<p>The alternative to staying the course--trying to time the market, anticipating its ups and downs--is difficult at best, dangerous at worst. Market timing is just a form of predicting the future, a skill that no one to date has proven proficient at over the long haul.<p>But what about investors who have sold a house, changed jobs, or inherited a windfall, and find themselves with a sizable amount of cash to invest now? With money market and CD yields so low these days, putting the money there doesn't seem a viable solution. Consequently, we formulated the Worth ratings to identify those mutual funds that have the best chance of beating money market rates while providing a safe haven from which you can move capital into the markets more aggressively when you feel like it.<p>First, we asked the mutual fund analysis firm of Morningstar in Chicago to set up the Worth system to emphasize fund consistency and low loads; this gave us a list of consistently performing bond funds. Then we screened for funds that own  bonds with less than two-year maturities. Short-term bonds are far less sensitive than their long-term brethren are to moves in interest rates, particularly those upward movements that can reduce a bond owner's principal.<p>The result is the list of funds here, which offers investors an alternative to the stock and the long-term bond markets while providing the potential for attractive returns. The perfect place to park your nest egg until times are a little less trying.
--R.C.<p><p>BREAKING INTO A CLOSED FUND<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>
To groucho marx, the only club worth joining was one that wouldn't have him as a member. And a lot of investors feel the same way about mutual funds. Nothing is as enticing as a fund that has closed its doors to new investors. The attraction becomes irresistible when a closed fund such as <a name="FUND:LDDVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/LDDVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lindner Dividend</b></a> or <a name="FUND:ACRNX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ACRNX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Acorn</b></a> comes out on top of a mutual fund rating, as both have done this year. "People want what they can't have," says Eric Ryback, who manages the Lindner Dividend, which stopped accepting new investors in March. <p>Fortunately, there are several ways that investors can crack open a closed fund. Funds close to new investors for several reasons, most of which make the fund a better place to invest. A manager will close a fund if it threatens to grow too big or if the market has bid up the types of securities the fund buys to unacceptable levels. Sometimes funds close because the manager finds the overall market too risky. Managers may close a fund only to open it up again when conditions change. Others are closed permanently. <p>How can new investors get in? Some funds that have closed will accept new investors who simply try very hard. "If an investor is so determined to get in that they write you long letters explaining why they want to be in your fund, then they are a valued customer," says a star manager of a closed fund who asked for anonymity. "If a fund allows those kinds of people in, they're customers for life."<p>Some closed funds make an exception for spouses, siblings, parents, children, or in some cases grandparents of an existing shareholder. Ace portfolio manager Ralph Wanger of the $1.9 billion Acorn Fund says, "Most funds won't do a lot of detective work [to ensure a new shareholder is really a relative]. We're not about to hire a bunch of unemployed Russian secret police to make sure nobody insults us by giving us what we want."<p>Another way to break open a closed fund: Have a friend who is an existing shareholder in the fund--or even a stranger contacted through a classified ad--transfer shares to you. A fund can't stop a shareholder from transferring ownership unless a fund's registration statement specifically prohibits it. In fact, San Diego discount broker Jack White Co.'s Connect program matches buyers with sellers of closed funds, although they don't seek sellers for specific funds. There's some paperwork involved in transferring shares and getting the new account established. But once you're in, you're in forever. Most funds don't limit additional purchases, even to shareholders who own just one share.<p>Here's a list of some of the top funds in the Worth guide that are closed but perhaps not impenetrable: <p>Acorn Fund. Invest in Acorn's sister fund, <a name="FUND:ACINX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ACINX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Acorn International</b></a>, and you can later transfer into Acorn. There's a 2 percent redemption charge on the international fund if the transfer is made less than 60 days after an initial investment.<p><a name="FUND:JAVTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JAVTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus Venture</b></a>. If you're a sibling, parent, child, or spouse of an existing shareholder, Janus Venture will let you in.<p><a name="FUND:LOMCX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/LOMCX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CGM Capital Development</b></a>. Permits transfers to relatives.<p>Lindner Dividend. Manager Ryback says his fund is hermetically sealed but admits that a handful of "hard luck" cases--people who had account applications sitting around for a year until receiving their retirement money--have squeaked through. Ryback expects to reopen his fund to new investors early next year.<p>-------------------------------------------------<p>
The Top Five Fund Chiefs<p>By Jim Jubak<p>
Ralph Wanger, manager, no. 1 long-term fund<p>Biography<p>Born in 1934 in Chicago. Joined the mutual fund industry in 1960 when Irving Harris of Harris Associates offered him a job: "Sounds great. What do we do?" said Wanger. Manager of Acorn Fund from its inception in 1970, first for Harris Associates and then for Wanger Asset Management. <p>Fund Objective<p>Small-company growth fund that concentrates on long-term capital gains.<p>Fund Strategy<p>"We are eclectic," says Wanger, who practices both growth and value investing. "Just because you like lobster doesn't mean you won't eat steak." Wanger style is research intensive: Acorn's portfolio is always full of companies that no one else has heard of. Up to 25 percent of the portfolio can be in foreign stocks.<p>Worth Rating: 9.530<p>Wanger's long-term record is second to none--Acorn has returned an average of 17.4 percent annually over the last ten years. Important for long-term investors, Wanger's minimal turnover (just 25 percent a year), low expenses, and zero load put more of an investor's money to work in the market.<p>Current Favorites<p>Wanger is still holding two of his biggest winners, <a name="NYSE:IGT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13812"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>International Game Technology</b></a> (IGT) and <a name="NASD:LBTYA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=51395"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Liberty Media A </b></a>(LBTYA). Foreign favorites include Electrobras, the Brazilian utility, and Cafe de Coral, a Hong Kong fast-food chain.<p>Caveats<p>Wanger closed the Acorn Fund to new investors in July 1990. Assets are now at $1.9 billion.  Wanger launched Acorn International in September 1992; the fund holds many of the same foreign stocks as the Acorn Fund. Acorn International already has $500 million in assets.<p>
ROBERT RODRIGUEZ, MANAGER, NO. 1 HIGH-RETURN FUND<p>Biography<p>Born in 1948 in Los Angeles. University of Southern California. Started managing money in 1974. Has managed <a name="FUND:FPPTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FPPTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>FPA Capital</b></a> for First Pacific Advisors since 1984. <p>Fund Objective<p>To maximize total return for long-term investors who aren't afraid of volatility. The fund was down by 31 percent in the third quarter of 1990.<p>Fund Strategy<p>Rodriguez calls himself a classic value investor. "I prospect in areas that are out of favor" to find stocks with low price-to- earnings, low price-to-book- value, and low price-to-cash-flow ratios. Typically, he owns only 25 to 30 stocks. <p>Worth Rating: 9.000<p>FPA Capital's ten-year average annual return of 16.31 makes this fund seem an odd choice for investors looking for extra return. But Rodriguez has earned those numbers during a long-term small-cap slump. Historically, small caps outperform their bigger brethren by about two percentage points a year. Rodriguez's ability to outperform his group in tough times makes this fund a good bet for investors who need the maximum long-term return.<p>Current Favorites<p>Rodriguez buys only one to four new stocks a year. This year he's bought two. <a name="NYSE:AGL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10114"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Angelica</b></a> (AGL) makes and launders uniforms for hospitals and hotels. "I've been buying it at about $1 above book [value of $21 a share]," says Rodriguez. <a name="NYSE:NX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11239"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Quanex</b></a> (NX) is another fallen angel. In 1992 it got bid up to $31 when people thought the maker of steel tubes was one of the then-fashionable mini-mill steelmakers. It has traded as low as $14 before climbing to a recent price of $17.75. Book is $11. <p>Caveats<p>FPA Capital charges a 6.5 percent load.<p>
ERIC RYBACK, MANAGER, NO. 1 MEDIUM-TERM FUND<p>Biography<p>Born 1952 in Detroit. Idaho State University. Manager of Lindner Dividend Fund since 1982. Completed buyout of Lindner Management, now Ryback Management, in 1993. <p>Fund Objective<p>"I make an effort to pay as much [income] as I can without getting too volatile."<p>Fund Strategy<p>Ryback applies a value-investing strategy to an income fund.

On-line services bring Wall Street into your home office for a fraction of what the institutions pay<p>By Robert N. Veres<p>One of the reasons individual investors have remained at a disadvantage to professional money managers in the stock-picking business is that detailed financial data--like that used by the pros to uncover promising stocks--has been unavailable to the common man or woman. <p>Slowly but surely, however, information barriers are coming down. Databases are starting to migrate from the world of professional investors to the masses, bringing a new freedom for individuals to do their own stock picking.<p>Consider, for example, the two-month-old newsletter published by Chicago-based Zacks Investment Research. Zacks is best known in the institutional world since 1978 as a one-stop shopping mall for research reports. For $3,500 a year and up, a user can dial in on his computer and find out what hundreds of analysts at 185 different equity research firms are saying about any stock. Check out <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>'s latest earnings projections and detailed write-ups on the company published by <a name="NYSE:BSC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10191"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bear Stearns</b></a>; Smith Barney Shearson; <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>; A.G. Edwards; and a throng of others. Particularly revealing: Run through the previous reports put out by these hotshots and see how close their numbers came to reality. <p>Now Zacks has begun selling a composite of all this information, for an affordable $249 a year, in a monthly publication (that includes biweekly updates and a hotline updated daily) called Analyst Watch. Readers don't get the individual reports; instead, they receive a consensus view of earnings estimates--basically an average of the views of every analyst who follows the stock. The newsletter also lists the numbers of brokers issuing buy, sell, or hold recommendations. In all, Analyst Watch offers 50 key numbers on over 4,000 companies. "This is our first real product for the individual investor," says Ben Zacks, executive vice president with the firm. <p>Investors with a personal computer can tie into a number of relatively new equity databases that offer up-to-the-minute trading information on even the most obscure pink-sheet stocks (those that don't trade on any exchange). One of the more interesting offerings is the Free Financial Network, a so-called bulletin-board service established by the Small Investor's Software Co. in Amityville, New York. By dialing a phone number in the 212 area code, would-be stock pickers can read or download reports on about 7,300 different stocks, as well as information on mutual funds, options, and futures. The cost? "We don't charge for the bulletin-board service," says James Kellndorfer, president of Small Investor's Software, which sells a market-timing software program. "Anybody who wants to dial in is welcome to the data."<p>Investors who have about $600 to spend on a program might look at Telescan Stock Market Analyzer, a comprehensive market database published by Telescan in Houston. Investors can access Telescan by dialing a local phone number into the SprintNet Data Network; the opening screen offers a summary of the business news of the day, as reported on two news wires: Reuters and Comtex, a composite of other services around the world. Users interested in a specific stock can call up news articles about that company and scan trades made by company executives or other insiders over the previous two months. (The database also lists a number of on-line investment newsletters that dispense advice to subscribers--at an additional cost.)<p>The real power of Telescan lies in its heavy-duty searching capabilities. Suppose an investor wants to find companies that meet a strict set of criteria. Perhaps he wants a current price-to-earnings ratio no higher than 16--the historical average for the S&P 500 but well below most stocks in today's market. And he is looking for a price-to-book-value ratio of not more than 3 and a dividend yield of at least 2 percent.<p>And, on top of all this, the investor wants growth. So he asks the computer to show him stocks with five-year earnings growth higher than 10 percent, five-year dividend growth above 20 percent, and a growth in book value above 20 percent a year for the last 20 quarters. He also specifies a debt-to-equity ratio below 25 percent, so he won't have to look at companies burdened with heavy interest payments. And he only wants to look at stocks with a market capitalization above $100 million. <p>Log on, give Telescan the specifications, and about 35 seconds later (using a 2,400-baud modem) out comes a single stock that, believe it or not, meets all these criteria: <a name="NYSE:NWL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11073"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Newell Co.</b></a> (NWL), a NYSE-listed concern trading at around $31 a share. As you can see, Telescan pleases even the most particular investors.<p>Never heard of Newell? To learn more about it, turn to another part of the database, called Marketguide, and summon up a summary report. There you'll find that Newell manufactures cookware, cabinet, and window hardware and that it recently acquired Stuart Hall, a school- and office-supplies manufacturer. Also revealed in the summary is the fact that Newell's stock is trading near its 52-week low of $30.75, well below its 52-week high of $43.63. The report also includes a complete balance sheet and cash-flow statement for each of the previous two years and year-to-date information for the current one. <p>To get a sense of how the stock has moved historically, you can see how the company's stock price has behaved every week since 1973, displayed in a graph. You can call up an overlay screen and watch how price movements in the stock almost exactly track changes in the company's book value--until recently, that is, when book value rose while the price per share slid. Telescan also offers investors its own composite index, which represents daily stock prices divided by the sum of five different indicators over the last 20 years<p>The cost? Telescan offers a variety of packages; the most attractive costs $45 a month for unlimited access to the system between 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. <p>Investors who don't want to do their research by modem might prefer MarketBase, a service out of Needham Heights, Massachusetts, that tracks over 5,500 stocks, offering historical data for the past five years. For $695 a year, MarketBase sends out monthly diskettes containing all the latest stock market information, which can be stored on a computer's hard disk. The service is also available weekly for $2,300 a year.<p>Although MarketBase's information doesn't go back as far as Telescan's and isn't as current, the program itself is more user-friendly. Investors can select their own criteria and search for stocks that meet them, then call up summaries or balance sheets and income statements. The database also has a helpful "sort" function, which allows users to rank all 5,500 stocks according to dividend yield, price to earnings, price to book, or any of over 100 other ratios.<p>So far, the heaviest users of MarketBase and Telescan appear to be professional investment advisors, but that will likely change soon. After all, ten years ago, even institutional investors and fund analysts had trouble getting this kind of detailed data. It's only a matter of time before it finds its way onto the monitor of the average consumer. Then mutual funds may just discover they've got some new competition: their own more financially enlightened customers.<p><p>DEALS ON DATA:

When times are tough, tightwad companies often outperform their more free-spending brethren. Ditto for their stocks.<p>By Stuart Weiss<p><a name="NASD:SBOS"></a><b>Boston Bancorp</b> works hard to maintain its image--just look at its corporate headquarters. It's a dump. "And they're proud of it," says Thomas O'Donnell, thrift analyst at Prudential Securities.<p>The company, parent of South Boston Savings Bank, operates out of a three-story building located in a part of town that most executives wouldn't even visit. "The walls need paint, the uncarpeted floors are covered with scuffed tiles, and the furniture would be hard to give away at a garage sale," writes O'Donnell in a recent report. <p>Just because the walls need paint doesn't mean O'Donnell hates the company. He loves it. Boston Bancorp's expense ratio--1.18 percent--is about half the industry average, and it has made money every year since 1983. The stock has risen steadily over the past decade to its current $35.50 a share, yet its price-to-earnings ratio is a modest eight. "Their ragtag corporate office is symbolic of a cost-cutting mentality," says O'Donnell. "They bought some properties from the RTC and finally got some decent furniture, but they're kind of embarrassed about it."<p>When you want to buy shares in a company, what information do you use to make your decision? The annual report? A broker's recommendation? If it's a consumer-goods company such as <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a> or <a name="NYSE:PEP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11166"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pepsi</b></a>, you can taste the products. But unlike Wall Street analysts, individual investors rarely get to meet management or tour company facilities. Most of the time, you base decisions on columns of lifeless numbers that may be outdated by the time you see them. <p>One active approach individual investors can take is to conduct an on-site visit. Drive to a public company in your locale and do a little reconnaissance. Walk into the lobby; tell the receptionist that you're thinking of investing in the company's stock and ask to see a copy of the most recent annual report. While you're there, look around. Is it a Taj Mahal or a bare-bones office park? Check out the parking lot. Do the executives drive flashy cars?<p>"I love to see frugal offices," says Suzanne P. McGrath, a managing director at Piper Jaffray in Portland, Oregon. "When I go to companies that display affluence, I can't help but wonder if their priorities are on running the business or on taking more for themselves." One of her favorites is <a name="NYSE:FMY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13519"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fred Meyer</b></a>, a Portland-based chain of variety stores. The stock sells at $34, 15 times 1992 earnings. "You walk in the front lobby, and it's obvious that they haven't had a decorator," she says. "The floor is covered with warehouse-gray carpet. Each office is divided by portable walls." And the address? Let's just say you wouldn't want to take a stroll after dark in that part of town. But Piper Jaffray likes the stock because the company is a low-cost, high-profit merchant.<p>Not all companies with low-rent headquarters produce high-powered earnings, of course. The supermarket giant <a name="NYSE:SWY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11308"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Safeway Inc.</b></a> is one such exception. Its corporate headquarters, a warehouse-like office located in the bowels of Oakland, is nobody's idea of glamorous. But keeping headquarters rent low hasn't been enough to keep earnings high at Safeway recently. In 1992, the company saw earnings decline almost 30 percent from 1991.<p>To be sure, investors have made money buying shares in glitzy companies. <a name="NYSE:NKE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14254"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Nike</b></a>'s corporate headquarters, across town from Fred Meyer, might as well be worlds away. But Nike has done well over the years and so have its shareholders.<p>What about investors' love affairs with gaming companies? Their corporate headquarters are usually as gaudy as the casinos they own. Exception: <a name="NYSE:PRH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=43989"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Promus Cos.</b></a>, based in Memphis. The company runs Harrah's casinos in Nevada and Atlantic City as well as Embassy Suites and Hampton Inn Hotels. "It's probably the most efficiently run gaming company out there," says James J. Murren, analyst with C.J. Lawrence in New York. Promus's headquarters is a large house built in the 1930s. "They got it for a good price," Murren says. In the past two years, the stock has zoomed from $11 to $65.<p>Visiting the "executive offices" of <a name="NYSE:LFB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10914"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Longview Fibre</b></a>, a paper manufacturer located in Longview, Washington, could give anyone a headache, thanks to deafening mill machinery. Headache or no, Longview has made money every year, even as its competitors--<a name="NYSE:LPX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10918"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Louisiana-Pacific</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:CHA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10317"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Champion International</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:GP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10648"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Georgia-Pacific</b></a>--lost money. Furthermore, the company has never cut its dividend. How frugal is Longview? Its 1992 annual report, excluding the financials, consists of just three pages with not one color photograph. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings of 19, far less than Georgia-Pacific's 26.<p>In the computer industry, first prize for low-cost operations goes to <a name="NASD:NOVL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14287"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Novell</b></a>, a network-software maker. The company's Provo, Utah, office looks like any other short glass box in Silicon Valley, except for one thing: Real estate in Provo costs a lot less. Chairman Raymond J. Noorda drives a pickup truck to work and makes a relatively modest $200,000 a year. "It's a very frugal company," says Richard H. Kimball, a telecommunications analyst with Montgomery Securities. "The executives stay in Holiday Inns and don't fly first class." At $19.50, is the stock still a buy? Yes, says Kimball, adding that Novell is the dominant player in the fast-growing operating-systems market for local area networks. <p>Skimpy annual reports. Low-rent headquarters. Guys who drive pickup trucks. Maybe they're all emulating the most famous aw-shucks, regular-guy CEO there is: Warren Buffett. As chairman of Omaha-based <a name="NYSE:BRK.A"></a><b>Berkshire Hathaway</b>, Buffett pays himself $100,000 a year in salary. Don't worry, though; he's far from poor. He owns more than $8 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock, which sells for $16,710 per share.<p>The company earned over $407 million in 1992 on revenues of $3.03 billion, and the stock has consistently beaten the S&P 500 in price appreciation for nearly 30 years. "We have no legal, personnel, public-relations, investor-relations, or strategic-planning departments," Buffett wrote in his 1992 annual. "We see the simpler, low-cost operation as more likely to operate effectively than its bureaucratic brethren." Investors looking for promising stock market ideas, take note. <p>Stuart Weiss has written for Business Week and CFO Magazine.<p><p><p>

 A GOOD TIME TO INCORPORATE 
<p>
With the tax code changing and medical costs rising, professionals
should consider restructuring  
<p>
 By Mary Rowland  
<p>
 As writers, my husband and I are self-employed and are grappling
with soaring health-care costswhich we pay ourselvesand spiraling
taxes. Last December our accountant suggested that we look into
forming a C corporation, which would allow us to write off all
our medical expenses, including insurance. He did some projections
that showed we would save a pile of money in 1992 under the C
corp structure. But with year-end projects closing and the holidays
coming, we felt we didn't have enough time to sort through all
the pros and cons, so we put it off until 1993.  
<p>
 Procrastination, of course, has a price, and for us it recently
went up. First, the New York legislature passed a bill that sent
the cost of health insurance skyrocketing; the premiums for our
family of four nearly tripled. Then, one of our kids needed some
treatments that we had to pay largely out of pocket. By June,
we'd run up $10,000 in medical expenses we could have deducted.
Our accountant only shook his head sadly and repeated, "You have
to form a C corp."  
<p>
 With President Clinton's tax proposals promising to raise the
top income bracket five or six percentage points above the bottom
corporate rate, small-business owners are scurrying to their
accountants to convert their subchapter S corporations into C
corps. In most cases the benefits can't make up for the double
taxes that C corps often incur. But for self-employed professionals
whose business income comes solely from the services they provide,
a C corp can make a lot of sense.  
<p>
 Both C corp and S corp are named for sections of the tax code;
the primary difference between the two is that a C corp is taxed
directly as a business at corporate rates, whereas the income
and expenses from an S corp flow through to the owners, who are
taxed at individual rates. As taxpayers are only too aware, the
Clinton administration has proposed a top tax rate of 39.6 percent
(including the so-called "millionaire's surtax"), while the highest
rate for a C corporation with revenues below $10 million will
remain at 34 percent .   
<p>
 Unfortunately, this doesn't mean that a C corp is automatically
a better way to go. In most cases it isn't. The problem is that
a profitable C corporation often saddles its owner with double
taxes. Some of the corporation's revenues can be paid out to
the owner as salary, on which he pays taxes at the individual
rates, and is deducted as expenses by the corporation. But the
corporation pays taxes on any profits it makes, and to get what's
left of those profits, the owner has to pay himself a dividend
and then pay tax on that too. Why not just pay everything out
in salary? For many businesses that produce a product or that
grow in value, the IRS limits the salaries they may pay to a
level that is customary in their respective industries. But in
most cases, self-employed professionals may pay themselves all
the revenues less expenses in salary and bonus. And that means
no corporate taxes, and therefore no double taxation.   
<p>
 Why all the fuss? Because unlike the owner of a S corp or even
a sole-proprietorship, the owner of a C corp can deduct all of
his and his family's medical expenses. And with many one-person
and small family businesses getting buried by medical costs these
days, it can make quite a difference. Insurance premiums can
run $10,000 or more, and often there are substantial costs that
insurance does not cover. Under current tax law, none of these
expenses are deductible by a sole proprietor unless they exceed
7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. Often that means no deduction
at all. Says Michael Janicki, a partner at Arthur Andersen &
Company in New York, "C corps look better because of the favorable
treatment of fringe benefits."   
<p>
 A C corporation can deduct insurance premiums and any share
of health-care costs, such as deductibles and copayments, as
well as anything that the IRS considers a medical expense and
is not covered by insurance. That includes dental care, eyeglasses
and contact lenses, preventive care (such as check-ups, well-baby
visits, and mammograms), transportation to the doctor, psychiatric
care, and even drug or alcohol treatment. The IRS even includes
hair transplants, health spas if they are prescribed by a doctor,
orthopedic shoes, and Navajo healing ceremonies.  
<p>
 There are other advantages to C corporations as well. A business
owner can buy up to $50,000 of group life insurance and have
the corporation pay for it as a deductible expense. The corporation
can also pay for disability insurance. Unfortunately, if the
corporation pays the premiums with pre-tax dollars, the benefits
will be taxable. But taxpayers often get around this by paying
the premiums themselves and having the corporation reimburse
them. Owners of a C corp may also be able to put more money into
retirement plans than they could as individuals. In some states,
retirement contributions are not deductible for a sole proprietor,
but they are if they're made by a corporation.  
<p>
 There can be some additional tax savings, too. President Clinton
proposes removing the $135,000 ceiling on the Medicare tax. By
deducting the cost of benefits before taking their salaries from
their corporations, business owners may reduce the amount of
income on which they pay Medicare tax. For example, in New York
City, a sole proprietor pays 4 percent of net profit as an unincorporated
business tax. A small C corporation would pay 2.65 percent. In
California, income taxes are higher for an S corporation, too.<p>
<p>
 A drawback of the C corp is the possibility that the IRS might
claim that the compensation taken out is unreasonably high. Remember,
the C corporation works only when the owner takes all the incomeminus
expensesas salary. As long as one person is providing all the
services that generate revenues for the business, it is fairly
straightforward to take the money as salary and bonus. "If you
are talking about $100,000 to $300,000, it would be OK," says
Thomas C. Lenz, a tax manager in the Chicago office of accounting
firm McGladrey & Pullen. "But if a guy is running some type of
manufacturing business, it might be tough to justify a $1 million
salary."  
<p>
 The key issue is whether the owner is generating all the revenues
of the business or whether employees and equipment are doing
some of the work in building its value. A one-person business
almost always avoids this problem. "In a personal service corporation,
there is no value to the company," says Thomas Ochsenschlager,
partner at Grant Thornton in Washington. "You may have a desk
and a computer and that's it." Still, the corporation should
document what the salary will be and the formula for the bonus.
"Typically, small companies don't keep meeting minutes at all,"
says Mary Smalligan, a partner in the San Francisco office of
Deloitte & Touche. That's a problem in the face of an IRS challenge.<p>
<p>
 Most accountants agree that family businesses and businesses
with more than one revenue earner should usually consider an
S-corp structure. But for professionals who can legitimately
pay themselves what the business makes, a C corp can save a bundle.<p>

						 <p>By Margaret Opsata<p>John and Linda Cifarelli and their daughters, two-year-old Nina and five-month-old Annabelle, moved into their Burlington, Vermont, lake-front home in August 1988. Four months later, with accumulating snow in the overnight forecast, the family turned on, for the first and last time, the gas-powered driveway de-icer that had come with the house. By morning, Nina and her parents were dead, poisoned by carbon monoxide fumes that had seeped into the house from the de-icing heater in the adjoining garage. Little Annabelle and an overnight house guest survived.<p>The state of Vermont charged the previous owner of the home, Stephen Converse Brooks, with three counts of involuntary manslaughter for failing to disclose the dangerous condition of the heater to the buyers. The prosecutor argued that Brooks was well aware of the problem because his girlfriend and child had been hospitalized for carbon monoxide poisoning only a year earlier. But the former Republican Party chairman for Burlington and Chittenden County maintained that he had had the defective appliance disconnected soon after his near tragedy. He blamed the local gas company for reconnecting the device without alerting the Cifarellis to the danger. The jury, however, concluded that Brooks had been criminally negligent, and the judge sentenced him to 15 years for each death.<p>Caveat emptor__"let the buyer beware"__has been the rule of thumb in real estate transactions dating back to English common law. But these days, a new credo, caveat venditor ("let the seller beware"), may be more accurate.<p>Indeed, although it is unusual for a former homeowner to face a prison sentence, today sellers can incur severe penalties for not disclosing material defects in their properties. Courts generally support the view that buyers should be told not only about malfunctioning equipment, but also about roof leaks, plumbing problems, structural flaws, hazardous wiring, and any other conditions that could jeopardize health, safety, or property value. Some juries have even ruled that a seller is obliged to reveal that a murder or suicide occurred on the premises or that the house may be haunted.<p>And to save home sellers from this legal onslaught of litigious home buyers, an industry has sprung up, offering products from errors-and-omissions insurance to home inspections. But in most cases, people would be better off keeping their money and just telling the truth. <p>HOME WARRANTY<p>One such booming business is sales of home-warranty protection, which is growing by 50 percent a year, according to John M. Kinker, president of the National Home Warranty Association and founder of his own home-warranty company, Guaranteed Homes, in Lake St. Louis, Missouri. A handful of national firms and dozens of regional and local companies offer service agreements for repair or replacement of heating or air conditioning system components and of built-in appliances that work at the time of sale but break within 12 months. Home warranties have a $35 to $200 deductible and they cost between $350 and $500. By purchasing warranty protection for buyers, sellers are told, their houses may sell more quickly and their chances of being sued for equipment failures should diminish.<p>It's true the cost is relatively low, but then what's the real chance that something will happen in the first year after sale? If the need for this kind of coverage didn't exist while the seller lived in the house, why is it necessary now?<p>Moreover, sellers who decide to buy a home warranty cannot do so on the open market__the only people who offer the policies are real estate brokers, who earn up to $60 for each contract they sell, if they are fortunate enough to do business in a state where such payments are permitted. In addition, brokers who agree to sell home warranties can also receive discounts on their own errors-and-omissions insurance, a product designed to protect them from suits by disgruntled customers. <p>E&O INSURANCE<p>People who've put their homes on the market over the past few months may have been offered one such new product, "sellers' errors and omissions insurance," from Homeowners Marketing Services (HMS) in Hollywood, Florida. Their high-powered sales brochure, which is illustrated with realistic-looking bullet holes and pictures of spent cartridges, advises buying the new insurance "before you become a target" of buyers who can sue for "any situation or condition that happened in the past, is scheduled to happen in the future__or even might happen in the future__that may directly or indirectly affect your property value." <p>For only $200, payable at closing, a seller can buy $100,000 of E&O coverage for one year with no deductible. (Sellers who list with HMS member brokers automatically get $25,000 of insurance with a $5,000 deductible.)<p>Again, the cost is low (free if sellers take the automatic coverage), but the benefits may be equally as valuable. The HMS brochure describes coverage for "Innocent omissions. Accidental errors. Frivolous statements you don't even think twice about, that turn out to be false or misleading." A better strategy may be to think twice about any representations and to provide a full and frank disclosure about the house.<p>HOME INSPECTIONS<p>Another group that stands ready to serve home sellers for a price are the companies that provide home inspections. For $250 to $350, an inspector will provide a written report on the current condition of a home, pointing out existing and potential problems with construction and equipment. <p>"We promote home inspections at the time of listing, so the seller can have a report available for buyers to peruse," says Kenneth T. Austin, chairman of Bound Brook, New Jersey-based HouseMaster of America, the largest franchiser of home inspection companies in the country. For an additional $95, a HouseMaster inspector will walk a prospective buyer through the home to explain the report. <p>Proponents contend that a home inspection can focus attention on details like rust stains or cracks that the seller might not otherwise disclose because they seemed so insignificant but which, to a trained professional, are clear symptoms of trouble ahead that buyers should know about. "Homeowners could have problems if they knew about a condition but ignored or lived with it," says Harry S. Rosenthal, general counsel to the American Society of Home Inspectors. <p>However, an inspection also can reveal unpleasant surprises, such as construction that is not up to code or high levels of radon gas__facts the seller would then be obliged to disclose to prospective buyers. "Once you have an inspection, you can no longer say you didn't know about it," Rosenthal points out.<p>Consequently, a home inspection may do more harm than good, at least from a legal standpoint. "The last thing you want to do is uncover an expensive problem like a leaking underground oil tank," says Gordon C. Duus, who heads the environmental practice at the Hackensack, New Jersey, law firm of Cole, Schotz, Bernstein, Meisel & Forman.<p>People who sell protection products want sellers to believe that they could be liable for not disclosing defects they knew nothing about. But, in reality, courts do not expect homeowners to have X-ray vision or to be psychic. The buyer has to show that the seller knew or should have known and concealed the information. "Ignorance is a defense," emphasizes Harvey A. Miller of Cole, Schotz. Adds Diane Tiberend, an associate at the law firm of Cox, Castle & Nicholson in Irvine, California, "A homeowner does not have any obligation to rip the house apart to check it out before selling it." Of course, if the buyer requests an inspection, it will be hard to refuse. But let the buyer ask.<p>DISCLOSURE FORMS<p>The cornerstone of any seller's defense is disclosure, and to be sure they've covered everything, many realtors recommend use of a disclosure form, a detailed questionnaire about the condition of the property. To date, nine states (Alaska, California, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Wisconsin) have made seller-disclosure forms mandatory, and more state legislatures are considering the idea. Unfortunately, some forms actually do more harm than good. "A good disclosure form should protect the seller, but some are so awful that they put the seller in a completely untenable position [by asking questions no reasonable person could answer]," says Jerilyn Coates, an agent for 15 years with Carriage Trade Realty in Wayne, Pennsylvania. "I have seen some that even I couldn't fill out for my own house."<p>A disclosure form is a legal document; anyone who fills one out should seek the help of a real estate attorney, who can advise what disclosures are required by law and how best to word the responses. A lawyer typically charges from $400 to $1,200 for this kind of advice, but this should not add to the costs of sale, because most states require sellers to be represented at closing anyway. Having an attorney review the disclosure statement (and, later, the sales agreement) is really only getting full value for the fee.<p>Attorneys advise clients to be factual and forthcoming but not to volunteer extraneous information and never to guess at answers on a disclosure form. If a form asks the age of the roof, for instance, the seller may be tempted to estimate the time based on what the previous owner may have said or the recollections of a neighbor, who is pretty sure the roof was installed right after her youngest child had the chicken pox. However, unless the seller has a receipt from the roofing contractor or other written documentation that firmly fixes the date, the correct response should be "I don't know."<p>AS IS<p>Do the words "as is" added into the contract really protect the seller? Not according to HMS. "If you think putting 'as is' in the contract lets you off the hook  you may be wrong. And it could cost you a bundle," proclaims the bullet-riddled brochure. However, the examples of "innocent omissions" and "accidental errors" that HMS supplies seem neither innocent nor accidental: "not remembering" to mention that a halfway house is being built next door, misrepresenting the zoning, warranting plumbing and mechanical systems without inspections, promising that a home will double in value over a short period of time. Some would say that homeowners who behave so irresponsibly deserve to be sued.<p>The truth is, offering a house "as is" does protect sellers who allow inspections requested by buyers, offer no warranties, and make clear that buyers have no future rights or remedies for undiscovered problems. The words "as is" may frighten away some buyers, but these people are likely to be litigious sorts who are better avoided anyway.<p>Rather than falling prey to scare tactics, sellers can save the money they might otherwise spend on protection products and perhaps stay just as safe simply by being honest, choosing a broker whose interests are inseparable from the seller's, and following the advice of an experienced real estate lawyer every step of the way. <p>As further protection, clauses in the real estate contract that have the prevailing party in a lawsuit agreeing to pay the attorneys' fees for both parties should be lined out. Some lawyers view such provisions as a free ticket to a fishing expedition, since they get paid regardless of the outcome. "People are more cautious about litigation," Tiberend notes, "when they have to pay for their own lawyer." <p>An award-winning journalist, Margaret Opsata has written about real estate investments for the past 20 years.<p>-----<p>BE OPEN WITH LIMITS<p>If a prospective buyer requests an inspection and is willing pay for it, homeowners should agree to it, as a token of good faith and to show that they have nothing to hide. But they should also establish some ground rules. Since buyers often procrastinate, there should be a time limit for inspections, so the house will not be kept off the market by a buyer who eventually backs out of the deal; a clause, for example, stating that if the buyers do not meet a deadline, they waive any right to claim for damages. 
Decide in advance who will pay to repair any problems the inspector finds. "We try to put dollar limits on what the seller will spend__for example, anything up to $3,000 the buyer must take care of; anything over that amount, the seller will consider fixing, or we will renegotiate the contract," says Harvey Miller of Cole, Schotz.

For some time now the big four online services -- America Online, CompuServe, Prodigy, and Microsoft Network -- have catered to investors with financial news and data, discussion groups, and electronic brokerage services. Over the past year, however, these features have come to look slight next to the abundance of investor options available on the World Wide Web. But now all four services have reinvented themselves and co-opted the encroaching competition by melding Internet access into their programs. Because online access is indispensable for individual investors, here's a quick look at the four options in their New Year's clothing.<p>
Behind the familiar front of America Online ($19.95 a month for unlimited use) is a vastly faster service and a built-in version of Microsoft's superb browser, Internet Explorer. AOL content is now linked to external Web sites. In a news item that mentions AT&T, for example, a click on the company's name takes users to AT&T's Web site. Some of AOL's content providers, such as Morningstar and Fidelity, have retooled their areas to take advantage of AOL's new features. And to counter the many excellent portfolio-tracking services on the Web, AOL, like its competitors, has improved the tools with which users can track stocks.<p>
CompuServe ($9.95 a month for five hours; additional time and premium services extra) has done an even better job of integrating the Internet into its system by creating road signs and routes back to its own, orderly world. CompuServe still caters primarily to business users. Its investment forums remain the most wide-ranging and have the most informed, dedicated participants of any online discussion group around (the relatively high fees probably screen out yappers and gadflies). The area devoted to taxes -- H&R Block is CompuServe's corporate parent -- is especially strong.<p>
For the average investor, there are few reasons to opt for Prodigy Internet ($19.95 a month for unlimited use), which has been spun off from its precursor, now called Prodigy Classic -- at least not until the investor areas from Classic are moved to the new version. Microsoft Network ($19.95 a month for unlimited use) is the swankest and most reliable service; yet beyond some online banking options and a moving ticker tape, it, too, has slim investor appeal. America Online offers the best combination of price and information. CompuServe is worth the extra cost for hard-core information junkies and those seeking the online fellowship of informed investors.<p>

						THE GUARDIAN
As the author buys property and accumulates wealth, he gets ever closer to the poorhouse. What is it about land?<p>
By Richard Todd<p>
I've never met a piece of land I didn't like, an attitude that can get a person into trouble. I am not alone. Many of us walk around with a case of land fever. We love nature -- that's part, but by no means all, of the story. (In candor, I know many an apartment dweller who loves nature more than I do.) We love nature, but more exactly we love land, need to live on it, and want to own ever more of it. This hillside and that meadow and the tract of woods with the little brook going through it -- they all look attractive in one way or another, and the price always seems, if you take the long view, so reasonable. After all, this is land, and as the real-estate broker will tell you, "They aren't making any more of it." <p>
The real-estate broker, you may note in passing, lives in a big house on a small plot in town and maybe has a time-share in the Cayman Islands, but no matter -- he speaks my language. Land is real and land is earnest. You can walk on it, you can fence it, you can dig in it, and when you dig you can hold the soil in your hands. Of course, all these are qualities of a less attractive concept called illiquidity.
You can always sell land -- but maybe not today or tomorrow or this year. That doesn't bother people like me, because in our view we are accumulating wealth, not making deals. We tend to agree with the 19th-century economist Henry George, who argued, in Progress and Poverty, that land is the source of all wealth. (We tend not to agree with his corollary, that government should therefore raise its revenues from a tax on landholdings alone.)<p>
An embarrassing portion of my net worth is accounted for by the 150 acres and "the buildings thereon" that I currently occupy in a rural corner of Massachusetts. It occurs to me sometimes that this state of affairs may result from actual mental deficiency, a lack of talent for abstract thinking.<p>
Here is the problem. People like me think that $50,000 worth of trees, rocks, and rills is fundamentally more valuable than $50,000 worth of blips on the Merrill Lynch computer. I know this is crazy -- a price is a price -- but even as I write, it doesn't seem crazy. Thank God for the few blips I have, or else my banker would never write a mortgage, but they nonetheless don't feel the way acreage feels.<p>
It should be obvious that the syndrome I'm describing is all about land and not much about real estate, or real-estate development. There are people who are very good at real estate. They are the ones who stop at the edge of town and see a pasture and imagine its hills leveled, and they see "feeder roads" and cul-de-sacs, and they seem to have lots of daughters and nieces after whom to name these streets. They have a transformative vision, give them credit for that, and with the help of some misguided laws, they are largely responsible for some of the regrettable things that have happened to the American landscape in recent years. They have been the financial engineers of the placelessness that plagues our country, the homogenized world in which people find themselves living at someplace called 1347 Darlene Drive.<p>
No, I am talking about a sensibility that has less to do with speculating and more to do with collecting. The land collector tends to be biased against development -- a paradox worth thinking about if you consider your land as wealth. The preservationist instinct runs strong in the land collector, and investment and preservation make uneasy bedfellows. Buy-and-hold is the collector's strategy, which is a recipe often enough for becoming land poor, a condition I achieved in a modest way sometime ago. I languish there still.<p>
Some people are obviously more prone to becoming obsessed with land than others. An ethnic thing? Ancestors victimized by the Enclosure Acts may well leave a genetic marker. A male problem? Well, you could argue that. One need look no further than the phrase "virgin land" to see that long ago land was feminized in men's imaginations, and it has often been pointed out how the land has served as an escape from women. (Its roundedness more bearable, more comprehensible than theirs?) The feminist historian Annette Kolodny has traced this theme in her book The Lay of the Land, arguing that the American West has been alternately romanticized and abused in a pattern that parallels the woes of women and men.<p>
But I don't know -- all of this wants to take us toward a notion of landholding as the last bastion of that sorry and familiar figure, the aging, raging white guy. It's got to be less sordid than that. The truth is that some men and women of various persuasions seem to need the comfort of dirt beneath their feet and an eyeful of field or forest before them. It starts as simply as that. Then it gets more complicated. One trick is to achieve land poverty while avoiding actual bankruptcy. Another trick is to emerge with your conscience intact. Certain rules apply.<p>
First, a rudimentary sense of balance. Years ago an old New Hampshireman gave me some useful advice. He was talking about a neighbor of his, a wealthy man who had bought a farm and was adding to it. It stood at 400 acres and was growing, as the owner made extravagant offers for adjoining property. "The trouble with that fellow," said my mentor, "is that he hasn't figured out that you can't own your abutter." <p>
True, owning your abutter ultimately takes you from sea to shining sea. I admit my sympathies were with the gentleman farmer, who wanted only to own what he could gaze upon and maybe a little bit more. That's what I wanted in those days, too, and I haven't really outgrown the impulse.<p>
The need to have dominion over your surroundings may be one of the least attractive qualities of the landowning personality. It explains, incidentally, why the serious collector may not be especially keen on views. The better the view, after all, the more likely it is to involve abutters you cannot own. I have a bit of hilltop land. It has an old farmhouse, which needs...work, and visitors (out of kindness) seldom remark on it; they say instead, "What a nice view." It is a nice view. But it makes me a little uncomfortable. I feel easier on my lowland field, which is not a place you'd ever stop to look at if you were to pass by on the road. All I see from my field is my own tree line.<p>
Recalling now and then that you can't own your abutter can be a comforting check on desire. But the inverse is also true. Your abutter's land is the piece you most want, and when it's available you should (almost) always buy it (a serious land collector maintains a fund for this purpose). If everyone made a practice of buying his abutter instead of complaining about the person who does, then life in rural America would be truly peaceful. Recently, land adjoining me (a psychologically revealing usage, I know) came on the market. It was a strange piece, shaped more or less like a watering can, with fully 20 of its 90 acres accounted for by the spout, a corridor of land that separated two more-rational tracts, one of which is mine. I did not really want this gerrymander, but there it was, and I wanted it not in unknown hands. I was ready to go again to the bank. But happily on this hill I have a neighbor who is afflicted with the collecting impulse, too. He bought it. I was immensely grateful. My abutter bought my abutter, and since I can't own him, all is quiet again on my eastern front.<p>
An awareness of the finitude of land animates the psyche of the land buyer. But it's important to remember that Gertrude Stein was right when she said, "In the United States there is more space where nobody is than where anybody is. This is what makes America what it is." It was truer in 1936, when she said it, but it is still true today, as a cross-country flight on a clear day will remind you. This should be a cautionary fact for the land buyer, though paradoxically it usually isn't, since the very existence of wide-open spaces makes you want to own them, keep them, save them. (I experience a disorientation, a vertigo, while visiting the city, but in another sense I am free: There is no place there that I covet.) Part of the problem with the American landscape is that we have too much land, not too little, and the abundance has encouraged the sprawl that so demeans us. But the bottom line for the landowner counting assets is that there is a rational supply-and-demand reason your net worth does not seem to be mounting as fast as it might in other markets.<p>
Gertrude Stein was right, but most of our great American writers prove less than reliable sources of advice for the landowner. Buy into the American landscape and you buy into a package of cultural confusion that starts in the first European apprehension of the New World as a second Eden and continues to the latest Ralph Lauren ad. Think of Thomas Jefferson, who scorned cities, saw the new republic as a garden, and eloquently lobbied for a nation of farmers. His agrarian vision still appeals to me -- but what a lot of mischief it has caused! (Anyone who thinks about it for long knows that only in the salvation of our cities is there a hope for preserving the countryside.) Think of Mark Twain and Huck's escape to the territory. And think then, above all, of Thoreau.<p>
Henry David Thoreau was a genius, Walden is the absolutely essential American book, and never will the reader exhaust its richness, its humor, its paradox. Don't get me wrong, but Thoreau, if you consider him as the cultural icon he has become, has a lot to answer for. <p>
If there is a single idea popularly associated with Thoreau it is the value of a direct, unmediated relationship with nature. In Thoreau's woods, removed from the distortions of civilization, one can learn to "live deliberately," "to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it...or if it were sublime, to know it by experience."<p>
That stirring call! Who can fail to heed it, or at least to want to heed it. Thoreau dismisses not only corrupt urban existence but the agrarian life as well, in favor of a direct association with the natural world. Everyone remembers the passage early in Walden in which Thoreau has sport with those Concord residents who have had the "misfortune" to have inherited a farm: "How many a poor immortal soul have I met well-nigh crushed and smothered under its load, creeping down the road of life, pushing before it a barn seventy-ffive feet by forty, its Augean stables never cleansed, and one hundred acres of land, tillage, mowing, pasture, and woodlot!"<p>
Thoreau, wisely, was not a landowner; he borrowed the site for his cabin from Ralph Waldo Emerson. He seems to have been tempted once or twice to buy a farm, to judge by his account in Walden. He writes amusingly of actually having agreed on a price with the owner of "the Hollowell place," only to have the owner back down, offering Thoreau $10 to release him from the deal. Thoreau gallantly declines the money and imagines that he is selling the farm back to the man, for nothing: "I sold him the farm for just what I gave for it....I found thus that I had been a rich man without any damage to my poverty. But I retained the landscape, and I have since annually carried off what it yielded without a wheelbarrow."<p>
Thoreau "retained the landscape," though it ought to be said that the farmers created it. A learned paper could be written on Thoreau's relationship to farming, but my own literal-minded heart has always had a soft spot for the farmers of Concord. I have thought of them when reading Walden and when I'm in the contemporary town. With their townspeople, who had an idea of what a village street should look like, they made Concord beautiful, a beauty from which, mercifully -- despite the efforts of the 20th century -- it has not fully recovered. The farmers made Concord beautiful -- Thoreau made it sacred.<p>
The problem with Thoreau is only that his latter-day disciples think that you can have it both ways -- that you can buy into his blessed relationship with nature. Many a new landowner, as I have observed firsthand, set out literally to live a version of Walden. Such a pilgrim has doomed himself already by buying land. He will discover that you cannot live at Walden Pond. He will find himself not removed but, in some ways, more connected to the world than ever. To own land is to become implicated in what happens to it.<p>
Despite your preservationist inclinations, the overwhelming likelihood is that one day, if you own land, you'll sell some. I have and have regretted it. When I saw something built that altered the surrounding countryside for the worse, I felt as guilty as if I had done it myself.<p>
The problem is that in some higher sense you can't sell land. That is, you never quite get rid of it, even after the papers are passed. There are all sorts of practical differences between land and other assets, but perhaps the most important difference is emotional, moral. When you sell 500 shares of Intel into the market, "your" stock may be bought by a young family assembling a college-tuition portfolio or by a young drug dealer parking some cash. You don't know, and it would be insane to care. That is the freedom afforded by fungible assets.<p>
When you sell land it's a different story. You know who's buying it. You can learn, and you should, what the buyer plans to do with it. With the sale you ratify the plans. As it happens, you have extraordinary practical powers in this situation, powers that greatly exceed those of the state. You can restrict your deed to forbid further division of the land; you can even determine how many trees may be removed. If the land is to be built on, you can specify where and what, down to the siding and the pitch of the roof. All these restrictions compromise the marketability of the land, but they may not necessarily reduce its value.<p>
Once you own a piece of land you become part of its history, part of its future, and so you might as well become an active part. But landowning, which so often starts in a simple desire for refuge, can thus lead to a kind of megalomania. There is a grandiosity even in preservation, an appropriation of the commonwealth into one's own breast. The greatest contemporary land collector, Ted Turner, has said -- and one knows that he's only half joking -- "If I want to save the West I'll have to buy it."<p>
In heavy moments you ask yourself, Who am I to want to own my "viewshed"? Who am I to try to stop development? If I have more land than I need -- and pray, how much does anybody not spending full time feeding people "need"? -- then who am I to stand in the way of others? Why should I replace the wisdom of the market in allocating places in the woods?<p>
Good questions, and you should be ready to answer them. I have reached my own answers, and they have to do with the gratitude I feel toward people who kept the rural landscape intact before me and who, when they built, built wisely. It is true that the nation faces more immediate and heart-wrenching problems than preserving its hayffields. But those landscapes occupy a place in our culture, and the argument for them is the argument for opera or for art museums. They are one of the reasons we are moved to solve the other, more pressing problems -- they are one of the many pleasures awaiting those rescued from life's exigencies.<p>
I have come to think that the only answer for the landowner is to face your hubris. You wake up one day to the fact that you do have actual power over a corner of the earth and that you have to use it some way. I don't know of another small investment that so tangibly affects the world. The ultimate price and pleasure of buying land is that you have to form a vision for what's to become of it.<p>

						By Clint Willis<p>
Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that you don't have a few million dollars to build a diversified portfolio of properties. You have to get it right the first time. That means paying as little as possible -- and avoiding disasters. <p>
Unlike some places, the United States doesn't have a lot of unexploded land mines buried around the country. But land can still blow up. So ask these questions before you buy any property: <p>
Why is it for sale? Say the land is being sold by a bank's trust department. Chances are it's a liquidation, and the bankers have been instructed to unload the property. They want to sell the land and will be businesslike about it. <p>
Compare them to the guy liquidating his grandmother's estate. Since it was Grandma's land, he may attach sentimental value to it and expect a higher price in compensation. Then there's the couple getting a divorce who may bicker over the price and timing of the sale, or there's the land speculator with lots of time to find a buyer. <p>
How long has it been on the market? If the land has been for sale for six months or a year, the seller might be ready to entertain a lower bid than he originally hoped for. But maybe you aren't interested: A large tract of land might take a long time to sell because it's on the wrong side of town or the hunting is bad or there is a glut of similar farmland in the area...which brings us to another question. <p>
What's wrong with it? Some land cannot be used for the purposes that would make it most valuable. Say you plan to develop your land or hope to sell to a developer one day. If you're not connected to a municipal sewer system, you should probably perform a percolation ("perk") test, which costs about $200. This test measures the ability of the land to absorb water. If your property fails the test, any prospective developer will have to haul gravel onto the land to create a leach field that can support a septic system. That job could cost more than the land itself. <p>
Make your initial contract for a piece of land conditional upon inspection of the property. In addition to a perk test, you may need a survey ($20 to $50 an acre) to determine if your property includes wetlands and to identify borders. You also might want to check for hazardous waste ($1,500 and up). And you'll need a title search ($100 to $250). <p>
Will the view last? If you buy land that abuts a national park or other government-owned preserve or a wetland, you won't have to worry much about ugly buildings cropping up. At the very least, make sure that your property is big enough to shelter you from the sight of the pink house that your nearest neighbor decides to erect next year. <p>
How much will it cost to keep the land? Since you usually cannot borrow money to buy land, you might avoid debt. But you will have to pay property taxes, and you might have to cover liability insurance and upkeep, such as pruning around power lines and maintaining fences. Make sure you will have the cash -- and take into account those costs when you figure your potential return. <p>
Is it worth the trouble? Finding the right piece of land at the right price and checking it out could take scores of hours. It took us roughly 300 hours of phone calls and other research to find a dozen or so interesting properties in our price range -- and we didn't buy them, which would require still more work. <p>
Count on investing additional time and effort if your plan calls for the land to generate income. For example, you might have to find timber companies to buy your wood or tenants to live in your cabin. Try to figure out how much time that will take before you put money into a property -- and then double that. If you're still interested...don't say we didn't warn you.<p>

						A PIECE OF THE ACTION
Fifteen acres of heaven in Oregon, an ocean view in Maine, an orange grove in Florida, and a dozen other ways to turn a dream into an investment.<p>
By Clint Willis<p>
In 1957, my father and some of his friends each paid $1,200 to buy half-acre plots of woodland an hour from New Orleans. Their plan: build houses, move in with their families, and spend weekends playing volleyball and drinking bourbon-and-Cokes around a communal swimming pool.<p>
I saw the property only once, when we drove there some years later to chop down a Christmas tree. "A gangster bought some of the lots, so we never developed the land," Dad recently explained. "I sold mine 20 years later, for around $2,000."<p>
Let's see. I figure that before taxes and after inflation my father's $1,200 stake shrank around 25 percent. <p>
Fact is, it's hard to get rich buying land. Not impossible, but hard. We learned a lot of lessons when we set out to find appealing properties priced at $150,000 or less. For instance, banks don't like to lend money for raw land; state and local zoning laws can restrict use of the property; and, of course, land doesn't pay dividends. Quite the contrary: The costs of owning it -- taxes, maintenance -- can be considerable. Then absentee owners can suffer various indignities, such as the guy who decides to build a garden on your land, or the fellow who sets up a beekeeping operation there, or the homeless person who takes up residence -- or the kid who digs a tunnel in the side of a hill on your property, gets stuck, and has to be helicoptered out to a medical center. All these things happened to clients of Howard Hallengren of Falcon Real Estate Investment in New York City. When buying land, he notes dryly, "there's a lot to consider." <p>
Anything else? Land prices can be volatile, and the price direction is hard to predict: Changes in demographics, zoning, inflation, commodity prices, tax law, and luck all play a role. You can't rely on Wall Street analysts or investment newsletters to help you find and evaluate parcels for investment. And there is no central regulatory body equivalent to the Securities and Exchange Commission to oversee land and real-estate brokers or to set federal guidelines about the information brokers provide and the claims they make. <p>
You may find it impossible to assemble a diversified portfolio of land parcels, since you'll need at least $50,000 to $150,000 to buy just one promising piece. And it can be difficult to sell at any given time; thus, you may be stuck with your choice for years.<p>
In short, buying land ain't like buying a mutual fund. <p>
That said, are there any reasons to invest? <p>
Several.<p>
Land provides diversification. Stocks and bonds aren't much help during periods of rising inflation, but in some cases land can be. True, we haven't been through such a period for 16 years, and no one is looking for prices to move sharply higher this year or next. But contrarians exist, and some are interested in land. Bill Barnett, a broker with Joyner & Company in Richmond, Virginia, notes that pension funds have begun buying timberland in his state. "We didn't see pension funds buying land ten years ago," he says. <p>
It can be fun. A property can provide recreational or other uses while you're waiting for the value to appreciate. We found parcels close to sailing, fishing, skiing, hunting, hiking, and horseback riding. You might have to slap together a cabin to take advantage of these resources, but even that's not always necessary. Some parcels come with a cabin.<p>
Getting rich isn't out of the question. The fact that there aren't armies of analysts following land can work in your favor. You're more likely to stumble on neglected bargains. Also, many properties offer income opportunities that will cover taxes and other costs and perhaps boost your investment's total return.<p>
And there's always the chance you'll get lucky. Developer Lyle Anderson says that in his early days of buying and selling he made an occasional killing on raw land. "I once had a piece of property on the west side of Phoenix, several hundred acres, that the freeway ultimately went through," he says. "In 15 years, it had gone up 60 times in value." (Anderson now builds golf-course developments, such as Desert Mountain in Arizona -- over 8,000 acres with four courses and million-dollar homes.)<p>
Still, you probably shouldn't count on a freeway to bail you out. Instead, draw a bead on more fundamental issues by asking questions like: Where should I buy? What income will the land generate? What factors might affect the land's market value in the next 5, 10, or 20 years? (See "Be Careful Out There.")<p>
If after weighing all the pros and cons you decide you still want to buy land (or at least look at some parcels), turn to your local classifieds and check out for sale signs on rural roads; you might find a little gem not advertised anywhere else. We also looked in The Wall Street Journal's classified section and Islands magazine, which led us to a few properties. Most of our properties, however, were found through real-estate brokers. The Realtors Land Institute in Chicago (800-441-5263) provided the names of several hundred brokers; we called more than 30.<p>
The brokers told us again and again that it's hard to make money investing in land -- especially when you have only $150,000 to spend. But nevertheless, a number of them ended up singling out one property they -- and we -- thought might work.<p>
They often backed up their claims with numbers about timber cuttings, farm yields, taxes, and the like. And the claims weren't outlandish; if anything, they struck us as conservative. We sometimes found ourselves contemplating projections that promised -- get this -- single-digit annual returns. And not once did anyone suggest that a piece of land would double or triple in the next year. Wall Street could teach these people something about hyperbole. <p>
One way to make money in land is to buy property with development potential -- with the idea of developing it yourself (building a house on it, for example) or holding it until a real developer buys it from you. Developable land is often found on the outskirts of cities or towns in fast-growing regions. <p>
The fast-growing region that appeals to me (and everyone else) is the Pacific Northwest. I started calling brokers.<p>
Seattle? Too late. Bend, Oregon (population: 32,000), is more like it. Cool nights, low humidity, 250 days of sunshine a year, easy access to mountains, lakes, powder snow, clean rivers, and national forests. In short, telecommuter heaven. "A lot of people who do their work via fax and modem are moving here," confirms Kitty Warner, who has owned Duke Warner Realty in Bend for 30 years. <p>
Warner allows that our $150,000 may get us 20 acres 20 miles from Bend with a mountain view and easy access to skiing. But her best candidate turns out to be only seven miles outside of town: 15 acres on Gosney Road, offered for $139,500. The land is owner financed -- requiring 25 percent down and payment due in full at the end of the third year. The sellers bought a 60-acre plot and built on 30; they split the remaining acres into two parcels, including mine. Thus, the land is surrounded by other large plots. It has views of the snowcapped Cascades. I can ride horses onto 600 acres owned by the Bureau of Land Management. <p>
The property can't be divided again, so unless I want to fight zoning authorities (no way) I must abandon hopes of building a subdivision. But there is "septic feasibility" and paved access, which help. The property has been surveyed, there is a well, and it's zoned MUA-10 (multi-use agricultural). I'd have to apply for permission to work at home, but that shouldn't be a problem. Best of all, the land is 20 miles from Mount Bachelor's skiing, 25 miles from pristine trout-fishing lakes, 7 miles from the Deschutes River (white water), and 25 miles from Smith Rock (rock climbing). <p>
Expenses? I'd have to maintain the water system, trees around any power lines, and the road, including snow removal, but I could share some of those costs with my neighbors. Livestock is limited to horses, cattle, sheep, and llamas. So I could build on the land, ski every weekend, and sell when I get too old to ski. Or I could hold on to the land and sell it to a software designer from Northern California if Bend continues to grow and land prices surge. Warner figures that the parcel could appreciate between 5 and 15 percent a year. That's not bad, even after taxes of $640 a year.<p>
Back in Virginia, Bill Barnett has what might be a better idea -- if I'm willing to think like a real developer. For $97,000, he will sell me four adjacent lots totaling about 78 acres of former timberland on a state road in Fluvanna County (population: 16,000). The land is five minutes outside Palmyra, a sleepy village that is 20 miles from Charlottesville and 60 miles from Richmond. The owner (a timber company) will finance 75 percent of the purchase at 11 percent.<p>
Why Fluvanna County? Barnett says people from Richmond and Charlottesville are moving to the countryside between those two cities in search of better value and a more rural lifestyle. Writer John Grisham has a place in Albemarle County, which is about a 30-minute drive from my plot. And billionaire John Kluge has bought more than 10,000 acres south of Charlottesville during the past 15 years or so. The county even has vineyards -- surely a sign of a yuppie haven in the making. <p>
Also, Motorola has bought a site 40 minutes away. The company plans to build a $3 billion microchip factory that will eventually employ 5,000 people. Fluvanna County also has taken steps to reduce the amount and raise the quality of development; this ought to help support the value of lots already approved. <p>
The wooded parcels themselves stand on an elevated ridge across the road from a pasture and, on a clear day, offer views of the distant Blue Ridge Mountains. The land is surveyed, a driveway has been built, and the soil test has been done. Taxes are negligible: $111 a year for all four plots. Barnett won't commit to predicting the rise in value of this particular parcel, but he says a well-selected property should double in value within five years. <p>
Now we're talking, and I'm getting even more ambitious. Jeff Wooster, a broker in Bar Harbor, Maine, says he has 54 acres in Ellsworth (population: 6,200). Ellsworth is the gateway to Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island, which receives over four million visitors every year; it's also a commercial center for the area. The land is in a suburban residential neighborhood about a mile from downtown Ellsworth. It will cost me $125,000 or so; I can spend the other $25,000 in my budget building a road, doing tests, and getting approvals to divide the land.<p>
Wooster has a plan: Let's say I create 40 plots, which I then sell for $15,000 apiece. I offer owner financing, selling for $5,000 down and financing the other $10,000 at 10 percent over ten years. The down payments alone yield $200,000 (assuming I sell all the plots), and I get another $65,098 a year in loan payments. At the end of the decade, I have made $850,000 on my $150,000 investment. Before taxes, that comes to around 19 percent a year -- which is almost double the historic return of blue-chip stocks.<p>
Could be risky. Maybe I should buy the land and wait for a real developer to get interested in Wooster's plan.<p>
Land on the ocean or a lake-shore is likely to rise in value as baby boomers start buying second or vacation homes. Trouble is, that land is already too expensive for someone with only $150,000 to spend. <p>
Or so I figured. Mostly I was right, but Jeff Wooster came up with another idea. For $149,000, I can have four acres of land with 200 feet of shore frontage in tony Bar Harbor -- renowned vacation spot for upper-crust New Englanders and a hot spot for tourists during the high season. I've heard enough about Bar Harbor and its affluent denizens to be surprised at the low price. Besides, the place has access to great sailing, fishing, hiking, rock climbing, and sea kayaking. <p>
This property, incidentally, has a modest three-season cabin tucked away in a corner that I can rent out or use myself. But I'm really interested in the land. It has enough room for a larger, year-round house. Thus, it may be easy to resell to someone with real money -- Bar Harbor money -- or I can sell a portion of the lot and keep the cottage for myself. <p>
Feeling greedy, I decide to see if I can buy a whole island. Mary Reid, a salesperson with the Muljat Group in Bellingham, Washington, says that she recently sold a piece of an island -- "a few acres of rock out in the open" -- for $250,000, and that she knows of a bigger island with an airstrip and appraised at $1.65 million.<p>
Could I do better closer to home? I work in Portland, Maine. Portland has its harbor on Casco Bay, which has some 360 islands of its own. Ralph Ashmore, a local broker, tells me I can have a half to one and a half acres on an island for $100,000 to $190,000.<p>
His best idea: For $119,900 (reduced from $124,000), I can have just a bit more than half an acre facing the ocean on the back side of Peaks Island, a 15-minute ferry ride from Portland. I can buy the land and invest $200,000 or so to build a four-season home and live there year-round (the kids can commute to school on the ferry). Or I can buy the land and hold it with the idea of building or selling later. A trip out to the island, a chat with brokers there, and a walk around the property tell me I'll regret not buying this. The summer-rental market is strong; a house on my property might fetch $1,200 a week. Of course, together the land and house will cost me more than $300,000. Still, water views, lighthouses, rocky shores, the sound of the ocean.<p>
Before I set out to find a farm to buy, I talked to my friend Einar, who grew up on a beef farm in northwestern Pennsylvania. Einar warned me of cattails, which indicate unfarmable wetlands; of Budweiser-swilling hunters, who at the end of a deerless day don't always draw the line at cow murder (during hunting season, Einar dresses his dog in a yellow vest and ties it to the house); and of gory accidents (a neighbor lost a foot to a bushhog). "Don't do it," he warns.<p>
Ignoring Einar, I set out posthaste. After all, I just want to make some money off farmland. I don't actually want to be a farmer. Most people who set out to buy a farm for investment look for one that might find itself in the path of residential or other development. Meanwhile, they contract with real farmers to rent the land from them. <p>
Terry Riley, a broker in eastern Maryland who specializes in farmland, tells me to look for property with good road frontage and no wetlands (watch for cattails). Trees can be a problem: You or the developer may have to chop them down later. Zoning is an issue: How many houses could a developer put on the land? <p>
I also must find something to do with the farm while I'm waiting for it to appreciate. The obvious solution is to lease the farming rights -- but in some places that barely covers taxes. In other regions, you can lease the land's hunting rights for as much as $10,000 a year. (The Eastern Shore of Maryland is good for this; western Pennsylvania isn't.) <p>
Riley can't think of anything that's selling for less than $300,000 -- and neither can any other brokers I call in his neighborhood. Calls to Iowa and Wisconsin yield nothing much. A broker in Walla Walla, Washington, a town of 28,870 with the oldest continuous symphony orchestra west of the Mississippi, says he might be able to find me a 30-acre parcel on which to grow concord grapes -- my own vineyard! -- but doesn't. <p>
I do better in Minnesota. Howard Sturm, a broker in Cannon Falls, can sell me 121 acres in Kenyon, a town of about 1,400 people 50 minutes outside of Minneapolis. The seller wants $200,000, but I can borrow $50,000 of it at 8 percent over 15 years. The land is suitable for soybeans or field corn; it has a "crop-equivalency rating" of 88 to 90. Sturm informs me that anything higher than 75 is considered good, so I should not have a problem renting the land to a farmer or contracting with the local Green Giant factory, which will buy my product and provide the seed.<p>
Sturm figures I could own and manage the farm from Maine. All I need to do is come out once and meet some farmers who will rent from me; Sturm will find them and help me develop a crop plan. Doing it this way, he figures, I'll earn $13,920 a year. That is a 7 percent return -- before taxes ($2,080), disaster insurance ($464), and interest on the loan ($2,509). Those costs bring the annual return down to 4.4 percent.<p>
If I'm willing to hire a farmer to plant and harvest on my behalf -- I take the risk and get all the profit -- I might earn as much as $45,240. Subtract $20,880 for expenses such as seeding, fertilizing, weed control, and harvesting, then trim for taxes, insurance, and interest payments on the loan, and I'm left with a 9.7 percent return.<p>
Land broker Barbara Douglas in Winter Haven, Florida, has a warmer proposition: a 6.5-acre orange grove outside Winter Haven (population: 25,000) on the shores of Lake Confusion. Asking price: $65,000. <p>
The grove should produce 400 boxes of Valencia oranges an acre -- about $16,250 a year at $6.25 a box. After annual expenses of $1,640 an acre for fertilizer, weed control, harvesting, and taxes, I'd have around $5,590 left. That's an 8.6 percent annual return, excluding insurance, while I think about whether I want to develop the land or sell to someone who will. <p>
Douglas reckons I can divide the property into 15 lots of 15,000 square feet each. That leaves 20 percent of the acreage for road frontage. Then I could sell all of the lots for roughly $20,000 apiece -- a total of $300,000, for a $235,000 profit and roughly a 292 percent total return. That assumes I sell the lots, of course -- but with Winter Haven developing into a bedroom community for Orlando and Tampa, prospects could be good.<p>
My father refused to take me hunting during my youth in south Louisiana. But for $150,000 I figure I can buy a property to rival the hunting estates of the early Russian nobles. <p>
Having read William Faulkner's story "The Bear" as a youngster, I start my search in the South. It turns out that buying raw land just for hunting can be very expensive; in fact, I might be better off leasing land from someone else for a few bucks an acre each year. Then Mike Callaway, president of Land Brokers in Ringgold, Georgia, suggests another way to make buying the land worthwhile: Sell the trees on it. "We've seen a dramatic increase in the value of forest products on hunting lands," he says. Callaway recommends that anyone buying rural land with trees call the Association of Consulting Foresters of America (703-548-0990); the organization will suggest a qualified forester who can appraise trees.<p>
Broker Harold Hudgens Jr. -- Huddy to his friends -- of the Albany Land Company in Albany, Georgia, notes that most hunting properties in his region fetch more than my paltry $150,000 stake. But after some rummaging, he finds a 273-acre parcel 25 miles outside of Albany (population: 113,000). The price just happens to be $150,000. About 198 acres is cutover woodlands. He says the remaining 75 acres is suitable for such crops as cotton, soybeans, peanuts, and wheat. Deer, turkey, and dove abound.<p>
For income, I can rent out the cropland at $25 an acre annually; that's $1,875. Then I can rent out hunting rights for the property at around $15 an acre each year; that comes to another $4,095. Annual taxes: $1,095. <p>
Tommy Bell -- a consulting forester in Blakely, Georgia -- tells me I can add to my income if I plant timber at a cost of around $75 an acre. The first cutting, in ten years, will earn me an estimated $95,550. The second cutting, in 21 years, will earn about $143,000. <p>
As near as I can make out, that's about a 6.1 percent annual return over the next decade. I might do a bit better if the fees I charge for farming and hunting rights rise with inflation. Hudgens figures I'll get at least another 3 percent in annual appreciation from the land, even if inflation remains low. <p>
An advertisement in The Wall Street Journal leads me north to Dan Christmas, president of Christmas & Associates, a land-acquisition and sales company in Tupper Lake, New York. Christmas tells me that the western Adirondacks are getting attention from European buyers who want investments with good long-term growth potential. He also notes that film star Patrick Swayze was rumored to have looked at some land in the area back in 1995. What's more, demand for the region's hardwood trees is the highest it has been in several years. As a result, land prices have edged up approximately 10 percent since 1992 -- but they're still well below their peaks back in the late 1980s. <p>
Christmas's best offering: 200 acres near Cranberry Lake, some 45 minutes from Lake Placid (site of the 1980 Winter Olympics). Price: $149,000. The acreage is about six hours from New York City and six miles from the nearest major road. It's surrounded by great tracts of paper-company land, so parcels this size rarely come on the market in the area. <p>
The state-owned Five Ponds Wilderness is two miles away; it's a great place to canoe and go fly-fishing. There are plenty of grouse and deer for hunters, and the property has a good trout pond. "This is 200 beautiful acres in an area where real estate has been depressed," says Christmas. "It's like buying stock in Coke after a bad quarter." <p>
Christmas figures I can lease the land to hunting and fishing clubs in the area for around $6 an acre; that's $1,200 a year. And if I'm willing to let loggers cut 30 percent of the spruce, balsam, cherry, yellow birch, and other trees on the property, I can hope to clear $100,000 right away and another $100,000 in ten years, when I let them cut again. <p>
But let's say I don't want to log the land. The trees will add some value -- perhaps $2,000 a year -- simply by growing. If I build a cabin, I can rent it out part of the year for maybe $3,000 or more. Annual expenses will amount to around $1,000 or so a year for road maintenance and $5 to $7 an acre in taxes. Total annual return: 20 percent if I let someone log the land and a meager 3 percent if I don't. <p>
There's a lot of property out there. How about 270 acres of ranchland in southern Colorado for $159,900? The land is surrounded by 8,000 acres owned by the Bureau of Land Management, offers views of the snowcapped Sangre de Cristo Mountains and Spanish Peaks, and is ideal for horses, skiing, and mountain biking, says Sarah Harsch, an agent in La Veta, Colorado. Billy Long of William Long & Associates in Aspen tells me I can find more ranches in my price range in relatively isolated places like western Idaho.<p>
Then there's Alaska. Stuart Watkins, a broker in Anchorage, says I can pay $110,000 (cash only) for 160 acres west of Soldatna, on the Kenai Peninsula -- great fishing country south of Anchorage. "There's road access, so you could put up a subdivision with lots of room for recreation," says Watkins. <p>
But I don't want to become an Alaskan real-estate developer. No problem. Watkins has 40 acres in Talkeetna -- a jumping-off point for the climbers who attempt Mount McKinley each year. Or I can have 80 acres in the outback for $150,000. The land includes a mine. "I had some friends who bought a mine and found a hunk of gold as big as my hand," says Watkins. "They traded it for a Caterpillar tractor so they could keep mining." <p>
What happened? The mine flooded, and the tractor was ruined. Like the man said: There's a lot to consider<p>

						Is your appeal no longer appealing? Cash up front might help.<p>
By Teri Karush Rogers<p>
Even after losing at trial, deep-pocketed defendants have been known to appeal cases endlessly, forcing strapped opponents into skimpy settlements. Now little-guy plaintiffs can take heart: San Franciscobased Judgment Purchase Corp. will chip in -- for a stake in the spoils.<p>
Let's say your $1 million judgment is appealed, and you barely have money for gas, let alone legal expenses. You call JPC, which judges your case winnable (as it does in only 20 percent of the cases thrown its way) and offers you, in a typical example, $200,000 in exchange for $300,000 out of any money you collect. After paying your lawyers, you keep whats left of the 200 grand. If you win your appeal, you give JPC $300,000 from your settlement. And if you lose, you owe bupkes.<p>

						New rules force home sellers to disclose lead hazards<p>
By Kathleen Murray<p>
If you don't have young children, you probably haven't worried about lead paint in your home, but a new law may change that. Under federal regulations that took effect late in 1996, anyone selling a home built before 1978 (when lead paint was banned) must now disclose to the buyer knowledge of lead-based paint and its hazards on the property. <p>
Government officials estimate that nearly two-thirds of these pre-1978 homes (about 64 million) contain lead. That isn't necessarily a danger; lead paint is usually not hazardous unless it is chipping, peeling, or released in the air during remodeling. But high concentrations of lead can damage the brain, central nervous system, and kidneys, particularly in children under six. <p>
Before you have your home tested or the lead removed, however, you should understand what the law does and does not require. First, it doesn't require you to have your home tested for lead. If your house is on the market, you have to tell the buyer about lead paint only if you're aware of its presence. "The answer may be 'I don't know,'" says Daryl Jesperson, executive vice president with realty company Re/Max International. "And that's perfectly fine and legal."<p>
The risk you run is that a problem may come to light before the sale is final. The regulations allow the buyer ten days to have the house inspected for lead; the discovery of lead could affect the price or even scotch the sale. And once you know this information, it must be passed on to other prospective buyers. <p>
Patrick Connor, a lead inspector in Baltimore, estimates that 60 percent of his residential business in the past year has been from sellers who want to find lead before it can hurt their home's market value. "You're not going to have the EPA lead police out there," he says. "But you're going to have consumers who walk if they don't like what they see."<p>
Getting a home tested for lead will cost $200 to $400. If it's a home you want to buy, you may be able to get it done more cheaply as part of your home inspection. If you live in one of the 17 states that have lead-certification programs, you should hire a certified inspector. Otherwise, look for an inspector who has completed the EPA-required curriculum. For information and referrals on qualified inspectors, call the National Lead Abatement Council at 301-924-0804 or the National Lead Information Center at 800-424-5323. Or try HUD's lead-information Web page at http://www.hud.gov/lea/leahome.html, which also provides referrals on inspectors.<p>
A basic inspection will identify areas where lead is a problem and suggest a plan of action. Beware of evaluators who immediately recommend complete removal, also known as abatement, which can cost $10,000 or more. Some cities require abatement under certain circumstances, but removal should be considered only as a last resort. "Unless the house is completely dilapidated, abatement is usually more risk than it's worth because it generates a lot of dust," says Stephen Weil of the National Lead Abatement Council. <p>
Often you can reduce the lead to a safe level simply by having a contaminated area professionally treated; this runs about $200 (you can do it yourself for about $50). Connor also recommends using ski wax on painted wooden window frames and spraying Teflon on painted hinges as safeguards to keep paint from chipping.
"The point is not to be lead free but lead safe," says Connor. "And everything you need to do that you can usually buy at the Home Depot."<p>

						Keep your medical and savings plans in good shape<p>
By John Fried<p>
Planning a little year-end housecleaning? Your employee benefits deserve as much attention as your basement or closet. The end of the year is the deadline for opening many savings plans, and it marks the season of open enrollment for many employee-benefits options. That means now is the time to make sure you're taking advantage of what you've got and to make your changes for the upcoming year. Investigating these options should help you close 1996 with a solid "just did it" rather than a regretful "should've done that."<p>
Open a flexible spending account if your company offers this valuable option. Flexible spending accounts allow you to set aside pretax money that can be used to reimburse you for almost any medical expense except cosmetic surgery. The money is deducted from your paycheck on a regular basis, but the flex account is credited with the full year's balance on January 1. A common strategy: Put enough in the flex account so that it covers your medical deductible for the year.<p>
These accounts must be established for 1997 by year-end. You cannot, however, roll over money from your flex account from year to year. "In simple terms, use it or lose it," says Paul Fronstin, a health-care economist at Employee Benefit Research Institute.<p>
If you already have a flex account and haven't used all your money for 1996, make an appointment with the dentist or buy yourself an extra pair of reading glasses. That's your money in there, and if you don't spend it now, it goes back into your company's coffers at the beginning of next year.<p>
Many employers offer similar flex plans for child-care expenses, such as day care. These expenses are generally easier to estimate on a yearly basis because they involve regular weekly or monthly costs. The Internal Revenue Service has set a limit for dependent-care accounts of $5,000. (Regular flex accounts have no such IRS limits, though employers usually limit them to about $5,000.)<p>
Reassess your 401(k) plan. Many employers require you to make changes to your account now for the following year. "There are two basic decisions to consider when you're rethinking your 401(k) plan," says Paul Yakoboski, a benefits expert from EBRI: "How much you are putting in and how that money is invested." Most financial planners agree that you should put in at least as much as your company will match. In addition, Yakoboski suggests that employees assess their plan's asset-allocation method and consider whether their money is properly invested for their expected retirement needs. (For more information on allocating assets in a 401(k), see "Making It Personal" in the November issue of Worth.)<p>
If you already have a 401(k) plan established for this year but wish you could put more money into the account before the end of the year, it may not be too late. Some employers allow employees to increase their contribution or add a lump sum before year-end.<p>
Rethink your company's choices in health benefits, particularly if you're expecting a big change in your medical expenses next year. Perhaps you have a child who needs braces. Orthodontics may be covered at different rates under different plans offered by your company. Or perhaps you're expecting a baby and the obstetrician you want to use isn't in your HMO. In a case like that, it might be worthwhile to switch to a point-of-service plan or a preferred-provider organization, each of which allows you to go outside the program's network for an additional expense. Given that HMOs tend to cost more up front, leaving the HMO may pay for the increase in unreimbursable doctor's bills. If your expenses return to normal next year, and the HMO becomes the best option again, you can always switch back.<p>
And finally, if you earn income outside your regular job or are self-employed, consider self-employment plans (SEPs) or Keoghs as retirement-savings opportunities. Even if you cannot put money in one immediately, a 1997 Keogh account must be set up by year-end. Any money you put in before April 15, 1997, can be deducted from your 1996 taxes. A SEP can be set up any time before April 15, but you must decide between the two before the end of this year.<p>

						Now ten years old, E-banking is ready to take off<p>
By Jeff Blyskal<p>
More than a decade ago, when Citibank's automation ber alles policy put human tellers on the road to extinction, the Citi sank some $100 million into banking by home computer. It was the next logical step for inhuman banking. It was paperless, even bricks-and-mortarless. It was also a flop, because only 13 percent of households had a PC at the dawn of home computing.<p>
But Citibank's hallucinations have finally proved visionary. The rest of the world has caught up. Nearly 40 percent of American households now own a PC, and 26 percent have a modem. Not surprisingly, E-banks are sprouting like Web sites: More than 50 institutions now offer online banking. One bank serving customers in all 50 states, Security First Network Bank (<A HREF="http://www.sfnb.com">http://www.sfnb.com</A>), exists almost exclusively on a server computer in Atlanta. SFNB has $14 million in deposits in almost 5,000 accounts opened through its Web site; it also has two physical branches, in Atlanta and Pineville, Kentucky.<p>
The explosion in the number of electronic banks isn't the only reason to think this technology is poised to take off. The major drawback of E-banking is that your PC won't accept or dispense cash, but magnetic-cash-card technology is in the works. Next year in New York City, Citibank and <a name="NYSE:CMB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10322"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chase Manhattan</b></a> plan to launch smart cards that have a computer chip able to store up to 100 digital dollars. The cards will work at point-of-sale terminals much like ATM cards can now be used at supermarkets and gas stations. This could be the technology E-banking needs to make it the system of choice for bank customers.<p>
All E-bank accounts let customers do pretty much the same things: make direct deposits, pay bills, check balances, transfer funds, maintain a balance ledger. Paying bills with paper checks and other hard-copy transactions are still permitted, too. Online banks typically let customers open and manage other accounts at the same bank as well -- credit cards, loans, certificates of deposit. Institutions accessible through Quicken or Microsoft Money (for Windows 95) let users download account data directly from the bank. <p>
Competition will take place almost solely on the basis of price. Banks that exist primarily online -- like SFNB and Oneonta, New Yorkbased Wilber National Bank (<A HREF="www.wilberbank.com">www.wilberbank.com</A>) -- charge only basic checking-account fees. Other banks, including Chase, <a name="NYSE:PNC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11138"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PNC</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:WFC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11619"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wells Fargo</b></a>, require customers to open an old-fashioned checking account plus an online link to that account; they hit the customer for fees on both, with fees for the E-account ranging from $4.95 to $7.95 per month. A typical consumer -- with 21 bills and other payments, four deposits, and four ATM withdrawals per month, keeping an average daily balance of about $1,800 -- can pay as little as nothing to as much as $161 a year for an E-account, versus zero to $132 for regular checking at nine banks we studied.<p>
For now, E-banking appeals mainly to young, upscale customers -- just the sort banks are eager to entice. "PC-banking users are a very attractive customer base, because the more they get into using their PC, the more likely they'll consolidate their accounts with you," says Neal Chambliss, a group vice president at PSI, a financial-research firm based in Tampa. Once you're in the electronic tent, the bank can get you to buy a CD or sign up for a credit card -- the relationship thing. No wonder farsighted Citibank charges nothing for its PC Banking.<p>

						Apply for scholarship money through the Internet<p>
By Ellen DePasquale<p>
Are you looking at a college-tuition bill that causes you to consider taking a second mortgage? Before you head to the bank, take a seat at your computer; the Internet could be your safety net. Countless Web sites offer information on financial aid from a wealth of resources. You can find government assistance, information on individual schools, scholarship-search firms, and searchable online databases. <p>
Perhaps the most comprehensive site is FinAid, the Financial Aid Information Page (<a HREF="http://www.finaid.com">http://www.finaid.com</A>), which is sponsored by the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. FinAid offers numerous links for every financial-aid category listed above and is well organized and easy to navigate. Another helpful site is fastWEB (<a HREF="http://www.fastweb.com">http://www.fastweb.com</A>). Its primary attraction is a searchable database of scholarships from around the country. The database asks for relevant information, including the student's name, address, age, sex, grade-point average, selected major, first choice in schools, hobbies, work experience, and any military participation by the student or his or her parents. My search took approximately 15 minutes and returned 11 scholarship opportunities to apply for. Lastly, stop by the U.S. Department of Education (<a HREF="http://www.ed.gov/">http://www.ed.gov/</A>) for the Student Guide to Financial Aid, which offers various helpful sections, from "Finding Out About Financial Aid" to "Applying" to "Choosing a School Carefully."

						After all the partisanship, 1996 brought serious legislation that will affect how you save, buy, and retire -- and 1997 could be just as busy<p>
By Morey Stettner<p>
As President Bill Clinton faces off against a Republican-controlled Senate and House of Representatives for the next two years, citizens may be expecting an avalanche of overheated rhetoric and political posturing accompanied by very little actual legislation. But if the first two years of Newt Gingrich's Republican Congress were any indication, partisan squabbling does not always mean gridlock.<p>
Skeptical? Consider a surprising truth: The Republican 104th Congress passed a flurry of laws that will have a long-lasting impact on how you plan for retirement, pay your taxes, and make decisions when buying insurance. Recent legislation has also created consumer safeguards in a host of areas. Here's how to make the most of the new laws in 1997, along with other changes that might be in store in the year ahead. <p>
Tax incentives for saving <p>
With the help of the 104th Congress, you can stash away more money now for your retirement later. Several new laws offer new opportunities for tax-deferred savings. <p>
The enormous law that increased the minimum wage -- the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 -- also created dozens of tax breaks. For example, the law raises the maximum amount that a nonworking spouse can put into a spousal individual retirement account from $250 to $2,000 -- effective in tax years after 1996. That makes a one-earner couple's new total contribution limit $4,000 (or $2,000 per spouse). <p>
The expanded limits apply even if the IRA is not tax-deductible, which is the case for savers who also participate in a qualified retirement plan at work or who do not meet IRS income standards. Couples who don't invest the full $2,000 apiece may want to allocate the larger share of the IRA contribution to the younger spouse to delay required distributions in later years.<p>
Highly paid family members who work for the same employer also get a break for their retirement planning. Under the old "family-aggregation rules," married couples working for the same company couldn't contribute as much to their 401(k)s as individuals could. Those rules are repealed for tax years beginning after 1996. "Before this law, married people and their kids under 19 were treated as one individual for purposes of compensation," says Joseph Unger, a tax partner at M. R. Weiser & Co., an accounting firm in New York. "As a result, their contribution to a qualified retirement plan was aggregated. Now you are no longer put at a disadvantage for being married if you work at the same firm. The law puts married couples on par with other employees at the company."<p>
The minimum-wage law also cut some slack for higher-paid employees who want to beef up their 401(k)s. Prior to the law, some highly compensated workers were not allowed to  invest the annual maximum ($9,500 in 1996) in their 401(k)s. That's because those earning a salary of more than $66,000 a year and in the top 20 percent of their company's earners could not contribute proportionately more to a 401(k) than lower-paid employees. The limit has now been raised to $80,000. The proportion of employees considered to be highly compensated affects the maximum contribution, but in general, if the company's plan allows for a contribution of, say, 10 percent, an employee making $80,000 used to be able to contribute no more than $6,600. Now that person can contribute up to $8,000.<p>
And more people can join the 401(k) party. The law allows millions of employees of trade associations and other nonprofits to have 401(k) plans instead of less flexible 403(b) plans.<p>
The law lets IRA holders wait longer to begin tapping their savings. Plan participants were previously forced to begin withdrawing IRA funds by April 1 of the calendar year after they turned 70 and a half. Now, if they keep working beyond that age (and they own less than 5 percent of their own business), they can wait until the year they retire to receive plan distributions. Employed septuagenarians who do not need IRA money right away can let the funds grow tax-deferred for as long as they continue to work.<p>
"Most people don't want to be drawing down their pension while they're still working," says David Certner, senior coordinator of economic issues for the American Association of Retired Persons. "This postpones it until they actually do retire."<p>
Tinkering with Social Security<p>
Seniors who choose to continue working between the ages of 65 and 69 have another reason to cheer: They'll get more Social Security benefits. A law that passed in March raised from $11,520 to $13,500 the cap above which Social Security recipients start to lose a dollar in benefits for every three dollars they earn, and this limit will increase to $30,000 by 2002. <p>
Another new law eliminates Social Security's check-in-the-mail method of payment. New Social Security beneficiaries who have a bank account are now paid electronically through direct deposit. By 1999, all current beneficiaries will have to use direct deposit, too.<p>
"We're working with the banking industry to promote direct deposit as a safer and more efficient way to get  Social Security benefits," says Tom Margenau, spokesman for the Social Security Administration in Baltimore. Margenau says it costs 42.5 cents to mail a paper check, but only 2.5 cents to pay by direct deposit. The Social Security Administration expects to save $115 million a year by 1999 by paying beneficiaries electronically.<p>
Retirement Savings Plans<p>
Lump-sum distributions from retirement plans used to be frowned on by the government: Anyone withdrawing more than $155,000 in one year faced a so-called excess-distribution penalty of 15 percent. But another aspect of the minimum-wage law opens a three-year window for retirees to take out their savings without facing the penalty.<p>
"This is an opportunity for people with large balances in their plans to pull that money out without getting socked," says Dennis Coleman, principal at Kwasha Lipton, an employee-benefits consulting firm in Fort Lee, New Jersey. "The primary rationale for the government doing this is to raise revenue. A lot of people will use these three years to withdraw lots of money. And those withdrawals will be taxed. This means the government will collect more tax sooner. It's really a way to accelerate tax revenue." The penalty will be reinstated in 1999.<p>
Unger warns that one provision of the law is more curse than blessing for taxpayers. After December 31, 1999, taxpayers can no longer use five-year averaging to reduce taxes on lump-sum pension withdrawals. Five-year averaging allows taxpayers to receive a pension payout all at once but treat  it as taxable over a five-year period. "It's a negative move, because five-year averaging is very beneficial," Unger explains. "They repealed it because it was too complicated, and they wanted tax simplification. But it does not help. If anything, it'll cost some taxpayers money."<p>
Insurance as a Tax Write-Off<p>
Most people treat insurance simply as a financial necessity. But the Health  Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 -- better known as the KennedyKassebaum bill -- tosses some tax breaks into the mix.<p>
This modest stab at health-insurance reform makes health benefits more portable for job switchers and offers a particularly appealing prize for the self-employed: bigger tax deductions. Starting in 1997, self-employed workers can deduct up to 40 percent of their health-care expenses; the deduction increases to a whopping 80 percent in 2006. The law also lets individuals withdraw IRA funds without penalty prior to age 59 and a half to pay medical expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. <p>
New tax breaks are now in place for people who buy long-term-care insurance, which helps cover extended stays in nursing homes as well as ongoing custodial care. Starting in 1997, premiums for long-term-care insurance will be partially tax-deductible as a medical expense -- the older you are, the more you can deduct. Counting long-term-care policies as a medical expense will make it easier for many older taxpayers to surpass the threshold -- 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income -- above which they may start deducting medical expenses. Employer-paid premiums will not count as income for an employee.<p>
In addition, up to $175 a day in long-term-care benefits will be tax-free, and the limit will be indexed for inflation after 1997. Similarly, chronically ill individuals can exclude from tax $175 a day in accelerated life-insurance benefits. This will enable policyholders to get cash from their life-insurance policies while they're alive.<p>
Until now, it was unclear whether proceeds on so-called viatical settlements -- in which terminally ill individuals sell their life-insurance contracts in exchange for lump-sum payouts on part of the death benefit -- were taxable. The law makes the benefits tax-free to those defined as terminally or chronically ill. <p>
Consumer Protection<p>
Congress is often reluctant to enact new consumer laws for fear of alienating some deep-pocketed segment of the business community. But certain industries are handy punching bags for politicians, especially when their constituents complain about shoddy treatment. For example, new legislation makes it easier for consumers to evaluate the terms of a deal when buying a home or leasing a car. <p>
A year-end spending bill that Clinton signed on September 30 simplifies home-mortgage disclosure forms. "Instead of all the duplicative disclosure statements that list all the things you'll have to pay, the new law requires the Federal Reserve Board and HUD to come up with a one-page summary," says David Runkel, communication director of the House Banking Committee. "All mortgage firms will have to use the same, simple form."<p>
Disclosure forms for auto leases will also be easier to decipher. As of October 1, 1997, auto dealers and finance companies must clearly reveal the numbers that determine lease payments. Consumers will be able to ascertain the gross cost of a vehicle, its residual value, and the lease fees and other charges that inflate the monthly payment.<p>
The same law also regulates misleading lease ads. "There have been a lot of complaints about auto leasing," Runkel says. "Ads will be policed more carefully so that they provide set information on the total amount of the lease over the life of the lease, not just come-ons for low monthly payments."<p>
The mother of all consumer bugaboos -- credit bureaus -- also received some long-overdue congressional attention. Beginning in October 1997, consumers will find it easier to correct errors on their credit reports and learn when their credit history has been used against them -- say, to deny them insurance coverage or an apartment lease. In an acknowledgment of how irritating it can be to phone a credit bureau, the law requires these companies to set up toll-free numbers where callers can easily reach a live person, not just descend into automated Touch-Tone hell.<p>
Speaking of 800 numbers, one of the last laws passed by the 104th Congress established a toll-free hot line through which consumers can research the background of  a financial planner. "When you are picking a financial planner or investment adviser, one of the things you can do is check out  the person's background to determine if he or she has any previous enforcement action, lawsuits, arbitration cases, or any history of misconduct," says Jeff Duncan, legislative director for Representative Edward Markey, one of the law's sponsors. "You can already get information on a stockbroker using the NASD hot line [800-289-9999], but you cannot get information on a financial planner unless he is also registered as a stockbroker, which many are not." The new hot line should be ready some time in 1997. Duncan says that the number will probably be the same as the NASD hot line, but that has not been firmly established. <p>
The New Congress: Looking Ahead<p>
The 105th Congress is expected to grapple with tax reform, the privatization of Social Security, and the continuing health-insurance crisis. Beltway insiders who track legislation expect some hotly contested debates.<p>
"It'll be a big Congress for taxes," predicts Bill Mattea, legislative director for Senator Carol Moseley-Braun of the Senate Finance Committee. "Last year we went through this whole Congress without any significant change to the tax code, yet there was lots of talk about major changes. At the same time, ordinary people are paying much more in payroll taxes than in income taxes. That's something that'll be discussed in more detail in 1997."<p>
Then there's the perennial fight over the capital-gains tax cut. James Wickett, tax-policy analyst for the National Federation of Independent Business, says 1997 could bring a "technical-correction package" to the Small Business Job Protection Act that could both fix some legalistic, technical mistakes in the law and break new ground. "I wouldn't be surprised if the capital-gains tax cut was considered as part of that package," he says.<p>
Representative Bill Archer, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, has declared that his top two priorities in 1997 are a capital-gains tax cut and a child's tax credit. "We will also continue our efforts to abolish the tax code itself," adds Ari Fleischer, the committee's spokesman.<p>
At the same time, Social Security's future will take center stage. A caucus co-chaired by Representatives Jim Kolbe and Charles Stenholm is exploring market-oriented solutions, such as privatization. And Congress will propose a number of new bills to prolong Social Security's financial survival. <p>
"You will hear the words 'Social Security' a lot this year," says Michael Tanner, director of health and welfare studies at the Cato Institute. "But nothing will pass in the 105th Congress. These things take a few years to move through the system. My guess is that by 1999 a privatization law will pass." Clinton has talked of appointing a bipartisan commission to map out recommendations for Social Security's future, but the last such panel, chaired by Senators Bob Kerrey and John Danforth in 1994, didn't result in any action. Any real changes in Social Security will emerge from Congress.<p>
On the health-insurance front, Clinton has far less grandiose goals than his 1992 promise to extend coverage to the much-ballyhooed 37 million uninsured Americans. Now he proposes to guarantee six months of insurance to those who lose their jobs and to offer coverage to one million poor children. Senators John Kerry and Edward Kennedy have introduced a bill that would subsidize premiums for working-class families who can't afford private insurance but whose incomes are too high for Medicaid. Outgoing Labor secretary Robert Reich has also suggested a law to help retirees at risk of losing the health insurance provided by their former employers, although the mechanism for doing so has yet to be worked out. <p>
Finally, a bipartisan consensus is emerging to expand IRAs. "There has been discussion to convert existing IRAs into new IRAs you can use to buy a first home or fund college tuition," says Mark Luscombe, principal analyst at tax publisher CCH in Chicago. "Proposals by both Clinton and the Republicans can make possible the use of even nondeductible IRA funds on a tax-favored basis -- one more reason to get into a nondeductible IRA now." <p>
Some of these ideas may appear a little unlikely given a president and Congress that don't seem to have many goals in common. But if Clinton continues to appropriate Republican themes to secure his place atop America's political center, and if a defanged Newt Gingrich and his GOP cohorts continue to speak of moderation and bipartisan cooperation, we may hear less of gridlock and more of results.<p>

						Sovereign Citizens<p>
John Brant's excellent article "<a HREF="http://www.worth.com/articles/Z9609F08.html">Citizens of no Country</A>" (September) brought to mind a couple of questions: When sovereign citizens "travel" in their "personal property," do they use their own network of roads, or do they travel on highways that my "Monopoly money" maintains through taxes? When potential sovereign citizens pay Jeffrey Thayer for his House of Common Law course, do they give him troy ounces of gold, or does he accept "Monopoly money"?

Sovereign citizens may seem radical, but that does not make them wrong. If it did, the original patriots who founded this country, the founders of the state of Texas (who took up privately held arms and appropriated land for themselves), Abraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King Jr. would today be branded the same. We must never make the assumption that the government knows best. This country was born from freethinkers, and from freethinking comes our strength.
Jim E. Compton

You devote over nine pages to people who choose not to be part of society, although they travel on taxpayers' roads and certainly expect some protection from the roving gangs that would fill the void if we had no police. I assume they don't care whether or not the food products they buy are ever inspected, or the cafs they frequent. If their houses catch on fire, do they just watch them burn? Most of us would agree that the government is too intrusive and that far too much of our income goes toward taxes that subsidize waste, needless programs, and inefficiency. But there are better and more reasonable solutions. Being more responsible in all we do is the first step. The frontier no longer exists, and we have to develop a spirit of cooperation, not confrontation. 
James M. Power
Memphis, Tennessee<p>
John Brant's story on sovereign citizenship is laded with little ironies that reveal the crass hypocrisy of this movement. If these sovereigns were truly serious about divorcing themselves from the government, they wouldn't be driving their unlicensed vehicles on tax-supported roads, flying commercial air carriers that rely on the tax-supported air-traffic-control system, or touting their movement on cable programs whose owners' franchises are awarded by local governments. Too bad Brant didn't follow them into the bathroom so we could learn if their dedication to their cause extends to shunning the tax-supported sewer system in favor of outhouses and chamber pots. I doubt it.

I'd love to see more articles examining investor feelings toward online newspapers and magazines, investing via the Internet, etc. Surely, FastTrack isn't the only high-tech investing product around with a committed, enthusiastic following. How do real people really feel about investing technologies? What high-tech qualities lead to investing success?

Social Problems<p>
James K. Glassman's column on Social Security did absolutely nothing to help solve a very serious problem ("<a HREF="http://www.worth.com/articles/Z9609E01.html">Social Insecurity</A>," September). Social Security is a social-insurance program that provides a reliable base of income for millions of retirees, survivors, and the disabled. Social Security, in combination with Medicare, distributes among all working families the burdens of caring for the elderly and disabled. With the demise of defined-benefit pensions, we need Social Security more than ever. No prudent person should want to rely on the vagaries of the capital markets as a sole source of retirement income. The privatization program urged by the profiteers would do just that.
Mel Aaronson

I urge all publications to beat the drums for cutting out cost-of-living increases except once every three or four years -- and making that one a 5 percent increase. That would be a great savings, and I believe that most senior citizens, including me, would be willing to forgo the annual increase. But the American Association of Retired Persons and similar organizations keep trying to convince Congress this is a no-no. Glassman's idea of compensating wealthier retirees and cutting them out of Social Security is a good one. I believe most would be willing to give it a try.

Follow-up<p>
Californians will be voting this fall on a proposition that would increase the ability of individual investors to launch so-called strike suits, in which a company gets hit with a class-action suit alleging securities fraud. Andrew Tobias unsuccessfully sought to deter such suits last March with Proposition 201 and wrote about it for Worth ("<a HREF="http://www.worth.com/articles/Z9610C01.html">Ralph Nader Is a Big Fat Idiot</A>," October). Proposition 211, which will appear on the November 5 ballots in California, would allow pensioners to file the type of class-action lawsuits in California state courts that have been curtailed in federal court, as Tobias reported. Opponents of the measure argue that its purpose is to create a climate in which lawyers can file frivolous lawsuits in the hopes of gaining out-of-court settlements from large corporations. Bill Clinton and Bob Dole have both said that they are opposed to Proposition 211.<p>

						Bill Gross hates excess -- that's why he's so good at running bond funds.<p>
By Michael Peltz<p>
Pacific Investment Management co-founder William Gross can be brutally honest. Taken aback by the April death of 328-pound baseball umpire John McSherry from a heart attack on the field in Cincinnati, only seven pitches into the season, Gross wrote in his monthly newsletter, Investment Outlook: "He'd been killed by his fatness, by a billion molecules of sink clogging, Drano-resistant cholesterol that fed on his coronary artery and sucked up his life's blood like a vampire in the heat of the night."<p>
Why does the man widely considered one of the premier authorities on fixed-income investing care about the weight of an umpire? Gross says his graphic description of McSherry's inability to control his eating -- "the man, it seemed, was a Cuisinart with limbs" -- was meant to be instructive. "I thought there were some good lessons to learn about the importance of discipline and willpower," says the trim six-foot, 175-pound bond trader.<p>
**Self-discipline is the key to PIMCO's success.**<p>
Self-discipline has been the key to Gross's success since he, James Muzzy, and William Podlich founded PIMCO 25 years ago in idyllic Newport Beach, California. The firm now manages $81 billion, mostly in institutional assets. In 1987, PIMCO introduced one of the first no-load mutual-fund groups, PIMCO Funds. Today, 15 of its 22 eligible funds have four-star or five-star Morningstar ratings. "Bill Gross and PIMCO are a fixture in the fixed-income markets in the same manner as Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch are in stocks," says Morningstar analyst Mark Wright.<p>
Unlike other bond managers who have often been sideswiped chasing high yields, PIMCO hasn't wavered in pursuing what Gross calls "total return" -- yield plus capital appreciation. "The big mistake investors make is they reach for yield and bid up the price of bonds," explains Muzzy. Applied with Gross's discipline, PIMCO's total-return strategy shows that an active fixed-income manager can beat the indexes. (For a story on managers who never beat their bogeys, see "<A HREF="http://www.worth.com/articles/M9611I02.html">Losers Out of the Gate</A>.")<p>
**When the firm's strategy backfired early this year, a disaster was thwarted by other well-placed investments.**<p>
Last year and this have shown exactly how the discipline works. PIMCO turned very optimistic on interest rates back in the spring of 1995, a strategy that proved highly successful until early this year, when long-term Treasurys plummeted as rates shot up from 6 percent to 7. That would have been a disaster for most fixed-income managers. Yet, through August, the <a name="FUND:PTNAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PTNAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Total Return Fund</b></a> was down only 1.36 percent for the year, thanks to well-placed sector bets on mortgage-backed securities, European bonds, and high-yield debt. "Outside of interest rates, they've gotten everything else right," says Morningstar's Wright, who isn't worried about the fund's recent underperformance.<p>
Switching among different types of bonds is critical to PIMCO's strategy as the firm's 13 traders search a universe of 54,000 domestic and international securities for undiscovered values. Currently, the firm is still heavily weighted in mortgages, which represent about 40 percent of its portfolio, but it has reduced its non-U.S.-bond exposure from 20 percent to 5 percent.<p>
**PIMCO's total-return strategy has been going strong since the mid-1970s.**<p>
Gross developed PIMCO's total-return strategy during the mid-1970s, when active bond management was just gaining credibility. Gross persuaded management at Pacific Mutual to reorganize PIMCO from an equity manager to a bond manager after the 197374 market slide.<p>
PIMCO had $5 billion under management by the early 1980s, but the markets were getting increasingly complex. Wall Street's investment banks had begun raiding academia for Ph.D.'s, whose fancy options-pricing models helped their traders value bonds more accurately. In 1984, Gross brought in "computer geek" Frank Rabinovitch and charged him with upgrading the firm's computer systems and software.<p>
Today, PIMCO's network of workstations and servers has roughly the same computational power as two Cray supercomputers. Every Friday night, after PIMCO's portfolio of 1,500 securities has been updated, the computers kick into high gear. Some 12 hours and 200 trillion calculations later, the firm's portfolio managers know the precise duration for each institutional account and mutual fund.<p>
**Adjusting duration is PIMCO's most valuable part of its strategy.**<p>
Adjusting duration -- which measures the rate of change of a bond's price with respect to its yield -- is probably the most valuable tool for implementing PIMCO's long-term strategy. The longer the duration, the more sensitive a bond is to movements in interest rates; so, when PIMCO is optimistic and expects bond yields to fall, it lengthens duration. Conversely, when PIMCO turns negative, it shortens duration. Currently, the firm's duration is about 5.9 years, a full year longer than the Lehman Aggregate Bond Index.<p>
Gross and his team deploy their strategies from the firm's high-tech trading room, set against a panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean. The portfolio managers are divided into two camps: the generalists, Gross, Rabinovitch, David Edington, John Hague, and William Powers; and the specialists, including high-yield expert Benjamin Trosky and international-bond maven Lee Thomas III. "The generalists make sure the portfolios are structured similarly," says Muzzy, "while the specialists are there to find the best buying opportunities." The generalists, including Gross, do most of their own trading, which they say can add as much as 50 basis points to performance. "If we're wrong on our large secular [interest-rate] bet, we can make up for it on the trading side," says Edington.<p>
**PIMCO also devotes heavy consideration to its top-down analysis of the economy.**<p>
PIMCO's investment strategy is top-down driven, based on the firm's long-term economic forecast. Unlike many other bond managers, PIMCO doesn't employ an economic guru to divine the direction of interest rates. "We don't have a single economist here," says CEO William Thompson Jr. "Every portfolio manager is expected to do his own economics homework."<p>
The cornerstone of PIMCO's top-down approach is a weeklong retreat each spring for its 58 investment professionals to discuss global macroeconomic trends. Gross loosely presides over the forums, and prominent academics are brought in to stimulate discussion. This year's meeting featured Harvard University economist Jeffrey Sachs, best known for his work advising former Eastern-bloc countries on how to move from Communism to capitalism.<p>
Like Sachs, PIMCO has been studying the globalization of capital markets since the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, but with an eye to its impact on bond rates. "As more and more nations have jumped into the capitalistic pool," explains Gross, "the multitude of swimmers has made it increasingly possible for production to migrate to the world's cheapest ports of call." Low-cost labor in emerging countries like China restrains wages in the developed economies of Japan, Germany, and the U.S. and leads to low inflation. Demographic trends also play a big role in damping inflation: As the populations in the major developed countries get older, they are more likely to save than to spend.<p>
**Gross is backing bonds -- the 15-year bull market can't go on forever.**<p>
The case for holding bonds has rarely been stronger, Gross believes. The 15-year-old equity bull market -- and the oversize returns that investors have come to expect -- can't go on forever. "Even if the economy is growing at 5 percent a year, companies can't continue to manufacture profits at double-digit rates of return," says Gross, noting that declining profits will ultimately translate into lower stock returns. In a world where equity returns mimic hat sizes, he adds, investors will be happy to get 7 percent income from bonds.<p>
Still, it is going to take more than Gross's salesmanship to get retail investors back into fixed-income funds. According to the Investment Company Institute, an astonishing $40 billion flowed out of bond and income mutual funds following the brutal market of 1994 (see chart above), when long-term Treasury bonds lost 7.8 percent. "The sell-off in the bond market in 1994 scared people away, and they never came back, even though 1995 was a strong year," explains Fred Quirsfeld, a senior portfolio manager at American Express Financial Advisors.<p>
To Gross, that just means many investors will miss out on some attractive returns. With inflation in check, PIMCO believes long-term Treasury rates will stay between 5 percent and 7 percent during the next few years. Recent rates, of course, have bounced above 7 percent, but that only increases Gross's resolve. "Bonds have a clear place in this market," he says. "Investors will be very glad to own them during the next recession."<p>
Even in this market, though, investors should approach bond mutual funds circumspectly, says Gross. "As with stock funds, it's very important to find fund families with very low expenses. If you're only going to get 7 percent a year, to pay close to 1 percent in fees is preposterous."<p>
**Changes at PIMCO are making it difficult for individual investors to take advantage of their strategy.**<p>
The problem is that PIMCO has made it harder to follow Gross's advice. In the past, individual investors could invest in several PIMCO funds through Charles Schwab's fund marketplace for a minimum investment of only $1,000. But last year, PIMCO eliminated that no-load distribution channel because it competed with a new line of load funds offered by <a name="FUND:PVLAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PVLAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PIMCO Advisors</b></a> that was created when PIMCO spun off from Pacific Mutual Life Insurance and merged with Thomson Advisory Group in November 1994.<p>
PIMCO offers its no-load funds via special relationships with Schwab, Fidelity Investments, and Jack White & Co. These funds, however, require higher minimums or, in the case of Schwab and Fidelity, a relationship with a registered investment adviser. <p>
But there is a little-publicized way for investors to get Gross's expertise in a no-load version -- by turning to the <a name="FUND:HABDX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/HABDX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Harbor Bond Fund</b></a> or the <a name="FUND:FBDFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FBDFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fremont Bond Fund</b></a>, both of which Gross manages as a sub-adviser. "They essentially mirror the Total Return Fund," says one PIMCO watcher, noting that those funds' recent six-month and one-year records matched those of their bigger and better-known cousin. That's welcome news for would-be investors who are unwilling to use a fee-based adviser but still want to avoid the steep charges of the PIMCO Advisors funds: Loads for the A shares of a Gross-managed PIMCO Advisors fund start at 4.75 percent, while the deferred-load B shares carry 1 percent annual 12b-1 fees plus expenses of 2 percent.<p>
Accessing genius, it seems, occasionally has its price.<p>

						By Jim Jubak<p>
If the mutual-fund companies applied as much effort to the investing process as they do to the creation of new ways to charge fees, investors would be a lot better off. That has been especially true in recent years. Fund marketers have displayed unusual creativity in developing schemes for lining their pockets in new and more complicated ways.<p>
Take Legg Mason as just one example. The Legg Mason Value Trust, a large-cap growth fund, looks like a no-load fund. There's no sales charge for buying shares and none for selling. An investor might be forgiven for thinking that all he or she pays is the 1 percent annual management fee -- not unreasonable for a large-cap growth fund.<p>
But that 1 percent isn't all a shareholder in this fund has to cough up. Legg Mason also collects an additional annual fee of .95 percent. That not-so-tiny charge, dubbed a 12b-1 fee, is deducted from fund assets to pay for distribution and marketing costs and can add up fast. For example, an investor who holds the Legg Mason fund for five years would wind up paying a total of 4.75 percent of assets in 12b-1 costs, making the fund nearly as expensive over time as many of the funds sold with old-fashioned front-end loads by <a HREF="http://www.ml.com/">Merrill Lynch</A>, <a HREF="http://www.painewebber.com/">Paine Webber</A>, or <a HREF="http://www.aimfunds.com/">AIM</A>. This is why we have begun factoring 12b-1 fees into our rating system.<p>
**Fund investors looking for a true no-load are finding an increasingly narrow range of choices.**<p>
Sadly, fund investors looking for a true no-load fund are combing through an increasingly narrow range of choices. This group -- composed of those funds that don't impose any sales charge or 12b-1 fee -- has fallen to 251 funds, or 35 percent of the 719 funds on our list. And while traditionally investor-oriented fund families, such as <a HREF="http://www.troweprice.com/">T. Rowe Price</A>, <a HREF="http://www.scudder.com/">Scudder</A>, <a HREF="http://www.strong-funds.com/java/welcome.htm">Strong</A>, <a HREF="http://www.vanguard.com">Vanguard</A>, <a HREF="http://www.janusfunds.com">Janus</A>, and <a HREF="http://www.twentieth-century/">Twentieth Century</A>, are all still holding the line, one more no-load family will bite the dust on October 25. That's when the sale of Michael Price's Mutual Series funds to the Franklin Templeton Group will close; the funds will then add a 4.5 percent sales charge for new investors.<p>
Nor is the fund industry cutting fees in other areas to make up the difference. The average maximum sales charge -- 2.82 percent -- was virtually the same for this year's group of funds as for last year's. The expense ratio dropped slightly, from $1.33 per $100 in 1995 to $1.24 in 1996, but that had more to do with our decision to remove the very smallest funds and sector funds from our list this year than with any industry trend.<p>

						This may be the one time it makes sense for you to read a whole story devoted to the subject of mutual funds. Why? Because the asset-allocation strategy and model portfolios we describe here can work just as effectively for investors who make their own stock selections as for those who buy funds. Investors can easily classify stocks by employing the same criteria we use to place mutual funds into five asset groups. By doing so, investors who own stocks (or a combination of stocks and funds) can ascertain whether their overall portfolio is strategically balanced to meet their needs.

						Attaching some strings to trusts can help you and your children<p>
By Claire Poole<p>
When she turned 25, a Houston woman, the scion of a wealthy family, was given $110,000 from a trust fund her grandfather had set up in the early 1960s. Instead of investing and saving the money, she lived off it for four years while she attended graduate school, lived the high life in New York, and traveled, including spending one summer in Paris. Now in her 30s and starting a family, she'd like to turn back the clock. "I didn't learn how to manage the money," she says. "I learned how to spend it."<p>
Unfortunately, it's a common problem for many trust-fund children. Parents and grandparents want to hand down their hard-earned riches so their offspring never have to be without. But usually a trust is a lot of money -- and responsibility. Who's to say they won't blow it on a Ferrari or a trip around the world? <p>
**There are methods to making sure your heirs use their trust funds wisely.**<p>
But there is a way to keep your children from turning into trust bums. Trust funds are not boilerplate documents and can easily be written with a few strings attached. These so-called incentive trusts are increasingly popular among wealthy individuals who want to bolster their children's initiative by making them jump through a few hoops before receiving their inheritances.<p>
"[Clients] are becoming concerned that their wealth will have a very destructive impact on their descendants," Stephanie Denby, an attorney with the Chicago law firm Schiff, Hardin & Waite, recently wrote in the trade journal Trusts & Estates. "Long criticized as 'ruling from the grave,' incentive trusts are now increasingly being used to direct the development of beneficiaries."<p>
The trick in crafting such a trust is to have one broad enough to cover unexpected changes in fortune but specific enough to protect your children from themselves. Here are several ways:<p>
**Spread out the wealth.**<p>
Spread out the wealth. Your child doesn't have to get the entire wad when he or she turns 21. It's more likely to sap his or her initiative than to help. Many attorneys suggest staggering principal payments over several years -- decades, if you want. <p>
The most common ages to break out a trust are 25, 30, and 35. Why? At 25, the kids are out of college and working or in graduate school. At 30, they've probably established a career and married and are considering buying a house. At 35, they may be having children and beginning to save for their kids' college education and their own retirement. <p>
You could also distribute earnings only until they hit a certain age -- retirement, perhaps -- and then hit them with the principal. Michel Kaplan, a tax and estate lawyer in Nashville, had one wealthy client who didn't distribute the balance of his children's trust fund until they turned 50 and 60 years old. "Real wealthy people look at money as something to pass on to the next generation," he says. "So the bigger the estate, the longer you want to hold it in trust."<p>
But don't hold back too much, or your kids will never learn how to manage their money. "A lot of parents think they're doing the child a service by keeping it from them," says Martin Shenkman, an estate-planning attorney based in New York City and author of The Complete Book of Trusts (John Wiley & Sons, 1993). "You have to get the child used to the money so they'll develop the maturity to deal with it." <p>
**Include incentives.**<p>
Include incentives. If you want to instill your value system in your children, you can build in some hurdles they must clear to get a chunk of the money. These provisions can be as general as finishing college, earning a living, or raising a family, or as specific as making a 3.5 grade-point average, earning $100,000 a year, or taking over the family business. <p>
Jon Gallo, a Los Angeles attorney specializing in estate planning, recently structured a trust so the children would receive 15 cents on the dollar for the first $15,000 they earned in income, 30 cents for the next $15,000, 60 cents for the next $15,000, and 100 cents once their income reached $45,000. "The more successful the child is, the more matching comes out of the trust," he says. <p>
But Gallo doesn't advise using a trust to do your teaching for you. "You can use a trust as an incentive toward productive behavior," he says. "But there's nothing an estate planner can do if the parents don't teach their children the appropriate virtues."<p>
Incentive trusts can also backfire. Say you want your children to get a big chunk when they finish college. But what if Junior isn't academically inclined and starts a small business instead? Make the trust broad enough to cover all legitimate definitions of success.<p>
**Take a family-bank approach.**<p>
Take a family-bank approach. You can set up a pool trust for the entire family that will provide only for health, education, and well-being until the funds are fully distributed. It would be up to the trustee to decide if the children's needs fit the amount they want to tap -- and if they can handle it.<p>
For instance, Michel Kaplan has a client with a $6 million estate. He has two daughters, both of whom are successful in their careers and happily married. He also has a son in his late 30s who has never held down a job for more than six months. When the client dies, what should happen with his son's $2 million share? "It's a real dilemma," Kaplan says. "He doesn't want to cut him out, but he doesn't want to give him a free ride either." Kaplan suggested the client set up a trust in which the trustee has the broad authority to pay out or withhold money depending on the child's ability to handle his affairs.<p>
That means it's vital to choose your trustee wisely. You really shouldn't manage the trust yourself, because of possible tax and legal consequences, and your attorney would probably run into conflicts of interest. So in selecting an independent trustee, you want someone who has enough latitude to make the right decisions but also understands your wishes.<p>
You could go with a bank or a trust company. But many won't look at you unless you have at least $250,000. And the fees can be high -- 1 percent per year for the first $500,000 in assets, with the fee declining with additional funds. Plus, institutions are not as sensitive to family concerns. If that's important to you, consider a family member or friend, one who has the same values as you and doesn't mind doing a little extra paperwork come tax-time. <p>
But there's peace of mind in parking the trust with a bank or trust company that will manage it, invest it, and deal with difficult beneficiaries. "Relatives are good at understanding the situation and doing the right thing," Kaplan says. "But typically they're not good at investment management, filling out tax returns, and getting the money out on a timely basis." <p>
The solution? Have a family member and a bank or trust company as co-trustees. "That way, you can delegate all the administrative paperwork to the corporate trustee and allow the family member to help make decisions on discretionary distributions to family members," Kaplan says.<p>
**Allow for emergency needs only.**<p>
Allow for emergency needs only. Prudent parents may want to allow the trust to distribute earnings or principal only in dire situations, such as if the child develops serious health problems, is sued, or finds himself or herself unemployed and with a family to support. Items can even be paid directly by the trustee, so there's no chance that the money will land in the hands of the beneficiary -- a good safeguard if your child is a spendthrift or a drug addict.<p>
D. John Thornton, a Boise, Idaho, attorney specializing in high-end estate planning and wealth preservation, has a client in New York whose son is a successful surgeon in Los Angeles. But his parents have never forgiven him for marrying out of his religion and moving to L.A. In this case, the fund allows the son only emergency provisions but provides very broadly for his children.<p>
**Consider a limited partnership.**<p>
Consider a limited partnership. A limited partnership can basically do the same things as a trust, but it's structured differently. Instead of having a trustee, you would establish yourself as the general partner. That would eliminate the middleman, i.e., the trustee. "It allows the parent to call all the shots, including how to invest the money and when to dole out the distributions," says Gideon Rothschild, a New York estate-planning attorney. "A limited partnership is a darned good way to do that."<p>
The parent typically retains a small ownership interest in the partnership (say, 1 percent), assigning the rest to his or her children. If the parent dies, only that 1 percent would be included in the parent's estate, and an appointed successor would take over the partnership. If a successor was not named, the partnership would be liquidated, and the proceeds would go to the children. <p>
There are tax incentives, too. Income from a trust fund is taxed at the top personal rate of 39.6 percent as soon as it crosses $7,900 a year. The child's share of income in a limited partnership would be taxed at his or her bracket, which could be as low as 15 percent. 
There are a few drawbacks. The start-up costs are higher -- typically $3,000 to $5,000 versus $1,000 to $2,500 for the standard trust. Then there's the concern that the child might waste the partnership's distributions. The solution? Put each child's partnership interest in a trust. "Now you have another layer of control," Martin Shenkman says.<p>
Whatever route you choose in setting up a trust, make sure your children are adequately covered for life's little emergencies but can also make mistakes along the way and learn from them. "Remember," says Shenkman, "you can't rule from the grave."

						Great last-minute airfares appear on the Net every week.<p>
By Rudy Maxa<p>
Every Wednesday, American Airlines, <a name="NYSE:U"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11527"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>USAir</b></a>, and <a name="NASD:NWAC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=17160"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Northwest Airlines</b></a> post cut-rate weekend deals on their World Wide Web sites for flights on which the airlines think excess seats will be available. The rules are fairly simple: You must travel that Saturday and return the following Monday or Tuesday. In the case of USAir, you may return on Sunday. American also tosses in deals with Avis (<a HREF="http://www.avis.com">www.avis.com</A>) and <a name="NYSE:HLT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10733"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hilton Hotels</b></a>. Both American and USAir allow you to register your E-mail address on the Web sites so that each Wednesday you'll be automatically notified of special bargains. You must visit Northwest's site to see each weekend's offerings.<p>
The deals usually involve the airlines' hubs, so American offers a good mix of flights to and from Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Miami. USAir specializes in flights to and from Pittsburgh, Washington, Boston, and Charlotte, North Carolina. And Northwest's menu includes plenty of flights to and from Minneapolis/Saint Paul. American generally offers the most options, USAir comes in second, and Northwest is third. The savings are extraordinary if you can travel on short notice -- as much as 75 percent off walk-up fares. Some recent examples: Chicago to Dallas/Fort Worth round-trip on American cost just $129, while USAir charged only $79 for a round-trip ticket from New York City's LaGuardia to Pittsburgh. For more information, check out American Airlines at <A HREF="http://www.amrcorp.com">http://www.amrcorp.com</A>, USAir at <A HREF="http://www.usair.com">http://www.usair.com</A>, and Northwest at <A HREF="http://www.nwa.com.">http://www.nwa.com.</A><p>

One of the obvious virtues of the aptly named World Wide Web is that it brings the world into your house. This makes it a great resource for those who want to get out and hit the road, too. Start with maps. Map Quest (<A HREF="http://www.mapquest.com">http://www.mapquest.com</A>) covers the entire United States, and users can scale the maps of most populous locations down to the level of a few city blocks. Plug in a pair of points, and the site will calculate a route and the driving distance between them. There's also an address finder. If old-fashioned foldout road maps are still needed, thousands can be ordered at Travel Search (<A HREF="http://www.travelsearch.com">http://travelsearch.com</A>). Of course, knowing where you're going doesn't mean you're home free. Check MSNBC's weather pages (<A HREF="http://www.intellicast.com">http://www.intellicast.com</A>) for forecasts anywhere in the country, or call up a real-time satellite photo of North America at Yahoo Weather (<A HREF="http://www.wni.com/yahoo/">http://www.wni.com/yahoo/</A>). If Houston is your destination, information about a different kind of travel hazard can be found at AccuTraffic (<A HREF="http://www.accutraffic.com">http://www.accutraffic.com</A>), which provides maps of current traffic flows; the service is being developed for another nine cities. Finally, if you want something other than franchise food, the Web site of Roadside (<A HREF="http://www.usa1.com/roadside/index.html">http://www.usa1.com/roadside/index.html</A>), the magazine of diner aficionados, lists blue-plate specials in various parts of the U.S.

						Even the managers thought investors were paying excessive fees for the Quantitative Numeric Funds<p>
By Michael Peltz<p>
"It felt like they put a gun to our heads," says Edward Pittman, looking back on the day early last March when he received a fax from *Numeric Investors' John Bogle Jr. and Langdon Wheeler. The partners were resigning as sub-advisers to his Quantitative Group of Funds to start their own mutual funds. Like many a falling-out in the fund world, this one was about fees. But Bogle and Wheeler weren't complaining that they were making too little money. Instead, these managers were quitting because they thought the Quantitative Group was overcharging investors.<p>
Both the <a name="FUND:QBNAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/QBNAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Quantitative Numeric</b></a> and <a name="FUND:QNIIX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/QNIIX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Quantitative Numeric II</b></a> Funds have high expense ratios -- 1.97 percent and 2.34 percent, respectively, including annual 50-basis-point 12b-1 fees to pay for marketing the funds -- as well as a 1 percent charge when investors cash out. Nonetheless, because of Bogle's performance (annualized returns of nearly 22 percent for the  past three years through June 1996, a full six percentage points better than the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks) and name recognition (his father is chairman of Vanguard Group), the first Quantitative Numeric fund sold well enough to close to new investors. But Quantitative Numeric II struggled to attract assets. "Financial planners looked at the fee structure and turned up their noses," says Wheeler.<p>
"Expenses should come down during the life of a fund," says Bogle, "but after the fund closed, expenses were still 180 basis points." Both funds even continued to charge 12b-1 fees to cover the cost of marketing, although the closed fund no longer needed to be marketed. Wheeler and Bogle's new funds carry no 12b-1 fees and cap expenses at 1 percent. Pittman, a former Securities and Exchange Commission attorney, argues that the 50-basis-point 12b-1 fee was, in essence, a commission for financial planners. <p>
The Quantitative Group, which has turned over management of its Quantitative Numeric funds to Robert von Pentz of Washington, D.C.based Columbia Partners, has refused to let the partners use the "Numeric" name on their funds. Instead, they are listed under "n/i." "It's making it hard for people to find us," says Wheeler.

Our list of the 200 best financial advisers isn't the only such register. <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab & Co.</b></a>, the brokerage that has prospered by appealing to do-it-yourself investors, also has a list for folks who don't want to plan for themselves -- and have at least $100,000 in investable assets.<p>
Schwab (800-777-3337) currently has a roster of 400 advisers. To make the list, an adviser must already have at least $10 million under management, five years of experience, and a clean disciplinary record. The advisers pay Schwab 30 percent of their first-year fee as a referral commission, 25 percent in the second year, and 20 percent in the third year.

As bewildering as the concepts involved in financial advising is how advisers get their compensation. Here's the skinny:<p>
"Fee-only" means the adviser gets paid only by the client, with no compensation contingent on the purchase or sale of any financial product, such as a mutual fund or life insurance. Fee-only planners can be paid a fee for services rendered, a percentage of the assets under management, or both. Flat rates range from $1,500 to $4,000 and up, depending on the size and complexity of a person's financial situation. Per-hour fees go from $100 to $250 and asset-under-management fees from 0.5 percent to 2 percent.<p>
A commissioned adviser gets paid on a per-transaction basis -- usually a percentage -- by the companies whose products he or she sells. Stockbrokers and life-insurance agents are almost always paid on commission.<p>
"Fee-based" connotes an adviser who gets a combination of fees and commissions, usually more commissions than fees. The terminology was developed to avoid the word "commission" in a compensation description; "commission-based" might be more accurate. Our chart calls these advisers "fee and commission."<p>
"Fee-offset" is an infrequently seen hybrid in which the adviser quotes a flat fee, then subtracts any commissions that result from the implementation of the financial plan.<p>
From a conflict-of-interest standpoint, fee-only is thought to be the purest form of advising, since the professional's income does not depend on the products sold. Since commissioned professionals get no income unless there's a deal, there's a big incentive for them to push transactions. Fee-only planners account for about 70 percent of our Top 200 Advisers List.<p>

When it comes to credentials, the financial-adviser field is a forest of abbreviations and sometimes-murky labels. Some designations connote real expertise and training; others merely indicate membership in a trade organization. Here's a guide.<p>
CFA: Chartered financial analyst. A fairly prestigious credential held primarily by institutional money managers and stock analysts, it is issued after several years of appropriate work experience and rigorous testing by the Association for Investment Management and Research, Charlottesville, Virginia (804-980-3668). There are ten CFAs on our list of advisers.<p>
CFP: Certified financial planner. There are 31,000 CFPs in the country. The credential is issued by the nongovernmental Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards in Denver (888-237-6275) after an applicant completes a ten-hour exam and agrees to abide by a code of ethics. The CFP certificate still lacks the prestige its promoters seek, but customers can take it to mean that a person who has one is serious about the profession.<p>
CLU: Chartered life underwriter. Issued by the American College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania (610-526-1000), this designation is held mostly by life-insurance agents. CLUs sign a code of ethics, have three years of experience in the field, and have completed ten college-level courses. By taking three more courses, an agent can obtain a Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC) certificate, also issued by the American College.<p>
CPA: Certified public accountant. A CPA must pass an extensive, fairly rigorous test administered nationally and receive approval from state accountancy boards.<p>
Enrolled Agent: An EA has passed a test on tax law and is entitled to practice before the IRS. By itself, it does not mean the holder is proficient in financial planning.<p>
IAFP: International Association for Financial Planning. This 14,500-member trade group (800-945-4237), based in Atlanta, is open to anyone in the financial-services business. It does no testing but requires members to sign a code of ethics.<p>
ICFP: Institute of Certified Financial Planners. The ICFP, based in Denver, is little more than a marketing organization.<p>
LINC: Licensed Independent Network of CPA Financial Planners. Members of this Nashville-based group (800-737-2727) are fee-only planners licensed as CPAs. There is no test.<p>
MBA: Master of business administration. This graduate-level degree is generally seen as solid background in financial matters.<p>
NAPFA: National Association of Personal Financial Advisors. This is a trade group, based in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, of about 300 fee-only planners whose leaders view non-fee-only planners as conflict-ridden parasites. Needless to say, non-NAPFA members resent this. For NAPFA referrals, call 888-333-6659.<p>
PFS: Personal financial specialist. This credential is issued by the American Institute of CPAs (800-862-4272) to members who pass an exam and have professional experience in personal finance. PFSs are not necessarily state-licensed CPAs.<p>
Registered Representative: This refers to a stockbroker who has passed a series of exams given under the authority of the National Association of Securities Dealers. There is no explicit financial-planning component to the testing.<p>
The Registry: This listing, an attempt by the IAFP to establish standards for financial planners, ceased to exist in 1995. The CFP Board no longer uses it as a credential.<p>
RIA: Registered investment adviser. Not really a credential, it simply means an individual or a firm has submitted certain filings to the SEC and paid a modest fee. <p>

						Protection from bad checks could mean exposure to more charges<p>
By Tom Nawrocki<p>
Callback service makes it cheaper to dial from abroad<p>
Banks often advertise overdraft protection as free, but if you're not careful about paying the amount back right away, the strings attached to this protection may cost you a bundle.<p>
Almost all banks charge interest on the overdraft from the day it happens -- at Citibank, the annual rate is a healthy 18 percent. What's more, even when you put enough money in your checking account to cover the overdraft, the cash doesn't automatically cover the loan. New York's Chemical Bank deducts as little as $25 a month to pay back an overdraft; if the amount loaned is more than that, the interest piles up until the customer writes a check specifically earmarked to cover the overdraft.

What began in the era of <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple</b></a> II computers as an automated checkbook is now, in the multimedia Windows age, a suite of database and on-line tools and sophisticated financial calculators, souped up with audio and video prompts and tutorials. This is what it's like having a financial adviser at your elbow--an adviser with infinite patience, pushing for on-time mortgage payments and maximized savings; an adviser that doesn't shirk the dirty work of uploading electronic bill payments and downloading bank and credit-card statements. Oh, and it analyzes popular mutual funds, too.  <p> Quicken has spawned three serious rivals, so it's no longer the only servant in town. All the personal-finance programs do the basic heavy lifting, which consists of putting a checkbook and other household accounts on a hard drive. (About that hard drive: Be sure to back up your data on a floppy, as all four programs recommend; Windows 95 is still crashing my Pentium 120 at least once a week.) The elimination of drudgery is stunning: Paying bills by printing checks from your computer takes a fraction of the time it used to the old-fashioned way, by hand at the kitchen table; paying electronically takes seconds. (Don't worry if Aunt Ruth doesn't have an electronic account; the bank willcrank out a paper check for her.) Reconciling a checking account is equally easy, especially if that account is at one of the scores of institutions with on-line links to one of these programs. Finally, the creation of an electronic checkbook means a database now exists, so you have a budgeting, planning, and tax-preparationtool at the ready. Throw in your other accounts--an amortizing loan, perhaps, plus a portfolio--and you can swiftly summarize your net worth, freshly updated with each transaction.  <p> A couple of the programs outperform Quicken in particular areas.Managing Your Money Plus on CD-ROM is better for investors: It's far superior for such transactions as covered and naked shorts, zero-coupon bonds, stock options, and buying on margin--it even tracks gold bullion. Triggers remind the user to buy or sell certain securities; they also note when bonds mature and options expire. (Many of these higher functions work best when you have a companion CompuServe account.) And Andrew Tobias is on board to provide often droll advice.  <p> Kiplinger's Simply Money, by contrast, incorporates advice from Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine and offers the strongest suite of tools for small-business users. Its graphic interface also works fastest with a mouse. And while the others have dropped their  manuals for on-screen help--close to useless, in my experience--Simply Money has kept a good, fat manual.  <p> Still, Quicken remains the best total package. Managing Your Money and Simply Money are essentially stuck in a losing game of catch-up. The latter, for example, has no multimedia for beginning users and not nearly enough sophistication for advanced ones (you might bully it into handling small prepayments of principal each month on a mortgage, but the process is awkward). Managing Your Money lacks the elegance and eciency of Quicken. And as for Microsoft Money, well, Microsoft's attempt to buy Quicken's corporate parent, Intuit, was such a public admission of itsown product's failure that when the deal fizzled Microsoft backedout of serious competition and served up a bare-bones packagewhile bragging that Money is "user-friendly." The check-writingand on-line banking functions are indeed fine, but the financial calculators aren't very numerous.  <p> Quicken, meanwhile, keeps moving forward. The newest version,the CD-ROM-based Quicken Deluxe, adds an Internet link, on-line banking capabilities, and a tutorial called Finance 101, which provides home-finance basics. It's clear why some users become Quick-en fanatics, putting it on their laptops or using it to track pocket change. Not that you have to, of course: Even as a checkbook and nothing more, it's one of the smartest tools you can use. <p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Review  <p> CENTS AND INNOCENCE  <p> ZILLIONS <p>Consumers Union, $16 (six issues)  <p> PIGGYBANKS TOMONEYMARKETS <p>KidVidz, $14.95  <p> <a name="FUND:SRYIX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SRYIX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>STEINROE YOUNG INVESTOR FUND</b></a>  <p>Stein Roe &Farnham  <p> PARENTBANC  <p>ParentBanc, $14.95  <p> WORLD OF MONEY ALLOWANCE KIT  <p>Summit Financial Products, $39.95  <p>  <p>By Hillary Johnson  <p> "George Washington is dead,"Tyrone announced when I picked him up from pre-school the other day. He's four.  <p> Upon questioning Tyrone's teacher later, I found the subject that day had been not American history but the rudiments of the cash economy. Dollar bills had figured large. And so, I thought, thus it begins: with death. Taxes would not be far behind. Later that night, during the 36th screening of Free Willy, Tyrone made his first, clumsy attempt at purchasing. "I want to buy that whale," he said with heartbreaking conviction.  <p> I launched into a long explanation about the kinds of things money can and can not buy, at the end of which he frowned and declared forcefully, "George Washington is dead!" At this point I considered it time to teach Tyrone the facts of life. With that in mind, I looked around and saw there were a fair number of products designed to do just that, to teach children the basics about money. So with a hopeful eye I started to sample.  <p> Being a writer, I start with a magazine, Zillions: Consumer Reports for Kids. I like any publication that asks the eternal question,"Why can't you bring your own food into movie theaters?" Zillions prints articles debunking carnival games and letters from kids about the advertisements they hate, e.g., "It bugs me when commercials bring people closer together." In a consumer landscape that is all too gung ho and gee whiz when it comes to the young, healthy skepticism can be quite refreshing. Kids can appreciate both rebelling and being in the know, which this magazine promotes. My favorite kids' product by far.  <p> Inspired, I pluck up my courage and order a prospectus for the SteinRoe Young Investor Fund, a mutual fund that invests primarily in securities that "affect the lives of children or teenagers." In other words, <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a>, and the like. In 1995 the fund had a 39.8 percent return. Hey, kids, geese really do lay golden eggs!  Next to cynicism, enormous profits are the best formative experience a child can have in relation to finance.What I like about this fund is that (1) since it's written for kids, I can understand the prospectus and (2) if I open a custodial account in Tyrone's name I can't have a midlife crisis ten years from now, cash in, and move to Burma. Nor can the IRS, if it ever decides to collect that $5,000 I owe from 1985, nab Tyrone's college money. Yet while the idea of a fund in my son's name is nice--assuming someone puts real money into it (Tyrone will have trouble with the $50 monthly minimum)--mutual funds are too abstract and not much fun for young children.  <p> I explored ParentBanc, a checkbook for kids. The idea here is that I hold Tyrone's allowance, and when he wants money he cashes a check. The hitch is that I am not covered by the FDIC and can't guarantee that his four dollars will always be available for withdrawal. (If they come up with a kiddie credit card, sign me up--him up, I mean.) Besides, I'm not sure what the point is: Any parent anal enough to keep this goofy system going is bound to raise a compulsive checkbook balancer anyway.  <p> No less silly is the World of Money Allowance Kit, which is really a piggy bank. It's made up of three plastic book like boxes: one for spending, one for savings, and one for investment. Fine--except spending money belongs in your pocket, and investment money belongs in an investment fund. And piggy banks should be shaped like pigs.  <p> Tyrone likes videos, so I pop in Piggy Banks to Money Markets, aimed at 5- to 12-year-olds (I always jump the gun on age brackets).This video has won so many awards that it kind of scares me, and it does give a thorough and clear presentation of cash economies, stock markets, and consumer credit, as well as the costs and profit margins involved in running a lemonade stand. Okay, so it's a good video. But must it be so humor-less and well-meaning, like a sex-ed film?   <p> And there's the rub:When adults talk (down) to kids about money,they fail to acknowledge that money, like sex, is one of the complicated subtexts of every book and video they will ever see, that it's the root of all evil and good, sociologically speaking, and that they will never, ever understand it fully.  <p> Another problem: Most of these products treat money as a thing instead of an instrument. It's probably better for children to learn about value by trading marbles or baseball cards with one another than by writing checks to their parents. The willingness to part with value, the emotional and physical value invested in things, is more apparent in these childhood rituals than in toys that fetishize the transaction itself. Why get so caught up in shiny checkbooks, the inscribing of sums, the sound the check makes being torn out?  <p> I've come to realize that Tyrone instinctively understands the American economy without reference to the concept of money. He knows there's a qualitative difference between his paid baby-sitter and friends who come over, he knows that when we go to the store there is some kind of "price" we pay for the things we take, and he understands the sometimes desperate necessity of something called work. Indeed, he understands economics better than he will once he is able to re-cathect all of his desires onto the popular fetish object known as the dollar bill.  <p> Even if, in this house (for now), George Washington is dead as smelt. <p><p>

						Insider tips for the hottest time of the year<p>By Rudy Maxa<p>Europe is very big with Americans this summer, as anyone 
trying to book a flight there knows. So how do you beat the crowds and travel smart? Here with a compendium of basic advice, survival tips, and insider shortcuts.<p>> Concierges from Inter-Continental hotels around the world compiled their personal tips for cities from Amsterdam to Warsaw in a free booklet, Concierge Confidential. Call 800-327-0200.<p>> Ruesch International, a foreign-currency consultant, will send you a free pocket-size guide that gives the value of the U.S. dollar in 24 currencies; send a stamped, self-addressed envelope to Foreign Currency Guide, c/o Ruesch International, 700 11th Street NW, Washington, D.C., 20001.<p>> Arrange auto rental before leaving the U.S. -- it's cheaper. If you need a car for longer than 17 days (or three weeks with some firms), consider leasing. Try Kemwel (800-678-0678) or Renault Eurodrive (800-221-1052; from western states, 800-477-7116).<p>> If you're staying in one place in Europe for longer than a week, renting an apartment or home -- or a farmhouse or castle -- might make sense. French Experience (212-986-1115) lists about 100,000 apartments and homes in France; other French options include Interhome (201-882-6864) and Prestige Villas (800-336-0080). For apartments, villas, or luxurious farmhouses in Italy, call Italian Rentals (202-244-5345).<p>> One of the British Isles, the Island of Jersey, 14 miles off the coast of France, has some of the cleanest beaches in Europe and no value-added tax.<p>> Book London theater tickets from the U.S. by calling Edwards 
& Edwards at 800-223-6108.<p>> Want to see the Mona Lisa pronto? Avoid the crowd at the main entrance to the Louvre in Paris by going around back to a little-known door on the Seine side of the rear wing of the museum. There's rarely a line, even in l't.<p>> Planning to drive in France? Before leaving the U.S., call the French tourism office (900-990-0040) and ask for help planning an itinerary. You'll receive precise directions and notes on sites and hotels along your route. It's 95 cents for each minute you talk with a travel planner, but the average call lasts only three minutes.<p>> Taxis in Brussels are expensive. Don't make the tab higher by tipping -- it's included in the fare. If you're going downtown from the airport, consider taking the 20-minute ride on the shuttle train to Brussels's Central Station for only three dollars one way.<p>> In Barcelona, pharmacies that are closed must post the name and address of the nearest open competitor. Or call 010, the city's 24-hour information line, to find the nearest open location as well as to get other tourist information.<p>> If you're taking the train to Florence, make sure your ticket is to the Santa Maria Novella, the central station in town, and not the inconvenient Campo di Marte station. <p>> Instead of staying in the city of Venice, which can be crowded, hot, and humid in the summer, consider the nearby resort island of Lido, where the beach is spacious and trees and lush landscaping keep temperatures pleasant. Top hotels: the Hotel Excelsior and the Hotel des Bains (call 800-325-3589 for either). Don't be surprised when the reservation agent answers "Sheraton": The American company bought most of the Italian CIGA chain's luxury properties last year.<p>> Don't leave visible luggage in a rental car anywhere in Europe. Don't pull over to the side of the road just because someone tries to convince you something is wrong with your car. In Russia, don't hesitate to be rude and shout or push if you're suddenly surrounded by a group of people in a market area; they're most likely going through your pockets as they crowd you.<p>> To receive your value-added-tax refund upon your departure from most major European airports, you sometimes must display the goods purchased. The desk is usually on the other side of the airport security check, so don't put those items in your checked luggage.<p>> And, finally, if you were frustrated in attempts to get tickets to Europe this season through an airline frequent-flier program, that's because the airlines allocate very few award seats during prime travel time. And you waited too long. Moral: Book now for next summer. <p><p>

						Even scrupulous chargers can fall victim to reporting errors.<p>By Ellen DePasquale<p>You've always paid your credit-card balances in full and have never made a late payment on anything. Your credit report is spotless, right? Maybe not. A Consumers Union study found that almost half of all credit reports contain some sort of error -- from incorrect dates to credit accounts that don't belong to the reportee. <p>To check your credit report, write to each of the three credit bureaus -- TRW (P.O. Box 8030, Layton, UT 84041), Equifax (P.O. Box 105873, Atlanta, GA 30348), and Trans Union (P.O. Box 390, Springfield, PA 19064). Include your full legal name, mailing address, prior addresses over the past five years, Social Security number, birth date, and a copy of a document (such as a utility bill or driver's license) that shows the address is correct. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, if you have been denied credit within the past 60 days, you are entitled to a free report. Otherwise, TRW offers one free copy each year, Trans Union charges eight dollars, and Equifax charges up to eight dollars, depending on the state (call 800-685-1111 for information).<p>If you find an error, send another letter and a copy of the report, asking that the credit bureau either verify or remove the item in question. By law, the creditor has 30 days to verify the information. So if the bureau doesn't respond to you within 30 days, it must remove the item from your report. If you don't receive a response within 30 days, write and demand a corrected report. Your last resort, if there is still no answer, is to threaten to go to court. <p><p><p>

						By Ted C. Fishman<p>The American Association of Individual Investors has been educating investors since 1978. An independent, nonprofit organization, the AAII works hard to keep its members current when it comes to computerized investing. Now AAII's Web site (http:// www.aaii.org) makes a generous sampling of its riches available to the rest of us. For those people who have yet to introduce a computer into their investment lives, the site presents a thorough, comprehensive introduction to the entire process, from tips on gearing up to evaluations of software genres -- personal finance, technical analysis, stock screening -- and individual programs. AAII's site also provides such tools as an exhaustive glossary that defines most of the terms often used to sell an investment. In the near future, the site will offer software and shareware, more articles from AAII newsletters, and a message center where investors can trade tips and post questions. With brokers, fund companies, and software vendors all in a lather to snag on-line investors, AAII is a welcome nonpartisan refuge. <p><p><p>

						As the financial giants move in on the independent planners' turf, who reaps the benefits?<p>By John DeMott<p>For all our clients, the quality of our advice makes a difference," coos the commercial on CNN's Early Edition. "The difference is <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>." On ABC's This Week With David Brinkley, <a name="NYSE:AXP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10085"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Express</b></a> claims that "nine out of ten people would recommend American Express Financial Advisors to a friend." The financial giants of the world have begun entering your living room, where once only invited guests -- like your friendly neighborhood financial planner -- were welcome.<p>The biggest player in the world of institutional financial planning is Merrill Lynch, with 13,000 financial consultants in 880 branches. Merrill's primary target: a growing flock of busy, well-heeled baby boomers, now cracking 50, with net worths starting at about $100,000 -- more than 500,000 U.S. households in all. Merrill has roughly 300,000 financial plans in force, with a goal of adding 150,000 more this year. For its high-net-worth clients, Merrill draws on teams of specialists in every area from insurance to estate planning to assist the financial consultants in its branches.<p>After unsuccessful pilot missions with a couple of banks, American Express has rebranded its IDS subsidiary as American Express Financial Advisors. Amex has 26.7 million cardholders worldwide, but only 250,000 of them are clients of American Express Financial Advisors.<p>Are these gargantuan financial planners any good? Absolutely, say some of their clients. Claire Fillinger of Portland, Oregon, a retired registered nurse, dumped her independent adviser and moved her business to American Express Financial Advisors' Bob Farnes after she and her husband attended one of the half dozen investment seminars Farnes holds monthly in the Portland area. "I detected a lot of honesty in his presentation," Fillinger says. Of her previous adviser, she says: "There were occasions when I felt he wasn't presenting the entire picture but just what was to his benefit in getting him a commission. I don't really like that sort of thing."<p>Farnes gets commissions on top of his planning fees when he sells American Express investment products, such as IDS mutual funds, all types of insurance, and cash-management accounts. Does this mean that Amex's financial planners are at heart just salesmen for Amex products? Farnes says he wants to put investors into the best products, Amex's or no. The Fillingers had a long-term health-care plan, for example, that was clearly superior to anything Amex sold -- so Farnes advised them to keep it. As it happens, Claire Fillinger's portfolio does have about $200,000 worth of Amex products in it -- about 40 percent of the total. But she claims Farnes didn't put any extra pressure on her to buy them. "They're the better investments for me now," she declares.<p>However, independent planners say that examples like the Fillingers make the strongest case against their institutional brethren -- that planners at these places can't be objective, that they're really not in the business of planning but in the business of selling plans tied to the products they push. "It belittles the art of financial planning," says Terry Siman, a lawyer and financial planner and principal of Executive Financial Services in Spring House, Pennsylvania. "It reduces lifetime decisions to what is the right thing for you to buy." The big investment houses, he charges, have "polluted" the meaning of financial planning "when you know that the planner sitting in front of you earns X percentage of his income from doing this planning and Y percentage from selling you products."<p>Even other big companies that market financial plans concur. "I wouldn't call Merrill Lynch and American Express competition," says Steven Weinstein, managing director of Arthur Andersen Financial Advisers, which joined four of the other Big Six accounting firms in registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment adviser last year. Andersen sells no financial products of its own, only advice. "Those are people who are selling products," Weinstein says. "We're objective advisers who help our clients select the best products that make the most sense."<p>Amex and Merrill admit that casting themselves as planners helps increase sales of investment products by entwining the customer in ways more complicated than merely selling a stock or bond now and then. (It also pulls in nice fees: At Amex, they average $185 an hour, $43 million in all for 1995.) But they support their claims of disinterestedness by pointing out that their plans aren't linked to specific products. "Our plans are neutral," says Merrill Lynch senior vice president J. Arthur Urciuoli. "You could write a Merrill Lynch plan and have it implemented anywhere. It's just a blueprint." At Amex, the advice comes with no strings attached: If you don't like it, you can get your money back -- guaranteed. Amex senior financial adviser Michael Tilles says, "The analytical work I do stands on its own."<p>The independents' ultimate concern, of course, is that they'll be crushed by their monster competitors, with all their financial and human resources and, most important, name recognition. The giants agree that these areas constitute a real advantage for them. "We can provide more support and more tools to our financial advisers," says Amex Financial Advisors CEO Dave Hubers. Among them: a staff of CPAs and lawyers that's large and getting larger. Amex is gobbling up small accounting firms all over America -- as many as 45 this year and next -- to team with its financial planners, says Robert Basten, president of Amex's Tax and Business Services.<p>The smaller planners are also concerned with being outgunned in the increasingly lucrative scramble for corporate business, a prime market for all the big players, whether or not they sell their own financial products. Andersen, for one, has an entire division devoted to this part of the business. "I'm just a lonely planner," says Siman. "There's no way for me to compete" against deals drawn up between "Johnson & Johnson corporate and Merrill Lynch corporate." For all of that, though, he says that none of his 70 clients has deserted him for the big investment houses.<p>Some smaller planners say they aren't worried because the big companies will find financial planning is a tougher, more expensive racket than they realize. But the bigger companies will be formidable competitors with deep pockets and thick skins. Not even a pending $2 billion lawsuit against Merrill after the 1994 Orange County bankruptcy seems to have tainted its reputation.
If the big brokers ever convince the general public that they've put their clients' interests ahead of their own, "it will be much harder for the independents to compete," says Madeline Noveck, a planner with Novos Planning Associates in New York City. "I'm flying just under their radar right now."<p>But investors like Claire Fillinger are clearly on the screens of the big institutions, and that's fine with her. "I just want to be able to live in the style to which I've become accustomed," she says, "and Bob Farnes is doing that quite well for me."<p><p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Review  <p> LITTLE BY LITTLE  <p> By Laurence Hooper  <p> <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>APPLE</b></a> MESSAGEPAD 120  <p>$699  <p> CASIO Z-7000  <p>$600  <p> <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>HEWLETT-PACKARD</b></a> OMNIGO 100 <p>$349  <p> <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MOTOROLA</b></a> ENVOY, MOTOROLA MARCO <p> $1,000 each  <p> PSION SERIES 3a <p>$399  <p> SHARP ZAURUS ZR-5800  <p>$650  <p> For the past few years, dropping $750 on a personal digital assistant -- a portable, computerized Filofax -- has been the mark of either a rube or a gadget freak. Epitomized by the Apple Newton, these gizmos were simply too big, too expensive, andtoo useless for any normal person. The Newton itself, of course,drew a special kind of ridicule because it purported to recognize whatever handwriting users scrawled on its screen -- but much of the time spat back gobbledy gook.  <p> I've always thought the derision a bit harsh. Okay, so these palmtops, as they're called, didn't live up to their early publicity.Still, they were way stations en route to a PDA that many busy types would pay money for. Personally, I'm waiting for the day when a PDA includes all the now standard features -- a slot foradd-in cards, plus a date book, address book, memo pad, and alarm clock -- and adds three important attributes: It fits in my pants pocket; it communicates wirelessly; and it costs less than $250.(Some people also want PDAs to swap information with their regular computer, but that isn't high on my list.) In the meantime, it's 1996, and we're faced with a second generation of PDAs. Most are better than their predecessors -- smaller, lighter, more powerful. For input, they use a stylus-type pen, a keyboard, or both. And mercifully, they've come to market without any of the hype from 1993. Here are the pros and cons of several machines I tested.  <p> The Apple MessagePad 120 (a successor to the Newton) is expensive and elegant, and it has mostly overcome the Newton's inability to read handwriting. What's more, a bunch of companies have developed software for it, which means you can expand its capabilities.It even comes with Intuit's Pocket Quicken to track spending. <p> But the machine is just too big to carry around. I knew I was in trouble when I gathered all the little add-ons that make the MessagePad work well -- a keyboard, a modem, a recharging stand -- and then realized that lugging a regular notebook computer would be easier.  <p> Two siblings from Motorola, the Envoy and the Marco, have the same problem: They're heavy and awkward and come in carrying cases that could fit a notebook computer. Unlike their competitors, both come fully equipped to send and receive wireless E-mail.For me, that's a huge plus: I hate being out of touch, so on-the-road communication is perhaps the biggest reason I'd buy a PDA.  <p> Because the Marco runs the Newton operating system, it's basically a MessagePad with wireless capability. The Envoy -- the hippest toy in Hollywood right now -- uses different software, from a company called General Magic. I'd seen this software before and disliked its childish quality: You navigate by tapping on cartoon-like pictures of a desk, rooms, buildings, and so on. But I have to admit it has grown on me. What hasn't grown on me is the pain of having to type with a stylus, since there's neither hand writing recognition nor a keyboard.  <p> The Casio Z-7000 is a nice machine marred by annoying touches, such as a hard-to-read screen and a dinky stylus, but it's a bit more compact than the MessagePad and feels more rugged. With a few tweaks, its next version might be worth a look.  <p> The Z-7000, MessagePad, and Motorola PDAs all have one thing in common: They depend on pen input because they lack a built-in keyboard. The other machines I tested, however, are variations on a clamshell design, with a keyboard on one half of the shell. Despite having a bias against Chiclet keyboards, I found they work quite well when teamed with a pen-style interface. The clamshell devices are cheaper, too; shoppers should focus on them.   <p> The Psion Series 3a is an admirably small gadget and fairly powerful as well. I don't really like the aesthetics of the case or the screen graphics, though. It's purely personal, but if I'm carrying a machine, I want it to reflect my style. If you're a gray-flannel type, however, consider the Psion.  <p> The Sharp Zaurus ZR-5800 comes on like a hopped-up calculator, but it handles the standard tasks pretty well. I especially liked what may seem a silly feature, the ability to paste ready-made symbols into documents (great for drawing maps). I also felt I could drop this solidly built PDA with impunity -- an important quality for a portable machine, albeit one I was scared to test with a trial model.  <p> My favorite device is the Hewlett-Packard OmniGo 100 OrganizerPlus. Unlike the other clamshell machines, it folds over backward to become a pure pen-input machine -- yet unlike most pen machines, it's decently priced and has a keyboard. Its GEOS operating system is my cup of tea, and the handwriting recognition works well if you're willing to bend your habits a little. In many ways, it's the best of all worlds.  <p> Still, the OmniGo doesn't fit in a pocket. A coat pocket might work, but what happens in the summer? And it doesn't have built-in wireless communication, either. This peeved me -- was no machine perfect? -- until I read about a system called WyndMail.  <p> Wynd Mail, which also works on the MessagePad, allows you to send or receive wireless E-mail; you can also connect to any fax machine, pager, or even telephone -- a synthesized voice will read a message aloud. It works with an add-in card from Megahertz that weighs just a few ounces. (Radio Mail, a competitor, works with this card, too, though not on the OmniGo.)  <p> I'll admit that this is an expensive solution: The Megahertz All Points card alone lists for $499. But I tried it and found it works just fine. If the OmniGo were just a bit smaller and the wireless card a lot cheaper, I'd say we have a workable combo here. While I can't really recommend the OmniGo for general users, now's the time for gearheads to pounce without embarrassment. <p> Perhaps it's no surprise that none of these machines meets all three of my requirements; technology doesn't move that fast. So I'll wait for the next turn of the crank -- most likely from Hewlett-Packard. If I need wireless communication in the meantime, I'll get a Megahertz card for my Macintosh PowerBook. Unless I can put it in my pocket, I don't need another machine right now.  <p>

To this capability Switchboard (http://www. switchboard.com) has added 90 million residential listings. Then there's the brand-new World Yellow Pages Network, or WYP.NET (http://wyp.net). In addition to simple searches, WYP.NET lets users look up businesses by zip code. And there's an on-line utility for finding the zip+4 code for any street address. But the site's most intriguing feature, also free, invites users to set up their own WYP.NET mini-Web page (text only, 300 words max), which will pop up whenever someone searches for their address. Those who already have sites elsewhere can add hyper-links. This may well be the form that all on-line directories take in the future.  <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Review  <p> COMPOUNDING IS COOL  <p> By Ken Kurson  <p> GET A FINANCIAL LIFE: PERSONAL FINANCE IN YOUR TWENTIES ANDTHIRTIES  <p>By Beth Kobliner, Fireside, $11  <p> TIME IS MONEY: A MILLION-DOLLAR INVESTMENT PLAN FOR TODAY'S TWENTY- AND THIRTY-SOMETHINGS <p>By Frances Leonard, Addison-Wesley, $12  <p> Writing for novices about any complex topic is like having friends follow your car -- go too fast and you lose 'em, go too slow and you get rear-ended. When it comes to writing about money for youngish adults, however, calibrating the sophistication of the material is made more difficult by another critical element-- cool. That is, not only must the information be understandable without insulting the reader's intelligence, but its presentation must connect with its media-savvy, hipster-lite twentysomething target. It's an audience with a telepathic suspicion of jargon and get-rich-quickism, so the right tone is as important as the right information.  <p> Get a Financial Life, by Beth Kobliner, comes close to succeeding on both fronts. Comfortable with the vocabulary and attitude of a generation that's still characterized more by Slacker anomie than Friends effervescence, Kobliner has written a broad-ranging primer in the breezy magazine-speak befitting a contributing writer for Money. (She's loyal, too -- by the halfway point she's mentioned Money seven times.)  <p> Get a Financial Life also knows when to shut up. Because itranges from credit cards to car insurance to taxes, too much information on any one topic could easily send a reader scurrying for the comfort of MTV. Plenty of real-life examples, presented as illustrative side bars and laden with phone numbers, effectively keep monotony at bay. The quality of information is uniformly high, and there isn't a single chapter that doesn't contain useful but not obvious advice alongside a clear and well-presented blueprint.The investing section, for instance, covers everything from "What Is Stock?" to a deft explanation of the impact of inflation on the returns of various investments.  <p> The investment strategy Kobliner recommends, however, is oppressively conservative. Here's how she summarizes it: "I'm willing to stick my neck out and recommend a middle-of-the-road approach." Her program calls for a mix of 50 percent stocks, 30 percent bonds,and 20 percent cash, which had me wincing at the costs of missed opportunities. Kobliner dismisses the process of determining the appropriate level of risk for each individual with a couple of "Do you like to gamble?" questions and proceeds to recommend a strategy far more tentative than the old saw that says the percentage of stock in a portfolio should equal the investor's age subtracted from 100.  <p> Time Is Money, by Frances Leonard, sets much less ambitious goals for itself: It covers only the investment side of personal finance. Despite its allegiance to a single topic, however, Time Is Money haphazardly handles its sole insight -- that young people have a longer time horizon than old people. Compound interest is a hell of an idea, but writer-lecturer-attorney Leonard has a tough time filling an entire book with interesting examples of its magic, which may explain why a goofy quiz -- not to mention a blank page here and there -- follows every chapter. Leonard is a snappy and funny writer when she's not trying so hard, but references to "humongous bucks" and a <a name="NYSE:HDI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10706"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>"Harley-Davidson </b></a>big-twin"ring false.  <p> Mistakes are sprinkled throughout the book. A 0.5 percent back-endload would not mean a $50,000 hit on a $1 million redemption (it would be $5,000); a 403 percent increase is not a quadrupling of principal (it's a quintupling). But more troubling than mathematical errors is a structural flaw that runs through Time Is Money.All four of Leonard's recommended strategies employ a model that calls for monthly contributions of a manageable amount through one's 67th birthday. Yet the book's calculations depend on the assumption that 11 monthly deposits will be made after that 67th birthday.  <p> Money is a topic greeted by most young people with an enthusiasm usually reserved for jury duty. My experience editing a personal-finance magazine aimed specifically at those nauseated by the phrase" personal finance" has taught me that the only way to reach these readers is to convince them that nonaction spells disaster. Neither of these books is as urgent as it should be. The terror, bewilderment,and plain ennui that personal finance is capable of inspiring in most twentysomethings are blithely disregarded; both writers maintain that a bright future awaits any young investor who squirrels a way a couple bucks a month. And maybe that's true. But the message needs bigger teeth and more desperation to have a chance at cracking the jaded facade of today's young Americans.  <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> INVESTING BRIEFS  <p> INDEX FUNDS BY COUNTRY <p>Investors who want to buy into specific countries have two new choices this spring. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C. J. Lawrence's Country Baskets Index Fund (800-482-3940) and World Equity Benchmark Shares, or WEBS (800-810-9327), are products that, like shares in an index fund, mimic a single foreign country's entire market. A cross between an open-end fund and a security, these instruments, which are available for about a dozen countries, will trade on U.S. exchanges. Unlike closed-end country funds, they'll carry fees of less than 1 percent and won't trade at a discount to net asset value.  <p> OLDER AND WISER <p>Who says no one can beat the indexes? Investors seeking superior long-term returns should look to two funds managed by "ageless legends," according to the mutual-fund research company Morningstar. New Yorkbased <a name="FUND:NYVTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NYVTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Davis New York Venture</b></a> (800-279-0279), run by Shelby Davis, and <a name="FUND:GPAFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/GPAFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Guardian Park Avenue Fund</b></a> (800-221-3253), run by Charles Albers, again ranked in the top ten of all funds for long- and short-term performance in 1995. Each scored an average annual return of almost 18 percent for the past 15 years by consistently investing in out-of-favor, low-risk, high-quality stocks.  <p> FINANCIAL FOOTNOTES <p>Children aged 5 to 18 could get a head start on their investing careers. Nasdaq will award $1,000 each to 25 winners of its essay contest. The topic: "What Stock Markets Mean to America." Send entries to Investor Relations, Nasdaq Stock Market, 1735 K St.,NW, Washington, D.C., 20006...Vanguard Group, already known for its low fees, is trimming advisory fees by 18 percent for17 of its equity and fixed-income funds, including its flagship Windsor funds.... Closed-end funds that invest in the Pacific Rim (excluding Japan) did almost twice as well as open-end fundsin the region's January rally, returning 13.8 percent versus 7.4 percent.  <p>

						Are luxury SUVs just a vehicle for raising prices?  <p> By Jim Mateja  <p> It has become as de rigueur to have a sport-utility vehicle in your driveway as Blass and Givenchy in your closet -- not the real Messrs. Blass and Givenchy, of course, but the clothes they design. You get the point. Even more fashionable than your blue-collar SUVs are the newest niche vehicles emerging in the sport-ute line: Lexus, <a name="NASD:TOYOY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41889"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toyota's</b></a> luxury division, now offers theLexus LX 450, while Acura,<a name="NYSE:HMC"></a><b> Honda's</b> alter ego, counters with the Acura SLX. Lincoln-Mercury and Infiniti will soon join in with, respectively, the Mountaineer (late this spring) and the QX4 (late fall), while Mercedes will unveil its AAV (All-Activity Vehicle) in the 1998 model year.  <p> What is a luxury SUV? At a press conference last November, Jim Press, Lexus division general manager at Toyota, described theLX 450 as "King Kong in a tuxedo: a blue-collar work machine gone black-tie." In other words, a four-wheel-drive truck with leather seats.   <p> What's troubling about these new models is that all but one is built from the same platform as an existing -- and less expensive-- SUV. The LX 450 is a dressed-up Toyota Land Cruiser, the SLX a dolled-up Isuzu Trooper, the QX4 a Nissan Pathfinder, the Mountaineer a version of the <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford</b></a> Explorer. The Mercedes AAV is the only one that began life on a clean sheet of paper.   <p> Yet the LX 450 starts at $47,500, about $7,250 more than a Land Cruiser, while the SLX starts at $33,900, about five grand more than a Trooper. The QX4 should come in around $40,000, a few grand more than its progenitor.   <p> Mechanically, the luxury SUVs don't differ a whit from the vehicles that spawned them. The LX 450 has the same 4.5-liter, 212-horsepower six-cylinder as the Land Cruiser, the SLX the same 3.2-liter,193-horsepower V-6 as the Trooper. Where they depart from their host models is in subtle refinements to justify -- or allow buyers to rationalize -- the higher price tags. The luxury SUVs offer plusher interiors, with leather upholstery and just about every power system available as standard features. There are also top-of-the-line sound systems, air-conditioning, and sunroofs. Since all the creature comforts are standard, options are held to a minimum. <p> But for $40,000, you'd expect some new technology and engineering innovation, and neither the LX 450 nor the SLX provides any gee-whiz features -- except that the premium SLX has a button in the console that flattens the outside mirrors against the vehicle body to avoid contact with car-wash brushes and mailbox doors. Neat feature, but for $40,000 don't you want a bunch of neat features?  <p> This is plain and simple badge engineering -- sticking a new name on an existing model, as if the consumer is too dumb to realize he or she is paying for camouflage. Jim Press disagrees."If we had taken a Corolla and made it a Lexus, then that would have been badge engineering," he says. He argues that since theLX 450 comes off the Land Cruiser, a semi-luxury model itself, it doesn't deserve the badge-engineering rap, but that's a difference without a distinction.  <p> If function is more important than designer labels, stick with the current crop of compact SUVs: the Chevy Blazer, Ford Explorer,and Jeep Cherokee. For value, check out mini SUVs, which offer the same features as the compacts, only in smaller packages for less money. You'll miss only the leather seats.  <p><p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> SOFTWARE WITH STYLE <p>One $95 program takes most of the hard work out of style analysis for individual investors  <p> By Andrew Gluck  <p> Some say style-analysis software is a revolutionary new product that will change how we analyze mutual funds. Others call it voodoo. Our conclusion after evaluating all three of the leading packages designed for institutional investors: Style-analysis software does offer valuable insight into how a fund earns its returns --  but like many powerful financial tools this one can all too easily produce misleading results in the hands of an inexperienced investor or financial adviser.  <p> Style-analysis software characterizes a mutual fund's style of investing based on finding the best match between a fund's monthly returns and the performance of some combination of indexes. It therefore eliminates the need to decipher a fund's investment strategy by poring over outdated fundamentals and lists of portfolio holdings that mutual funds report only twice a year.  <p> But that doesn't mean this software is easy to use correctly--  or that it should replace all other kinds of analysis. The investor operating the software must know enough about an individual fund to pick the right indexes for comparison. For instance,we deliberately tried to trick one of the programs by matching the <a name="FUND:VFINX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VFINX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vanguard Index Trust 500 Portfolio</b></a>, which replicates the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index, with some unlikely indexes.The software fell for this ruse, telling us that the Vanguard fund behaved as if 42 percent of its assets were invested insmall-cap growth stocks, 29 percent in corporate bonds, 18 percent in British stocks, and 12 percent in Canadian equities. Together those indexes explained 82 percent of the fund's returns. That's not a very useful conclusion.  <p> "People say you can just run the fund's total returns through a computer, and it will magically ferret out what the fund invested in," says Don Phillips, president of Morningstar. "I think that just like every other shortcut in the investment universe it's fraught with peril."   <p> Style analysis, however, will show details about a fund's strategy that are hard to pick up using other methods. It reveals, for instance, that <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity Magellan</b></a> has a surprisingly large foreign exposure because it owns stock in so many multinationals that collect earnings in foreign currencies.  <p> Instead of the institutional programs we tried, investors might consider a product from Advisor Software in Orinda, California. Advisor Software's $95 program, Style Data (800-738-6369), doesn'trequire the user to learn the ins and outs of dozens of financial indexes or statistical techniques such as regression analysis.Instead it reports the results of style analyses performed bytrained experts who have compared 5,200 funds with the most appropriate12 indexes. (You'll need <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> Excel for Windows version5.0 to run the data.) Investors can see the style of their fundsor search for the best way to combine different styles. They can also look up the styles of individual funds for free at the company's World Wide Web page (http://www. advisorsw.com). <p><p>

Worth magazine/Personal Adviser<p>CREDITWORTHY AT LAST
Visa and MasterCard team up to secure Internet charges.<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>Afraid cyber-thieves will snatch your credit-card number when you buy something on the Internet? Visa and MasterCard recently joined forces on a new technology called SET (Secure Electronic Transactions), which scrambles credit-card numbers so that only the receiving merchant or bank can access the data. That means Joe Hacker will have a much tougher time copying your number and charging his spring wardrobe to your account.<p>To display the Visa or MasterCard logo in an on-line store window, a merchant must be accredited by a member bank. "You'll know you're not dealing with some college kid who's set up a Web site that looks like a fancy store," says Richard Lonergan, executive vice president at Visa.<p>The entente between Visa and MasterCard has eased concerns that there would be several different payment protocols coexisting on the Web. The credit-card titans plan to start testing SET on the Web this spring and hope to make it available to consumers by the end of the year. "This technology should allay security fears," says Edgar Dworsky, director of consumer education at the Massachusetts Executive Office of Consumer Affairs. "Eventually, you'll be more likely to get your credit-card number ripped off when you're ordering something over a cordless phone."<p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> MIND YOUR MORTGAGE <p>If your lender made a mistake with your mortgage payment, would you know it?  Here's how to keep tabs on your tab.  <p> By Ellen DePasquale  <p> In an effort to turn our 30-year fixed-rate mortgage into a15-year mortgage, my husband and I recently started making monthly prepayments. We used our computer to generate an amortization table so that we could see exactly how our prepayments would reduce the principal balance and shorten the length of the loan. After making our first prepayment, we called the automated customer-inquiry service offered by our lender to check the payoff figure against what we had calculated.  <p> We found that our prepayment hadn't been credited. When we asked about it, the human customer-service department told us that our principal prepayment had been mistakenly credited to our escrow account, where it would be used for items such as real estate taxes and mortgage insurance. If we hadn't checked our figures, we would have received a sizable reimbursement when the bank assessed our escrow for the coming year, and in years to come, our principal figures would have been far off our lender's. <p> "Homeowners have too much trust in the lending institutions," says Richard Allridge of Allridge and Associates, a financial-planning firm in Bethesda, Maryland. The majority of homeowners Allridge works with do not monitor their mortgages, despite the fact that banks make many errors in handling them. Adjustable-rate mortgages, precisely because of their adjustability, are a particular problem: According to a 1991 study by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 38 to 46 percent of all ARMs are adjusted incorrectly usually in a way that works against the homeowner.  <p> ARMs are particularly susceptible to mistakes resulting from banks' using the wrong index to figure out mortgage rates. The index most commonly the interest rate on one-year Treasury bills, though other durations can be used is agreed to in the mortgage contract, along with the dates on which the mortgage will be adjusted. Banks can err on either count.  <p> The first step toward finding a bank error is getting information on mortgage payments. Banks usually have customer-service departments that can tell borrowers how each payment was applied, but most borrowers get mortgage information solely from the interest statement their lender provides for tax purposes each year. If asked, most lenders will also provide a more detailed, month-by-month record of each payment made, and where the money went to interest, principal, escrow, etc. With that in hand, the borrower can double-check that each payment was properly applied.  <p> Personal-finance programs for home computers have made it much easier for borrowers to evaluate their bank's numbers. I  used Bankonit!, a fairly primitive program that I got via mail order, to calculate amortization tables for my loan, but software has gotten much more sophisticated than that. LoanWatch ($149 from Compu-Share; 800-928-2456) manages several types of loans, including fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages. It produces amortization tables, recalculates the principal in light of prepayments, and even checks the index through updates sent every adjustment period.<p><p><p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> MIDDLE-CLASS MEDICAID <p>The elderly can protect assets with long-term-care insurance. <p> By Donna Fenn  <p> Forty-three percent of the over-65 population can expect to spend time in a nursing home an average of 2.5 years, commonly costing $30,000 to $65,000 a year. Medicare won't foot that bill, and Medicaid kicks in only for those who've spent their assets down to poverty level. But a growing number of states are linking long-term-care insurance to Medicaid in a way that will let people protect their assets.   <p> Connecticut, Indiana, California, and New York are the original participants in a three-year-old program called the Partnership for Long Term Care, which helps state governments set up alliances with private insurers. Illinois, Maryland, and Iowa are in the final stages of implementing partnerships, and seven other states have passed the legislation needed to get started. David Guttchen, the project director of Connecticut's program, says he has received requests for information from over 25 states.   <p> Consumers who purchase partnership insurance policies can apply to Medicaid under a special set of eligibility rules when their insurance benefits are exhausted. In Connecticut, Indiana, and California, every dollar paid out by a partnership policy for long-term care protects a dollar of assets from Medicaid eligibility requirements. So if an insurer has paid a claimant $75,000 in benefits, he or she can keep that much in assets and still be eligible for Medicaid.   <p> New York's plan is even more generous: A certified policy that covers three years in a nursing home or six years of home health care results in total asset protection. Any subsequent care is covered by Medicaid, no matter how much money a participant has in savings. "For middle-class people with $50,000 to $250,000 in assets, these are particularly valuable programs," says Mark Meiners, director of the partnership's national office at the University of Maryland Center on Aging. <p>  <p>Anne Rich, a 49-year-old accountant in Cheshire, Connecticut, bought long-term-care insurance two years ago. "It's good to know that I won't have to go into poverty if I ever need Medicaid," she says. "It helps you keep a little of your dignity." Rich pays about $1,000 a year for $100,000 worth of coverage. Rates rise steeply as the insured gets older; a 70-year-old buying coverage can pay four times as much as a 55-year-old.  <p> The partnership puts several restrictions on the types of insurance eligible for the program. For example, the policy must offer both home-care and nursing-home coverage. Each insurer should know which of its long-term-care plans fit the criteria.  <p> While interest in the plans is widespread, several states, including Massachusetts, Colorado, and Michigan, are at a standstill because of a law that requires new plans to restrict the asset-protection coverage to the insured's lifetime. When the participant dies, states would recover any Medicaid spending from the remaining protected assets. Several bills now in Congress have proposed removing that restriction to encourage the creation of the partnerships. <p> The partnership programs have their critics. "At a time when Medicaid resources are scarce, the state may be spending on individuals who are clearly not impoverished," says Howard Bedlin, legislative representative for the American Association for Retired People. But Gail Holubinka, director of New York's partnership program, contends that people are already artificially impoverishing themselves to qualify for Medicaid. "In 1988, 60 percent of New Yorkers entering nursing homes were Medicaid-funded from the beginning," she says. "Does that sound right to you?" Holubinka argues that the partnership encourages people to be financially responsible for their long-term care, saving Medicaid money in the long run. And with Congress discussing cuts in Medicaid funding, creative solutions like this one should continue to gain popularity. <p> ------ <p>Joining the Partnership  <p> For more information on partnership policies, the program office numbers are:   <p> California: 800-434-0222 <p>Connecticut: 800-547-3443 <p>Illinois<p><p><p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> MAANA, HAVANA <p>Cuban cigars don't light up today's brand of smoker.    <p> By Manjeet Kripalani  <p> Observant sorts who wander through the newly fashionable cigar bars in America have noticed something missing: the fabled Cuban cigar. They are available to those in the know; industry insiders estimate that 5 million to15 million Cuban cigars are smuggled into the U.S. every year, of the 150 million premium cigars smoked. But the new breed of American cigar smoker has gotten used to going without Los Cubanos.  <p> Prior to the Cuban embargo, the tobacco in all premium cigars sold in the U.S. came from Cuba. After 1962, American companies shifted their production to the Dominican Republic and Honduras, both of which now produce cigars of excellent quality. American cigar tastes have also changed. The baby boomers and Generation X crowd responsible for the stogie's resurgence premium cigar sales in the U.S. have tripled since the 1970s prefer a milder cigar to a strong Cuban Cohiba. And Cuban cigars lost their champion after Fidel Castro stopped smoking them eight years ago. But the most basic reason may be that they just don't make them likethey used to.  <p> The decline of the once-magnificent Havana is illustrated by cigar strategies in Canada, a land unhindered by a trade embargo with Cuba. Take Thomas Hinds, Canadian tobacconist. In Toronto, Hinds used to do a brisk trade almost exclusively in Havanas. After reading of the high ratings of Dominican and Honduran cigars in Cigar Aficionado magazine, Hinds offered his customers a tryout. "I brought in brands that sold well in the U.S.," says Hinds."I sold out. Now Canadians who smoked only Havanas are smoking 60 percent Cuban and 40 percent non-Cuban cigars." Hinds attributes the popularity of the latter to the excellent quality of the hand-rolled new comers. Emboldened by the success of non-Cubans, Hinds set up shop in July in Beverly Hills, where he sells all manner of non-Havana cigars.   <p> Cigar lover Chuck Caulkins, a 39-year-old marketing executive in New York City, is a baby boomer who has been smoking cigars for 15 years. He remembers the old Havanas and thinks that their time has passed. "These days, the draw isn't smooth, neither is it rolled smoothly," Caulkins says. "And why pay $20 in the black market for a Cuban cigar when you can get an excellent, complicated non-Cuban for $7?"   <p> Indeed, why pay top dollar for a smoke that ain't that good?" You know the Americans they're the first to say, Oh no, I don't get my value here,' " says Christoph Kull, president of the U.S. operations of Davidoff of Geneva. In 1989, Davidoff closed its Cuban operations, thinking the quality of its product no longer met the company's exacting standards. It now makes its cigars in Honduras and the Dominican Republic.  <p> President Clinton recently decided to loosen communication and travel restrictions to Cuba, although lifting the embargo will most likely have to wait until Castro meets his end. What will happen then, when the fragrance of those Havanas comes wafting over to U.S. shores?  <p> "Nothing," says Robert Kemp, publisher of The Cigar Monthly. "Cubans will be a big deal in New York and Los Angeles, prices will rise, then the craze will fade and people will go back to smoking non-Cuban cigars. A lot of people couldn't care less about Cuban cigars."  <p> ------ <p>Smoke 'Em if You Got 'Em: The Best Non-Cubans  <p> By Teri Karush  <p> Even in places where Cuban cigars are legally available, such as Canada, non-Cubans have made their mark on the stogie community. "People who smoke only Cuban cheat themselves of the opportunity to experience a rich breadth of flavors," says Peter Dobbs, general manager of Thomas Hinds Tobacconists in Toronto. "It's like drinking only French Bordeaux. Imagine never tasting a fine California cabernet sauvignon or Italian Barolo." Here's Dobbs's take on some of his most popular non-Cubans:  <p> Puros Indios (Honduras): "Gorgeous wrapper leaf, broad range of character. A cigar you crave over and over again."  <p> Arturo Fuente Opus X (Dominican Republic): "For anyone who's a big smoker of Cuban cigars. Has every flavor, nuance, and enjoyment of a great cigar."  <p> Ashton Maduro (Dominican Republic): "A subtle, mild, meaty flavor that's fat and filling. Not heavy or hard. A cigar for everyone." <p> Don Lino Havana Reserve (Honduras): "A more mature tobacco. Aged well. Tastes like it's ready to be smoked. More full-bodied than most non-Cuban cigars."  <p> Thomas Hinds Honduran Selection Robusto (Honduras): "A creamy, mushroomy nuance. It's not designed to kick you in the butt. A simple cigar to understand, one everyone can appreciate." <p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> DOUBLE DIALING FOR DOLLARS <p>Two long-distance plans are better than one.  <p> By Ellen James Martin  <p> America's mailboxes have been swamped lately with come-ons from companies reselling phone capacity from the major carriers: VoiceNet, Valu-Tel, Ameracall, Atlas, and hundreds more. They boast ofbig discounts in comparison with <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>, <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI</b></a>,and <a name="NYSE:FON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11560"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sprint</b></a>, and in some cases they're right. But there's no need to pick a reseller over a long-distance giant. Since the resellers usually offer their deals through access codes (usually a five-digit prefix, an 800 number, or a 950 number), callers can stick with their major carrier and dial in to the little guys only when the prices make it worthwhile.   <p> For instance, Sprint heavily promotes its Sprint Sense program,which gives subscribers in most states a flat rate of 10 cents a minute on evenings and weekends. But the price jumps to 22 cents a minute during daytime hours on weekdays. Using Telegroup, a typical reseller, during work hours cuts the charges almost in half: a flat rate of 12.9 cents per minute on domestic calls at all times. Or for heavy-volume callers, VarTec Telecom charges10 cents a minute around the clock, but with a five-dollar monthly fee. The choice of plans is virtually endless: The Long Distance Resellers Source Book, published every spring and fall by Phone+magazine ($12.95; 602-990-1101), lists more than 600 resellers and their plans.   <p> Mixing and matching phone plans does have its limitations. If you use an  access code without registering with the company, you may not get the best rates. On the other hand, the market is so competitive that callers can often negotiate rates below the standard discounts. <p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Adviser  <p> CRUISE CONTROL <p>Are you a Princess, a Celebrity, or a Royal Viking?  <p> By Rudy Maxa  <p> It's 1996, and this is not your father's cruise ship. You know the one, where every passenger collects Social Security and a walk on the wild side means staying up for the midnight buffet. According to the Cruise Lines International Association, babyboomers make up 52 percent of cruise passengers. So even though the number of passengers dipped slightly last year, cruise lines are ordering up more and bigger ships in anticipation of a baby boomer surge and are also trying to differentiate themselves from one another. How do you know which one is right for you? Let's generalize: <p> Romance: You want short cruises on a budget? Consider Carnival Cruise Lines, Kathie Lee Gifford's favorite. Four of the world's ten largest cruise ships are Carnival ships, and they attract a first-time passenger looking for a casual, moderately priced cruise. For a more upscale experience, consider the Royal Caribbean, Princess, Celebrity, and Norwegian lines. Expect better wine lists, less passenger density, and larger cabins. But remember, two ships in the same line can be quite different, so it's important to choose a specific ship, not just a certain line. A seven-night Caribbean cruise on Carnival's Celebration ranges from $529 to$964, not including airfare; a similar cruise aboard the Princess line's Regal costs between $799 and $2,039 per person, not including airfare.  <p> Family fun: Cunard's legendary Queen Elizabeth 2 offers English nannies on board. Many ships have "camps" for kids, including some from Carnival, Royal Caribbean, and Premier. Premier, like some others, also offers special "single parent" deals. Don't trust your travel agent always check with the cruise line to make sure the trip you're considering caters to kids.   <p> Luxury: Check out brochures for ships of the Seabourn, Cunard, Silversea, Radisson, Renaissance, and Crystal lines. For a larger tab, you'll find gourmet food, select wines, outside cabins only, no pressure to participate in structured events, fewer feathers in the stage shows, plenty of caviar, open sittings at dinner, and no plastic cutlery even at outdoor dining sites. Fares on Seabourn for a five-night Caribbean cruise range from $2,475 to $4,250, including airfare; a seven-night cruise on Cunard's Sea Goddess I costs $4,500 to $6,800 with airfare.   <p> At the top end of the luxury scale, Cunard's Royal Viking Sun was rated the best cruise ship in the world by the bible of the industry, the Berlitz 1996 Complete Guide to Cruising and Cruise Ships. It has everything you can possibly imagine on a luxuryship, casino, gym, library, even a golf club with an electronic golf-course simulator. The Royal Viking Sun set sail in January from Fort Lauderdale on a round-the-world cruise; fares for the entire 114-night trip started at $40,000.  <p> Seniors: In general, you'll find an older crowd on longer voyages, such as transoceanic trips, than on Caribbean island-hoppers. Many lines, including Cunard, Regency, and Royal, provide male guest hosts to serve as dining and dancing partners on longer cruises, where the passengers tend to be mostly female.<p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> BE MY VIRTUAL VALENTINE <p>This year, let your modem do the walking.  <p> By Dean Robinson  <p> A rose on a computer screen may not smell that sweet, but at least you can see the Valentine's Day flowers you order over the Internet. Your inamorata in Arizona deserves flowers, but should you go with roses to say "I love you" or a  modest bouquet that says "I really like you"? Dial up the Flower Link Web site (http://go.flowerlink.com/html/menu1.html), click the search option, and enter a zip code. Up pops the Web site for Tucson's Inglis Florists, which includes a menu of prices and, best of all, pictures of arrangements. Say, that Crystal Keepsake bouquet doesn't look half bad.  <p> If you want to comparison-shop, other outfits that deliver nationally have their own Web sites, such as 1-800-Flowers (http://www.1800flowers.com),which also sells flowers via CompuServe and <a name="NASD:AMER"></a><b>America Online</b>. You can even get economic forecasts and find out why roses cost so much more in February.  <p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> BANK ROBBERY? <p>Bank customers are still being sold mutual fund investments they don't understand   <p> By Andrew Gluck  <p> In 1992, Roy Burgess, an 81-year-old retired minister from Dothan, Alabama, put his life savings into a mutual fund bought through his bank AmSouth. By the time he sold the <a name="FUND:PGMAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PGMAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pilgrim Adjustable U.S. Government Securities fund</b></a> now an Astra fund in early 1995, he had lost $20,000 of his $90,000 nest egg. On Burgess's behalf, the Worth Advocate contacted the Alabama State Securities Commission. Burgess filed a formal complaint, claiming that his goal had been to protect his principal and that he had never been advised about the risks of the fund.  <p> The Securities Commission has since launched an investigation that could help him and six other clients of AmSouth Investment Services recoup lost principal totaling $200,000 plus interest. <p> But the larger issue raised by the Burgess case is: How many bank customers are being sold funds as if they were as safe as a federally insured savings account?   <p> Banks got into the fund business in the 1980s and certainly haven't established an unblemished record. For example, last year arbitrators at the National Association of Securities Dealers found a "prevailing environment of improper business practices" at First Union National Bank's brokerage. Other major banks,including NationsBank, GlenFed, and Great Western, face class-action lawsuits by customers over fund sales.  <p> Some 200 formal consumer complaints about bank-sold funds were registered with state securities regulators in the first half of 1995, according to the North American Securities Administrators Association. "I think it's just the tip of the iceberg," says Denise Voigt Crawford, Texas securities commissioner and chair of a NASAA committee examining the issue. Complaints to the Securities and Exchange Commission's Office of Investor Education and Assistance, while small in number, more than doubled last year.  <p> Guidelines issued in 1994 were supposed to make banks, which sold $60 billion in mutual funds that year, clean up their acts. Regulators required banks and thrifts to disclose to potential investors four mutual fund risks, including potential loss of principal and lack of coverage by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. But according to a survey by the General Accounting Office, which sent employees to banks to pose as potential fund customers, just one in three banks and thrifts mentioned all four risks. One in five mentioned none.   <p> New rules soon to be released by the NASD will take another shot at reform. They address such dubious practices as bankers' passing on information about customers' accounts to fund brokers, and brokers' paying fees to bank employees for referrals of customers .Unfortunately, under pressure from bankers, the NASD has weakened these rules.  <p> Investors who feel they've been misled by their banks can file a complaint with their state securities commission, the SEC, and federal and state banking regulators. The state commission will know if other complaints have been lodged against a given bank. Finally, customers can consult a lawyer who specializes in securities arbitration. <p><p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> THEY'VE GOT YOUR NUMBER <p>Telemarketers may already have your credit card in hand  <p> By Dean Robinson  <p> Some telemarketers may have more than your phone number with which to irritate you--they may already have the numbers and expiration dates of your credit cards. Several telemarketers have taken advantage of the fact that providing confidential information is not technically illegal by selling card numbers to other marketers.   <p> Late last year, the Federal Trade Commission, in the first case of its kind, settled with ten corporations involved in the unauthorized sale or rental of consumers' credit-card numbers to direct-marketing third parties. The direct marketers had been contacting cardholders and--without revealing that they had credit-card information in hand--charging their accounts as soon as the cardholders agreed to test products or services on a "free" trial basis. The defendants were banned from providing confidential credit-card information to third parties; they also agreed to pay nearly $300,000, which will be returned to consumers.  <p> "No law explicitly says you can't sell credit-card numbers," says Lucy Morris, an assistant director for credit practices at the FTC. This means that consumers must rely on the FTC, whose mandate is to fight unfair or deceptive practices, and on the marketers themselves.  <p> "You bring a case to send a message," says Morris. A strong message may have been needed, too. William Reihl, a spokesman for the American Telemarketing Association, says his group does not have specific rules safeguarding the use of credit-card numbers. Direct Marketing Association guidelines state that numbers should not be rented or sold "when the consumer has a reasonable expectation that the information will be kept confidential.  <p> Morris says that individuals can protect themselves from potential problems by taking the standard credit-card precautions: don't engage in transactions you haven't initiated, know who you're dealing with, and remember that the Fair Credit Billing Act gives you the right to dispute charges to your account. She doesn't think consumers need to worry about most vendors selling cred-card numbers. "I don't think legitimate companies do this," she says. On the other hand, Morris concedes she doesn't know how widespread the practice of selling credit-card numbers is. And there is one area where vigilance is justified: the Internet. "That's where people are giving out their credit-card numbers," she says. <p><p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> THE FUTURE IS NOW <p>The end of the century comes early for check writers  <p> By Tom Nawrocki  <p> End of the millennium watch: Before long--maybe as soon as your next batch of checks--you're going to have to write the whole year on the dateline as opposed to tacking a 96 on to the preprinted19.   <p> "All our new check designs will not have the 19 on the dateline so they will be able to transcend the turn of the century," says Stuart Alexander, vice president of corporate communications for Deluxe Corp., which prints more than half the nation's checks and is the world's leading check printer. "The existing check designs as they are updated will also have that change made, so that the entire check inventory will be changed over well before the end of the 1900s." And after 2000 arrives? "We'll cross that bridge when we get to it," says Alexander.  <p><p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> LITTLE DISH, BIG CHOICE <p>From the Cleveland Browns to CNBC in 150 channels  <p> By Monica Corcoran  <p> A few months ago, Ted Sturman invested in the future to buy back a piece of his past. Sturman, a psychology professor at the University of Southern Maine in Portland, sorely missed the sports teams of his native Ohio--so much so that he laid out nearly $700 for a satellite-TV system that offers him the sportschannels shown to the Clevelanders back home. "Now, I can watch an Indians game at night or settle down with the Cleveland Browns on a Sunday," says Sturman, who's lived in Portland for just over a year. "I see local commercials from Ohio that bring me back to my childhood."   <p> The system Sturman bought, however, hardly harkens back to the Volkswagen-size satellite dishes of yore. The new satellite-TV systems are more like Hot Wheels cars: smaller, sleeker, and soon to be very affordable. Although not quite two years old, small-dish satellite-TV setups are already found in almost 2 million American households.  <p> Until the birth of these compact systems, a satellite-TV dish spanned ten feet and cost around $2,000. Today, a system requires an investment of just $200, nestles inconspicuously on the roof of a home or apartment building, and delivers exclusive programming. And with newcomers joining the satellite market soon, prices are expected to drop and choices to multiply. "Once the competition heats up, they'll probably start giving the hardware away just to get eyeballs," says James Scott, editor of Satellite TV Week.  <p> For now, though, two small-dish satellite systems are available: the RCA Digital Satellite System, which offers two programming choices--DirecTV and USSB--and Primestar. The RCA dish costs $550 to $1,000 (depending on the model) plus $199 for installation; Primestar leases its dish for an up-front payment of $200, including installation.  <p> But before beaming into space, know that network broadcasting is not always included, meaning no Seinfeld or X-Files unless the viewer gets a basic cable hook-up ($10 to $25 per month plus installation) or adds an antenna to get the local network affiliates. Or the satellite company will zap you a network signal from a distant city for a nominal fee.  <p> DirecTV, which runs $29.95 a month, boasts a 65-network-channel menu similar to cable's (CNN, CNBC, etc.), 29 audio-only channels, and 7 movie channels. And sports zealots take note: DirecTV offers an NFL package (choose any of 13 games every Sunday for $139), an NBA package (all 700 regular-season games for $149), and an NHL package ($99 for the whole season). Last year, DirecTV offered its Major League Baseball package for free, but next year's edition will carry a price tag that has yet to be announced.   <p> For premium channels, you need to add USSB to the mix. USSB carries 21 programming options for $34.95 a month, including five HBO, three Showtime, three Cinemax, and two Movie Channel channels.   <p> With Primestar, which for $45 a month offers 90 channels, in addition to the standard cable lineup, you can click from 16 regional sports networks to movie channels that show only westerns or mysteries. There are also three HBO and two Cinemax channels airing different shows, thanks to feeds from different time zones. Primestar also offers season-long sports packages similar to those on DirecTV.  <p> New providers are coming: By mid-December, AlphaStar will launch programming, and EchoStar will debut next February. "Unlike cable, the satellite industry is wide open to competition," says Scott."There will be better prices and wider variety as new companies emerge." After all, there's plenty of room in space. <p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> HIT THE INFO HIGHWAY <p>Car-lease shoppers have begun cruising the Internet  <p> By Ellen DePasquale  <p> In increasing numbers, potential car buyers are becoming potential car leasers, and thousands of them have turned to a new resource: the information superhighway. Leases now account for 30 percent of all deliveries of new cars, up from just 7 percent a decade ago, according to Business Trend Analysts, a Commack, New York, marketing research firm. It's only natural that leasing information should sprout up on the Internet.  <p> The Internet helped David Goldstein, owner of a software-production company in Seattle, make his decision to lease. While waiting in a car dealership to look at a $13,700 Plymouth Neon last February, Goldstein noticed an ad in a local paper for a leasing deal on an Infiniti. That night, he downloaded some numbers to his home computer from several online services and crunched out some leasing costs. He found that his monthly outlay would be the same for purchasing the Neon as for leasing a $24,325 1995 Infiniti G20. <p> "I was able to plug in the figures I had and determine that the Infiniti payment should come to $208 a month," Goldstein says. "The dealer came back with $210, which I accepted." Indeed, luxury-car dealerships seem to be the best place to hunt for leasing bargains--partly because of manufacturer subsidies and partly because of strong resale values, both of which help lower monthly payments.   <p> If leasing seems worth pursuing, the first step is to find out how much the dealer paid for the car which will determine how much he's willing to take for it. CompuServe offers car datasheets that include the manufacturer's suggested retail price and dealer invoice prices as well as charges for available options. Each sheet, provided through an agreement with Automotive Information Center in Acton, Massachusetts, costs $1.50. Prodigy and <a name="NASD:AMER"></a><b>America Online</b>, as well as CompuServe, provide access to magazines suchas Car and Driver and  Consumer Reports that have information on car values. The online services also provide user forums, such as CompuServe's Automobile Forum, where people around the country offer tips and opinions on leases and car models.  <p> With price information in hand, a shopper can then check out FinanCenter's Auto, Boat, and RV Loan Department, a division of Banker's Portfolio Exchange in Tucson, Arizona (the Internet address is http://www.financenter.com/resources/autoloan/index.htm). This site helps calculate the cost of leasing a car and offers a downloadable page of key clauses in lease agreements, which illustrates various ways in which contracts can be written. It also identifies points that should be specified and negotiated with the dealer, such as charges for excess wear, early termination, and excess mileage.  <p> Those who decide to lease can then use the Internet to set up a deal through the Auto-By-Tel web site (http://www.autobytel.com). This service maintains a database of dealers who pay a fee to Auto-By-Tel to receive requests from potential buyers or leasers. Prospective leasers enter their name, address, phone number, and type of car desired; a dealer in the area will then call with his or her leasing terms. Armed with all the other information leaned from the Internet, leasers will be ready to negotiate. The leaser has to go to a dealer showroom only to sign the papers and pick up the keys. Thanks to the Internet, the traditional haggling over price has become more of a contest between equals. <p> MEANWHILE, ON YOUR LOCAL DRIVE  <p> You don't need to explore the Internet to get help with a car lease. The CD-ROM Popular Mechanics' New Car Buyers Guide 1996 ($29.95 from Books That Work; 800-242-4546) offers similar information to help shoppers make up their minds about a car lease. It provides sticker prices and dealers' invoice prices as well as lease-versus-buy calculations.  <p> There are also several software programs that can help in understanding the leasing process, the terms, and the monthly-payment calculation. The best are Expert Lease ($99.95 from Chart Software; 800-418-8450), a stand-alone application that includes MSRP and dealer invoice prices, and AutoFinII, a spreadsheet that works with Lotus 1-2-3 and <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> Excel ($49 from Village Software; 800-724-9332).Both of these programs can instantly calculate how changing one element of a lease affects monthly payments. Given data suchas the length of the lease, any capitalized-cost-reduction payments, residual value, and the interest rate, they will calculate an expected monthly payment to compare with a dealer's offer.  <p><p><p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> INVESTIGATING INVENTORY <p>Inventory numbers can be a crystal ball into a company's future--and its stock value  <p> By Maxwell Dale  <p> Everyone who has taken an introductory course in economics knows that a balance sheet is a snapshot of a company's assets and liabilities at a single moment in time. Yet balance sheets also hold a prediction of the future--one investors should know about. <p> This prediction is found on the line entitled "inventories"--the dollar value of the finished goods and supplies a going concern has on hand. Because companies usually have to commit to making something before they can sell it, a large inventory generally reflects high expectations; a small one, the reverse.  <p> A company can get into deep trouble when its sales predictions go awry in either direction. If an automaker builds more minivans than people want to buy, its only recourse is to slash prices--at the expense of profit--to move the goods.  <p> Earlier this year, <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple Computer</b></a> found out what happens when a company guesses too low. Apple built too few new Power PC machines,causing a backup in demand, lost sales--and again, lost profits. <p> Effective inventory management is especially critical for retailers, since few make their own goods. This is why securities analysts who follow retail stocks pay so much attention to inventory numbers heading into the all-important Christmas selling season.  <p> In the end, a retailer's success during the holidays depends almost entirely on how good a job it does predicting consumer demand for each line of goods it sells. Stocking up on Mighty Morphin Power Rangers when people want G.I. Joes is an example of the biggest mistake a retailer can make: It must then sell the Power Rangers at discount while losing G.I. Joe sales to a more prescient rival.  <p> Investors who want to keep tabs on a company's ability to manage its future need to understand the relationship between production, inventories, and sales. Higher production will lead automatically to higher inventories unless sales keep pace.  <p> That's why rising inventories are often an early sign of trouble--sales are not meeting managers' expectations. Expect price cutting and curtailments in production (even layoffs) to follow.  <p><a name="NYSE:ANN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14959"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ann Taylor Stores</b></a> is a case in point. The company's stock peaked at $44 a share last December but then collapsed to $17 during the next ten months as its sales weakened and it cut back an aggressive expansion program. A full month before the peak in the 1994 share price, however, Ann Taylor's third-quarter inventory showed an unexpected 31 percent increase--a jump that far exceeded sales growth.  <p> There are some times, though, when a rise in inventories is positive: It may mean a company is confident about a new product launch and is stocking up. To tell the difference, investors need to know the story management has to tell. Next, they should compare that with their own opinion--will that new cherry-lemon-kumquat soft drink really fly off the shelves?--and with the way the sales, inventory, and production numbers have been tracking. A company that manages its inventories well is a company in touch with the future.  <p><p>

						January 1996--Special Issue <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> DAYS OF WINE AND HEAVY STATUARY  <p>Experts give the lowdown on seven art markets  <p> By Carlos A. Rosas  <p> Art, the maxim goes, is not an investment. Of course this is true: Art is bought to be savored, adored, experienced, then bestowed upon a  museum for the public's edification. But it's also true that a lot of art moves in and out of dealers' and collectors' hands, finds its way to auction blocks all over the world, and goes up and down in price. Here are some of the categories art auctioneers and other experts will be watching in 1996. <p> WINE <p>Last november, Sotheby's kicked off its three-session wine auction with an evening sale, a distinction generally reserved for the best (or most hyped) impressionist paintings. This capped wine's recent journey from a commodity that the big auction houses in New York were prohibited from handling state law changed in 1993 to one capable of bringing out the swells. Prices have risen accordingly: One bottle of 1900 Chteau Margaux sold for $10,975 at a Sotheby's sale last June. Still, experts say there are some very fine wines that can be had for much less.   <p> Fritz Hatton, Christie's New York: "I suggest 1981 red Bordeaux wines. It is an A-minus vintage that can be picked up, in some cases, for less than half of what the celebrated 1982 wines cost. Consider Chteau Gruaud-Larose: A 1981 case recently sold for a little over $300 versus a 1982, which fetched close to $1,000. Similar scenario with Lafite '81 cost about $850, '82 cost over $2,100. My only warning is that the '81 wines will not be as long-lived as the 1982 or 1986 wines, which also got a lot of fancy press. Still, 1981 is a good value and is ready to be consumed now."  <p> Bruce Kaiser, Butterfield & Butterfield's, San Francisco: "1984,1985, 1986, and 1987 California vintages are all sought after, but for my money I would think about the 1989 vintage. It could be rated as a B or B-plus wine that you can buy at C prices. Think about this comparison: A case of Dunn Vineyards Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon 1986 can sell for as much as $1,000 at auction, while a case of the 1989 can sell for under $550." <p> Serena Sutcliffe, Sotheby's London: "In general I feel that lunatic prices are being paid for a few things, but there are bargains out there, too. Vintages such as the 1988 red Bordeaux can be under valued. Few realize that the '88 vintage will have the longest life anywhere from 10 to 30 years. I feel 1978 red Bordeaux have been overlooked as well. They are lovely and ready to drink. Second wines from younger vines that have a faster maturation also have lower prices. An example is Chteau Margaux's second wine, Pavillion Rouge du Chteau Margaux. A case of it from 1982 is estimated at about $500 a steal."  <p> CONTEMPORARY INDIAN PAINTINGS <p>There is a classic formula to creating a new art market, little known to people outside the trade. It begins when an art dealer or collector "discovers," then buys up, an artist or genre that has been forgotten, neglected, or dismissed as trivial. Deep pockets are  not obligatory, for the work shouldn't be expensive. Over time this does take time and patience the collector/dealer accumulates a nice little stockpile, from which pieces are eventually dribbled out to other collectors in the key markets of London, Paris, and New York. Prices rise slightly, press is garnered, a glossy coffee-table book or serious monograph appears, and then, if all has gone well, the artwork reaches the secondary market the auction block where money is made.  <p> This is loosely how contemporary Indian painters like M.F. Husain, Anjolie Ela Menon, S.H. Raza, and F.N. Souza came to be introduced to international auction shoppers. During the past 30 years, Chester Herwitz, an American handbag manufacturer from Worcester, Massachusetts, and his wife, Davida, have amassed more than 3,000 paintings and works on paper by contemporary Indian artists. They began exhibiting them during the 1980s in the major markets, then offered a consignment of 219 selections to Sotheby's New York in an inaugural sale last June. The sale realized $1.2 million and established a record auction price for M.F. Husain, a member of the Progressive Artists Group formed in Bombay in 1948, a year after India won its independence. Both Christie's and Sotheby's plan sales for this year. Opinions differ as to the strength (and direction) of this market.  <p> Carlton Rochell, Sotheby's New York: "It is a good time to buy Indian contemporary art because in time it could out pace the traditional material everyone associates with Indian art, such as Mughal miniatures. In fact, that was how this market was tested. Sotheby's London would include several lots of contemporary Indian painting in traditional Indian art sales. After seeing that these lots had sold well, we realized work by living Indian artists could stand on its own."   <p> Michael Ludgrove, Christie's Australia: "It is dangerous to predict if the market will continue to grow; the prices realized were rather healthy. After all, there is not a great academic body of work about contemporary Indian painting, [although] the best works are not as [expensive] as comparative Western art." <p> COLORED DIAMONDS <p>Until the turn of the century, when the supply was exhausted, pink and blue diamonds were mined in India and collected by that country's princely rulers. Since then, the stones' rarity has kept all but the truly well-heeled (the Shah of Iran comes to mind) from even browsing in this market. The record for a colored diamond at auction is $9,902,500 for an emerald-cut, 20.17-carat blue stone sold at Sotheby's New York in October1994.   <p> Yellow diamonds are a dime a dozen compared to blues and pinks but are rarer than colorless diamonds. Unlike the blues and pinks, which are sold as individual stones, yellows are mounted in jewelry. For comparison, a rectangular-cut fancy intense 3.66-carat yellow diamond ring sold at Christie's New York in 1993 for $145,500.<p>Edward J. Landrigan, Landrigan Verdura, New York: "Thirty years ago when I started at Sotheby's, most people regarded colored diamonds as an oddity or a curio. Then I was thrilled if I sold a colored [blue] diamond for about $1,000 a carat. It seems that price records are constantly being broken at auction in Geneva and New York, and knowing that there are very few players in that strata, I wonder if Newton's law of gravity wouldn't apply if only a couple of them dropped out."  <p> Ronald Winston, Harry Winston, New York: "Colored diamonds are fully and consistently on the rise because of the enormous rarity of the stones."  <p> Bonnie Selfe, Cartier, New York: "I am not surprised by the increase in prices for colored diamonds, and I believe they will continue to rise. There is considerable demand for them from Asian buyers."  <p> EUROPEAN WORKS OF ART <p>Turn-of-the-century robber barons had a penchant for tapestries, bronzes, marbles, and the like, which encouraged a steady stream of works from Europe into the U.S. But taste has lightened up considerably since World War II, and though Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque items may attract interest from museums looking toupgrade existing collections, there is currently a real paucity of high-end collectors. At a Sotheby's New York sale last year, several top bronzes from London dealer Cyril Humphris's inventory failed to sell. Lesser examples did better.   <p> Margaret Schwartz, Sotheby's New York: "Religious themes in art can be tricky, and 70 percent of what I sell is religious. Not everyone wants a Gothic Madonna. When you consider that a very good quality bronze with a secure attribution to a master or his workshop is available for $20,000, you realize the field is under appreciated compared to later sculpture or paintings." <p> Alice Duncan, Christie's New York: "Compared to old master pictures, Renaissance bronzes are terribly undervalued. I feel the loss of major dealers has had an effect on the market; they're not around to train collectors. It is a very good market for objects, whether bronze, marble, or terra cotta under $200,000. Under $50,000 there is also a good market; $15,000 to $50,000 enjoy a healthy market. The top end is tricky."  <p> Anthony Blumka, private dealer, New York: "I'm a fourth-generation works-of-art dealer whose family started in Vienna about 150 years ago. The flow of work has been from the U.S. back to Europe for some time now, and that makes sense [because] it is a European taste and sensibility, not necessarily an American one. Consider maiolica [tin-glazed earthenware produced in Italy during the Renaissance]. It's the one area in the field that sells for what it's worth, and most of it goes back to Italy."  <p> LATE 19TH-CENTURY AMERICAN FURNITURE <p>Post-1820 American furniture has yet to achieve the high prices or desirability of Philadelphia Chippendale and New York Federal, though it's not for lack of trying. Classical revival American furniture, made of mahogany or rosewood, was trumpeted as a promising category in the mid-1980s. (Long time collector Richard Jenrette of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette has adorned his investment-banking firm's New York offices with classical revival pieces.) But as much as this category has been appreciated on a curatorial level for a number of years, passionate collectors are still few and far between.  <p> Interest is now moving toward the Herter Brothers, members of the Aesthetic movement who carried out high-style commissions for clients like E.H. Harriman and Jay Gould during the 1870s and 1880s. Some experts say that because Herter Brothers furniture had its first comprehensive museum catalogue and traveling museum show just last year, the market with a few notable exceptions has not caught up.  <p> Margaret Caldwell, private 19th-century decorative-arts dealer, New York: "Private collectors are intimidated by Herter furniture because of the pieces that came up at Butterfield & Butterfield's, one in 1988 and one last summer. Each sold for well over a quarter of a million dollars. If you were willing to do a lot of work as a serious collector, you could seek out examples by the Herter Brothers' exact contemporaries. Late 19th-century New York cabinet makers such as Alexander Roux, Leon Marcotte, and Pottier & Stymus are less known, but they produced some very good pieces. Still, I purchased a set of ten walnut dining chairs, possibly by Herter, just last fall at Sotheby's in New York, for less than $6,000. You couldn't pay less for a set of ten chairs unless you made them yourself with plywood."   <p> Margot Johnson, 19th-century American decorative-arts dealer, New York: "Prices for late 19th-century American masterpieces such as furniture from the Herter Brothers' commissions for Mark Hopkins in San Francisco and William H. Vanderbilt in New York have only begun to rise. Although I am shocked at how quickly prices have risen for the best Herter furniture, I believe that in time they will equal the prices of the best 18th-century American furniture." (Johnson purchased both a forementioned lots of Herter furniture at Butterfield's in 1988 and 1995.)   <p> Elaine Whitmire, Sotheby's New York: "Institutional interest in the field of late 19th-century Americana is substantial, but only at the top level. Many private American collectors associate Herter Brothers and their contemporaries with dark, ornate Victoriana, and that keeps them away and the prices down. A four-piece maple bedroom set from a known Pennsylvania commission by Herter Brothers sold for below the low estimate at Sotheby's last year when it fetched $12,650."  <p> 19th-CENTURY PHOTOGRAPHY <p>Just two years ago photography dealers were still encouraging collectors to look at 19th-century daguerreotypes and other early images as an under appreciated part of the popular collecting area of photography. But unique-image daguerreotypes (those made from a process that doesn't allow duplication) failed to attract more than a small group of collectors. Now that's changing: The former record price for a daguerreotype sold at auction was set at Swann Galleries, New York, in 1992 $63,800 for a Cincinnati street scene taken around 1851 by African-American photographer James Presley Ball. That record was broken last October when Sotheby's New York sold a circa 1846 daguerreotype of the U.S. Capitol building by John Plumbe Jr. for $189,500.   <p> Daniel Wolf, photography dealer, New York: "I have seen enormous growth in the 19th-century field with the prints of Felix Teynard, for instance, going from $500 to $35,000 for the rarest example of his work. Images from the last century proved to be the strongest category in the recent fall auctions, with all the good pieces selling. The same wasn't true if you looked at the 20th-century offerings. The one neglected area within the 19th-century market is American landscape photography. William Henry Jackson's work from the 1870s can be found for $4,000 to $7,000, and prints by Frederick Monsen and Carl Moon, from 1900 to 1920, are available for about $5,000."  <p> Denise Bethel, Sotheby's New York: "To be fair about the strong prices for daguerreotypes last fall, you should consider that not since the early 1970s had a comparable collection come up for sale. Still, anyone looking to get into 19th-century images should do it now. If prices continue to rise, 20th-century photography will be undervalued."  <p> JADE AND JADEITE JEWELRY <p>The strength of pan-asian economies has produced an array of new collectors in several categories of Asian art and art deco jewelry and this has encouraged international dealers and auction houses to expand existing operations and open new ones. Christie's and Sotheby's opened branches in Shanghai within days of each other in April 1994.  <p> Jade and jadeite jewelry, a thriving, complex market with great cultural significance for Asians, is a hot category. As  always, the best is in fashion: Christie's Hong Kong sold a 27-bead apple-green jadeite necklace, known as the Mdivani necklace, in October 1994 for $4.27 million. This was one of the most expensive items ever sold by an international auction house in Asia. The necklace had previously been sold in 1988 by Christie's Geneva for $2.2 million.   <p> Sam Bernstein, jade dealer, San Francisco: "Collectors should stay away from judging jade by size. You're not collecting rocks; you're collecting art. In spite of great demand for top pieces in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China, I feel jade is under valued by 20 percent to 30 percent when compared with Asian art in another medium, such as sculpture or porcelain. Where as a Shang dynasty bronze might cost $100,000, an equally rare and fine jade would probably sell for $20,000."  <p> Amanda Miller, Butterfield & Butterfield's, San Francisco: "Pure white or mutton fat' jadeite is very desirable right now in Hong Kong and the West, as is apple-green jadeite. While collectors always seek out purity and consistency of color, the color itself goes in and out of style. Up to 1994 prices were high for lavender jade; then collectors heard that white jade could be treated to take on a lilac coloring. They've stayed away since, keeping prices for lavender pieces down. Toughest to sell are small pieces called toggles buckles, pendants, miniature carvings. That's the most under valued area of the market. Two small circular19th-century white Nephrite plaques, about 2 inches in diameter, sold for a little over the low estimate, just over $600 for the pair." <p> Antonia Tozer, Spink & Son, Ltd., London: "Last year Spink's participated for the second time at the Tresors art fair in Singapore, and we'll be back this spring. Asians have a passion for jadeite jewelry. For about $15,000 a collector bought a good three-strand apple-green jadeite necklace last fall."  <p> Carlos A. Rosas writes on art and antiques for Antique Internationaland Town & Country.  <p> <p>

						November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> MORTGAGE-FREE: THE CASE AGAINST OWNERSHIP  <p> By Nick Ravo  <p> Jason Thomas, a 25-year-old computer consultant, always assumed he would buy a home when it came time to settle down and raise a family. That was before he actually began house hunting last year.  <p> "It's crazy,'' says Thomas. "I can get a nicer house for less money if I rent rather than buy. Then, if I invest my down payment, I can get 8 to 12 percent. I'm not going to get that kind of return on real estate these days.'' Thomas, who is also studying to be a chartered financial consultant, now lives with his wife and daughter on three acres in Glen Ellen, California, in a two-bedroom bungalow that rents for $800 a month.   <p> Renting has never been part of the American dream. Young couples and hard-working immigrants might rent with anxious dignity--until they could afford to buy. But otherwise, the popular perception of renting included images of creaky tenements with thin walls, dubious neighbors, and thugs for landlords.  <p> Ownership, on the other hand, implied solidity, probity, and solvency. Think of Ozzie and Harriet, Donna Reed, the Cleavers--the significant moments in the lives of these archetypal Americans took place "under their own roofs.'' The material anxieties and vulgar squabbles of the Kramdens were strictly for the struggling. <p> Over the past decade, though, the nation has begun to revise these cultural orthodoxies. Fear of layoffs, the falling realestate prices of the late 1980s and early 1990s, and rising concern about crime and the quality of public schooling have all made many Americans less willing to take on the long-term, often illiquid financial commitment of buying a house.  <p> "Renting makes it possible and affordable to live in a nicer neighborhood, and personally, I value that,'' says Jonathan Cohen, an investor-relations writer who lives in Palo Alto, California. "I place the schools and the general ambience of a top neighborhood above the extra financial gain I might--or nowadays might not--enjoy by owning a house in a poorer area.  <p> "I live next door to executives who make twice as much as I do," Cohen says. My wife and I enjoy that as a kind of revenge."  <p> Thomas and Cohen represent the future, even though 13,700 Americans buy homes every day and 63 million (64 percent of household heads) own them. Real estate also remains our primary source of personal wealth, with about $8.7 trillion invested in homes, roughly $5.6 trillion of which is homeowner equity--$500 billion more than individuals collectively invest in mutual funds, stocks, and bonds. But while home ownership rates are creeping upward to record levels as the overall population ages, they are falling for Americans under 35, despite interest rates and prices that, in many areas, have made houses more affordable today than at any time in the past 20 years.  <p> America's long romance with real estate is testimony, in part, to Madison Avenue's success in convincing us that social enfranchisement, security, and happiness can be found behind a white picket fence. But even more important have been the federal government's financial incentives. "The government wants you to buy a home, whether it makes sense for you economically or not," says Marc Eisenson,the publisher of The Pocket Change Investor, a newsletter based in Elizaville, New York, that offers advice on reducing personal debt. "It's good for America, as they say."   <p> The primary reason banks bother to make mortgages in most cases is that government-chartered agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase the loans. Then there is the mortgage-interest deduction--amassive middle-class tax shelter, which, if eliminated in the name of tax reform, could push home prices down 15 percent. "We would expect homeownership to decline to perhaps around 50 percent,''says Kenneth T. Jackson, professor of history at Columbia University and author of Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States.  <p> Why does the government--the Clinton administration recently declared its intention to encourage home ownership--want to make every American a burdened borrower? Well, real estate, like defense contracting, creates jobs--in construction, financial services, timber, consumer appliances, household furnishing, and a host of other industries. And since the Great Depression, when jobless armies tramped the roads, prompting fears that the civil order was crumbling, the government has recognized its interest in promoting social stability through home ownership, which helps to knit our diverse population into financially and emotionally rooted communities.  <p> This was not always a major policy consideration in Washington. Prior to 1945, banks often required a 30 or 40 percent down payment on mortgages and were reluctant to lend to any but their wealthiest borrowers. Only after World War II, with the government determined to find jobs and homes for millions of veterans, did it become common, even expected, for young couples to buy a home with 10 or 20 percent down and a bank loan. Such low-down-payment mortgages (paid for by G.I. Bill benefits) helped build Levittown, thenation's first planned suburban community, and innumerable similar developments. Donald L. Bartlett and James B. Steele note in their book America: What Went Wrong that in 1952, with "the opening of Levittown, Pennsylvania, the world's largest planned community, a symbol of the flourishing middle class ... it took a factory worker one day to earn enough money to pay the closing costs on a new Levittown house, then selling for $10,000."   <p> Houses were homes then--not investments. Anyone looking to make a killing bought stocks, which posted phenomenal gains during the Eisenhower era. Real estate had appreciated about 2.5 percent annually after inflation over the previous century--roughly the same as bonds, according to Karl E. Case, a Wellesley College economics professor and a principal in Case Shiller Weiss, a real estate research firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts--and the equity that accrued to home owners was likened to a savings account.  <p> Inflation changed all that. As late as the 1965, for example, a new four-bedroom colonial on one acre in a middle-class suburban development like Pleasant Hills, in Bel Air, Maryland, near Baltimore, cost $30,000. But as inflation began to accelerate, in step with the escalating Vietnam War, so did home prices. And following the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74, inflation soared for the next six years. Again, home prices followed suit.   <p> Even after inflation was stamped out by Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker in 1981, real estate speculation continued unabated, fueled by the demographic bulge of baby boomers buying first homes and by new tax laws that let developers, especially of condominiums, take real estate losses against other income.  <p> Thus, by the mid-1980s much of the nation (Texas and the oil-patch states being a notable exception) was experiencing full-blown real estate inflation, even though overall inflation had been tamed. "In 1985, in the Northeast, people thought the only thing dumber than not owning a house was not owning two,'' says Karl E. Case. "People were nuts. And when that happens, prices rise as part of a self-fulfilling prophecy."  <p> And why not? By the late 1980s, that home in Pleasant Hills was listed for $240,000, a $210,000 profit on a $30,000 investment made mostly with borrowed money. And the capital gains could be sheltered or deferred.  <p> The relationship between individual earnings and home ownership changed during this period. Modest homes became golden egglaying geese for those who bought early and unattainable luxuries for those who came later. As Bartlett and Steele note, by 1991 the $10,000 Levittown house cost $100,000 or more, and it took a factory worker 18 weeks to earn enough money to pay the closing costs.  <p> The bubble burst in the early 1990s. Prices fell substantially in many areas, a phenomenon unseen since the Great Depression. In Beverly Hills, the median home price fell about 30 percent from July 1990 to July 1994. Prices in some Boston suburbs fell as much as 50 percent.  <p> "In past recessions, like in 1981-82, prices were sticky; people just took their homes off the market for a while and waited out the downturn,'' Case says. "In 1990, though, the bad economy lasted a lot longer.'' The result was that many people sold at a loss, while others simply lost their homes.  <p> The market's fall also transformed yuppies and buppies intonebbies--negative equity baby boomers--whose mortgages often exceeded the value of their homes. This term was coined by ShermanWhipple, a demographer and market strategist in Hingham, Massachusetts. In 1991, Whipple surveyed 1,000 homeowners in southeastern New England with a median income of $70,000, 17 percent of whom were professionals or managers between the ages of 35 and 54. While12 percent of the survey sample had negative net worth--were "underwater," in mortgage-banker parlance--three quarters of the nebbies were from the apparently prosperous baby boomer group.  <p> In a 1993 study, Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) found that 12 percent of the borrowers in its portfolio did not have enough equity in their homes to refinance. Generally, lenders will not allow a borrower to refinance and get a lower mortgage rate unless they have a loan-to-value ratio of no more than 80 percent, which means the outstanding home loan is no more than 80 percent of the home's assessed value.  <p> Jonathan E. Gray, a securities analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, a Manhattan research and money-management firm, estimated that 5 percent of home owners have negative equity today. That's about 5 million households. The situation is perhaps two or three times worse in California, says Gray, and prices there continue to decline by 2 to 6 percent per year.  <p> "What we have are people who have cashed out of the American dream,'' Whipple says. "These are people who are spending or losing the equity in their homes. This equity is what they were supposed to use for their retirement or for the children's college education, and now it won't be there when they need it.''  <p> This financial debacle has led many potential home owners to cease assuming that, for financial and cultural reasons, they should buy. Instead, they are looking closely at costs to determine whether renting makes more sense--especially if they expect to move in a few years or they live in an area of falling or stagnant housing values.  <p> Ted C. Jones, chief economist with the Real Estate Resource Center at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, says that people who remain in a home long enough to hold a mortgage-burning party on a 30-year loan are rare. In fact, the average home owner stays put 11.8 years, according to the Chicago Title Co. The average household--renters and buyers--stays under the same roof for only about seven years.  <p> "The longer you are going to be in your house, the longer it is going to make sense to buy,'' Jones says. "But if you're going to be in your home three years or less, then definitely rent, unless you are living somewhere when prices are rising fast. <p> "Buying for three years and then selling just produces a lot of grief and expenses and the illusion of equity, in large part because you are mainly paying interest, and then you usually have to pay a 5 to 7 percent commission to sell,'' Jones says."That may also hold true for people who own a home for as long as five or even seven years, too, depending on appreciation."  <p> Homes can depreciate, too, as the nebbies discovered. Take a $200,000 house bought with 20 percent down. If it falls 20 percent in value over three years, the home will be worth $160,000--the same as the initial mortgage balance, which has been reduced little, if at all, by the first 36 mortgage payments. (Payments are almost all interest in the beginning.) In other words, 100 percent of the down payment is gone. Poof! Out the window--just like rent.  <p> Actually determining whether renting or buying is financially the best deal involves weighing numerous factors such as time in the home, maintenance expenses, fees, tax savings, potential investment gain on the down payment, appreciation, and the costs of renting a comparable house. "It's best left to a computer,'' says Steve Lyons, author of the book-software combination called HomeBuyer. The Real Estate Center at Texas A&M also sells software that will help crunch the numbers, as does Mitchell A. Levy, a financial analyst in Cupertino, California, and author of Home Ownership: The American Myth. (Levy's wares are available onthe Internet; send E-mail to mlevy@mythbreakers.com, or searchthe World Wide Web at http://www.mythbreakers.com.) "If you are going to buy a house, have the right reasons, emotionally or financially,'' Levy says. "Don't just jump on the band wagon because everyone else is doing it or because your family and friends say you have to.''  <p> Determining how much your home must appreciate for you to breakeven is probably the key part of the rent-buy calculation. For example, Levy's spreadsheet computed that if Jason Thomas bough this home for $250,000, using a $50,000 down payment and taking a mortgage for the remainder at 7.5 percent interest, the home must appreciate at 4.8 percent annually over seven years for Thomas to break even. If the home didn't appreciate, he would save $88,580 over seven years by investing the difference between his $1,440 mortgage payments (including the mortgage interest deduction) and his $800 monthly rent, and by investing the $50,000 down payment for an 8 percent average annual return.   <p> Even if Thomas's rent were $1,200 month, a comparable home would have to appreciate at 4.4 percent annually over three years, 3.2 percent over five years, or 2.7 percent over seven years to break even with renting. At $1,500 a month rent, buying looks like a better proposition, as the amount of appreciation needed falls to 2.8 percent over three years, 1.6 perent over five years, and 0.9 percent over seven years.  <p> Some investment professionals suggest gauging the overall return on investment (your down payment) to help calculate whether buying or renting is the best deal. They caution, though, that to offset the high returns made possible by leveraging, four percentage points must be deducted annually as compensation for risk, three percentage points for the lack of liquidity, and two percentage points for the work involved in managing the property. That means you need at least a 9 percent annual return on your down payment to start--or about a 2 percent annual appreciation on a house bought with a standard 20 percent down payment.  <p> "And don't forget to subtract 6 percent in sales commissions at the end when you sell the house,'' Levy says. "The minute you purchase your house, it's worth 94 percent of what you paid for it."  <p> And what about those tax benefits? The big ones (other than the rollover of a gain if the seller buys a more expensive house or is over 55) apply to mortgage-interest and property-tax deductions, and they are less substantial than most people realize, largely because the federal government already gives taxpayers a $6,550 standard deduction or $3,900 each when two single people buy a home. That means that the first $6,550 in mortgage interest (or $546 a month) they pay gives them no tax benefit, because they already have it whether they own a home or not.  <p> A couple in the 28 percent tax bracket, who pay $8,577 annually in mortgage interest and $2,500 in property taxes totaling $11,077, may think they are saving 28 percent of $11,077, or $3,102. Actually, their tax benefit will be 28 percent of $4,527 ($11,077 minus the $6,550 standard deduction). That amount is $1,267.56, or $105.63 a month.  <p> "That's 11 cents back for every buck they spend on interest and property taxes,'' said Eisenson. "What a deal.''  <p> Of course, for most people, the decision to buy a home has never been entirely, or even primarily, a financial one. Putting down roots, finding a place in a community, being seen as a mature, responsible person--these considerations often have equal or greater influence than money. The type of home we choose, its location, and the way we landscape and decorate it are approved, often admired, forms of giving public expression to an identity.  <p> Doubtless this is still the case, but what has changed is that renting, too, is becoming for many a route to self-definition. People are rethinking the premises of ownership. Does owning a home really help create or enhance success and security? Certainly, it's hard to make that argument if your neighborhood is full of laid-off aerospace workers or people whose homes are worthless than they paid for them. Moreover, if, in the 1950s, the suburbs were regarded as utopian havens from the city, that is no longer the case. From drugs to pollution, urban ills are now also suburban ones.  <p> "We decided to rent, and it was a lifestyle rather than a strictly economic decision,'' says Jonathan Cohen, who owned a home in Santa Cruz, California, before deciding to rent a two-bedroom cottage for $1,490 a month in Palo Alto. "We gained tremendous flexibility in being able to relocate when and if necessary. I feel more secure knowing I can move on short notice, particularly with all the layoffs going on.''  <p> This view is likely to spread in an era of service-sector McJobs, serial careers, and diminished material expectations. The baby boomers, now ages to 32 to 49, bought their homes in one huge wave from about 1970 to 1987, pushing up prices in a classic short-supply/high-demand economic equation. But who will buy those dwellings when boomers start to retire in a decade?  <p> Don't count on the baby boom let--anyone under 16 or so today--or the so-called Generation Xers. These kids may be ready to buy houses when their parents are ready to sell, but if real income remains flat or continues to decline, then they won't be able to afford them.  <p> "It's becoming more and more difficult for young people to take their place in the American dream,'' says Katherine Newman, a Columbia University professor of anthropology and the author of Declining Fortunes: The Withering of the American Dream. "Much more difficult than for the generation that came of age after World War II. A home today requires two-income households, long commutes, sometimes families deciding to have fewer kids and more day care. The American dream of the future will be simply holding on to a job, and that's becoming harder and harder forAmericans, and it will have a powerful effect on housing markets.'' <p> As a character in Douglas Coupland's novel, Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture, says, "When someone tells you they've just bought a house, they might as well tell you they no longer have a personality. You can immediately assume so many things; that they're locked into jobs they hate; that they're broke; they they spend every night watching videos...."  <p> Nick Ravo is a reporter with The New York Times. He can be reached at nickravo@nytimes.com.  <p>  <p>TO BUY OR RENT, THAT IS THE QUESTION  <p> Intelligently deciding whether to buy or rent entails a number of variables--and every individual's situation is unique. There are, however, a few key considerations. These tips are based on Home Buyer: The Book & Software Home Buying Kit by Steven A. Lyons (Stratosphere Publishing, 1995).  <p> * Because of its exponential effect on a home's value, appreciation has the most dramatic impact on profit and loss. Estimate future appreciation in the area you plan to buy by its performance over no less than the past 12 years. Don't be dissuaded or unduly encouraged by sharp price dips or increases in just the past few years.  <p> * If home prices in your area are near the nationwide median of about $110,000, then there is room for substantial future price increases. If prices considerably exceed the median, as in California and Hawaii and parts of the Northeast, they maybe hitting a ceiling.  <p> * If appreciation averages 3 percent annually over the next12 years, then the typical home buyer, purchasing a $110,000 home, will fare slightly better than the typical renter paying the national median rent of $450.  <p> * Don't fixate on tax savings. Homeowners can benefit from huge tax write-offs, particularly after selling, but if appreciation is zero, you probably are better off renting.  <p> * How well a renter invests a down payment and the difference between the monthly mortgage payment and the rent are important. A renter who parks the down payment in the bank will have difficulty coming out ahead of a home buyer, as will the renter who fritters away the monthly differential. Astute investors, however, canerase any advantages home buying may offer.  <p> * Homeowners do not have access to their down payment. The renter, however, does, and can use it, whether to act on an investment tip or to take a cruise around the world.  <p> * Nonfinancial issues may be as important as financial ones. Renters may not want to physically maintain a house. Or they may want to live in a school district where they can't afford to buy. Conversely, the security of owning may outweigh its potential financial disadvantages.  <p> * Remember that homeowning is riskier and more constraining than renting. If real estate values drop or if a fire devastates your rented home, you can simply walk away. But an owner may never completely recover from such a blow. Conversely, homeowners can't be forced to vacate at the end of a lease.  <p> * While you may improve your home by painting it, adding a built-in book case, or landscaping, as a renter you never own or profit from the results of your hard work.  <p><p>

						October 1995   <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> 1 RM W/OCEAN VU TO RENT CHEAP  <p> By Rudy Maxa  <p> Once upon a time, there were two basic hotel-room rates: the general or "rack" rate and the package rate. Today, the lodging industry is a consumer crapshoot <p>Your best deal may be to book through a relatively new group of wholesalers called hotel consolidators, who buy large numbers of hotel-room nights and pass the savings along to last-minute customers. Whether you are in San Francisco, Washington, London, or Paris, consolidators can save you a lot of money. And when a particular hotel or every hotel in an entire city here or abroad is sold out, a consolidator may be your best shot at a bed for the night.  <p> Consolidators require nothing more than a credit card number; most use it to guarantee your reservation, and you pay the hotel. Cancellation policies vary, but most require a 24-hour notice. <p> Here are some representative savings: <p>Hotel Reservations Network (800-964-6835) offered a room at the elegant Rihga Royal in Manhattan for $237 a night, including the 13.25 percent hotel tax (all prices and availability areas of July 1995). When the hotel was called directly for a weeknight room, the rate quoted was $295, before tax. The consolidator's rate amounted to a savings of about $100 a night.  <p> The Essex House overlooking Central Park said its lowest rate, a national corporate rate for a double with no view, was $243, excluding tax. HRN offered a tax-inclusive rate of $189, saving almost $91 per night. And while the recently renovated Drake Swissotel on Park Avenue said over the phone that its cheapest weeknight rate was $224, not including tax, HRN offered a tax-inclusive rate of $160 nearly $100 per night less.  <p> In Beverly Hills, California, the Summit Hotel on Rodeo Drive offered a "special promotional rate of $150 a night," excluding hotel taxes of 14 percent.  HRN charged $113, including tax, for a room on the same night about $60 less.  <p> HRN, based in Dallas, lists rooms in most major U.S. cities, as well as some in Europe, including London and Paris. HRN is open Monday through Friday, including most holidays, from 8 a.m.to 6 p.m. Central time.  <p> The catalog of properties from New Yorkbased RMC Travel Centre (800-782-2674) includes hotels in all major U.S. and Canadian cities (except Honolulu). Rates for the Essex House and the Drake were identical to those offered through HRN. An oceanview room at the trendy Shutters on the Beach in Santa Monica, California, cost $275 a night, but $400 before tax if you had reserved through the hotel. RMC is open for business Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern time.  <p> Among other consolidators, Quikbook (800-789-9887), which calls itself "America's Number One Hotel Discounter," advertises discounts of up to 70 percent in 21 U.S. cities. Room Exchange (800-846-7000) promises discounts in all major U.S. cities, the Caribbean, Mexico,and Hawaii. You prepay for your room and receive a voucher which is fully refundable if you cancel 48 hours before arrival. The company also has started listing European and Asian properties, such as London's Dorchester ($285 plus a 17.5 percent tax, or about $80 below the regular rate) and Hong Kong's deluxe Peninsula (starting at $259, about $100 less than the hotel rate).  <p> There are also regional specialists, such as Central Reservation Service (800-548-3311), which offers reservations in Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and New Orleans as well as for some New York and Los Angeles properties. California Hotel Reservations (800-576-0003) specializes, naturally enough, in California and recently added Portland, Oregon, and Seattle to its portfolio. Atlanta-based Hotels Plus (800-235-0909) specializes in discount hotels in England and mainland Europe, as well as the Middle East and South Africa. <p> As in any bargain hunting, shopping around pays off. And just because one consolidator has nothing available on the date you want doesn't mean another won't.   <p>     <p> Travel Tips  <p> Calling a hotel directly for a room is often (but not always) better than calling a central reservations number, because locals respond to day-to-day business conditions. For example, when I called a reservation clerk at Ma Maison Sofitel in Los Angeles, she said that, since business was slow that day, she'd extend the weekend rate of $129 before taxes, $30 less than the normal weekday rate. (Hotel Reservations Network offered a tax-inclusiverate of $148.) <p>Hotels will often give you a corporate rate even if you don'twork for a corporation, so always request it (unless there's a lower rate). Also, watch for advertised specials, such as Hilton's1995 summer rates for its foreign hotels, which undercut the consolidator prices. <p>In the United States, hotels of ten equal or undercut consolidators' rates on weekend stays.

Worth magazine/Features<p>MEN OF THE CLOTH
Appreciating the tailor's art is suddenly fashionable<p>By Carol A. Schatz<p>"I love you, I love you!" shouts Vincenzo Furfaro, the head tailor for Napoleon, a men's specialty store in New York City. His enthusiasm punctuates a dinner hosted for eight tailors by Kiton, an Italian suit maker, at one of Manhattan's finest French restaurants. Kiton has flown the tailors in for a weekend of entertainment, put them up in a deluxe hotel, escorted them around the city in private cars, and presented each with an expensive bolt of super 150's wool. Why? "To us, the master tailor is a vital link in providing the level of craftsmanship that Kiton demands,'' says Andrew Tanner, one of Kiton's two U.S. representatives, looking crisp on a humid evening in his handmade Luigi Borrelli linen shirt, handmade tropical-weight Kiton suit, and handmade seven-fold silk tie.<p>At a time when Kiton is taking pains to recognize the tailor, more suit buyers are recognizing the Neapolitan tailoring in Kiton (KEE-tahn, from chiton, the Greek word for the tunics worn in ancient Greek society). And Kiton isn't the only high-end suit maker finding new customers and bigger revenues: Retailers are also talking about Luciano Barbera, Brioni, and the American suit maker Oxxford. "Most people have never heard of Kiton and Brioni and probably never will," says Murray Pearlstein, owner of the menswear store Louis, Boston. "But these are the artisans of the industry." With gross U.S. revenues ranging from Kiton's $4.5 million to Brioni's estimated $20 million, these suit makers may be a mere blip on the radar screen of the $71.5 billion men's apparel market, but their success signifies an important change in ready-to-wear: Tailors are heroes once again.<p>The trend toward exquisitely made suits is in part a reaction against the fashionable designer clothes of the 1980s. Some of these clothes were stylishly cut and highly advertised but not necessarily well made. "There's a whole new cult reemerging of really nice clothes," says Derrill Osborn, director of men's clothes at Neiman Marcus. "People got tired of paying high prices and having the buttons fall off in a day."<p>These really nice, $2,500 hand-sewn suits take about 22 hours to make and are said to fit as comfortably as sweaters, molding to the body of the wearer after about six months. They are virtually unadvertised and for the most part remarkably understated. Lewis Stein, a 51-year-old preschool teacher in Brooklyn, New York, says of his Brioni: "I like it because people don't say, 'That's a nice suit'; they say, 'You look nice.' So it doesn't as much draw attention to itself as enhance the wearer." He adds that his Brioni cost more than his first car.<p>Stein is in good company. When Pierce Brosnan appears as James Bond in Goldeneye this fall, he'll be decked out in Brioni. Other customers include Nelson Mandela, Peter Jennings, Al Pacino, and Riccardo Muti. These suits appeal to all sizes: The only thing Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg may have in common besides Disney stock is their Kiton labels. Bill Clinton owns a few Donna Karan suits, says Martin Greenfield, a Brooklyn master tailor whose 180 tailors make handmade suits for Donna Karan and Neiman Marcus.<p>Suit makers' time-intensive techniques result in high prices and low output (Kiton's total U.S. production, for example, is 2,500 suits; Luciano Barbera's is 4,000). As any tailor knows, a great suit is in the details. Oxxford puts 1,350 hand stitches in a jacket collar and 800 hand stitches in a lapel. Barbera ages its wool for six months in a cellar beneath its mills in Biella, Italy, and rests fabrics for 24 hours during each milling step. Brioni, to ensure the continuity of its tailoring, has developed its own five-year apprentice program. And don't forget the temperature-stabilized room where finished Kiton suits hang for two weeks. "It helps them get over the trauma of being born,'' says Alan Levine, Bergdorf Goodman's men's fashion director.<p>Handmade suits are helping retailers get over the trauma of early '90s recession selling. This spring retailers saw gains in this category of up to 30 percent. Three of Bergdorf's best trunk shows (special in-store events featuring a wide selection of merchandise and the manufacturer's representative) were Oxxford, Brioni, and Kiton, with sales of up to $100,000, says George Santacroce, the store's senior vice president and general merchandise manager. Hand-tailored suits from Richard Tyler, Hickey Freeman, Nick Hilton, and Ralph Lauren will be introduced in stores this fall.<p>"I've been in this business all my life, and what you typically see is something suddenly and mysteriously get in the air and move people to go in a new direction,'' says Wilkes Bashford, owner of the 18,000-square-foot eponymous specialty store in San Francisco. "People get bored and want something different. I think this trend relates to the martinis in the big martini glasses, the cigars. You don't stand around drinking martinis and smoking cigars in sloppy clothing.''<p>Even the more cost-conscious Brooks Brothers is introducing a handmade suit made by Martin Greenfield. According to Robert Squillaro, product director at Brooks, the suit is "completely handmade and as good as any of the top makes.'' It will sell for $1,298.<p>The rise of the top makes--and better-tailored clothing--comes at a time when menswear retailers in general have been in a nail-biting mode. The popularity of casual day left retailers wondering what balance to strike between suit inventory and casual wear (when Brooks Brothers bet wrong in 1994, profits dropped a stunning 60 percent). Now, however, more expensive suits are suddenly more popular.<p>Some retailers note that it's become easier to sell a $1,000 suit than an $800 one. Bergdorf Goodman Men is increasing the number of suits that sell for more than $1,000, says Santacroce. Saks Fifth Avenue's men's suit department has traded up from an average suit price of $850 some 18 months ago to $1,000$1,100 today, says Stanley Tucker, men's fashion director at Saks. This fall Saks is adding Brioni, Zegna, and Gucci to its New York City store. "Customers are asking for them,'' says Tucker.<p>Hand-tailored suits, once the province of older CEOs and the like, are finding a following among baby boomers who may have cut their teeth on Armani and are seeking something different. The Oxxford suit, for example, is recognized as one of the best-made suits in the world--in fact, an annual Neiman Marcus in-house analysis on technical merits ("They tear the suits apart,'' says Osborn) consistently ranks it best in construction. And like a Brioni, it's said to make everyone--well-toned biceps or not--look good. Its main appeal, however, has been to the "mature man." "Before Armani put some sizzle and sex appeal into clothing, there was always a coterie of portly men with seven-figure incomes who bought Oxxford and Brioni suits,'' says Alan G. Millstein, editor and publisher of a fashion industry newsletter.<p>Suit makers like Oxxford are changing styles to accommodate a younger clientele. "Demographics have changed so much in the past 50 years,'' says Crittenden Rawlings, the new president of Oxxford Clothes (not to be confused with Oxford Industries, whose products include the popular Oxford shirt). "The only person who could afford this suit in the 1950s and '60s was a mature man. Today, with young corporate lawyers and financial executives making $300,000 or so by the time they're 30, that young man is potentially our customer.''<p>Rawlings is out to lure the well-heeled younger man with new, updated models that have a more rounded shoulder, a slimmer cut, a longer coat, and a hipper-looking lapel. He also plans to dedicate a substantial amount of money to educating salespeople in the features and benefits of the garment.<p>Other top suit makers are restyling as well to attract the Armani consumer. Luciano Barbera has developed some ten new silhouettes since it opened its first showroom in the United States three years ago (before then, retailers bought the line in Italy). "The new James Bond really should have been in Barbera,'' says Michal Sestak, the company's U.S. manager.<p>Fabrics and patterns have also been brightened and modernized. Had Fitzgerald's Daisy Buchanan fingered these fine merinos and worsted cashmeres, these natty glen plaids and dapper chalk stripes, she wouldn't have wept--she would have moaned. "This sleepy segment has woken up and added fashion,'' says Osborn. "And quality and fashion combined will be a lethal weapon, perhaps the greatest threat to the designers.''<p>But not tomorrow. After hearing about Kiton through friends, James Mandelbaum, a 36-year-old entertainment attorney in Los Angeles, went to Fred Hayman Beverly Hills to try it on and came away unconvinced. "It hung beautifully on me, I looked great in it, but in the end it was a little old for me--too much like what my father would wear.''<p>His words are heresy to a true high-end clotheshorse like Enrico Formicola, Kiton's creative director. When he was 18, he owned 22 suits. Now at 46, he owns about 150. "I used to walk to school to save money to buy suits,'' he says. "The pleasure was to be with friends and have a suit they would admire.'' It still is.<p>

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>BOOT UP YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>Till now, personal financial software has offered little more than bookkeeping. For example, <a name="NASD:INTU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16001"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intuit</b></a>'s Quicken, with 8 million users the most popular application software ever sold at retail, keeps records on mutual funds and balances your checkbook. The product has an extremely loyal following, but there has always been some question whether such programs are really worth the data-entry work they entail.<p>"People who use checkbook programs like Quicken for household expenses are detail freaks--they'll write a check at the grocery store and then go home and rebalance their checkbooks again on a computer," says Dave McClure, who advises CPAs on accounting software.<p>Among programs that take on more complex tasks, Andrew Tobias's Managing Your Money (from MECA Software) has long been a top-rated best-seller. It too can balance a checkbook, but it also assists in financial planning, helping to calculate how much must be saved monthly to pay for a child's college education or how large a mortgage a home buyer can handle. What Managing Your Money can't do is generate an overall financial plan from the answers it provides to various personal finance questions put to it by the user.<p>Intuit has now jumped into that gap with Quicken Financial Planner, a major advance in personal-finance software. While this program won't replace the judgment and flexibility of a skilled financial advisor, it is a true financial-planning tool.<p>It's also extremely easy to operate. Users enter data about income and expenses, loans and assets, and projected retirement savings in ten stages, each involving a series of questions. Assistance can be called up by clicking on the help icon, and the well-known financial journalist Jane Bryant Quinn offers still more detail on topics such as investing, borrowing, and credit card debt.<p>The program uses your answers to create reports on your income, expenses, cash flow, investment portfolio, and net worth. QFP demonstrates in detail where you will be spending your money, how your investment portfolio will grow, and what your estate will be worth. <p>QFP also lets you, in a sense, enter your future into the projections. If your spouse plans to quit working from 2001 to 2005, you can see how it will affect cash flows and retirement savings year by year. Similarly, if you expect your children to attend college from 2008 to 2014, you can assess the impact on your budget. Using the program's "special expense" calculator, you can also plan to buy, say, a new bedroom set in 2000 or pay for a bar mitzvah in 2006.<p>The program does have some limitations. "If you could love and hate something at the same time, this is it," says David Drucker, a financial planner at Malgoire Drucker in Bethesda, Maryland, who examined the program at our request.<p>"It's about as smart as a bad financial planner," says Drucker. Someone who didn't know a 401(k) from a profit-sharing plan and who relied on QFP to run his or her financial life could be in for trouble.<p>"My clients often put the wrong numbers in the wrong boxes when filling out a questionnaire for me," says Drucker. "And if they do it with these software packages, they'll get wrong answers."<p>The program can occasionally become confusing, as in the section requesting data on employer contributions to 401(k) and other tax-deferred retirement plans. Quicken says that the software will be updated annually to keep up with tax-law changes and in response to user comments.<p>Another problem is that the program doesn't address every possible financial situation. For instance, federal laws give retirees a choice about how to take distributions from an IRA or pension plan, which can affect tax liability and cash flow. QFP uses what's known as the "term-certain method" of distributing those assets, but many retirees are better off using a "recalculation method" to take retirement distributions. The program, however, doesn't offer this option.<p>"A 65-year-old who uses this package could do himself a disservice," says Drucker. Intuit concedes that the program doesn't focus on retirees and was developed with an eye toward providing easy financial planning for baby boomers.<p>One last criticism is that the software can't be creative on your behalf. In my case, the program withdrew $56,000 from my wife's tax-deferred retirement fund in 2011 and another $31,000 in 2012 to pay for our kids' college tuition. But by then I'll be just three years away from retirement, and instead of paying a 20 percent penalty on withdrawals from the retirement fund, we'd be much better off borrowing money from my 401(k) plan, paying the interest on the loan (which is much lower than the penalty), and repaying the loan when I hit 59 and a half and can make withdrawals penalty free. <p>These are relatively minor criticisms. QFP brings us a long step closer to the day when we'll all be our own best financial planners. At a suggested retail price of $39.95, this program is a great investment. QFP requires Windows 3.1, 4 MB of RAM, and 16 MB of available hard-disk space. The CD-ROM version requires at least a 486-based PC with a sound card and speakers, running Windows 3.1 with 8 MB of RAM and 16 MB of available hard-disk space.<p>With the release of QFP, Quicken has simultaneously published the Parents' Guide to Money CD-ROM (requires Windows 3.1, 4 MB of RAM, 3 MB of available hard-disk space, and a 16-byte sound card and speakers; retail price, $29.95), a "fast and easy" way for parents and those expecting to become parents to "take control of the financial challenges of parenting."<p>Guide is a much less ambitious tool than QFP. It isn't powerful enough to generate budget projections of special expenses--summer camp, the cost of a new bedroom set--or the changes in college savings schedules required by, say, one spouse quitting work to remain home with the kids for five years.<p>Basically a talking book, Guide features video clips of parents and financial advisors talking about child care, life and health insurance, and college costs. The financial-planning portion of the product consists of ten worksheets on which users inscribe their monthly budgets, insurance policies, and child care costs.<p>Some limitations notwithstanding (it lacks a serious retirement planning aid, for example), Guide can be of real help to people who want to identify and quantify the fundamental fiscal impact of having children. It will be particularly useful for young couples just starting out.<p><p>

						July/August 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> THE POOR MAN'S ARBITRAGE  <p> By Nick Ravo  <p> Arbitrage: the elegant french word conjures images of sleuths snooping around for inside stock information. The reality, however, is legal and not terribly romantic.  <p> There are two kinds of arbitrage: pure and risk. Pure arbitrage is a game for those with the money and technology to execute huge, lightning-fast international trades. It entails purchasing something a stock, currency, or commodity in one market and immediately reselling it in another to profit from a price discrepancy. Anarbitrageur might buy silver contracts in London and instantly short the same kind of contracts selling at a higher price in New York. The profits are razor thin, but if the operation is repeated frequently, with millions of dollars of capital invested each time, annual returns can be sizable.  <p> Risk arbitrageurs do things differently. Typically, they buy big blocks of stock (or options) in a company targeted for takeover. Because the company's stock usually trades slightly lower than the takeover offer, arbs pocket the difference if a deal goes through. They lose a bundle if it doesn't.  <p> For instance, on April 27 the Justice Department said it would oppose the proposed merger of <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> and <a name="NASD:INTU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16001"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intuit</b></a> on antitrust grounds. On that day Intuit was  trading at around 83, Microsoft at around 79. Last October, Microsoft had offered 1.34 of its shares for each Intuit share (or about $106 a share). The arbs who bought Intuit at 83 expected a postmerger profit of about $23 per share. But after the Justice Department revealed its opposition, Intuit plummeted to 68. If the deal falls through,the price could fall to around 40, where Intuit was trading before the merger was agreed upon.  <p> Arbs often bet on possible takeovers, not just announced deals, making educated guesses based on networking with other investing pros, monitoring consolidation in a particular industry, and searching the financial press for rumors of merger activity.There is also a mutual fund that invests solely in risk arbitrage: the <a name="FUND:MERFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MERFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merger Fund</b></a>, run by Westchester Capital Management of Valhalla, New York (see Fund Profile, June).  <p> Another way to arbitrage individual stocks is SIP arbitrage. This technique involves buying and immediately selling stocks offered at a discount in shareholder investment plans by a small number of companies. SIPs are usually part of a dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP. "It's poor man's arbitrage," says Charles B. Carlson,vice president of Dow Theory Forecasts in Hammond, Indiana, which publishes DRIP Investor, a newsletter on discount stock programs."Any reasonably sophisticated small investor can do it."  <p> Seventeen companies provide discounts of 2 to 5 percent on cash purchases of restricted amounts of stock made through their SIPs and DRIPs. National City Corp., a bank in Cleveland, restricts cash purchases of discounted stock to $500 a month. United Mobile Homes, a real estate investment trust in Eatontown, New Jersey, allows purchases of as much as $40,000 a quarter. (Directories of DRIPs and SIPs with descriptions of how each operate are available from Standard & Poor's at 800-221-5277 or Dow Theory Forecasts at 219-931-6480.)  <p> To make an optional cash purchase in a SIP or DRIP offering discount stock, you must be a shareholder of record in the company, meaning you must own at least one share of stock in your own name (some companies require five or ten shares). Through a deep-discount broker, have the share transferred from the brokerage's name known as the street name into your name and mailed to you. You may also be able to buy one share through The Moneypaper (800-388-9993), First Share (800-683-0743), or the National Association of Investors Corp. (810-583-6242, ext. 22).  <p> Once you are enrolled in the SIP, mail a check to the company to buy its discounted shares. On the stock purchase date listed in the prospectus, call the company to find how many shares you bought at what price, then call your broker and sell short (that is, sell with the promise to buy back) the same number of shares on the same day.  <p> When the discounted shares arrive in the mail, put them in your brokerage account and cover your short position. You have now locked in the discount as profit, minus taxes and commissions.  <p> Suppose your brokerage account contains $4,500. You enroll in United Water Resources' DRIP, write a check to the company for $3,000, and ask the company to mail you the stock. This would buy 234 shares at 12.83, based on the May 8 price of 13.5 less a 5 percent discount. On the same day you short 234 shares at13.5 and collect $3,159. (You probably need at least $1,600 in your margin brokerage account to short this much stock.)  <p> When the shares arrive, use them to cover the short sale. You keep $3,159 from the short sale $159 more than you paid United Water Resources. Do this once a quarter and annual earnings will surpass $600, about 20 percent, on your $3,000. Those with deep pockets can earn more, investing in several stocks and through several accounts.  <p> Unfortunately, this route to easy money has been exploited so frequently by small investors and limited investment partnerships that specialize in arbitraging discounted stock that the number of firms offering discounts has declined for several years. However, new SIPs may pop up, Carlson says, when the strong market falters. He adds that the recent increase in popularity of DRIPs could soon raise the number of plans that also offer discounts.  <p> Not everyone approves of SIP arbitrage. "People who do this are defying the purpose of the plans, which are set up for employees, customers, and long-term investors to create a loyal base of shareholders," says Vita Nelson, editor of The Moneypaper. Companies now often limit how frequently shareholders can sell discounted stock. Other firms, such as American Water Works, may boot frequent sellers from plans.  <p> Also, many discount stocks, such as United Mobile Homes, are thinly traded. Shorting them or even selling them in a large block can be difficult or impossible. "We had two physics Ph.D.s recently who opened up a few accounts and tried this, and they found out how hard it is to sell a lot of shares at one time," says Eugene W. Landy, chairman of United Mobile Homes.  <p> The biggest barrier to pure arbitrage profits is that many companies now calculate the discounted price based on a daily high-low average over 10 to 12 days rather than just on the day of the purchase. That makes the phone call to verify purchase price all the more crucial. In the best-case scenario, the discount could increase because of the ups and downs in the pricing period. In the worst case, the pricing period could make the stock even more expensive than the market price the only real risk involved in this form of arbitrage.    <p> Nick Ravo is a reporter for The New York Times.

						July/August 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> DIALING DEALS  <p> By Kathleen Murray  <p> The rate skirmish among long-distance phone carriers is beginning to look like the Hundred Years War. <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>, <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:FON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11560"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sprint</b></a> collectively spend more than $1 billion a year trying to steal each other's callers with promises of big savings. But all that advertising money disguises very small distinctions. The competing discount plans offer "savings [that] really are comparable," says Charles Bain, a researcher at Washington, D.C. based Telecommunications Research & Action Center, a public interest group that tracks long-distance rates.  <p> Since the beginning of the year, the Big Three have each marketed new, less expensive calling plans. AT&T's True Savings will cut 25 percent from its standard rates if you make at least $10 worth of long-distance calls in a month, 30 percent if your bill is over $50. MCI's New Friends and Family discounts MCI's standard rates by 25 percent once monthly charges hit $10, 50 percent for calls to other MCI users specified on the Friends and Family list customers give to the company. Sprint Sense, eschewing discounts, has gone to a flat-rate plan, charging customers 10 cents a minute for night and weekend calls and 22 cents a minute for daytime calls.  <p> The resulting phone-bill differentials are minimal. A recent TRAC survey shows that for 50 long-distance calls a month, mostly made at nights and on weekends and totaling about 522 minutes, MCI will bill $52.72, Sprint $57.33, and AT&T $58.24. The discount plan offered by a rapidly growing new phone company, LDDS, based in Jackson, Mississippi, is comparable.  <p> Naturally, the carriers insist these savings are a big deal. "Even if it's only $3 [a month], that still adds up," says Chris Mannella, MCI's director of brand marketing. "We've still got the lowest rates out there."  <p> That may be, but standard rates are going up at all the major phone companies, even as they steadily drop in the various savings-plan rates. This is a crucial distinction, because carriers do not automatically give current users their lowest rates. In fact, Recent studies by PNR and the Yankee Group, two consumer-research companies, show that two thirds of long-distance users may still pay standard rates.  <p> According to TRAC, there's also little difference in the voice quality of the major services. So why take the time to switch? Ken McEldowney, executive director of Consumer Action, a consumer-advocacy group in San Francisco, says because of the intensifying competition, now is a good time to evaluate your long-distance service, if you haven't done so in the last six months. A heavy user one who spends $150 a month could save more than $500 a year over the standard rate.  <p> AT&T commands 60 percent of the market and charges the highest standard rate. A person billed at that rate who paid $63.15 monthly for long-distance service could reduce that to $44.20 by switching to AT&T's True Savings plan. To get the best deal, start by asking carriers specifically for discount-plan rates. Once you have the competing plans, look at your own calling pattern. "No one plan or company is best for everyone," McEldowney says. MCI's New Friends and Family plan, for example, is often cited as the low-cost leader. But that assumes you're calling other MCI customers that you've listed as regular contacts.  <p> If you make a lot of calls during the day, a plan like Sprint's Most II, which offers volume discounts of up to 35 percent, may cost less than the Sprint Sense flat-rate plan. Flat rates, including LCI All America and LDDS Home Advantage, may be cheaper if your call volume is light or if your calls are coast-to-coast.  <p> Alternatively, if you travel abroad frequently, you might find AT&T worth the slightly higher cost. American travelers often report that AT&T makes it easiest to dial the U.S. direct from overseas as well as get access to American operators.  <p> McEldowney recommends looking at bills for at least three months to determine your calling pattern. For the most recent TRAC study of rates, services, and features, send a stamped, self-addressed, business-sized envelope and $3 to TRAC, P.O. Box 12038, Washington, D.C. 20005.   <p> Currently, all carriers face intense rate pressure as the Baby Bells and even cable companies get set to offer long-distance service. So, once you've found the right plan, relax until the next round of discounts.<p><p>

						July/August 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> ADVISOR BRIEFS  <p> By Elizabeth Macdonald  <p> FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED <p>As municipalities increasingly weather financial storms, municipal bondholders may be concerned about the health of their investments. Securities and Exchange Commission rule 15C-2-12, which takes effect in July, mandates that all municipalities give underwriters ongoing financial information on their bond issues and their own fiscal health. You can now retrieve this information with a phone call to 1-800-BOND-INFO, which provides access to up-to-the-minute price information and credit ratings for more than 650,000 municipal bonds. J.J. Kenny, a New York bond-evaluation firm, began a three-month trial of the service on May 15. Other partners in the venture are the Public Securities Association and Standard & Poor's. <p> Callers must have the name of the bond's issuer, issue date, maturity, and coupon rate. Hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (eastern time) Monday through Friday, and the cost is $9.95 for 25 prices, payable with a credit card.  <p> MOVING MADE SIMPLE <p>Moving from one home to another is among most people's least favorite activities. MovePower, a Southport, Connecticut, relocation company, says it can make this trial a little less stressful. For $79.95, MovePower steers people to discounts on mortgage processing fees, up to a 45 percent discount on van-line and insurance costs, and up to $1,500 cash back on real estate commissions (the company does collect a referral fee).  <p> If you're selling a home, MovePower will also compile comparative sales data for houses in your neighborhood and attempt to find the most energetic brokers by getting the total dollar volume of homes they have sold, how quickly they sold them, and how close they came to the original asking price. For more information, call 800-692-3786. <p>  <p>LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT <p>There are almost 200,000 Cirrus- and Plus-affiliated automatic teller machines in the United States, but your ATM card can also get you cash in Europe and elsewhere. Nearly 200,000 Cirrus and Plus ATMs dot the globe outside the U.S., and the number is rapidly growing. Most European bank machines offer a preferred exchange rate comparable to the wholesale rates banks charge each other, saving customers some 3 to 5 percent per transaction.   <p> The standard PIN code outside the country is four digits, so if your code has more than that, ask whether the first four digits will work. If not, change your code before departing. Cirrus and Plus offer toll-free numbers for ATM locations, but keep in mind that the machines are scarce or nonexistent in some places, among them Denmark and Switzerland for Cirrus.  <p> COMPUTER MAP YOUR VACATION <p>Planning a road trip this summer? Let Rand McNally's Trip Maker software map the fastest or most intriguing route. Type in your starting point and destination, and the program quickly gives you a suggested route, the estimated driving time, and suggested overnight stops. The program also tells you when and where to pick up each road, lists the attractions along the way, and lets you choose the quickest, shortest, or most scenic way to travel. Cost: $79.95, in Windows and CD-ROM formats. To order a copy, call 800-284-6565.  <p> UP, UP, AND TAXED AWAY <p>If you plan on using frequent-flier miles to travel to a vacation spot this summer, remember that if the flights on which miles were earned were paid for by your employer, the IRS will consider this use as taxable income. While no court has ruled on the taxation of frequent-flier miles and the IRS says it has no guidelines for auditing them, travelers should still beware. Some taxpayers have been audited and slapped with a tax bill.  <p> To protect yourself, travel-tax expert Richard Meyer of Highland Park, Illinois, says you should telephone the airline you are flying, ask for its lowest fare for your flight, and keep a record of it. Or cut out an advertisement in the newspaper showing a lower rate. If you are audited, this information will preventthe IRS from randomly assigning a higher value to your flight.<p><p>

						June 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> ADVISOR BRIEFS  <p> By Elizabeth Macdonald and William P. Barrett  <p> Cheaper Mortgages <p>A computer system just introduced by Freddie Mac may save 20 to 50 percent on mortgage closing costs. The government-sponsored mortgage corporation says the Loan Prospector can complete a remote home appraisal in less than 72 hours, versus two weeks for the traditional on-site version. The system decides which homes qualify for expedited appraisal by comparing them with historical data on similar properties (the system has 4.6 million property transactions in its database). If a home meets the Prospector's criteria, in some cases the bank appraiser can dispense with an interior inspection.  <p> Thus far, Citicorp Mortgage, PHH US Mortgage of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, and Countrywide Credit of Pasadena, California, have signed on to use the system.   <p>  <p>Fore! <p>Here's an interesting real estate investment trust twist: National Golf Properties, a REIT based in Santa Monica, California, owns 74 golf courses in 23 states and Britain and intends to acquire15 more over the next 12 months. Morgan Stanley, which along with Smith Barney underwrote the company's 9.7 million-share offering at $20.38 per share back in 1993, forecasts the acquisition binge will boost the share price from a recent $19.75 on the New York Stock Exchange to $23 by next April. The REIT, whose ticker symbol is TEE, posted a recent dividend yield of 8 percent.  <p>  <p>Deposit Uninsurance <p>Look around the one office of Home Savings & Loan Association of Oklahoma City and you'll notice a lot of signs saying "Deposits not insured by any government agency." The little S&L, with $8 million in deposits, dropped its Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. coverage last year. In return, savers get higher deposit rates. Home Savings offers nationwide money-market rates at 6.7 percent, compared with, say, 3.75 percent at New York's Citibank. A four-year certificate of deposit throws off 7.5 percent, a good 1 percent above the recent national average. The FDIC says eight financial institutions have voluntarily given up deposit insurance since1984. Before you consider putting your money in an uninsured S&L, ask to receive financial statements, Home Savings cranksout two a year and watch the ratio of deposits to loans, called the equity-to-assets ratio. If the ratio is below 5 percent, yank the account even if you have to pay several months' CD interest penalty.   <p>  <p>Investors@stocks.com <p>National Discount Brokers, in conjunction with Portfolio AccountingWorld-Wide (PAWWS), recently introduced a stock-trading programon the World Wide Web. Investors who log on to NDB Online can buy and sell stocks and get stock quotes. Investors can also receive free use of PAWWS' portfolio accounting system, worth $8.95 per month. Trades are confirmed via E-mail, phone, or fax. The brokerage demands a hefty $5,000 cash or security deposit in an account before trading may begin. It charges a flat $20 fee for Nasdaq and OTC trades and $25 for listed trades of up to 5,000 shares. NDB Online says it will provide a high level of security for its customers by using a <a name="NASD:NSCP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42472"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Netscape</b></a> server with RSA encryption. The National Association of Securities Dealers reports no complaints against the company, but if an investor is dissatisfied, the transaction fee will be refunded. NDB Online's address is at:http://pawws.sccapl.com.  <p>  <p>Leave the flying to heirs <p>Each year deceased frequent fliers take an estimated $60 million worth of miles with them. But according to Frequent Flyer magazine in Secaucus, New Jersey, some major airlines will let you bequeath those miles to your heirs. While it is against their official policy, United, <a name="NYSE:U"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11527"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>USAir</b></a>, and America West will give good customers this last privilege. Donald Witte, director of marketing services at USAir, says the airline will transfer the miles to an existing frequent-flier mileage account or set up a new one, so long as it receives a letter of request, preferably from the executor of the deceased's estate.  <p><p>

Worth magazine/Features<p>WHY WE BUY
The Silent persuasion of boxes, bottles, cans and tubes.<p>By Thomas Hine<p>The packaging industry claims a piece of just about every business. More important, it claims a piece of every consciousness. 
At any given moment, whether you're in your house, on the street, or where you work, it's likely that at least one package is within your field of vision. Probably you don't notice it there, just being--tempting, informing, and reassuring through color, form, and suggestion.<p>During an average trip to the supermarket, we're exposed to more than a thousand different packages a minute, all stimuli to which we respond in a primitive, semi-conscious manner. Is this a food or a poison? A friend or a foe? Dense with images and messages, the supermarket is a sort of information rain forest in which products compete for survival. Retailers, using the marketing data produced by checkout scanners, quickly determine which products will live and which will die.<p>The supermarket itself is a sort of package, carefully designed to route consumers along a particular path. Nearly all open onto the fruit and vegetable section, employing the profusion of colors, textures, and smells to literally get shoppers' juices flowing and to prepare them to respond with equal visceral ardor to the more abstract consumables that will follow. This is where you'll find the great natural packages, like oranges and bananas, whose peels--vivid, endearing, and unmistakable advertisements for the edible insides--constitute a sort of packagers' Holy Grail.<p>The difference between, say, a coconut and a cereal box is that the latter, like all man-made packaging, is calculated to evoke thoughts and feelings--about health, beauty, athletic prowess--that mask the actual contents of the box. This is not new; 17th-century English patent- medicine sellers understood that the shape of their bottles was far more important than the miraculous liquid they held.<p>Packaging in its modern form arose in the last quarter of the 19th century. In 1886, "the man in Quaker garb" first appeared on an oatmeal box. Henry Parsons Crowell, a merchandising genius who proclaimed that God had chosen him to get rich, owned a mill that could produce more oatmeal each year than Americans had ever consumed. His insight was that he could sell more oatmeal by packaging it in small quantities and giving it an identity. His oatmeal was no longer simply a food for horses and Scots, but, as an early advertisement proclaimed, "a delicacy for the epicure, a nutritious dainty for the invalid, a delight to the children."<p>Quaker merchants had a reputation in 19th-century America as shrewd but fair dealers, leading some peddlers to affect Quaker dress. Crowell, who gave much of his wealth to evangelical Protestant causes, wasn't a Quaker, but the Quaker image, printed in four colors on the newly perfected cardboard folding box, endowed his homely grain with personality. By making a commodity into a friend, Crowell could survive lower-cost competitors and years when the price of oats was high. Within a few years of the Quaker's appearance, there were countless imitators. <p>"Good packaging creates companies," says Elinor Selame, principal of BrandEquity International, a design firm, and past president of the Package Design Council. Campbell's Soup is a good example. Its red-and-white can was adopted more than 90 years ago. Before that Campbell had colorfully illustrated cans, with a different brand name for each product. The red-and-white icon was a radical simplification that enabled the company to be identified not with a few products, but with a wide range of condensed soups.<p>For generations, Campbell's successfully sold not so much a line of soups as the idea of soup itself. The Campbell's can signified warmth, stability and nourishment, home. In fact, it had stopped meaning "food." "Our research showed that almost everyone has a can or two of Campbell's Soup in the cupboard," says Del Macaulay, the company's former package-design chief. "The problem was to get them to eat the soup." <p>And so the pioneering package recently underwent a major redesign to transform Campbell's from something to save into something to eat ... right now. The familiar red-and-white, gold-medalled can--originally based on the Cornell University football uniform--was given a full-color photograph of the soup at the bottom of the label.<p>"When we did tests of how people perceived Campbell's Soup, everyone knew it was in a red and white can, but not much else," says Macaulay. "They couldn't even tell us whether the red is at the bottom or at the top." The tests suggested that the can could be modified with little risk, as long as the red and white remained. (The red's at the top, by the way.)<p>In a sense, the redesign was a step backward to the way Campbell's soups looked a century ago. But new and old are elusive qualities in the world of packaging. One of the most successful product launches of the 1980s, which depended almost entirely on packaging, was the Classico pasta-sauce line. The mason jars in which the sauces are packed suggest that your grandmother might have "put them up." The labels' vague but highly evocative illustrations, and sauce names taken from cities and regions of Italy, create an aura of sophistication. These are sauces for people who travel.<p>While Classico is a new product in a partly nostalgic package, Murphy's Oil Soap is a very old product that was reborn in a new package. After many decades in a cylindrical plastic bottle, the brand was dying. The company moved to a flattened container, which provides a bigger selling surface. But the real difference for Murphy's seems to have been the addition of a handle. <p>"When the handle was introduced, without any special advertising or promotion, Murphy's started to sell so fast, they were having trouble keeping it in the stores," says Richard Gerstman, whose firm did the redesign. Shoppers had unconsciously associated Murphy's with 19th-century drudgery. "The handle demonstrated that the people who make Murphy's care about making the product easy to use," Gerstman says. Once that was established, the old- fashioned natural quality of the product became an asset rather than a liability.<p>The handle is perceived as the product--just as much as soap itself. And in fact, most consumers make no distinction between packages and their contents. This was the critical discovery of Louis Cheskin, a pioneer in the psychology of packaging. During the 1930s, Cheskin did a series of experiments with identical products, one in a package marked with circles and one with triangles. Eighty percent of consumers said they preferred the product with circles because of its higher quality. "I had difficulty believing the results after the first 200," Cheskin wrote later, "but after 1,000, I had to accept that many of the consumers transferred sensations from the circles on a container cover ... to the contents of the container."<p>This principle of "sensation transference" has been confirmed repeatedly. In a test of a deodorant, one design actually caused subjects to develop skin rashes. Tide, the first heavy-duty synthetic detergent, introduced in 1947, came in a box designed by Donald Deskey Associates, but its principles are pure Cheskin. The only other well-known detergent on the market was Dreft, which was intended for delicate items and sold in an elegantly designed box. By contrast, Tide had to demonstrate its power. <p>Cheskin's beloved circles were used, concentric and incomplete at the outer edges. The shopper mentally completes the circle, making the box feel larger. The arresting, caustic orange and yellow express the power of the detergent, while the word Tide, floating in the foreground in reassuring blue, indicates the product's strength wouldn't be damaging. <p>The basic Tide design, which has been extended to liquid-detergent bottles and more compact box shapes, continues to be effective. "Tide tests as Sylvester Stallone," says Stan Gross, a psychological researcher who, among other things, encourages his subjects to compare products with fictional characters and movie stars. "It doesn't beg the question. It gets your clothes clean."<p>While all packages make products understandable, some make them urgently salable. For example, the products in the Gillette Series grooming line, including shave cream, razors, aftershave, and skin conditioner, come in ribbed, rounded, metallic-gray shapes, looking at once vaguely sexual and like precision engineering.<p>"We wanted the package to convey a premium, upscale, high-tech masculine look," says Robert Leger, vice-president of business management for Gillette toiletries. "Some of this had to do with sizing, how they feel in a man's hand versus a woman's hand, and with the pearlescent metal colors."<p>The striking appearance, along with a uniform pricing strategy, has encouraged retailers to display the more than 20 different items together, while those of Gillette's competitors are dispersed on various shelves. The point of the line, which took $75 million to develop, Leger says, was to increase the price Gillette and its retailers could charge for each product, given that our population is not increasing and there is little prospect for unit growth. "The strategy is working," Leger says. "We've gone from zero to $150 million a year in two-and-a-half years."<p>Innovation is a two-edged sword, though. Shoppers, studies suggest, are by nature conservative. "The things that people take home from the store become a part of their identities," says Davis Masten, head of Cheskin+Masten, a market-research firm. <p>The delicacy of this relationship is illustrated by the Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice Cocktail Refill, an innovative package that appeared doomed to failure but was saved by a single word. The product is an eight-ounce carton that features a picture of the more familiar 48-ounce Ocean Spray bottle. But this didn't make sense to consumers, who confused the concentrate package with a single-serving juice carton. Moreover, most people had not realized that the bottled juice was also made from concentrate. (That's spelled out in the small print.) They didn't buy.<p>The product was saved by the word refill. Matching the word to the picture of the bottle, shoppers, already accustomed to detergent and household-cleanser refills, felt reoriented and reassured. The product is now earning its place on supermarket shelves. "There's an element of manipulation in packaging," says Masten, "but what the game is really about is clarity."<p>Possibly, but clarity doesn't rule out complexity. Consider Tom's of Maine toothpaste, with its old-fashioned box and tube, pale colors, almost clumsy type, and copy listing every natural ingredient in the all-natural product. This package flatters potential purchasers with the suggestion that they are too sophisticated to be seduced by slick graphics and vibrant colors. Indeed, it hints that smart, discerning people aren't affected by packaging.<p>Of course, having put this bit of mass-market Maine into your cart, you've proved both propositions false. You may think you've picked substance, not packaging. But what you've bought is a package that's effective because it tells you, ever so subtly, exactly what you want to believe. <p><p>

Worth magazine/Features<p>DOES YOUR 401(K) MEASURE UP?<p>By Jeff Blyskal<p>Does your employer offer a 401(k) plan that will allow you to take care of yourself in old age? Or are you slaving for an outfit that still thinks Social Security will be around to protect retirees for decades to come?<p>To answer those questions, you need to look at three essential elements of your 401(k) plan. First, the amount of pretax earnings you are allowed to contribute. If your plan lets you kick in as much as the law permits, count yourself among the fortunate and make sure you take advantage of this option. Many plans let participants contribute only a fraction of the amount that's legally allowed.<p>Next, examine how much your employer chips in on your behalf. The best plans match employees' contributions dollar for dollar. The worst don't contribute a penny.<p>Finally, look critically at the investment choices available in your 401(k). Ideally, you should be able to choose from a number of options and construct a safe and well-balanced portfolio--not one that puts all of your savings in one pot, as some antiquated plans still require.<p>These are the variables we focused on as we evaluated the nation's 100 largest 401(k) plans. And these plans provide a good picture of the state of 401(k)s in 1995: With some $200 billion in total assets, they collectively account for nearly 40 percent of all the money invested in 401(k)s and cover an estimated 3 million employees.<p>Lately we've heard much talk about a trend toward improved 401(k) programs at many large companies. We did find some evidence of this in our reporting. Last summer, for instance, <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> made sweeping changes in its program, boosting the maximum employee contribution to 12 percent of salary from 9 percent and hiking the corporate match to 50 cents per employee dollar from 30 cents. "We always look at what other employers are doing and work to stay competitive," says IBM  spokesman Tom Beermann.<p>Nevertheless, the IBMs of the world remain few and far between. Many of the programs we checked up on were downright substandard; we deemed at least half deficient in one or more important respects. <p>Our rankings of the top 100 show how well each plan serves all of its members as a group. In some cases, plans may do a better job for participants with above-average incomes than they do for middle- or lower-income employees. Our ratings also don't account for other retirement-savings programs the employers may offer, such as pension or profit-sharing plans. A low grade on our list, therefore, doesn't necessarily mean that a company is a benefits scrooge. <p>But there's little excuse for bad marks, either. Regardless of what other retirement programs they provide, we don't think there's any reason that companies should prevent employees from taking advantage of the tax breaks allowed under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Service code. Our grading system, in fact, is quite generous on this score: A company program can earn a better than average final score even if it doesn't contribute a nickel to its 401(k) program itself. All it has to do is let employees contribute as much as they are allowed to under the law as well as provide them with a solid menu of investment options. At the moment, though, many employers fail to meet even this modest goal.<p>Our list of the biggest programs comes from Judy Diamond Associates, a Washington, D.C., research firm. To get up-to-date details about the structure and benefits of each plan, we went to the employers themselves. Eighty willingly cooperated, but 20 refused. So we turned to inside sources. We then supplemented whatever intelligence we were able to collect with data that all employers are required to file with the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor, and Securities and Exchange Commission. When we finally had everything we needed, we sent faxes to each of the 20 companies that had refused to help. In the end, ten of these declined to confirm our results. <p>Employee Contribution
we began our analysis with the premise that, because the IRS already restricts the total amount an employee can contribute to $9,240, there's no logical reason for plans to slap any additional handcuffs on participants. Many, however, do just that. <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a>, for instance, limits an employee's contribution to 8 percent of annual salary--which prevents most of the company's workers from reaching the IRS limit. Under the Philip Morris plan, a manager who earns $70,000 can defer no more than $5,600. That's $3,640 less than the IRS allows.<p>On average, the programs in our survey set a cap of 14.6 percent. Yet, according to our math, even that figure is too low. In order to allow a $45,000-a-year employee to contribute the maximum amount, the ceiling should be set no lower than 20 percent. Among the 100 plans we surveyed, only three companies--<a name="NYSE:JNJ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10824"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Johnson & Johnson</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:WX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11627"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Westinghouse</b></a>, and American Airlines--have caps this high.<p>Grading on the curve, we awarded the top three plans in our survey an A-plus for their performance in this area. We gave plans with 14 percent caps a C. Plans that limited contributions to less than 6 percent got an F. <p>Company Contribution
Most companies match a certain percentage of an employee's contribution. This obviously is an important wealth builder, and given the gradual demise of old-fashioned pension plans, it is often the biggest commitment a company makes to funding the retirement of its employees. Employer contributions aren't subject to any IRS limits.<p>On average, the top 100 plans we looked at contribute 66.4 cents for each dollar put in by their employees (26 of the plans we looked at match dollar for dollar). The average limit on employer contributions for the plans in our survey was 5.2 percent of annual salary. <p>Here again, we graded employers on the curve, giving A's and B's to plans that exceeded the average and assigning average or below-average plans C's, D's, and F's. We took off a full grade for plans in which all or part of the company's contributions is in the form of company stock--a practice we don't like because it restricts an employee's ability to diversify his or her portfolio.<p>Once we had these first two grades for the 100 plans--both dealing with contribution limits--we averaged the two to produce a total plan-structure grade. Here's what it means, in dollars, to participate in a plan with an A rating for contributions:  Diligent savers earning $60,000 annually can load as much as $64,200 into their 401(k)s in just five years. In contrast, a D-rated plan can limit an employee's 401(k) savings to as little as $22,500 over five years. Neither of these figures, of course, takes into account investment returns. <p>Investment Options
a meaningful menu here serves a crucial purpose. As a plan's account balance grows, the risk of investment losses is reduced if the assets are appropriately diversified. <p>The basic investment principles of asset allocation suggest that every plan should offer three options at the least: a diversified stock fund to provide a chance for high returns, a fixed-income fund (preferably investing in a diversified portfolio of bonds rather than guaranteed investment contracts) to give more stable returns, and a money market fund so the participant can get out of the markets if need be.<p>We didn't reward companies just for offering a plethora of choices. The Levi Strauss plan, for example, has eight options, but three of them are Fidelity balanced funds. That's overkill in one area, especially when there's no fixed-income option. <p>We awarded a C grade to plans that met our minimum standard of three choices. Surprisingly, 55 percent of the plans didn't meet even this commonsense level. In most cases, the plans lacked only one of these choices--typically a money fund--but the plans at MetLife, <a name="NYSE:XON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10537"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Exxon</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:WAG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11601"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Walgreen</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:ABT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10030"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Abbott Laboratories</b></a> were missing two.<p>We gave extra credit to plans that went beyond the basics and provided meaningful alternatives within the larger categories. In stock funds, for example, the best plans offered large-cap, small-cap, and international equities funds. On the fixed-income side they offered balanced, asset-allocation, and government-bond funds. <p>Under this system, a plan with nine meaningful options--all three basics and six of the extra-credit alternatives--got a perfect plan-choice grade: an A-plus. Only four plans--those from <a name="NYSE:BCC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10222"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Boise Cascade</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:UIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11548"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Unisys</b></a>, and the <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> salaried and hourly employees plans--scored this high. The plan-choice grade in the table shows how each employer measured up in the area of choice.<p>The final step in our analysis was to combine the plan-structure grade and the plan-choice grade to produce the overall plan grade by which the 100 plans were ranked. In general, the best plans allowed employees to plow lots of money into the plan and gave a relatively high number of meaningful investment choices. The worst plans did poorly on both counts.<p>What if your company's plan isn't large enough to be on our charts? Or suppose you want to know how well your plan serves you, as opposed to all of its participants? It should be simple enough to gather up some basic information about your plan. With that in hand, you can use averages from our list to evaluate your 401(k) and produce a letter grade. Turn to "Grading Your Own Plan" for details.<p>Employees, of course, can't choose their 401(k) plan. But neither are they stuck with whatever their company has thrown together. As investment vehicles go, this one is still young, says Ted Benna, president of the 401K Association, a group that advocates improvements in 401(k) plans. The plans are evolving. Many companies seem to be earnestly trying to find out and deliver what employees want, and they are making improvements. Now is the time to lobby for meaningful change.<p>Employers and employees alike need to recognize that a plan can be improved for relatively little or no cost. For example, a typical pension plan costs a company 4 to 6 percent of payroll, versus just 1.5 to 2 percent of payroll for a 401(k). Beefing up the pension plan by 50 percent would cost 2 to 3 percent of payroll; to do the same thing for the 401(k) would cost just 0.75 to 1 percent. Furthermore, some improvements, such as simply allowing employees to contribute a larger percent of salary, add virtually nothing to plan costs.<p>Companies also look over their shoulder at the benefits competitors are offering. It is no coincidence that Conoco, <a name="NYSE:AN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10108"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Amoco</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:TX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11458"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Texaco</b></a>, and Marathon Oil are bunched together near the top. They're competing for the same industry pool of employees. A good 401(k) plan is one lure. <p>----------------------------------<p>WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW CAN HURT YOU<p>Would you put $30,000 into a mutual fund without first understanding what you're investing in?  Of course not. Yet millions of workers with 401(k) plans do this all the time, making their investment choices with little or no information about their plan's objectives or the quality or safety of its holdings.<p>One reason for this: A quirk in federal securities law releases 401(k) plan sponsors, trustees, investment managers, and any other fiduciaries from normal disclosure obligations. No prospectuses, annual reports, or financial statements are required. "If a 401(k) plan is using pooled investments run by a private money manager or in-house, those funds would not be in our database, because we can't get information about them--there's no access," says Paul Reis, an analyst at Morningstar, the mutual fund rating and data firm. More than 80 percent--or $438 billion--of all 401(k) assets reside in such pooled investments. <p>How could almost a half-trillion dollars in 401(k) assets have slipped through the regulatory cracks? Blame the U.S. Department of Labor, which has jurisdiction over corporate pension investments but hasn't kept pace with industry trends. In a 1992 study, then-SEC chairman Richard Breeden recommended that Congress eliminate the disclosure exemption for pooled-investment vehicles servicing 401(k) plans, among others. The SEC also suggested that employees receive prospectuses and semiannual and annual reports about the underlying investments. <p>Sound as it was, Breeden's take-charge approach violated bureaucratic etiquette. "Breeden was not afraid to step on anyone's toes, and the Labor Department saw the recommendations as a turf issue," says a government source with knowledge of the episode. "The current chairman [Arthur Levitt] is more willing to work with other regulators." So last year, Levitt and Labor Secretary Robert Reich met to find a more tactful solution. Eventually, the two agencies agreed to work with the Employee Benefit Research Institute on a survey aimed at learning what kind of information and educational materials 401(k) plan sponsors are giving participants.<p>Richard Hinz, a Labor Department research director, says he has "no idea what we'll find." Experts in the private sector, however, already know. "The information employees are getting is absolutely atrocious," says Tom Schlossberg, president and CEO of Diversified Investment Advisors, a registered investment advisor serving pension-plan sponsors. "In many companies, plan participants deal with someone in the HR office who knows little more than the participant does about investing and is frightened about giving any advice."<p>Some companies aren't waiting for the government to figure out what to do. The <a name="NASD:TOYOY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41889"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toyota Motor</b></a> Manufacturing U.S.A. 401(k) plan gives its members prospectuses on its two publicly traded mutual fund investment options, a prospectus on the <a name="FUND:AETBX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/AETBX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Aetna Bond Fund</b></a> investment pool, and a detailed, reader-friendly prospectus-type booklet explaining the <a name="FUND:INEAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/INEAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IDS Trust Income Fund</b></a>. MassMutual provides concise two-page profiles of its separate bond and equity accounts, giving sufficient information for those interested in only a quick read; investors who want more detailed information about these institutional funds can get a 20-page prospectus. <p>-------------------------------------<p>GRADING YOUR OWN PLAN<p>We rated the top 100 401(k) programs based on how well they serve all of the participants in each plan. Nevertheless, if your employer's plan isn't on our list or if your income is well above average, the scores won't apply to you personally. The worksheet below shows how to grade your plan yourself. All you need is some basic information, a few averages from our study, and a calculator. You'll start by computing a plan-structure score, go on to calculate a plan-option score, and then average the two to get an overall grade.<p>PLAN-STRUCTURE SCORE
1. Write down the maximum percentage the plan allows you to contribute. (For example, 0.07.) _________
2. Multiply your annual salary by this amount. (For example, $100,000x0.07 would be $7,000.)  Write the result here.__________
3. Divide this number by $9,240, the maximum amount the IRS allows employees to contribute to a 401(k) plan. (So that's $7,000/$9,240, or 0.76. Write the result here._________
4. Next, write down the percentage of your contribution your employer matches. (For example, if your employer matches each of your dollars with 75 cents, write 0.75.) ________ 
5. Multiply that number by the maximum percentage of your salary that your employer will match. (For example, 0.75x6 percent comes to 4.5.) This is your match value. ________ 
6. Divide your match value by 3.66, the average in our survey. (4.5/3.66, or 1.23 in this example.) ________
7. Subtract 0.1 from that score if your employer matches your contribution in company stock instead of cash._________ 
8. Last, to benchmark your company's score against those in our survey, divide that result by the best dollar-match value in our study: 2.23. Write that number here. __________
9. The average of the maximum contribution figure (no. 3) and the match value (no. 8) is your plan's structure score. _______ Multiply by 100 to convert this into a whole number. <p>PLAN-OPTION SCORE
10. Give your plan a 75 (a C on our scale) to start. Subtract 10 points if your plan doesn't offer a money market fund, 10 more if your plan doesn't offer a diversified stock fund, and 10 more if it doesn't offer a fixed-income fund. Company stock doesn't earn any credit here. The lowest your plan can earn in this part of the scoring is a 45. Then add points if, besides the basic stock fund, your plan offers an international fund, a large-cap fund, or a small-cap fund. Give your plan 4 points for one option, 10 points for two, and 14 points for all three. Do the same with bond funds beyond the basic option, awarding 4, 10, and 14 points for plans with balanced funds, asset-allocation funds, and government-bond funds. This is your plan's option score. Write that number here. _______ <p>OVERALL SCORE
11. To calculate your plan's overall score, simply average the structure (no. 9) and option (no. 10) scores. _________<p>LETTER GRADES
To convert each score to a letter grade, follow these last three steps. 
12. Your plan's structure grade will be the structure score______ divided by 79 and multiplied by 100.
13. Your plan's choice grade will be the option score________divided by 103 and multiplied by 100.
14. Your plan's overall grade will be the overall score______ divided by 77 and multiplied by 100.<p>And in case you've forgotten the old grade-school scale: 
A+ 100-97, A 96-93, A- 92-90, B+ 89-87, B 86-83, B- 82-80, C+ 79-77, C 76-73, C- 72-70, D+ 69-67, D 66-63, D- 62-60, F 60 and below.<p><p>

						A company has caught your eye, and you want to conduct due diligence before deciding whether to invest. From your home office, the obvious solution is to use an online data service, but which provides the best and most cost-effective information?<p>We asked Van Kasper, a San Franciscobased stock picker, to suggest a fast-growing, somewhat obscure company for us to research. Kasper chose Odwalla Inc., a maker of fruit and vegetable juices virtually unknown outside the San Francisco Bay area. Kasper's firm, Van Kasper & Co., helped underwrite Odwalla's initial public offering.<p>Three sessions on Prodigy provided progressively more data, ultimately yielding a detailed three-page report and a one-year price history--for under five bucks. We learned that Odwalla, based in Davenport, California, operates primarily in Northern California and Washington and that sales rose 60 percent in the quarter ended last November, to $6.3 million. The company made a net profit of $126,000 for the quarter, versus a year-earlier loss of $89,000. The stock was over $16, up from $10.25 in November.<p>The report listed the company's top officers, address, phone number, various financials, return on equity, and a comparison of Odwalla's performance against industry averages. Hambrecht & Quist Group, an aggressive San Francisco investment bank, was listed as owning 19 percent of the company, which it took public in December 1993.<p>Like Prodigy, <a name="NASD:AMER"></a><b>America Online</b> offered an easy-to-use quote service, and its free Hoover's Company Profiles lists 7,300 companies, though not Odwalla. Hoover's reports are comparable to Prodigy's but contain less financial detail.<p>AOL had a Business Week story that included Kasper's forecast that Odwalla's earnings would rise from 12 cents a share in the last fiscal year (ended August 1994) to 30 cents this year and 50 cents next year. Investor's Daily, also on AOL, had an article describing Odwalla founder Greg Steltenpohl as a former artist who said he is "learning to respect the fruit." The article mentioned Odwalla's recent acquisitions of juice companies in Denver and Bellingham, Washington, and said the company is "building a fanatically loyal following that other juice makers lack." ID said the company was expanding its product line and aggressively marketing the health benefits of its drinks. The San Jose Mercury News, which runs its own Mercury Center on AOL, had the interesting news that Hambrecht & Quist had sold several thousand Odwalla shares.<p>All the AOL data was free, save the $9.95 monthly charge. Not so with <a name="NASD:CSRV"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=43062"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CompuServe</b></a>, except for a bare-bones rundown of Odwalla through the business report service. A search of CompuServe's premium services revealed that Odwalla's stock is rated a moderate long-term buy by Vestor, an online stock-advisory service. IBES, a company that compiles earnings estimates from Wall Street brokerage houses, forecast earnings in line with Kasper. We downloaded three Dun & Bradstreet reports for $22.50 and found them less detailed than the $3.95 Prodigy report. For $17 we could have obtained the company's financial statements from Disclosure Inc., which puts Securities and Exchange Commission documents online. Another $25 buys a list of major Odwalla stockholders. InvesText, which puts stock analyst reports online, charges $20 to search for a report and $20 for each one downloaded (brokerage houses give these away). But most of what we needed was in the Prodigy material.<p>CompuServe also archives dozens of California newspapers, from which we learned that by 1989, the earliest article date, Odwalla offered its employees 100 percent health and dental insurance, flexible workweeks, time-off programs, hot lunches, and a music festival, and used recycled plastics.<p>The company was founded in 1980 when Steltenpohl bought a $225 juicer to sell fresh-squeezed orange juice to restaurants in Santa Cruz. By December 1993, when it went public, Odwalla had a 65,000-square-foot plant in the San Joaquin Valley and was selling juice through supermarkets, health-food stores, and restaurants. Its product line had grown to more than 25 all-natural juices. The articles also described a lot of volatility. Odwalla lost $427,000 in 1993, made $39,000 in 1992, and lost $895,000 in 1991.<p>We left CompuServe richer in information but dazed by the pricing system. Each service charges differently; one may charge $45 an hour to search for information, and the next will charge per search or per report. Our cost--$42 plus the $9.95 monthly fee--could have been much higher. <p>Our final stop was Dow Jones News/Retrieval, with articles from more than 1,400 publications. We limited our search to the Wall Street Journal and the Dow Jones News Wire, finding six articles that added little to what we already knew. In one story, however, a dietitian questioned why one Odwalla serving provided several times the recommended daily amount of key vitamins, as claimed. Our Dow search took just four minutes but cost $37. Searching further could add hundreds in no time, making the service practical only if your budget is unlimited.<p>After our investigation, we knew a fair amount about Odwalla's history, leadership, products, and prospects, enough to make an informed investment decision. Prodigy provided the best value; its company profile and a new Homework Helper research tool put it a bit ahead of CompuServe and AOL. CompuServe, the most comprehensive of the three, was also by far the most expensive. None of them is truly comprehensive, so the wisest strategy at present is to cover yourself by subscribing to more than one service. <p><p>

						April 1995 
Worth magazine/Advisor<p>BLEACHING OUT THE LEMON LAWS<p>By Jeff Wuorio<p>The shiny car sitting on the dealer's lot looks like a bargain: It's not brand-new, but it's close, with just a few thousand miles on the odometer and a demo sign on the windshield. The price clinches it__thousands less than the same model new.<p>Watch out: The car might be a mechanical basket case, a product of what's known as "lemon laundering."<p>Lemon laundering occurs when auto dealers knowingly sell defective used cars to consumers. Automobile watchdog groups say auto manufacturers also buy back defective cars from their owners, then auction them off, unrepaired, to unsuspecting dealers.<p>In 1990, Gayle and Gregory Pena of Mesa, Arizona, nearly crashed when the brakes failed on their 1989 Chevrolet Suburban. They had bought the car secondhand for $22,000 from Biddulph Chevrolet in Santa Rosa, California, which had assured them that the car had been driven for a short time by a <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> executive. In fact, the Penas discovered it had been repaired 22 times in its brief life and sued GM and the Biddulph dealership. Biddulph's attorney, Houston Tuel, says, "Biddulph's knowledge of the car's history was quite limited." The dealership and GM settled the case in 1991 for an undisclosed amount. <p>According to estimates derived from state reports of legal actions related to faulty cars posted by the Center for Auto Safety in Washington, D.C., car owners return more than 100,000 defective autos each year. Federal law mandates that dealers must fix these lemons (a term used to suggest the taste they leave owners) and/or disclose to the buyer the car's condition at point of sale__or scrap them if they prove to be irreparable. <p>However, both the Center for Auto Safety and Motor Voters, a Sacramento, California, group that has lobbied for consumer car laws for 16 years, believe more dealers than ever before are selling these lemons. They base their conclusions on the rising number of cases filed by state attorneys general and departments of motor vehicles against automakers allegedly engaging in this practice. Says Rosemary Shahan, president of Motor Voters: "Lemon laundering is becoming rampant. Any time anybody investigates, they find hundreds of cases. And the cases that we know about are just the tip of the iceberg."<p>According to records from consumer-protection, motor-vehicle, and attorneys-general offices in New York, California, and Pennsylvania, one of the biggest culprits is <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler Corporation</b></a>. In 1988, Robert Abrams, then New York State attorney general, accused Chrysler of surreptitiously reselling lemons through dealerships to about 400 people statewide. Abrams said Chrysler provided neither the buyers nor the state Department of Motor Vehicles written notice of the cars' lemon histories. Admitting no guilt, Chrysler agreed to refund $2 million in cash and offered extended service contracts to these individuals. <p>In 1989, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Consumer Protection fined Chrysler $35,000 for laundering 170 defective vehicles through state dealers. And late last year, the California Department of Motor Vehicles filed a complaint with the state Office of Administrative Hearings against Chrysler for selling 118 lemons without informing buyers about a variety of problems, including faulty steering.<p>Although the cars had been bought as lemons by dealers at auction, buyers were not informed of this until state officials stepped in. The case awaits a hearing in a state administrative law court. Karen Stewart, a spokeswoman for Chrysler, says: "Everyone who bought one of those vehicles knew exactly what it was. It is our policy to disclose to the purchaser the history of the vehicle and why it was repurchased."<p>In April 1994, GM paid $330,000 to the California DMV consumer-protection fund after the DMV accused both the company and 34 GM dealers of trying to lemon-launder 51 cars in Northern California. GM spokesman Albert J. Thomas Jr. says the company has a 100 percent disclosure policy on all used cars and denies it engages in lemon laundering.<p>Consumers can't always rely on state authorities to protect them. To date, 35 states have enacted lemon-laundering laws. Both the Center for Auto Safety and Motor Voters, however, say manufacturers routinely transport lemons to more lenient states to circumvent these statutes. A 1994 California state study also found automakers often repurchase lemons just prior to legal action or arbitration and then resell them. <p>To spot a car that's been lemon-laundered, ask to see its service records from the dealer. If they're not available, don't buy the car. Shahan says buyers should allow at least 10,000 miles a year on a used car; anything less could mean odometer tampering. Also, if you live in one of the 35 states that require dealers to provide disclosure statements on a car's condition, ask to review those records as well. If you aren't fully confident about the condition of a car you want to buy or already own, conduct a title search at the local DMV office for the previous owner, as did the Penas.<p><p>

						February 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> SHOPPING FOR PLASTIC MONEY <p>Choose a credit card wisely by avoiding these come-ons  <p> By Monica Corcoran  <p> Americans sure love their credit cards. Total card debt reached $327.7 billion in October 1994, an increase of 16.6 percent since October 1993, according to the Federal Reserve. But what looks like a borrowing binge to economists is still a starvation diet to credit card issuers, who want more consumers to feast on evermore plastic. This explains the blizzard of credit card offers now piling up in mailboxes. According to Behavior Analysis, a credit card consulting firm in Tarrytown, New York, issuers sent out 1.2 billion solicitations between January and June 1994; 20 million consumers took the bait. But credit card offers loaded with perks often pale when put under a microscope. To start 1995 off right, be extra careful when you see one of these come-ons: <p> SEEMINGLY LOW RATES. About three quarters of all new cards issued each year carry teaser rates--low initial interest charges that begin to rise in a relatively short time. Last May, <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> urged borrowers to transfer debt to its 9.9 percent variable-rate Mastercard. Associates/Unocal now offers a 7.6 percent variable-rate card. Problem: issuers can hike rates suddenly. Just weeks after GM introduced its card, it upped its rate to 11.15 percent. After six months, the rate on the Associates/Unocal card zooms to prime (currently 8.5 percent) plus 10.9 percent.  <p> FREE FREQUENT-FLIER MILES. United, American, and <a name="NYSE:CAI.A"></a><b>Continental</b> are now urging their cardholders to get a free mile for every dollar charged. But these deals work best for folks who charge big and pay up each month (68 percent of cardholders carry a balance). Since most frequent-flier deals require 25,000 miles for a free ticket, it will take the typical spender with annual average charges of $2,200 at least ten years to earn a ticket, according to a 1994 study by Bankcard Holders of America. The study also says cardholders who carry the average annual balance of $1,100 on a Continental card would spend $264 yearly in interest, which does not go toward the free ticket.  <p> CASH BACK ON INTEREST CHARGES. Mellon Cornerstone MasterCard will return interest payments to those who use its prime-plus-8.9-percent card, so long as they use it at least once a year and carry a balance. But after two years, just 10 percent of interest fees is refunded, with an additional 5 percent tacked on each year thereafter. According to the deal, a cardholder must wait 20 years to recover costs.  <p> REBATES. The Discover Card's 17.4 percent annual interest rate carries a 1 percent rebate on all charges. Cardholders get a check back from Discover at year end. CoreStates Bank and US West Banks also offer rebate deals. Drawback: These lures often carry high spending thresholds. Discover Card holders must accumulate $3,001 in charges before receiving the full 1 percent; according to RAM Research, a credit cardtracking firm in Frederick, Maryland, most Discover Card holders charge about $1,000 and get back 0.25 percent, or a piddling $2.50. Says Robert McKinley, editor of RAM Research's Card Trak newsletter: "The interest rates on these cards are very high" and often wipe out rebates if a balance is carried.  <p> INTEREST-FREE GRACE PERIOD. Nearly every card touts a 25-day grace period during which interest payments on earlier charges are waived. But a closer look at the application's disclosure box reveals that balance-toting cardholders can get stung if their issuer calculates interest through the average daily balance method, which means interest charges toll daily on outstanding balances.  <p>  <p>THE BEST CARDS FOR 1995  <p> AFBA Industrial Bank (800-776-2265)  <p>Rate: Prime plus 2.9 percent for the first year, prime plus 6 percent thereafter. No annual fee.  <p> <a name="NYSE:CMB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10322"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chase Manhattan</b></a>/British Airways (800-955-2748)  <p>Sign-up bonus of 4,000 miles. One mile for each dollar charged, a five-year redemption period, and high annual cap of 80,000 miles makes this card the best frequent-flier deal. Its maximum rate is prime plus 10.9 percent.  <p> Diners Club (800-234-6377)  <p>Frequent-flier miles, free collision coverage on car rentals, and free luggage insurance. You get two months to pay in full; after that, you pay a $20 late fee plus 2.5 percent on the balance. Annual fee: $80.  <p> GE Rewards MasterCard (800-437-3927)  <p>A rebate card that returns 1 percent cash on  purchases over $2,000 annually. Rate is 16 percent; no annual fee.   <p> The GM Card (800-846-2273)  <p>Five percent rebate on purchases toward leasing or buying a GM auto. Rebate maxes at $500 annually on standard card, $1,000 on the gold. Deal lasts for seven years. Maximum rate is prime plus 10.4 percent, with a $39 annual fee.  <p> USAA Gold Card (800-922-9092)  <p>Rate is the yield on a three-month T bill plus 7 percent. No annual fee.  <p> Wachovia Bank (800-842-3262)  <p>Rate: Prime for the first year, then prime plus 3.9 percent. Annual fee: $18; $28 for gold.  <p><p>

Software for testing both portfolios and theories.<p>By Jim Jubak<p>Rather than fiddle with pencil and paper, investors are increasingly relying on computers and portfolio-tracking programs to keep tabs on their investments. In the process, some also are discovering another nifty use for these software tools: testing hypothetical portfolios.<p>To illustrate how this can be done, we turned to Captool, a $129 program from Techserve (800-826-8082). The price is somewhat expensive for a portfolio tracker (though not Techserve's most expensive), but the program has built a loyal following among active investors who rely on its ability to show exactly what part of a position in an individual stock was sold on a specific date. <p>A less expensive version of the software, PFROI ($59), is also available, but it doesn't include one feature that we wanted to sample: a stock-evaluator function that lets users analyze securities based on their fundamentals. To test Captool, we employed the portfolio of the 50 new blue-chip stocks recommended in Worth's June 1994 issue.<p>Running a "what if" exercise is possible only if the designers of the investment portfolio to be tested state explicit investment goals. For a large-cap stock portfolio, the objective might be to outperform the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the Standard & Poor's 500 index. For a portfolio of smaller stocks, the benchmark might be the Russell 2000. <p>Investors also need to account for the portfolio's intended risk level. Portfolios that are riskier than a benchmark index can often outperform that index over some time periods because of the added risk. If that's the case with your portfolio, it's important to know that and factor it into your thinking. This wasn't an issue with the Worth blue-chip portfolio. We designed it to beat the Russell 1000 while taking on less risk. <p>We wanted to know if Captool could tell us whether our portfolio has been achieving the goals we set for it. At the time of our test, the portfolio was only a few months old -- hardly enough time to establish a very substantive track record. Nevertheless, one advantage of Captool is that it lets users pick virtually any time frame they want. We could, for example, have tested this portfolio to see how it would have done in 1993, or we could have chosen some specific up or down market from recent history. <p>For the purposes of the test, we focused on the six-week period that began May 20 (the first day a subscriber could have read about the portfolio in Worth and gone out and bought the stocks) and ended July 1. <p>Some of those weeks showed exactly the kind of downward volatility most likely to test the risk level of the Worth 50. During the week of June 20, for example, the Dow Jones industrials declined on four of the five trading days, dropping 34.88, 33.93, 25.68, and 62.15 points. The market advanced 16.80 during the one positive session. <p>We started by entering hypothetical buys of $5,000 for each stock into the transactions function of Captool. The process was easy and relatively straightforward: For each stock we created a single transaction record that included the price at the time of our hypothetical purchase. The program's use of stock symbols rather than full company names made input less time-consuming. (The symbols then let us download daily prices electronically from Compuserve via modem. The program can also use electronic prices from Dial/Data, Dow Jones News/Retrieval, and GEnie.) That gave us a starting portfolio, based on May 20 prices, worth $250,000. (Had we factored in the costs of brokerage commissions, the portfolio would have been valued at approximately $247,250.)<p>Then, moving to a function called valuation, we downloaded prices for July 1. The result: Portfolio losses of slightly more than 0.6 percent in the period, or $1,592. The S&P 500 and the Russell 1000, two indexes that represent the size of companies in our portfolio and the universe of our original sample, declined 1.9 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively. In a down market, the Worth portfolio behaved exactly as designed.<p>We also decided to see if Captool could help us find the ideal time to purchase individual stocks. Back when we published our story about the Worth 50, we urged investors to buy the stocks only when their prices were within a certain range. To set this level, we used a formula that considered relative dividend yield, earnings-growth rate, and historic price-to-earnings ratio.<p>Captool's valuation function made it easy to group the 50 stocks into categories that corresponded to our original timeliness ratings (stated as a scale of one to three stars, with three stars indicating the most timely buys). We could then check to see what had happened to the price of each stock since we made the original recommendation. For example, we rated <a name="NYSE:FDO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10546"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Family Dollar Stores</b></a> as a two-star stock. Since then, however, Captool told us that the stock's price had declined to $13.63 a share from $15.63 during our test period. Family Dollar was now more of a bargain -- and thus ready for an upgrade to three stars.<p>Over time, of course, an investor following a portfolio needs to be able to update fundamental statistics on each company as well. Here we found Captool's share-evaluator function disappointing. It lets an investor generate a spreadsheet for each stock that includes revenues, earnings, and dividends per share -- plus beta, a standard risk measurement that our portfolio didn't employ. But we don't think that's enough information to make a proper evaluation. Moreover, because the program doesn't provide an electronic source for downloading fundamental data, all this information must be researched from other sources and then entered by hand. Given these limitations, we felt that it probably isn't worth paying the extra $70 for Captool just to get this function. At $59, PRFOI does everything else. The more expensive cousin still leaves the fundamental investor at his desk with pencil and paper. <p><p><p>

You're in a good mood, but is the stock market?<p>By Alvin H. Danenberg<p>Warren Buffett once observed that the stock market often behaves like a manic-depressive businessman. At the peak of his mania he sees only favorable factors affecting his business, and therefore he prices shares outlandishly high. At the nadir of his depression he expects to be bankrupted at any moment, sometimes lowering the price on his concern below its liquidation value. This wide range of behavior has little to do with reality, which remains unchanged. Only the businessman's -- or the market's -- grasp on reality changes.<p>How does an investor know whether the market is in an ebullient or a morose mood? By checking out the value ratio, an indicator that helps identify the temperament of the market. <p>To figure the value ratio, simply divide the price of the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index by the amount of dividends that group of stocks paid to shareholders during the prior 52 weeks. Walter J. Rouleau, editor of Growth Fund Guide, an investment newsletter about no-load mutual funds, coined the term value ratio in 1981 to identify this indicator.<p>The meaning of the ratio lies not in any claim to infallibility; like all market systems, an investment strategy based solely on the value ratio is foolish indeed. But being mindful of where the ratio stands now can give investors a clue to where the market may be headed in the near term. In midsummer the value ratio stood at over 34, which is considered high. Since 1871, in fact, the ratio has exceeded 34 -- equal to a dividend yield on the S&P 500 of 2.9 percent -- only 7 times. Conversely, the ratio has fallen below 16 -- equal to a dividend yield of 6.3 percent on the S&P 500 -- only 11 times.<p>As for the meaning of this high value ratio, history offers the following: When the ratio rises above 34, the S&P on average has lost 41.2 percent of its value before bottoming out. On the other hand, when the ratio falls below 16, the S&P has risen an average of 240 percent before hitting its next top.<p>For investors who are committed to stocks for the long haul -- five years or more -- the value ratio can be quite useful when applied to the timing of purchases and sales of no-load mutual funds. When the value ratio exceeds 34, sell equity funds and buy into short-term bond funds or money market funds. When the ratio equals or shrinks below its historical mean -- 23, or equivalent to an S&P 500 dividend yield of 4.3 percent -- shift into equity funds. In extreme depression, when the value ratio languishes below 16, switch a portion into aggressive-growth funds. In the bull market that will probably follow, these funds will be the right place to be. As for short-term investors, the current high value ratio suggests that the best bets are short-term bond or money market funds.<p>Tracking and responding to value ratio won't make you as successful an investor as Warren Buffett. It's not an exact science, nor is it a comprehensive strategy. However, value ratio is a good reality check on overall equity prices, which can get carried away on the upside as well as on the down, and it provides an objective check against an investor's intuitive notions of market overvaluation and undervaluation. <p>If nothing else, consulting the value ratio will enhance your probability of success in up markets and reduce the probability of being wiped out in declines. It's just one of many indicators to consider, but it shouldn't be overlooked. <p><p>

What every investor should know about reading a financial statement. Second in a two-part series. (Part one appeared in the June 1994 issue of Worth.)<p>By Jonathan Burton<p>The infamous accounting high jinks that took place at a company called MiniScribe back in the late 1980s fooled even the sharpest of accountants. The computer-disk-drive maker, run by Quentin Thomas Wiles, a well-known turnaround artist, appeared to be flying high in 1987. With the company racking up record sales and earnings, the stock reached an all-time peak of $18.25 a share in May of that year.<p>Unfortunately, MiniScribe's books were a complete fiction. As detailed in a 1991 complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company had counted unsold product as revenue. Employees had even gone so far as to place bricks in cardboard cartons and ship them as finished disk drives. In 1988, MiniScribe's directors, alarmed by the company's mounting accounts receivables and inventories, launched an investigation. After they discovered the ruse, Wiles resigned. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1990. By then, the company's stock had dropped to 25 cents a share.<p>As the MiniScribe case shows, even audited financial numbers don't always mean what they seem to mean. But that's no excuse for tossing out your calculator, either. Although it isn't possible to catch everything, investors should still closely examine the public financial data that companies publish. Important signals are often there to be spotted. Are earnings as strong as the company has been boasting? Will the trend continue? Or are there unexpected land mines on the road ahead?<p>Last month, Worth reviewed three lines on a financial statement that help answer these questions -- accounts receivables, inventory, and gross margin. We also gave examples to show how an investor who knew what to look for could uncover trouble before it was too late. This month, we return to the subject by dissecting three other important items: expenses, quality of earnings, and depreciation. Understanding all six items should provide a solid start for any investor who wants to perform due diligence on a stock. The payoff is often well worth it, as the following examples show.<p><p>EXPENSES:
The inner Chambers<p>As the decade began, Chambers Development had all the clear markings of a stock to own for the '90s. In 1991, the developer and operator of landfills, based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, reported that earnings rose 45 percent, to $49.9 million, or 83 cents a share. Net sales approached $322 million, a tenfold increase from just five years earlier. This growth was powered by the acquisition and rapid development of new landfills.<p>Wall Street did not let this performance go unnoticed. Brokerage-firm analysts widely recommended the company through most of the year, and its stock began to rise in price, leaping from $16.13 in January 1991 to $37 a year later. Yet, on March 17, 1992, in a tersely worded statement, Chambers revealed that its profit growth had been overstated. As it turned out, the highly profitable company was not so profitable after all. In October 1992 Chambers restated income for 1991 and several prior years, wiping out $362 million in earnings and retained earnings.<p>What happened? The rapidly expanding company had been spending money to buy and develop land for future landfills and had recorded the costs as capital expenses. In other words, it treated these costs as money spent to create long-lived assets. That had the effect of pushing a substantial portion of these expenses into the future, rather than treating them as current costs to be charged against income.<p>This can be a murky area in accounting. Typically, companies and accountants say that anything that is used up in a period is an expense that should be deducted immediately from the bottom line. Nevertheless, as the stockholders of Chambers would learn, the company had been capitalizing items that clearly should have been treated as ordinary expenses, things such as, as the company's statement says, "executive administration, public affairs, and financial services." <p>In the wake of the March 1992 disclosure, Wall Street trashed the garbage-processing company. On March 18, the price of Chambers's class A shares fell more than 60 percent, closing at $11.13 a share from $30.50 the day before. Shareholders sued, and the dust still hasn't settled. A company spokesman declined comment on the matter.<p>Was there a way an investor could have seen this coming and jettisoned the stock before it got crunched?<p>Chambers reported in its annual statements that it capitalized costs, but all companies do that. Few companies, however, capitalize costs to the extent that Chambers did -- a fact ignored in the management discussion that accompanied the company's financial statements. But there were other clues.<p>Tucked near the bottom of Chambers's balance sheet under the heading "other assets" is a line called "deferred costs." This nebulous category is often a dumping ground for expenses that companies want to delay. "Whenever you see an asset called 'deferred anything,' hold on to your pocketbook," says Loren Kellogg, publisher of Financial Statement Alert, which analyzes companies and their accounting methods. <p>In Chambers's report for the quarter ended September 30, 1991, filed with the SEC on November 8, deferred costs totaled $32.7 million. This number was 32 percent higher than it had been a year earlier, when deferred costs amounted to $24.8 million.<p>Investors curious about what costs were being deferred could have found some cursory answers in a footnote to the 1990 annual report. Deferred costs, the company said, included "development costs for waste collection and security guard service contracts." It added that these expenses were being spread over three to ten years. Security-guard contracts? Remember, this is a category on the balance sheet that is supposed to describe long-lived assets. <p>Another reason for investors to worry was the sheer size of these charges compared with Chambers's earnings, which totaled $35.3 million in the first nine months of 1991. Had the company charged the entire $32.7 million in deferred costs against current earnings, its net income would have been only $2.6 million.<p>Moreover, Chambers's deferred expenses were rising at a rate that eclipsed the 22 percent growth in the company's revenue. This is important to note because, as Greg Drahuschak, first vice president at the Pittsburgh branch of brokerage house Janney Montgomery Scott, explains, "If the revenues don't continue, eventually you're going to have earnings difficulty because the [deferred] expenses are going to come home to roost." <p>In a healthy company, revenue growth usually should match or surpass growth in deferred costs. If not, then the company could be understating current expenses and padding its bottom line. As long as revenue increases, a company has a good chance of keeping this ball in the air. But a dip in growth can bring the ball crashing down. No investor wants to be there when that happens.<p><p>QUALITY OF EARNINGS:
The lesson of <a name="NASD:EAIN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16075"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Education Alternatives</b></a><p>In July 1992, the Baltimore City School District took a radical step in an effort to revive eight of its public elementary schools and one middle school. It hired Education Alternatives, a young Minneapolis-based company, to manage them. Under the five-year contract, the school board agreed to pay the company what it would have spent to run the schools -- $27 million per year, or about $5,550 for each child enrolled. In return, the company promised to spruce up the schools, cut class sizes, and improve teaching methods. Profits, the company claimed, would come from the efficiencies it could bring to public education.<p>At the time, Wall Street viewed Education Alternatives as a company poised to ride a crest of civic displeasure over public schools. The company itself certainly didn't discourage this view. "The potential for the future success of Education Alternatives continues to be phenomenal," chairman and chief executive John Golle wrote shareholders in the company's 1993 annual report. <p>This optimism, incidentally, was also reflected in a story in Worth's December 1993 issue. "EAI is a good long-term speculative buy," we wrote in an article about companies that promise to improve the world.<p>The company's financial statements also painted a rosy picture. For its fiscal year ended June 1993, Education Alternatives reported earnings of $1.1 million, or 18 cents a share, against a loss of $1.5 million a year earlier. In response, investors bid up shares last November to a 52-week high of $48.75. At that lofty price, the company had a market value of more than $300 million.<p>Then the bottom dropped out. This spring, the price of Education Alternatives stock plummeted, falling to as low as $9.75 a share before rebounding to around $15 a share in mid-May. <p>Despite the suddenness of this drop, investors who had continued reading Education Alternatives' financial statements could have seen the roller-coaster ride coming before it was too late.<p>Keep in mind that a stock's price, especially the price of a share in a young, hot growth company, is influenced more than anything else by its earnings and expected earnings. Investors need to know not only the amount of the earnings, but also where they are coming from and how reliable they are. <p>On November 15, 1993, Education Alternatives filed its quarterly report for the period ended September 30, 1993 with the SEC. Among other things, this document disclosed that the company had earned $330,000, or 4 cents a share. This was a sharp reversal from a year-earlier loss of $186,000. But an investor who probed just a little further could have discovered that the day-to-day operations of Education Alternatives were still actually losing money -- to the tune of $383,000 during the quarter. This number was listed under the line "operating loss" in the company's financial statements.<p>So how was it that Education Alternatives had been able to report a profit? Looking at a section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" would have revealed that Education Alternatives had received $728,000 in investment income from the proceeds of a May 1993 public stock offering. In other words, its profit had come largely from investors -- not as the result of any improvement in its operations.<p>In the absence of any earnings from operations, an investor might wisely ask whether the company's high stock price was justified on other grounds, such as revenue growth. But here, again, there was reason to suspect that Wall Street had overvalued Education Alternatives.<p>Yes, the company had signed service contracts for big numbers like $27 million. But a $27 million service contract isn't the same as $27 million of revenue generated by a company selling a product. For one thing, a service contract can be canceled on short notice -- 90 days in the case of Education Alternatives' arrangement with the Baltimore schools. For another, Education Alternatives was passing most of this revenue on to pay such things as salaries for teachers previously paid by the school system. It could count this money on its own books, but it wasn't as if the company had actually done something to create this revenue. The teachers, still technically employees of the school system, were the ones doing that. "That's not revenue," contends Howard Schilit, an accounting professor at American University and author of Financial Shenanigans: How to Detect Accounting Gimmicks and Fraud in Financial Reports. "Revenue is what they earn by providing their consulting service."<p>Education Alternatives may yet become a major force in an emerging new industry, charged with reforming the nation's public schools. But Wall Street clearly jumped the gun on the company's stock, bidding it up to heights justified by neither the company's earnings -- of which there were none -- nor its revenue growth -- which was less substantial than it appeared to be.<p>The lesson: When it comes to earnings, understand how a company is counting its chickens. If the bulk of its net income is from sources other than the business itself, the company should be asked how it plans to turn this onetime gain into long-term performance. If the bulk of the revenue could disappear when a single customer walks out the door, an investor needs to decide how that risk should be figured into the price of the stock. If the company counts revenue differently from the typical company, an investor should ask hard questions about why. If a company can't provide convincing answers, it's probably because there aren't any.<p><p>DEPRECIATION:
A distorted image for <a name="AMEX:AMS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11714"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Shared</b></a><p>Why buy when you can rent? That was the premise behind an innovative San Francisco-based company called American Shared Hospital Services: Offer mobile magnetic-resonance-imaging machines and other diagnostic equipment on a shared basis.<p>Doctors and hospitals rushed to sign up. In 1990 total revenues hit $61.5 million, up from $42.1 million two years before.<p>Finally, the company, which had gone public in 1984, looked ready to soar. True, a $30 million junk-bond offering in 1988, done with the help of financier Michael Milken, had increased its debt load. And losses in 1989 and 1990 reached a combined $6.3 million. But 1990's revenue growth made it look like the company's risky bet might be on the verge of paying off.<p>The third quarter of 1991 brought another positive sign. The company had earned a profit, reporting a net income of $30,000, or 1 cent a share. The one analyst who ventured a prediction at the time, according to Institutional Brokers Estimate System, forecast per-share earnings of a penny in 1991 and 20 cents in 1992. By October, the stock had risen to $5.13 a share from $1.63 in January 1991. In February 1992, it was at $9.63 a share. <p>The company's 1991 10-K (the "annual report" filed with the SEC), publicly available at the end of March 1992, reported that American Shared had earned nearly $2 million, or 70 cents a share, in 1991. That was certainly good news. Yet in the same report, management declared "substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern." Once that bit of information was digested, it's surprising only that the stock didn't sink faster. It ended 1992 at $3 a share. Recently, the shares traded at 69 cents.<p>Once more, it's time for us to say that investors could have seen all this coming. The tipoff appeared in an earlier financial statement prepared by the company: its September 30, 1991, quarterly report. The critical item: "Depreciation and amortization." <p>When a business acquires inventory, property, or a piece of equipment, it books the item on the balance sheet as an asset. The company then depreciates the cost of this asset over the number of years the item is expected to maintain its value. Thus, a $10,000 car with a useful life of five years would be depreciated annually at $2,000. Each $2,000 would be charged as an expense  -- deducted from total income. And each year, the car's value as an asset would decline accordingly on the balance sheet.<p>But depreciation is another one of those accounting areas that comes only in shades of gray. What is the useful life of an asset? A company that writes off the cost of an asset over a longer horizon is trading a current hit to earnings for a future one. If a company assumes a $10,000 car will last 10 years, for example, then it deducts a depreciation expense of only $1,000 every year for 10 years. Conservative companies generally depreciate assets faster than average. <p>Note this: Changing depreciation accounting in midstream can radically alter a company's financials. And that's exactly what American Shared did in 1991. In fact, this change in how it handled depreciation was equivalent to 80 percent of its $2 million profit for the year.<p>The company's September 30, 1991, quarterly report provided the tipoff that the company had decided to make this move. It showed a 12 percent decline in depreciation expense for the third quarter. This was a bright red flag. <p>In a note accompanying the financials, management explained that certain of its MRI units were now being written off more slowly. Management, however, did not spell out the change or how it had affected net earnings. This omission itself should have raised another red flag. The company had actually decided that equipment formerly depreciated over five years would now be expensed over seven and eight years.<p>American Shared, though silent about this back then, now defends the change as being simply prudent. "As we reviewed our depreciation policies, it became apparent to us that we were depreciating the equipment too quickly, and it was realistic to depreciate them over a longer life," says Richard Magary, a company spokesman. "It wasn't done to change earnings; it was done to more appropriately express the life of the equipment."<p>But a former company insider tells the story a bit differently. "The real reason for lengthening depreciation was so they would not be in default with the bondholders," he says. And indeed, the company's10-K covering all of 1991 credits the accounting change as helping boost stockholders' equity to a point just above the minimum net worth needed to satisfy creditors. The accounting change didn't keep American Shared above the minimum for long. A 1994 reorganization plan would give bondholders effective control.<p>Depreciation is one of the easiest places for a company to turn when it needs a boost to earnings or balance-sheet assets. Any change in depreciation accounting will add a onetime gain to net earnings. Most companies list that gain as an "extraordinary item," although American Shared did not. Sometimes, such moves are completely justified. But management should be able to make a good case. A change in depreciation may mask deeper problems in the business. If so, investors will soon find one of their own assets unexpectedly depreciating -- their stock.<p><p>Before MiniScribe tossed a brick at his reputation, Quentin Wiles told an interviewer for California Business how he came to be known as Dr. Fix-It, a miracle worker raising sick high-tech companies from the dead.<p>"Most entrepreneurs can't tell when their companies are getting in too deep," he said. "I don't blame them. After all, you have to be somewhat of an egomaniac to start a company."<p>In ways, though they wouldn't want to admit it, shareholders have similar qualities. They believe in something -- a rumor, a perception, a hunch -- and they lay their money down. After that, they often close their eyes and go to sleep, only waking up when a noisy decline in the stock's price alerts them that something has gone wrong. That's no way to be the part owner of a business.<p>Reading the financial statements won't always help an investor spot trouble. Some disasters just can't be dodged. But making money in the stock market is hard enough. Why not use the tools that are available?

						<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>This month, an army of Americans will descend on Europe to celebrate the 50th anniversary of D Day. Many tourists will bring back less money than they're entitled to -- perhaps hundreds of dollars less, if they splurge on the Champs Elysees.<p>The reason? Upon leaving most European countries, visitors may reclaim the value-added tax they've paid on certain purchases. But many don't: U.S. citizens left $30 million in Europe last year -- and they'll leave even more in 1994, says World Travel & Tourism Council, a research group. VAT is like our sales tax. In most countries it tops 10 percent; a few places (Portugal, for instance) may charge twice that much. VAT is usually included in the sticker price, so it's easy to forget about.<p>Reclaiming VAT is simple but tedious. If you spend a lot while traveling, however, the bother is well worth it. Some tips:<p>-> Business travelers can reclaim the VAT they've paid on car rentals and hotel rooms. Tourists get refunds only on goods.<p>-> Not all countries require stores to cooperate with the VAT-refund program. Keep an eye out for "tax free" signs -- or ask merchants about their policy. Some stores will do the paperwork for you.<p>-> At most stores, the drill involves showing a passport, then asking for refund forms and a mailing envelope. When you leave the country, a customs official will stamp the forms. You then pop them in the mail and, several weeks later, get a refund check -- in foreign currency.<p>-> Some banks may take these checks. Better yet, ask Ruesch International (800-424-2923) to convert them for $2 a check.<p>-> Too lazy for all that? Try a service called Europe Tax-free Shopping. From kiosks near customs points in 23 countries, ETS will buy stamped ETS checks -- issued instead of refund forms by many stores -- for a 20 to 25 percent fee. That's a lot to charge for convenience, but ETS can pay in dollars.<p>-> Finally, consider having goods shipped directly to the U.S. Merchants will often deduct any VAT on the spot. But beware: This makes sense only for fairly big purchases. <p><p><p>

The basics of the most basic investing skill: Reading a financial statement. <p>By Jonathan Burton<p>(First in a two-part series.Part two will appear in the July/August issue of Worth.)<p>Had Andy Warhol worked on Wall Street, he might have predicted every stock would get 15 points of upside. Kendall Square Research, a supercomputer maker based in Waltham, Massachusetts, had its moment of glory last year. Between April and October, its share price nearly doubled, helped by positive earnings estimates from analysts and speculation that the company might become a high-tech star. <p>But when Kendall Square announced in late October that it would report a third-quarter loss, the stock began a hasty retreat. The shares, which had closed at $24.25 on October 28, fell 32 percent the next day. Then, shareholders discovered that Henry Burkhardt III, Kendall Square's chief executive and founder, had dumped $1 million of his own holdings back in August. The share price kept skidding as more bad news hit: restated earnings -- lower than originally reported -- and withering revenue. By mid-April, the stock was down to $2.88 a share, and Burkhardt had departed as chief executive.<p>The crash of this highflier shouldn't have come as a complete surprise -- at least not to investors who know how to examine a company's financial reports and follow up with the right questions. As far back as August of 1993, Kendall Square's publicly available financial statements flashed a warning: The company was taking as long as five months to get paid by its customers. <p>Shareholders could have spotted this red flag in quarterly reports and acted on it in time to avoid the beating the stock would take months later. But they had to know where to look.<p>Trouble on a financial statement is not always easy to uncover. Some companies are better at explaining away accounting cosmetics than they are at selling their products. And not every number that raises a question is a sign of impending disaster. But the more an investor knows about how companies present their financial results, the better, and reading the public reports that companies prepare should be part of every investor's homework.<p>Doing this doesn't require an accounting degree. A diligent investor can, in fact, gain essential information -- the kind that could protect against a Kendall Square and some other recent flameouts -- by concentrating on several critical lines in the public documents that any investor-relations office will mail out for free.<p>But isn't this a job for securities analysts? Well, yes, but Wall Street doesn't catch everything -- at least not right away. The Street also doesn't always say what it thinks, even if it knows. Brokerage-firm analysts are caught between a stock and a hard place. A Chinese wall theoretically separates securities analysts from the corporate-finance department, which helps companies issue new stock and debt. Supposedly, an analyst could blast a corporate-finance client with a negative report, but it doesn't happen too often. Analysts tend to dig deeper once a company or an industry has tanked, turning into investigators at the crash site who hope the morning after can offer clues about what happened and why.<p>Yet, for obvious reasons, it's much better to ask why a stock is hot when it still is. Is its popularity sound or just a fad? Many factors can drive a stock up, but only fundamentals will keep it there.<p>This month, we'll zero in on three crucial entries in the financial statements that companies compile for Securities and Exchange Commission regulators in Washington and that current shareholders get regularly -- quarterly 10-Qs and annual 10-Ks. The three lines cover accounts receivable, inventory, and gross profit margins. In the next issue of Worth, we'll take a look at three other important categories. Knowing how to interpret these items is fundamental to guarding against unexpected trouble in a stock. The flipside: Investors also can turn up buying opportunities when they discover balance sheets with strong numbers in these categories.<p><p>ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE: 
The snare at Kendall Square<p>Henry Burkhardt III was exuberant about Kendall Square Research, the supercomputer maker he started in 1986 with the backing of William Koch, millionaire yachtsman and America's Cup winner. Enthusiasm came naturally to the 49-year-old president and chief executive, who first made his name as a cofounder of Data General. His reassuring manner proved valuable when dealing with Wall Street's restless stable of stock analysts and investors. But on a cloudy day last August at the company's headquarters outside Boston, Burkhardt didn't have to sell anyone; Wall Street had done that for him. Analysts saw the company earning 45 to 50 cents a share in 1993, eclipsing 1992's $1.22-a-share loss. Revenues would nearly triple, to $60 million, they felt. They forecast a third-quarter profit of between 8 cents and 13 cents a share.<p>Was Burkhardt comfortable with these estimates? A Wall Street Journal reporter asked him that in an August 12 interview.<p>"Quite comfortable," Burkhardt replied. The next day, Kendall Square's stock spiked up 75 cents a share to $19.75.<p>Nevertheless, a glance at Kendall Square's quarterly Form 10-Q for the second quarter ended June 26 would have revealed a disquieting element in this scene. It could be found on a single line on the balance sheet, the one that said "accounts receivable."<p>Receivables tell how much customers owe a company. Veteran financial analyst Thornton O'glove, author of Quality of Earnings, says accounts receivable is a particularly important figure, one that can reveal a great deal about a company and its payment terms. "Watch it over consecutive quarters," he advises. <p>The same day Burkhardt was meeting with the Journal reporter, Nasdaq officials received Kendall Square's second-quarter filing. It showed that the company's accounts receivable had jumped 57 percent in the first six months of the year, to $20.9 million from $13.3 million. The increase was partly explained by the fact that the company's reported sales, or revenue, had also risen sharply. (These numbers looked even gloomier when they were later restated by the company. But for the purposes of this article, we want to focus on information available to shareholders at the time.)<p>In addition to telling how much the company expects to collect from its customers, however, receivables reveal another important thing: how long the company is waiting to get paid. Investors can make this calculation through a two-step process. First, divide revenue by the number of days in the period. Then, divide the amount listed for receivables by this result. In Kendall Square's case, this calculation would have shown that the company was sending out bills and then waiting an average of 154 days to get paid -- about five months.<p>Faced with that answer, an investor might want to ask a few questions: Are customers disappointed in the product? Is the sales force extending payment schedules in an effort to inflate revenue? <p>Michael Murphy, who as editor of the Overpriced Stock Service newsletter in Half Moon Bay, California, earns a living watching such things, says companies show this kind of patience with customers for only two reasons: "Either the product's not working, or the company has granted the customer extraordinary terms." Leniency, he says, lets some companies "maintain their revenue-growth pattern so Wall Street will keep their stock up." <p>Kendall Square did have more to say on the subject in the June 1993 10-Q, attributing its growing receivables in part to "the granting of extended payment terms to certain customers." The company declined to answer further questions from Worth about its receivables, saying that officers familiar with the issue have left the company and are not available for comment. <p>Allowing receivables to build is not uncommon among aggressive, expanding companies like Kendall Square. Also, receivables may fluctuate more at a company that sells relatively few big-ticket products, like supercomputers -- because a single sale may represent as much as 5 percent of revenue.<p>Still, an investor who notices that a company is taking a long time to get paid has reason to be wary and should investigate further. Is the company managing its credit well? What do customers and competitors think of the company's products? Are soft credit terms an attempt to make up for prices that are too high? Rising receivables are an especially important red flag for companies that sell products based on rapidly evolving technology or fast-moving fashion. For these reasons, receivables always merit close scrutiny.<p><p>INVENTORIES:
Riding the Merry-Go-Round<p>Merry-Go-Round Enterprises, the clothing retailer for dedicated followers of young men's and women's fashion, was looking natty as a company. It was March of last year, and the Joppa, Maryland-based outfit had just announced the acquisition of Chess King, a rival clothing chain, a move that would give it the biggest share of the young -men's clothing market. Merry-Go-Round told brokerage-firm analysts that the purchase would add $13 million, or 15 cents a share, to profits for the year. So some Wall Street analysts raised their earnings estimates for Merry-Go-Round. The company's stock rose $2.25, or 15 percent, to $17 on the day of the Chess King news. Merry-Go-Round was hot -- $100 of its stock in January 1988 was worth $804 five years later. Last year, the chain owned 1,460 stores in 44 states, mostly under the Cignal, Chess King, and Merry-Go-Round names.<p>But Merry-Go-Round spun out. The company lost $544,000 in the first six months of 1993, compared with earnings of $13.5 million in the first half of 1992. Last fall, Leonard "Boogie" Weinglass, Merry-Go-Round's flamboyant founder and chairman, who started the company in 1968, boarded up his Merry-Go-Ranch in Aspen, Colorado, and returned to management after a 12-year hiatus. But the ponytailed, shirtsleeved entrepreneur -- the inspiration for the character Boogie in the movie Diner -- couldn't save his company from bankruptcy. In January of this year, the company filed for Chapter 11 protection in Baltimore. Shares crumbled below $3. <p>Was there any advance warning of all this? In Merry-Go-Round's annual report for the fiscal year ended January 30, one balance sheet item in particular stands out: "merchandise inventories." Inventory is unsold goods and considered an asset. As a rule, inventories should rise in tandem with sales. If inventories rise faster, it may be because the goods simply aren't selling. This is particularly true of companies in faddish or seasonal businesses -- Merry-Go-Round's world.<p>The company's report showed that inventories on January 30 were $82.2 million, up 37 percent from $60 million a year earlier. That's well above the 15 percent sales growth in the same period, to $877.5 million from $761.2 million. This alone should have been a major cause for concern. It indicated the company's goods simply weren't selling as rapidly as it expected, causing its inventories to bulge. <p>Merry-Go-Round officials don't see it that way. At that time, "the company was doing quite well," says a Merry-Go-Round spokesman. "We were anticipating additional stores and additional growth." But the spokesman also acknowledges that the company "bought for expected sales that did not develop."<p>The inventory problem was more obvious a quarter later. Merry-Go-Round's May 1, 1993, 10-Q showed a 48 percent increase in inventories over its January 30 level and a 49 percent rise over the level a year earlier. Sales over the year, however, had gone up just 8.5 percent. <p>Publicly available financial statements had confirmed a trend, but not the kind that Merry-Go-Round usually set. In the case of a retailer, an investor who spots rising inventories might consider a little field research. A trip to a store might provide some clues. Are customers buying? Is the merchandise on sale? With other kinds of companies, checking out the trade magazines may help, especially those issues that rate products against each other. If the quality, features, or price of a company's product are coming in for criticism, then the cause of rising inventories isn't exactly a mystery. <p><p>GROSS MARGINS:
The worm in the Apple<p>War came to the personal-computer industry in June 1992, and prices of machines soon were dropping to bargain levels. <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple Computer</b></a> watched this battle from its base in Cupertino, California, feeling reasonably confident that the war would have a much greater impact on <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> and the makers of IBM clones. Apple considered itself special, out of the fray. Consumers readily paid a premium for its products. <p>But Apple wasn't as safe as it thought. Given a chance to buy less-expensive IBM-style machines, customers balked at high-ticket Apples. The uprising forced Apple to cut prices for its signature Macintosh computers. <p>Shareholders, confident that Apple could withstand any challenge, remained loyal even when customers weren't. On June 1, 1993, Apple's stock closed at $57 a share, not far off its 52-week high of $65.25. Yet eight days later, when Apple said its earnings for the rest of the year would be lower than predicted, Wall Street finally pulled the plug. <p>By the end of June, Apple's stock had lost almost one third of its value. In mid-July the company posted its first quarterly loss in two years -- a bigger-than-expected $188.3 million shortfall. By then, shares had fallen to $27.50 each.<p>Under normal conditions Apple might have offset the premium loss with aggressive cost cutting. But the PC wars had become so intense that Apple was being forced to lower prices faster than it could trim expenses.<p>The result: A textbook case of shrinking gross margins. This was evident on Apple's financial report for the quarter ended on March 26, 1993 -- and made publicly available about two months before the stock began its spectacular decline.<p>Gross margin is a standard measure of corporate health. It shows how much of a company's revenue is left over after manufacturing costs are subtracted. What remains is partly eaten by salaries, advertising, taxes, and other expenses as it sinks to the bottom line to become earnings, the kind of profit that investors care most about. Gross margins will often shrink if the company's cost of making its products goes up or if a company has to cut prices. Other things, like product mix, can also affect gross margins.<p>But price cutting was what was happening to Apple, as its March 1993 10-Q showed. "I should have seen it," grumbles Michael Murphy, editor of the Overpriced Stock Service newsletter. "I looked at it and said, 'Well, they do have to get more aggressive about following these prices down,' but I didn't think they'd have to give up the premium." <p>Apple's March 1993 10-Q showed revenues of $3.97 billion for the first half of its fiscal year versus $3.58 billion the year before, a gain of 11 percent. Directly beneath net sales, under the heading "costs and expenses," is the line "cost of sales." This shows what the company spent on materials and equipment to produce the goods it sold. Apple in this six-month period earmarked $2.4 billion to generate sales of $4 billion. The difference is the gross margin. <p>The quick approach is to figure gross margin as a percentage of sales. To do this, subtract cost of sales from net sales, then divide by net sales. In Apple's case, the result is 40 percent -- the gross margin as a percentage of sales for the first half. <p>How did this compare with the company's gross margin a year before? A right-hand column gives matching figures for the six months ended March 27, 1992. Then, Apple's sales were $3.58 billion, and cost of sales was $2 billion. Using the same calculation as before shows a gross margin as a percentage of sales of 44 percent.<p>The drop in Apple's gross margin as a percentage of sales alone wasn't a reason to dump the stock. But it did signal danger. William Slakey, director of investor relations at Apple, says that at the time, Apple gave up its price advantage to lift sales. "We altered our pricing strategy accordingly, and it did impact our gross margins," Slakey said. <p>Indeed, sometimes a company will deliberately squeeze margins and lower prices in an effort to build market share. Apple set this goal, and for a time it worked. But this strategy succeeds only if costs come down, too. Investors who see this happening need to know whether the company plans to do anything to trim expenses or whether it expects increasing sales to offset the price cutting. Unless one of those things happens, the bottom line will suffer, with the stock price not far behind. At the end of the day, it's more important to make a buck than to make a sale. <p>Sometimes, of course, financial deceit is so polished that even the most cynical analysts are duped. Reading financial statements isn't a certain defense against outright corporate fraud. If management is determined to lie, investors who read the financials won't catch it.<p>But that's the uncommon case. More often, stocks fall because managers make business mistakes -- mistakes that leave tracks in their corporate disclosures. Spotting the tracks is not a command to dump the stock and run. It is, however, a strong signal to telephone the company, its competitors, and its vendors with pointed questions, and to check on management by reading the annual proxy statement and news coverage. Then a decision to hold or fold can be an informed decision. Otherwise, investors will find that from a certain trusting distance, drowning and swimming look remarkably alike. <p>Next month, we'll focus on three other items in a company's financial statements that investors should know how to evaluate: quality of earnings, depreciation, and expenses.

If you pay in advance, you can get an attorney for less.<p>By Lauren Goldstein<p>John Betley had a choice. To handle the sale of his house, he could hire a lawyer of his own for $750, or he could get one from his company's $12-a-month legal-aid program. Betley, director of financial operations for the DMB&B advertising agency, didn't hesitate. "I signed on to the company's legal plan - I knew I would use the service in the coming year." Prepaid legal-service plans - the health-maintenance organizations of the legal profession - are becoming more popular as a menu item in cafeteria-style employee-benefit plans. One hundred forty-four dollars covered the legal fees for the sale of Betley's house, as well as any other legal needs he had during the year. Betley was so pleased with the service that he will enroll again next year. <p>Legal-service plans generally cost from $8 to $16 a month and, depending on the type of plan offered, cover most basic legal needs. Of course, there are some things that aren't covered. Don't bother trying to mount a hostile takeover of your company with legal services financed by the plan, for example. And not surprisingly, you can't use the plan to sue your employer. What most of these prepaid legal plans provide are unlimited telephone consultation; the review of commonly used legal documents such as real-estate sales contracts; the drafting of wills, adoptions, and deeds; and discounts on the going fees for outside counsel in some litigation. In divorce, some plans cover an employee's legal costs only, not a spouse's. The plans do vary from firm to firm: Employers may exclude coverage for certain legal costs, such as defending driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.<p>The plans are endorsed by the American Bar Association and approved by the American Association of Retired Persons. Wayne Moore, director of legal counsel at the AARP, says, "It's like having a lawyer at your beck and call for a $100 retainer. People can call before they cut down a neighbor's tree or sign a contract they may regret. They know the consequences of their actions up front."<p>For complicated legal problems that require face-to-face visits, a comprehensive plan may help to limit costs. But don't expect top-notch service to be covered in full. The lawyers who take part in the plans are trading access to a population group and guaranteed payment for fees that are generally less than their going rate. Stephen Leaman, senior vice president of Hyatt Legal Plans, says his organization does, however, secure discounts for employees who require specialized, high-cost counsel - as in the case of settling estates large enough to be subject to federal taxation. "For what may be a $3,000 legal fee," Leaman says, "a 25 percent discount is not to be overlooked."<p><p>

						Would so many travelers go to so much bother to earn airline
mileage if they knew what a mile was really worth?<p>By Jeff Blyskal<p>A New York businessman has two days of meetings in Chicago. He could wrap up his work in time to get home to his family by 7 p.m. the second day. But instead, he schedules a three-day trip and stays in a different hotel each night. Rather than flying a direct route on the airline he prefers, he opts for another carrier and a circuitous route with several connecting flights. A taxi from O'Hare would give him more time to prepare for his meeting, but he actually rents a car at the airport, returns it downtown, then rents a second car for the trip back to the airport.<p>What could induce anyone to engage in such masochistic behavior? Answer: The quest for frequent-flier miles.<p>In a world where ledger books are always supposed to balance, the rules that forbid getting something for nothing seem to have been suspended when it comes to frequent-flier programs. They are a "terrific deal," swears Earl Quenzel, vice president of marketing programs at <a name="NYSE:CAI.A"></a><b>Continental Airlines</b>. Travelers would be "foolish not to take advantage of frequent-flier miles if they're there," adds Bruce Chemel, managing director of marketing programs at American Airlines. Many of us seem to agree: Countless people think that flying a roundabout route and artificially boosting the number of car rentals and hotel stays are economically rational acts. We love it when phone companies and credit cards offer us free mileage, and we rarely stop to ask whether these truly represent a good deal.<p>But are frequent-flier miles really worth it? And are some programs better than others? In looking into this issue, we set aside the romantic notion that flying is a luxury. We also hacked our way through the confusing jungle of airline pricing. What did we find? Well, for one thing, a frequent-flier mile has a lot less value than most people think it does. And that's before the industry's announced plans to devalue the worth of these promotions even further. Airlines are boosting award requirements by about 25 percent and putting more obstacles between the frequent flier and a free ticket. <p>Our research also found that some airline frequent-flier programs aren't nearly as good as their reputations. Plus, many of the accepted consumer rating systems for these airline promotions are flawed, sometimes seriously. For example, a major annual frequent-flier opinion survey, conducted by InsideFlyer magazine, rated Continental Airlines' OnePass program No. 1 for six years running. Yet by our count, Continental actually provided members with an effective discount of just 4.6 percent, well behind our first-place pick: Southwest, with a discount of 6 percent. And USAir, considered above average in other ratings, came in dead last on our ranking--a product of that short-haul carrier's high fares--with a dreadful 1.5 percent discount.<p>Our legwork also turned up some other surprising things about frequent-flier promotions: <p>-> For all consumers go through to rack up mileage, few cash in their awards. In 1992, only 1 in 14 American AAdvantage members collected a travel award. That same year, only 1 in 25 Continental OnePass members got a free ticket. <p>-> Free tickets are becoming harder to obtain because of the restrictions airlines impose and because of the limited number of seats available. On <a name="AMEX:TWA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16885"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>TWA</b></a>, for example, "25 percent of frequent fliers with enough miles required for an award don't collect because they are unable to schedule a flight," says Geraldine Frankoski, director of Ralph Nader's Aviation Consumer Action Project.<p>-> Compared with other frequency marketing programs in other industries, the airlines' frequent-flier promotions offer consumers a relatively small discount. In other words, when it comes to ticket giveaways, big carriers are definitely on the stingy side.<p>-> Airlines have unusual flexibility to change their minds about what they are willing to shell out in return for the mileage customers rack up. It's for this reason that New York State assistant attorney general Andrea Levine says, "But for the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that we have no jurisdiction over airline [advertising], we would be regulating frequent-flier-program marketing practices under the deceptive-business-practices statutes."<p>To calculate the true value of frequent-flier programs, travelers need to understand one thing: These programs are not giveaways. The airlines may have started these programs purely as marketing devices, but they are now often lucrative profit centers. All those award miles put dollars in the airlines' pockets and passengers in their seats.<p>Frequent-flier programs are now so much a part of travel that many people never stop to analyze them. What little press scrutiny there is generally follows the airline marketing departments' lead and focuses on helping the consumer navigate the Alice in Wonderland rules. It's rare that anyone has questioned the economic fundamentals of such plans. Last year, for instance, Fortune magazine explained how any business traveler could "Be a Smarter Frequent Flier" by contorting his or her normal behavior patterns to match the pretzel-shaped complexities and ever-changing requirements of frequent-flier-program rules. The publication never even stopped to ask whether such an effort might be worth it in the first place.<p>Of course, employers have long groused about employees collecting free tickets at company expense, though most firms have thrown in the towel on the issue. According to a survey of 749 corporations by Runzheimer International, a travel-consulting firm in Northbrook, Illinois, 88 percent of companies now agree that frequent-flier spoils belong to employees. Call it a reward for the pain in the neck otherwise known as business travel.<p>The Internal Revenue Service, which hardly ever shrinks from slapping a dollar value on abstract commodities, hasn't tackled this subject either. "There's a section of the tax code that says if income is not specifically excluded, it's taxable," says agency spokesman Kenneth Hubenak. "But there is no published IRS position specifically addressing the taxability of frequent-flier miles."<p>The airlines have been content to let the public misunderstand. Everyone knows that carriers rue the day American Airlines invented frequent-flier programs in 1981. Airlines are now slaves to frequent fliers, the story goes. And the growing liability of 1.4 trillion frequent-flier miles piling up like thunderheads on the Great Plains in July threatens the survival of the entire industry. The airlines would slay this monster in a minute, consumers are told, but no airline wants to be the first to eliminate its program unilaterally for fear of being at a competitive disadvantage. You'd almost think frequent fliers were fleecing the airlines.<p>Before you swallow that line of reasoning, ask yourself this: If frequent-flier programs are such a bad deal for providers, how come practically every telephone company, rental-car outfit, credit card issuer, and hotel in America has been so anxious to hop on the frequent-flier bandwagon? It sure ain't because the parade leads straight to the poorhouse. And it certainly isn't because frequent-flier programs are such a great deal for consumers. No, the real reason is that these programs are one of the most lucrative marketing schemes ever invented. Now guess who pays the price.<p>In the end, the airline executives we talked to conceded that frequent-flier programs are the greatest thing for carriers since the DC-3--the aircraft, introduced in 1936, that first made transporting passengers profitable. "Frequent-flier programs are not going to go away," says American's Chemel. "We don't want them to go away. The only people who want them to go away are those who don't understand them." <p>"The airlines without a strong frequent-flier program are the ones who want to get rid of them," says Evelyne Gaidot, vice president of business marketing at TWA.<p>The truth is, airline frequent-flier programs make money. They are not simple giveaways. "That's how we justified the programs economically," says Rolfe Shellenberger, who was American's manager of market plans in 1981 and is now a California-based management consultant at Runzheimer International. "When we developed the original plan, we figured if we gave the frequent flier a free ticket to Hawaii, a free Hyatt hotel room, and a free Hertz car rental, he would dig into his jeans and pay a couple hundred bucks for a ticket for his companion. Eighty-five percent of that ticket revenue would be incremental [extra revenue the airline otherwise wouldn't get], and it would pay 90 percent of the cost of the administration, the promotions and direct mail, and the award itself."<p>The extra expense of flying one more nonrevenue body (in what would have otherwise been an empty seat) is small. "On a transcontinental flight, you're talking about a couple more pounds of jet fuel, a meal, and a small allocation for passenger displacement and revenue dilution," says Donald Garvett, vice president of Simat, Helliesen & Eichner, a New York- based travel-industry consulting firm that specializes in aviation. The airline's incremental cost amounts to about a penny per mile, or $48 on a transcontinental round-trip. <p>No wonder the other U.S. majors jumped to imitate American--United did so in a matter of days. Consumers went wild. The first year, 1.8 million fliers accumulated 86 billion miles. A year later, membership rose to more than 3 million, and the number of bankrolled miles doubled. <p>Clearly the plans hit a psychological bull's-eye. Frequent-flier miles were seen as a classic something-for-nothing winner. "It's amazing how people play the game to get ten more miles here, a hundred more there," says Rick Boubelik, manager of <a name="NASD:NWAL"></a><b>Northwest</b>'s WorldPerks program. And the something wasn't just cash or a pocket calculator--it was an airline ticket. "Flying has always been a big dream of everyone since the days when air travel was considered elite," says Boubelik. Frequent-flier memberships quickly became status symbols. Long before these programs existed, an executive's importance was measured by the number of miles he flew per year. But the airlines now provided a monthly statement that confirmed those status miles.<p>The timing couldn't have been better for the airlines, either. The perk provided a distraction from the annoyance of the airlines' increasing use of hub-and-spoke systems that were forcing more and more travelers to change planes to get where they wanted to go.<p>The contradictions in the frequent-flier philosophy emerged just as quickly. These programs attempted to market prestige to the masses. To be fair, it seems likely that American didn't anticipate exactly how attractive its program would be to the infrequent flier. The airline's real target was the very, very frequent flier--the elite 3 to 5 percent of business travelers who fly 50,000-plus miles per year--not every Joe and Jane with a boarding pass and a garment bag.<p>American expected the frequent-flier program to attract about 350,000 top travelers--approximately doubling the number of Very Important Travelers that the airline's SABRE computer system identified for special treatment. Instead, millions piled on, creating two distinct classes of frequent flier: the elite corps of very frequent fliers who the airlines believe are really worth pampering, and everyone else.<p>Today, with some 30 million people belonging to at least one of these hardly exclusive frequent-flier clubs, the airlines have explicitly separated the two classes and spelled out the special treatment available for superhigh-mileage fliers--bonus mileage rates; complimentary upgrades; preferred seating, check-in, and boarding; and much more. "When there are irregular operations at the airport because of weather, we take the 100Ks [passengers who fly more than 100,000 miles a year] to a special lounge so they don't have to stand in long lines during cancellations and rescheduling," says Gayle Bock, United's director of marketing programs. "We handle them with white gloves and care." <p>To look at it another way, miles are worth more if they result in special treatment and less if they don't. Frequent-flier miles are one of the few currencies in the world that is worth more or less depending on caste membership.<p>Indeed, it's crucial that consumers think about frequent-flier miles as a currency; the airlines clearly do. Miles became a currency in the second year for the programs, 1982, when the first sizable number of free tickets--some 368,000--were issued. That effectively put frequent-flier miles on a par with deutsche marks, pounds, and francs, even though you'll never find the exchange rate listed in any financial pages.<p>But the big players in this market, the airlines and their marketing partners, know the rate. They have to: The banks, rental-car companies, long-distance phone services, and hotels that award frequent-flier miles to their customers pay the airlines for these miles--on average between 1 and 2 cents a mile, according to Randy Petersen, publisher of InsideFlyer magazine, and other industry sources. That revenue stream helps keep the frequent-flier programs at American, United, Continental, Northwest, and TWA profitable, "even before you look at how much the program increases revenues," says TWA's Gaidot.<p>Petersen, a leading expert on frequent-flier programs, says 48 percent of all miles now accumulated are awarded by the airlines' marketing partners. "Airlines love that financial shift," he says. "If they have a lot of partners buying miles, they've got money coming in from someone else. I estimate American takes between $125 million and $150 million a year just from the partners affiliated with its program." <p>At this point a consumer ought to ask again why banks and phone companies give away frequent-flier miles rather than cash discounts. Frequency marketing--giving a discount or a bonus to loyal customers--has been around since the 1940s, the heyday of promotions like Green Stamps. Rewarding frequent buyers has its own economics: A company wants to give the premium that combines the greatest perceived value with the lowest cost. The airlines' partners could certainly give cash or other discounts to frequent users, but they choose to give airline miles--a currency they have to buy.<p>That would certainly suggest that frequent-flier miles are a better deal for these marketers. And there is really only one possible explanation for that: Consumers consistently overvalue frequent-flier miles.<p>What's the real value? for the most part, the people who rate frequent-flier programs seem to regard this as an unknowable mystery. The numbers are too hard to figure, they assert, because of the ever-changing nature of air fares. Consequently, most ratings of frequent-flier programs amount to subjective judgments that don't test program quality.<p>Yet the necessary numbers are, in fact, available. You just have to know where to look. Our ratings of the major airlines' programs distill millions of marketplace purchase decisions, the plethora of constantly changing fares, the advantages and disadvantages of individual airline route systems, and the gobbledygook of frequent-flier program rules to rank the airlines on a simple and key indicator of true performance: the effective fare discount.<p>Here's how this method works. At the end of each year, the infinity of fares boils down to something called average yield per revenue passenger mile, or RPM. This is what an airline collects on average for flying one paying passenger one mile. Because of differentials in costs, markets served, route lengths, and management savvy, the average yield varies. Among the majors in 1992, it ranged from just 9.9 cents per RPM at TWA to 19.1 cents per RPM at USAir. Using this figure, it's possible to calculate how much money the average passenger shelled out to rack up 20,000 miles (40,000 at Delta, that airline's minimum award level since 1992). Multiplying an airline's RPM by 20,000 miles gives half the cost/benefit equation. (Our calculation assumes 10,000 miles earned from flying and 10,000 earned from hotel and car rental partners, since 48 percent of miles are earned from airline partners.)<p>Of course, a traveler also gets to fly all those miles he's actually paid for. Our method attempts to calculate the discount, represented by frequent-flier miles and awards, that a flier receives from the airline for being a good customer.<p>The average number of dollars spent to fly the 20,000 miles necessary to earn a domestic award typically ranges from $3,626 to $6,555, depending on the airline involved. The average cost of a free travel award at <a name="NYSE:DAL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10448"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Delta</b></a> is an unusually high $7,527 because of that airline's higher mileage requirement. At Southwest the average cost of a free travel award is an exceptionally low $929, because the <a name="NYSE:LUV"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11377"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Southwest</b></a> Company Club gives frequent fliers a free ticket after only eight round-trips rather than 20,000 miles. The average frequent flier on Southwest collected his free ticket after only 7,104 miles.<p>The next thing we did was calculate what a free ticket is worth once an airline has dispensed it to the customer. According to travel-industry consultant Garvett, carriers price their restricted discount tickets at about 6 cents a mile. He explains, however, that frequent-flier tickets have to be considered even less valuable than that. "If I'd had to pay for the free ticket at even the lowest fare, I wouldn't have taken the trip," says Garvett.<p>Now we can construct a value curve to estimate what one free ticket is worth. Obviously the value to consumers is greater than the 1 to 2 cents per mile that outside marketers pay the airlines. So we'll use that figure to establish the low point on our value scale. The high point would be the 6 cents it would cost to purchase a comparable discount airline ticket. So, giving frequent-flier programs every benefit of the doubt, we set the value at 5 cents in our calculations. Multiplied by the average number of miles per free round-trip at each airline--about 25 percent greater than the average round-trip, since travelers try to maximize the value of their awards by using them on longer flights--the dollar value of a free ticket ranges from $56 on Southwest (1,110-mile average free round-trip) to $208 at United (4,168-mile average free round-trip).<p>From there, it's easy to calculate the frequency discount a flier gets in each program. Think of the free ticket as a rebate for being a good customer. The effective discount measures how big a rebate each airline offers. The average effective discount is just 3.3 percent. The best is only 6 percent. That average is significantly below the discounts offered by other kinds of frequency marketing programs. "Hotel frequent-guest programs generally provide a 5 percent effective discount," says Richard Barlow, president of Cincinnati-based consultants Frequency Marketing Inc. In retailing, frequency marketing programs like Neiman Marcus's InCircle, Saks First, and <a name="NYSE:S"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11338"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sears</b></a> Best Customer also provide a 5 percent discount.<p>Of course, the airlines' effective discount can shrink considerably below even these levels for the 32 percent of business travelers who pay higher than average full-coach, business class, or first-class fares. <p>Airline frequent-flier programs do, however, best one class of frequency marketing program, the affinity credit card. <a name="NYSE:AXP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10085"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Express</b></a>, Diners Club, and most Visa and MasterCard affinity cards usually award one frequent-flier mile per dollar charged to the card. That translates to an effective discount of just 0.7 percent on the $20,000 (or $40,000 at Delta) spent on a credit card to earn the $152 value of the average free ticket.<p>There is another way to measure the frequent-flier discount, but this paints an even more negative picture of the programs. So far, these numbers haven't considered the costs to the consumer in the way these programs alter behavior. Frequent-flier programs push travelers away from the low-fare, low-frills carriers, because these small upstarts often don't offer frequent-flier programs that tie in with the major airlines. In effect, to earn that "free" ticket, travelers pay more for air travel than they have to.<p>For example, earlier this year, you could have flown round-trip Newark to Chicago on Kiwi International Airlines for just $208 unrestricted. The same round-trip on an apples-to-apples unrestricted United ticket cost $882. Kiwi has been having trouble getting business travelers from large corporations--because of the lack of a frequent-flier program. Small businessmen and entrepreneurs, however, are flocking to Kiwi. Think they know something?<p>To rack up 20,000 miles for a free domestic ticket on United, a frequent flier would have to make 14 round-trips at a cost of $12,348. Fourteen round-trips on Kiwi would cost just $2,912. That means the United flier's company would be paying an extra $9,436 so its employee can collect one free ticket worth, on United, about $208. That's a very expensive perk. Meanwhile, the entrepreneur who flew Kiwi would have no free ticket, but with the $9,436 in his pocket, he could buy 45 more Newark-to-Chicago round-trips or 26 trips to and from Palm Beach, Florida. Call it a negative discount of 324 percent.<p>That example brings up one of the most common reasons that travelers don't worry about the cost or value of frequent-flier programs. If the company is shelling out all that money for expensive tickets and the employee is collecting the free ticket, why should he care if the discount is only 3.3 percent and the average free ticket is worth just $152? The company pays the freight and the ticket is gravy, isn't it? Well, before taking those "free" miles to the bank, frequent fliers should see if they're paying any of the costs that seem to sneak into the mileage game. How about the annual fees of $35 to $85 on an affinity card and an annual interest rate of 15 percent to 21.6 percent? A non-affinity, low-rate card would charge more like 10 percent to 14.5 percent and would certainly have a lower annual fee--or perhaps no fee. Of course, that card wouldn't let a traveler win a free mile for every dollar he charges. It doesn't take much of a fee or too many interest payments to erase the value of a $152 free ticket.<p>All affinity cards limit the user to a single airline. Those credit cards that give the traveler more freedom come with higher costs. The American Express and Diners Club mileage programs allow members to apply earned miles to any participating airline. But the annual cost of this extra flexibility is $80 for a Diners Club membership that includes enrollment in the mileage program and $80 to $100 for Amex green and gold respectively (for every year after the first year of enrollment).<p>The disciplined frequent flier who has dodged that cost should next consider the cost of buying another ticket for a travel companion--some 75 percent of award recipients travel with a partner. And what about some of the other add-on costs? To manage miles in a disciplined way, many travelers buy The Official Frequent Flyer Guidebook ($14.99) and add an annual subscription to either InsideFlyer ($33) or Frequent Flyer magazine ($24). A TravelWare computer program ($149) will help manage miles and plan the travel gymnastics necessary to boost mileage accrual. Some frequent fliers even buy insurance to protect their miles from airline bankruptcy and expiration. Award Guard coverage offered by Colorado Springs- based Frequent Flyer Services costs as much as $139 per year. Sure makes sense as a way to protect that $152 ticket.<p>And express delivery of an award--two to three days instead of three to four weeks--costs $35 to $70, depending on the airline. A couple thousand miles short of an award? Continental will sell a frequent flier the last 20 percent needed for 2.5 cents per mile, which seems like the airline itself values its miles pretty cheaply. <p>The biggest cost may be the hardest to quantify. How should we value the time many fliers spend obsessing over maximizing mileage, keeping up-to-date on program rules and special offers, rescheduling travel and flying roundabout routes to boost mileage, going out of their way to stay at a hotel partner that will award miles, and undertaking extra travel to accrue enough miles for an award?<p>The frequent-flier-program member who recognizes the economic facts of life and takes a more casual approach toward the game still gets caught in a massive catch-22. Dump the affinity card, publications, software, insurance, and express award service. Pay no attention to concentrating all travel on one airline or doing business only with the program's travel partners. Don't worry about how many miles you've got, how many you need for an award, or when they expire. Vow never to make any unnecessary travel. And chances are good you'll wind up collecting no award. An estimated 30 percent of all accumulated frequent-flier miles will never be used, says L. John Eichner, of Simat, Helliesen & Eichner.<p>As grim as this picture is, frequent-flier awards are likely to become even less valuable in the future. One of the most valued perks--the free upgrade to first class--is becoming harder to get as frequent-flier programs grow in members and miles. And the airlines, worried about the huge number of miles in frequent-flier accounts, have started to devalue this currency.<p>The free upgrade has become especially valued by business travelers in the current economic environment. A lot of companies are cutting back, and business travelers can't buy first-class seats. But frequent-flier-program members can upgrade from coach to more comfortable business or first class. The only problem for the nonelite flier, however, is a few hefty direct costs. Typically, a first-class wanna-be must start with a full-fare coach or business-class ticket. The upgrade can cost around 10,000 miles on domestic flights and up to 30,000 internationally. Frequent fliers can pay cash instead, from $25 for a 500-mile trip to $140 for a 4,000-mile journey. They can upgrade only if there are seats available and generally have a 50/50 chance of success. But "forget it for the five o'clock to Logan [Boston] or DCA [Washington National]," says Northwest's Boubelik. Travelers seeking standby upgrades have to arrive at the gate two hours before departure to improve the odds of getting what they want.<p>Next year, the cost of a free domestic ticket will rise 25 percent, to 25,000 miles on American, United, and USAir, with other airlines sure to follow. That will erode the effective discount of the deal and make it harder to collect.<p>In 1992, Alaska Airlines, American, AmericaWest, Northwest, and United added another new twist by imposing expiration dates. So at American last year, 20 billion miles --$200 million worth--expired. Poof!<p>Nevertheless, these changes, and the mileage increase proposed for 1995, haven't solved the basic problem--a growing imbalance in the supply and demand of free seats, caused largely because the proliferation of travel partners has made it much easier to add miles. "The liability of frequent-flier miles is growing, but the capacity for free seats is a constant," says Boubelik. "If we raise the mileage requirement higher, fewer people can earn the miles they need for a free ticket and we're better able to meet consumer expectations." In other words, consumers should lower their expectations. Boubelik sees award requirements eventually rising to 50,000 for a domestic ticket and 150,000 to 200,000 for international. "We've now got so many ways to earn miles, we've got to adjust the award chart up to burn off the excess," he adds.<p>Not all consumers are willing to quietly see their frequent-flier miles devalued. Chicago attorney Spencer Marks brought a class-action suit against American Airlines on this issue in 1988. "American Airlines gives out all these miles, but they don't have enough seats for people to use them," says Marks. "It is my understanding that American and United have grouped their frequent-flier award seats in with their maxi-saver seats. Those are the least expensive seats, and they sell out first." The case is still pending.<p>In 1987 Marks successfully sued United when it abruptly raised the mileage for an upgrade to 15,000 from 10,000. "I thought that was inherently wrong; if the customer completes his end of the deal and the airline says he suddenly needs more miles when he tries to cash in, the airline has breached the contract," he says.<p>United settled in 1989, but it was a Pyrrhic victory for consumers. Now United and all the airlines have put language in their program contracts stating that the airline can change the terms of the program at any time with sufficient notice. That means a frequent flier's accumulated miles are subject to any method of devaluation and use restriction that the airlines can dream up. <p>"You shouldn't be able to unilaterally change the terms of a deal in midstream, and there's no question that this rises to the level of deceptive business practices," says Andrea Levine of the New York attorney general's office. Unfortunately, when the National Association of Attorneys General tried to issue guidelines for airline ads, the Supreme Court said in 1992 that only the U.S. Department of Transportation had the authority to regulate airline advertising. Under deregulation, the department has done nothing to stop the practice.<p>Given this trend, the smart traveler will reorder his priorities. Instead of picking the airline or the route that gives the most miles or exclusively flying just one airline in an attempt to earn a free ticket, search for undervalued basics such as a better fare, better safety, and better service.<p>Travelers who can use Southwest Airlines don't have to chose. Southwest, which ranked first in service quality, also had the best frequent-flier program. But customers of other airlines aren't that lucky. For example, Continental, whose frequent-flier program provided the second-best effective discount, rated last in service quality. <p>Which to choose: Service quality or the frequent-flier come-on? Considering the questionable bargain that frequent-flier programs turn out to be, we think the answer is obvious.

Ask any kid: Braces are mostly about vanity<p>By Bruce Upbin<p>Back in the dim mists of prehistory - the 1940s and 1950s - there were children who never smiled. Doing so would have revealed the dirty little secret that bound itself with wires or rubber bands to their teeth: braces.<p>Today, there may well be children who never smile because they don't have braces.<p>Braces are in vogue. In a compulsively self-improving society, children know that braces will enhance their looks, and they know that other children know it. The rubber bands and retainers come in rainbow colors, permitting children to mix and match their mouth gear to their clothing and other accessories. "It has become a social phenomenon," says Dr. Jeffrey Sulitzer, dental director of U.S. Healthcare in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania. "Kids want braces."<p>Orthodontics has become a growth industry. New cases measured on a per-doctor basis rose 6 percent between 1989 and 1992, the most recent numbers available. The gross income of the U.S. orthodontic industry amounts to a mouth-numbing $4 billion a year.<p>If your kids want to join the club, here are some things you should know:<p>The average fee for a course of treatment is about $3,300, but actual fees vary widely depending on the practitioner's experience and the materials and procedures used. Insurance barely makes a dent in the total cost. If you carry dental coverage at all, it is probably indemnity coverage that stalls at around 50 percent of the full course of treatment up to a lifetime maximum of $1,000 or two years, whichever comes first. Most plans - managed-care plans, for instance - omit coverage on extras like clear or lingual (behind the teeth) braces. Surgical procedures and interceptive orthodontia - troubleshooting before problems begin - are also excluded from these plans. <p>The reason for the paltry coverage is that orthodontia, like other elective procedures, "is a luxury item - you don't live or die from having straight teeth," says Robert Mehlman, national dental director of Aetna Health Plans in Hartford, Connecticut. Another reason coverage is minimal is that one third of orthodontists won't lower their fees to what insurers consider reasonable. Orthodontic fees rose 5.3 percent in 1992; that's less than the 7.4 percent increase in all medical-care costs in 1992 but still above the consumer price index's 2.5 percent rise.<p>What accounts for the high cost of orthodontia? It can't be the materials. The orthodontist's rubber bands, nickel-titanium wires, and stainless steel brackets cost around $300 a patient. "We're charging for our time. It's all we have," says Dr. Sewell Chason, an orthodontist in Bangor, Maine. "It's no different than a surgeon in an operating room, except that the situation is not a life or death one."<p>According to a survey by the American Association of Orthodontists, six out of every ten people who walk in for an orthodontia exam eventually begin a course of treatment. Among patients who return a second time to hear the orthodontist pitch his plan of treatment, the acceptance rate rises to nine of ten. <p>Orthodontists can usually make a case for straightening out young teeth to improve their bite. Half of all patients are referred by dentists who spot developing bite problems. Permanent teeth tend to erupt all over the place, first in the back, then in the front, and finally in the middle. This can lead to crowding, says Dr. David Forbes, director of orthodontics at the Northwestern University School of Dentistry. "An ideal bite is rare," he says.<p>Doctors say uncrowded teeth are easier to clean and that, by having them straightened, people can lower the likelihood of gum disease, tooth decay, and loss. But a direct correlation has never been made between less crowded teeth and cleaner teeth. "You'd think crowding would make it more difficult to clean teeth and gums," says Forbes. "But clear-cut proof has not been made. If one doesn't diligently brush, one can miss areas, crowding or no crowding."<p>Whether or not teeth will hold their alignment once the braces are removed is another question parents need to consider. In a study of 600 former patients by orthodontics professor Robert Little of the University of Washington-Seattle, 70 percent of the patients' teeth had slightly moved toward their original positions ten years after being treated for crowding. Since adult jaws continue to narrow over time, doctors are increasingly asking patients to consider wearing removable retainers for longer periods of time, sometimes indefinitely, to keep their teeth from crowding again.<p>Questions of value notwithstanding, young people know why they want braces. According to one doctor's survey, 85 percent of parents with kids under the age of 16 took them to an orthodontist simply to improve their looks. <p><p>

						<p>It can save time, but it's hard to sue for malpractice<p>By Stuart Weiss<p>There's nothing like a legal- software package to turn a virtuous layperson into a virtual lawyer, satisfying the deepest desires of ordinary human beings to dispense instant justice and protect their wealth simultaneously. Want to disinherit your undeserving spouse? Click! Reward a deserving niece or nephew? Click! Revoke or change a power of attorney? Click! <p>If it all smacks of a game or simulation, you're better off thinking of it that way. Software publishers warn you not to substitute their programs for living, breathing legal counsel. Far more visibly, however, their packaging touts the 50-state legal validity of the documents produced by the software. Between the promise of court approval and the threat of egregious error, the real value of the applications becomes obscured. <p>One sobersided argument is that running your legal work through a computer program before taking it to a lawyer will save him time and you money. This argument is probably overstated but does have some merit. When you visit a lawyer, the meter is on the minute you make eye contact. The preliminary work--fact gathering and document printing--could be done at home on a PC. Of course, the time you save is reduced by the several hours of work it takes to install and learn a program. Think of this as a cost. And if your hard disk is crowded with intriguing applications that you never had time to learn, you have another reason to hesitate before adding to the clutter. <p>One of the more comprehensive programs is It's Legal for Windows, by Parsons Technology, which sells for $69. On ten megabytes of hard-disk space this program gives you a library of documents and the procedures for editing them. You can draw up wills, contracts, corporate minutes, prenuptial agreements, sales contracts, living wills, and more. There are probably several dozen such packages for $100 or less. The Parsons program is one of the best in this class, and also one of the biggest sellers. <p>Certainly it's smart to learn as much as you can about a legal topic before visiting your attorney. 'I wouldn't object to a client running through a program before coming in," says Paul M. Stokes, a trusts and estates attorney with Kelley Drye & Warren in Miami, 'because 25 percent of my time is spent on education. I think it's possible to develop software that leads you through a number of questions. At some point, it should say, 'Go see a lawyer. Press F1 for a list of lawyers in your neighborhood.'"<p>In general, few lawyers think much of consumer legal software. This probably would be the case even if the programs were more valuable. But even putting their self-interest aside, some of their objections seem sensible.<p>Computers are easily satisfied with the answers to the questions they pose. That can create serious factual and legal errors in computer documents. 'How many children do you have? "the legal software asks a couple drafting a will. The husband and wife, each with children by previous marriages, may answer 'one" if they're thinking only of the one they had together, the one they want to inherit their estates. A thorough human lawyer, however, would determine whether other children by previous marriages might assert a claim.<p>Lawyers 'serve as a double-checker," says Evelyn Capassakis, an attorney and manager in the New York office of accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand's personal financial-services division. She adds, though, that legal software can be helpful in preparing a balance sheet. 'The financial questions," says Capassakis, 'tend to be more cut-and-dried" than the personal questions.<p>Legal software can give careless users a spurious sense of confidence. 'Just because the boilerplate is being done for you doesn't mean you're obtaining an appropriate end product, "says Scott Kamin, an attorney in Portland, Oregon. 'Human affairs are like snowflakes. No two are alike."<p>Says Lynn Jahn, group leader at Parsons Technology, 'Our intent is not to replace a lawyer. If you look carefully at the [It's Legal for Windows] help system and the manual, there are a lot of places where we advise you to go see your attorney. A lot of attorneys aren't computer literate yet, so I can understand their fear of this." Computer literate or not, lawyers must stand behind their work in a way that software publishers do not: Human lawyers can be sued for malpractice. Publishers place so many disclaimers on these products that it would difficult to sue them successfully for that.<p><p><p>

Don't miss out on your employer's benefits<p>By Mary Rowland<p>Despite continued cost cutting by many employers, not all the news on the benefits front is dour. Many companies are actually adding to the roster of perks that they offer employees. The new trick, though, involves learning what the benefits are.<p>"The hot benefits area is work/family opportunities," says Rosanna Z. Milley, a principal at the Apex Management Group in Princeton, New Jersey. "But most employers are not giving out information. You have to find out about them yourself."<p>Why are companies staying mum about these goodies? It's hard to generalize, but a cynic might suspect some employers are downplaying benefits to keep costs low while still complying with new laws or showing off--at least on paper--to the board of directors, outside consultants, Wall Street, and human-rights groups. Whatever the reason, employees now have to play detective to avoid missing out on obscure but valuable perks. <p>Here's what to look for:<p>--Maternity leave. If you're expecting a child, your human-resources department will provide the basic leave policy. But to get the real lowdown, you should talk with a number of employees who have recently had babies. Find out what kinds of arrangements the mother and/or father got. For example, some companies allow employees to stockpile vacation and personal days to use as leave when the baby comes--if, that is, they make such plans in advance. Others have a number of options for parents returning to work. "Many companies have a lot of phased back-to-work options that are known only to the underground network," says Angela Watson in the Washington, D.C., office of the Wyatt Co., a benefits consulting firm. "Maybe you can work 50 percent of the time and get 50 percent of pay or even 100 percent of pay." <p>The company may also agree to job sharing or working at home; ask about it. In smaller companies it may be even easier to cut extraordinary deals. "Family leave is often not formalized," says David Oberkircher, a consultant in Wayne, Pennsylvania. "You can pioneer a new program simply by asking." <p>--Adoption benefits. Many companies pay $1,500 to $5,000 toward the cost of adopting a child. "But you won't find it in the company manual," says Maureen McCoslin, a consultant in the Dallas office of Hewitt Associates.<p>--Sick-child care. When a child has an illness such as the chicken pox, some companies will pay for someone to take care of him or her so an employee doesn't have to miss work. Johnson & Johnson, for instance, offers this kind of child care.<p>--Free overnight child care for business travel. "My company reimbursed me $600 or $700 last year for overnight child care," Hewitt's McCoslin reports. "But many of our employees don't even know about the benefit."<p>--Financial-services perks. Many companies offer a credit union, which can be a great deal for employees, with low-interest-rate loans and credit cards and higher interest rates on savings accounts. Many have no-fee checking. Employers may also hook up with a bank that offers no-fee checking to employees as well as home-mortgage loans and refinancings at lower fees and with much less red tape.<p>--Concierge or errand services. "Some employers have begun to contract with an outside service to come in and pick up dry cleaning and shoe repairs and do grocery shopping," McCoslin says. <a name="NYSE:PEP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11166"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PepsiCo</b></a>, for example, offers such a service to employees at its corporate headquarters in Purchase, New York. <p>--Discounts. These can range from fleet discounts on cars to $2 off on movie tickets and $11 discounts at theme parks. Some companies offer their employees discounts on computers and the opportunity to pay for them through payroll deductions. It's just a matter of hunting them down. Paging through a policy and procedure manual of a client--CALTEX Petroleum Corp.--McCoslin discovered that it offered employees fleet discounts. "When you buy a car at the fleet price, there's a difference in both price and quality of service," she says. Yet the company didn't consider it important enough to make any sort of general announcement. "Most of these things are just word of mouth," McCoslin says.<p>--Wellness benefits. A number of companies offer free checkups, immunizations, mammograms, and blood-pressure and cholesterol testing. Some also offer a free health-club membership or a reimbursement for part of the club's fee.<p>--Career-development training and educational-assistance benefits. Often companies will pay for all or part of further education such as college or graduate school for their employees. Many of today's business leaders have M.B.A.s they got while on the job, at their employers' expense.<p>Some companies are beginning to add work/family coordinators, which is an excellent starting point for tracking down newly available benefits. Another place to look is at a company's employee assistance program, or EAP. Most big employers have them--81 percent of the firms surveyed by Hewitt Associates in 1993. Under the umbrella of the EAP, an employee might find dependent-care referrals, financial, legal, and tax advice, family and marital counseling, physical-fitness programs, stress counseling, crisis intervention, supervisory training, elder care, and help with on-the-job performance problems. <p>"Research is the key," Milley says. "If you know one of these areas will have an impact in your life this year, or that you will have a specific kind of demand, you have to start poking around to see what resources are available." <p><p><p>

Is Wall Street celebrating the wrong numbers?<p>By Jim Jubak<p>Economists on wall street worried about inflation have been greeting each statistic issued by the U.S. government with great sighs of relief. Payrolls rose only 183,000 in December, way below the 215,000 expected. And in December, the producer price index actually fell 0.1 percent. No inflation in sight means no threat of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve, or so say the economists.<p>But the Fed is probably examining different numbers to get its own inflation read. That's the view of James Stack, Fed watcher and editor of The InvestTech Market Analyst. A review of Fed tightenings in 1983, '84, and '87 tells Stack that the Fed's key indicators include capacity utilization, consumer-credit demand, and the consumer sentiment and consumer confidence indexes. Those numbers paint a picture that's likely to cause a fretful Fed, Stack says.<p>Capacity utilization, for example, measures the percentage of productive capacity that is currently in use. Utilization hit 83 percent in November, up from 78.9 percent a year earlier and 77 percent during the recession's low. Rising numbers like these are signs of inflation to come.<p>Stack is now watching the consumer-confidence numbers most closely. The consumer confidence index ended 1993 on the strongest two-month bounce in its 25-year history. Preliminary consumer-sentiment numbers point to a 7-point rise in January, which would bring that index to its highest level since 1989. "Will this latest surge in consumer confidence fall back as the economists are expecting?" Stack asks. Or will it remain high and worrisome? The Fed will be watching.<p><p>

Does your relationship need a major adjustment?<p>By Jill Andresky Fraser<p>For all the attention paid to hiring one, little if any information is available about when--and how--to fire a financial advisor. Yet avoiding or delaying a decision to cut the cord can be quite costly. <p>All too often clients are intimidated or confused about their rights and expectations in their relationships with financial planners, brokers, and accountants. Many people have a sense something's wrong but resist taking action because they don't know who else to go to or whether it's even worth the effort. And there's that guilt factor about firing someone you like personally. "I see these kinds of delays very often," says David Shellenberger, a Boston-based attorney who specializes in investor claims against financial advisors. "It's psychologically very difficult for people to understand that their trust has been breached. So they delay, often for years." <p>Of course there's nothing to be gained by waiting to fire an incompetent or unethical advisor. To make the decision, it's often helpful to have objective guidelines that indicate when it's time to call it quits. Although every situation is different, there are three clear warning signs that an advisory relationship isn't working:<p>--Poor results. Does your financial planner or stockbroker seem to consistently recommend strategies that don't work out as planned? Are you getting audited or penalized by the IRS regularly over tax plays your accountant recommended? When you evaluate your family's financial results, do you suspect you would have been better off investing on your own? To establish an objective basis on which to evaluate performance, clearly set out in writing the goals your advisor is expected to help you achieve and the results you expect to move your portfolio toward that end. Use specific numbers and deadlines whenever possible--for example, beat the market index, earn a 7 percent after-tax annual return, increase life-insurance coverage to $500,000 by the end of the first quarter, etc. Your expectations should be clear, reasonable, agreed to by both parties, and most important, measurable. Then set a time to meet and review the results. And while nobody's perfect, don't be too quick to overlook an advisor's shortcomings. "You've got to aggressively question your advisor about what went wrong in the past and how things will be different in the future. If you're not satisfied with the answers or explanations, move on," advises John Perkins, the securities commissioner of Missouri. <p>--Communication problems. These can run the gamut, warns Christine Bruenn, supervisor of enforcement for the Securities Administration of Maine, from advisors who don't return telephone calls promptly to those who "don't listen to your priorities about risks and returns." If, for whatever reason, you feel you just can't get through to your advisor, complain once or twice--then take your family's business elsewhere.<p>Don't dismiss intangible concerns, such as a feeling that you're just not comfortable with your advisor. They can reflect a sensitivity to high-pressure tactics or high-risk recommendations that are inappropriate for you. If you don't feel comfortable, there's probably a reason.<p>One caveat: Sometimes clients themselves are the problem, as when, in Perkins's words, "they tell their advisors that they don't want to be involved in risky investments but they want to earn large returns." In such cases, it's up to advisors to communicate the trade-offs between those two goals and to help clients set more realistic expectations. But the client also has to help.<p>--Churning and burning. Here's where advisors may cross the fuzzy boundary between incompetent and unethical activities--and in egregious cases, clients might even want to think about suing, as well as firing, an advisor. <p>One obvious no-no: Transactions (purchasing stocks, transferring funds between accounts, paying fees) that take place without approval or authorization from the client. Often the only way to identify that this has happened is by analyzing bank, brokerage, and other regular financial statements. That's a good reason not to rely on an advisor to read and file these for you.<p>Another all-too-common warning sign is account churning. "Watch out for advisors that keep pushing you to carry out an excessively high volume of transactions," warns Stephen Diamond, Maine's securities administrator. Remember that you pay, and your broker earns, a commission every time you buy and every time you sell a stock. Make sure each transaction that a broker suggests makes investment sense to you.<p>Here's the bottom line: You, not your financial advisor, are your family's last line of defense in the investment arena. It's up to you to supervise your advisor's performance and, when you're not satisfied, move on.<p>Fortunately, the act of firing a financial advisor is nowhere near as difficult as deciding whether or not to fire him or her. The key point: Do it by mail (return receipt requested) rather than by telephone. It's not as personal, but a letter preserves a record of your complete instructions, including the date the relationship was terminated. <p>If you suspect you might have some grounds for a legal complaint against your advisor, "hire a lawyer to prepare your termination letter," advises Shellenberger. "The letter should be very straightforward, directing the advisor to terminate the account, effective immediately, and to transfer promptly all financial records, securities, and other documents to an authorized location." <p>Above all, avoid recriminations or complaints. Shellenberger warns, "If you make any statements in your letter about why you're ending the relationship, you might end up limiting your rights and ability to sue later on because you failed to disclose other problems. It's better to end the relationship first, then decide upon other actions if appropriate." <p><p>

Who wins, who loses with age-weighted profit-sharing<p>By Donald Jay Korn<p>This story is for small-business owners who'd like to know how to keep a greater share of company profits for themselves. It's also for small-business employees who'd like to know what their bosses might be up to. The subject: "Age weighted" profit-sharing plans.<p>For anyone who owns a small business, such plans offer a tempting arrangement. This is especially true for very small companies, such as professional practices or other businesses where one or two people generate virtually all the revenues with clerical or administrative help from their staff.<p>The owners of such businesses often don't like plain vanilla profit-sharing programs because the federal government, in its efforts to ensure the fair treatment of all employees, requires that they distribute profits based on a percentage of income that's the same for everybody, regardless of their position or level of contribution to the company. Thus, if the owners determine that 15 percent is the figure that their outfit will pay, then an $18,000-a-year employee gets $2,700 and an $80,000 employee gets $12,000. The only adjustment is a cap on the upper level of income. It makes no difference if someone makes $200,000 or even $2 million a year; the base compensation for profit-sharing purposes is capped at $150,000. This cap increases with inflation.<p>Enter the age-weighted profit-sharing plan as approved by the Internal Revenue Service last summer. The idea behind this new scheme was to allow larger contributions on behalf of older employees, because they have fewer years for their funds to compound. Age-weighted plans pass the nondiscrimination test because they are based on tomorrow's projected benefit rather than on today's contribution. That is, $5,000 put in a plan today will be worth a lot more at retirement to someone who is 30 years old than it will be to someone who's 55. <p>Naturally, the major beneficiaries of an age-weighted plan are the older participants, which in smaller companies tend to be the owners. "If you have one 50-year-old owner while all the employees are low-paid, in their 20s and 30s, a simple age-weighted plan might be a good match," says Marjorie Martin, an actuary and director of technical information services at benefits consultant Sedgwick Noble Lowndes in Roseland, New Jersey.<p>However, a plan structured this way may not delight younger principals, whose share can slip sharply. An age-weighted plan also can force employers to make a large contribution on behalf of a low-paid but elderly employee (or even cause companies to shy away from hiring older people even though they're otherwise qualified).<p>The solution to these age-weighted problems lies in a further twist called "comparability" plans, which take age-weighting a bit further. In them, the company can designate groups of employees based on virtually any objective standard it wants and then apply the age-weighting to the average age of each group. For instance, a business might designate an owner group and a group containing the other employees. If the owner group has an average age of 47.5 while the employee group averages 29, much larger contributions could go to the older group, which includes the owners. "I recently helped a professional practice restructure a plan so that the principals' contributions went from 50 percent to 83 percent of the total," says Norman Newman, a partner in the New York law firm Winston & Strawn. <p>As pleasing as this result may be for business owners, it's not the only reason for establishing a comparability plan. "Frequently, employers want to do more for their long-term, most valued employees," says James Thomas, director of retirement-plan marketing at the New England, the Boston-based insurance giant. A comparability plan might include the owners in one group, key employees in another group, non-key workers in a third group. As long as the most valued employees are older than the others, comparability plans can boost their retirement contributions.<p>Obviously, comparability plans won't work where owners are younger than other employees or if an employer wants to use the profit-sharing plan to attract talented young people. They can be more expensive than other profit-sharing plans because of the costs of having an actuarial firm calculate the age-weighted projections.<p>There's a larger potential hitch down the road. Last fall, the Labor Department proposed legislation that would eliminate age-weighted retirement plans. Today, the outcome is still anybody's guess, but plans that already exist may be grandfathered in. For small-business owners, that emphasizes the need to take advantage of one of the best tax shelters available before it's too late. On the other hand, if you are a young employee of a small business, make sure your boss doesn't see this article any time soon. <p>Look to funds that have superior five-and ten-year numbers. These are funds that have proved their ability to survive tougher times.

Demand is up, but so are the yields for muni bonds<p>By Robert N. Veres<p>A peculiar thing happened when Congress raised income-tax rates last fall: The yields on tax-free municipal bonds actually went up. Way up, in fact. <p>All things being equal, this shouldn't have happened. The increased demand from investors with a new incentive to seek tax-free returns should have pushed up bond prices, causing their yields to fall. But all things weren't equal.<p>At the same time that Congress boosted tax rates, the market was growing concerned that the general decline in interest rates had bottomed out and might now begin to creep upward. Municipal borrowers rushed to refinance before this happened and flooded the market with new issues of bonds. The increased supply exceeded the increase in demand, forcing yields up and creating even better opportunities for tax-burdened investors.<p>By mid-November, taxable 20-year Treasury bonds were yielding about 6.35 percent. But high-quality munis of the same maturity were yielding up to 5.65 percent. For someone in the 40 percent tax bracket, that's equal to a taxable yield of 9.42 percent. "This is one of the few times, historically, when even people at a 15 percent tax rate should look at munis," says Judy Shine, a financial planner in Englewood, Colorado.<p>Investors who want to take advantage of today's high muni rates have several options. They can buy mutual funds that invest in munis, or they can buy bonds directly. Mutual funds probably make the most sense for people with less than $10,000 to invest. Investors in high-tax states often like funds that invest only in bonds from their state, to escape state as well as federal taxes. However, in-state funds have generally underperformed diversified funds in recent years.<p>Also beware of funds with risky portfolios (bonds with the longest maturities and/or the lowest credit quality). Although such funds were handsomely rewarded when rates were still declining, some of the highfliers recently have been taking a beating. <p>Muni-fund investors should look past the three-year rankings to funds that have superior five- and ten-year numbers. These are funds that have proved their ability to survive tougher times. Before investing in a fund, check its performance during three periods that were especially hard on munis: fourth-quarter 1993, October 1992, and the first three quarters of 1987.<p>Taxpayers who buy muni bonds directly should avoid several traps. Remember that muni income can increase taxes for people who receive Social Security. And be wary of brokers who recommend buying munis with 20-year maturities or longer. These provide higher tax-exempt yield, but if interest rates rise during the next 20 years, the value of these bonds will get hammered. <p>One good approach takes advantage of the refinancing frenzy. When a bond issue is refinanced, it is typically not paid off immediately. Instead, the issuer "retires" the old debt by purchasing Treasury bonds to be held until the bond is paid off, also known as the call date, removing the credit risk entirely. The old issue becomes AAA-rated short-term paper, with a high coupon rate. <p>Because these bonds are priced above their par value, many investors avoid them. This creates bargains for those investors who understand their appeal. "Retail consumers don't like to pay 109 cents on the dollar for a bond," says Ray Kuipers, who runs the bond-trading desk at Nathan & Lewis Securities in New York. "So you can usually get a better price and more bang for the buck."<p>The bang, in this case, is tax-exempt yield. Recently, Bear, Stearns in New York was offering bonds issued by the New Jersey Health Care Authority, originally paying 8.38 percent a year, for a price of 115.5. The bonds are now prerefunded, with a maturity of a little over four years at a price of 102. That means investors who bought them on the recent offering got a current yield of 7.25 percent and a yield to maturity of 4.25 percent. Compare this with the 4.05 percent annual yields typical for five-year munis priced at par. <p>These refinancings won't go on forever. Nor, alas, will today's low interest rates. Opportunistic investors will act quickly.   <p><p>

Why some financial planners claim to be both fee-only and commission-based<p>
By Jill Andresky Fraser<p>
How do you pay your financial planner? Sometimes it's not easy to tell. Labels such as "fee only," "fee offset" and "fee and commission" obscure rather than reveal how planners earn their livelihoods. For example, "fee based" refers to a commission planner without ever using the "C" word.<p>
The result of this confusion? People are probably paying more than they should and possibly getting bad advice. "If people don't understand a planner's compensation structure," warns Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Washington-based Consumer Federation of America, "they can't assess whether his or her recommendations are really independent--the way they would be from a true fee-only planner--or whether they might have been influenced by commissions or other payments." <p>
Some planners operate two practices, one fee-only and the other commission-based (labels vary, but that's what they mean). In some rare cases planners hide those connections--which is illegal. But even when they disclose both types of practices to their clients, an important question arises: Does this arrangement reduce the conflicts of interest that commissions entail or merely mask them?<p>
The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, a professional organization for fee-only financial planners, believes that operating two kinds of practices simply masks the conflicts. "Under our definition, a fee-only planner is compensated solely by the client," explains Andrew Hudick, a Roanoke, Virginia, planner who is NAPFA's vice president of membership. "There are a lot of people out there who call themselves fee-only planners but cannot qualify for membership in NAPFA because they also operate affiliate brokerage or retirement-planning businesses where they receive commissions."<p>
How do these combined practices work? Jeffrey Franklin runs such a practice in New York City, which he says he has structured "so that there is a fee-only side that does financial planning for a fee and a fee-and-commission-based practice." As a commission-based planner, he sells insurance and investments, largely mutual funds. "In my mind there's a Chinese wall between planning and implementation," he explains, using the industry euphemism for distinguishing between giving advice and selling products. "You can use one person to do both or you can use two people to do both, and I'll work either way."<p>
Both Franklin and NAPFA's Hudick are diligent about explaining their compensation structures so clients understand what they're paying for. Others aren't so diligent.<p>
"People who want to shave the edges and get away with confusing clients can do so," says Ellyn Brown, a professor at the University of Maryland Law School.<p>

						November 1993
Worth magazine/Q&A<p>Q&A<p>Edited by Bob Clark<p>Q: I am very interested in real estate investing, but I am confused on a couple of issues. Can you tell me about the tax-free exchange of appreciated property: Is it possible, for instance, to swap investment real estate for publicly held shares of a real estate investment trust (REIT) or some holding without incurring a taxable event?<p>
A: The short answer is no; you can't make a tax-free swap of investment real estate for shares in an REIT. But you can make a tax-free swap of one investment property for another investment property. Tax on the gain is postponed until you subsequently sell or exchange the new property.<p>Basically, for the exchange to qualify as tax-free, your current property must be traded for property of a "like kind." The exchange can't be done for an immediate resale, and you can't exchange U.S. real estate for foreign real estate.<p>It may appear simple, but the law in this area is very complicated. Investors shouldn't attempt a tax-free exchange without the advice of an experienced real estate tax attorney.<p>
Q: I've heard that Bill Clinton's new tax bill is more beneficial to those who donate appreciated assets, like stocks, to charity. If this is so, what are the benefits?<p>A: You heard right. Under the new tax bill, upper-bracket taxpayers who give a lot will have more to feel good about. For one thing, the higher marginal tax rates imposed on the so-called rich (loosely defined as anyone who makes more than a member of Congress) mean that they get a higher tax deduction for charitable donations. But the big news involves charity-minded taxpayers affected by the onerous alternative minimum tax (AMT). <p>Under the old tax law, people who made a donation of property that had appreciated well beyond its original cost risked losing a portion of the tax benefit. This was because, under the AMT, some of the property's appreciation had to be added back to the taxpayer's net income. Under the new law, gifts of appreciated property that have been held for one year or more are excluded from AMT calculations. This is good news both to those who want to make large donations and to the charities who will receive them.<p>
Q: There's been a lot of hoopla about investing in international stock funds, but I haven't seen much on foreign bond funds. Should a fixed-income investor like myself consider the global market? <p>A: For the past three years international bond funds have underperformed almost all categories of U.S. bond funds. But there are compelling reasons for income-oriented investors who have traditionally shied away from foreign bond funds to take a look at them now. <p>Today the U.S. has the lowest bond yields of all the world's major economies, except Japan. At the end of August, ten-year U.S. Treasurys were yielding 5.5 percent against 8.8 percent in Norway, 7.5 percent in Sweden, and 9.6 percent in Italy. Even in the U.K., where interest rates have fallen sharply, ten-year government bonds yield 6.8 percent.<p>Higher yields abroad are not unusual. In the last 30 years, foreign bonds have yielded 3 percent more on average each year than their U.S. counterparts.<p>Interest rates are falling in major European countries as central banks ease credit to stimulate flagging economies. That opens the way to the same sort of capital gains that bond investors reaped in the U.S. earlier this year. Although European rates have already dropped significantly in the past two years, many market strategists think rates could continue to drop in 1994. Investors interested in capitalizing on any further decline in European rates can do so by investing in one of the many global bond funds that have recently come to market. <p>In addition to interest-rate risks, investors in foreign bonds must accept the risk that weakening foreign currencies can wipe out some or all of the earnings made in foreign bond markets. As last year's turmoil in Europe showed, currency movements can play havoc with the total returns on foreign bonds. <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>'s Short-Term Global B fund, for example, lost 3.3 percent in 1992, largely due to currency changes. Many funds now hedge against adverse currency movements, though the cost of such hedging reduces investment income. But because bond markets around the world move in different directions at different times, the returns on a diversified global portfolio should outweigh the risks. <p>
Q: I would like to know if it's really a good idea to keep all my cash and securities in my brokerage account, what they call the "street name," as most brokers suggest. Also, how safe are large accounts ($500,000 to $2.5 million) that are said to be covered by the firm's insurance?<p>A: If a brokerage firm holds an investor's certificates, they may be held in either the investor's name or in the name of the firm, known as the street name. If your stocks are held in your firm's name, the brokerage shows up on the list of the corporation's shareholders, even though you are the actual owner.<p>Having a brokerage firm hold your stock makes it easier to sell your shares in a hurry. It is also the only way to borrow against your shares. But the primary advantage to having the broker hold your securities in a street-name account is that the firm takes responsibility for safeguarding them. All firms are insured against loss of the certificates. <p>But don't confuse insurance against certificate loss with insurance against market loss. The value of Wang Labs stock held in street name, for example, is chump change today, even though it is still insured against theft or loss by brokers. <p><p>

How do your parents affect the way you think about money?<p>By Mary Rowland<p>I am a schizophrenic where money is concerned, and I know precisely why. Growing up in rural Minnesota, my father had some of the fanciest cars, trucks, and equipment around. Budgeting, saving, investing, were not in his vocabulary, and lack of money never stopped him from buying or doing things. My mom, on the other hand, was frugal from childhood. She didn't spend money on herself, and she derived no enjoyment from the things that money could buy.<p>Not surprisingly, growing up with parents that were such polar opposites had an effect on me. As might be expected, given these conflicting genes, I developed something of a confused money mind-set. Although it's easy to understand, it is nonetheless difficult to shake off. Sometimes I refuse to spend money on things I need, like new socks or underwear. Sometimes I splurge and spend what I don't have. And then I lie awake at night and fret about it. <p>Feeling neutral about money comes hard. Most purchases have two prices--one financial, one emotional. And psychologists say that most of our money attitudes, values, and phobias are either adopted from our parents or developed as a rejection of our parents' ideas. "There are patterns in our thinking about money that go way back to the nursery," says Linda Barbanel, a New York psychologist who specializes in money issues and is the author of Piggybank to Credit Card: Teach Your Child the Financial Facts of Life, due out in February from Crown. "As a child, you hear and assimilate attitudes about money before you really understand them."<p>For those with similar or other money problems inherited from well-meaning parents,take heart.There is a strong case to be made for trying to work things through, and yes, it can be done. Feeling comfortable with money is an essential ingredient to a contented life. <p>Experts say that most people have several dysfunctional areas. If you're head over heels in debt, you know that's a problem. But many money problems are more subtle; in fact, they're almost subliminal. Take me, for example. I am financially responsible. I have life and disability insurance, a retirement account, and college accounts for the kids. I know how to pick a good mutual fund. I am a risk taker. But spending money gives me a headache. On vacations I find myself compulsively trying to create some type of money-to-fun index. How much are we spending? Are we having $2,500 worth of fun yet? Shop till I drop? Buying school clothes, going out to dinner, or buying a pair of shoes can be agonizing for me.<p>Fortunately, there are solutions to even the most deeply rooted money misconduct, and they don't require years of therapy. First we need to spend some time thinking about how our parents dealt with money, how it has affected us, and whether we are happy with the result. "As adults, it's very important that we think about what our parents taught us and what we believe," says Esther Berger, author of Money Smart: Secrets Women Need to Know About Money (Simon & Schuster). "We all need to evaluate where our attitudes come from, what shaped them, and where we are going today--to separate out money and emotions and learn to deal with money on a logical plane." <p>Not only is this self-examination good for your soul, it is also good for your kids' souls. After all, most of us don't want to pass on our own dysfunctional money attitudes to our inheritors as we would the antique silver. "People should be willing to work through them and solve this now," Berger says. "Some of the crazy things that guide our money decisions as adults can have very negative repercussions for our children.'' No sense continuing the chain.<p>Ideally, the experts say, parents teach their children to save some money, invest wisely, pay the bills, spend a little on enjoyment, give something to charity, and never think about what they don't have. "When children are lucky, money is treated just as a medium to obtain what is necessary or what is pleasurable, and there is some sense of balance in what should be saved and what should be spent," says Dr. Mio Fredland, a New York child and adolescent psychiatrist. But that is an ideal too few parents can realize. <p>Financial dysfunctionality need not be terminal, however. Here are some examples of how professionals have used their parents' money outlook--dysfunctional or not--to their own advantage:<p>~~ Berger, who is a first vice president at PaineWebber, grew up in a wealthy Cleveland family. She bought into much of what she learned at home. "To a large extent, my parents drew up the yardsticks for me," she says. "Much of what I attach financial value to is the same as my parents." Although she now lives in Beverly Hills, she still applies her Cleveland mentality to her purchases. Before spending money, Berger asks herself whether something is "worth it." Flying first class, $100 dinners, and Ray-Ban sunglasses are not worth it. "I'd rather eat pizza," she says. <p>Berger has picked up some of her parents' peccadillos as well. "My dad always bought very, very good shoes," she says. "He always thought a well-dressed man was judged by his shoes." As a result, shoes are one thing Berger refuses to skimp on. <p>Like her parents, she hates to be in debt. So she makes extra mortgage payments periodically to bring her balance down, even though she could probably find better, more productive places to invest that money. <p>But Berger has modified, somewhat, the behavior she learned as a child. Because she is half of a two-income household and the mother of three sons, she's tossed out the aspects of her parents' frugality that involve time-consuming bargain hunts. To Berger, time is more precious than that. "My mother will go 30 miles out of her way to save one dollar on a pair of slippers," Berger says. For the daughter, that doesn't work. "I blend the messages I got as a young child with what works for me as an adult," she says. <p>~~ Dr. Danella Schiffer, an industrial psychologist who grew up in New York City, also adopted many of her family's money values. But then she tinkered with the formula to make her life a little more pleasurable. Her parents, for example, never bought anything on credit. Schiffer uses a credit card, but for convenience only. She has never paid interest on anything but a mortgage.<p>On the other hand, she refuses to adopt the same parsimony that dictated her parents' spending. "My parents always bought the bottom of the line on everything," Schiffer says. Although she won't buy until she has the cash, when she has it, she goes first class. Her car has plush leather seats. In 1975, she bought eight acres of land in Connecticut and built a home that has been featured in House Beautiful. She enjoys spending money on landscaping and is willing to hire artisans to copy museum pieces that she loves--as long as she can pay with cash.<p>~~ Violet P. Woodhouse rejected nearly everything she learned about money from her foster parents. She grew up on an Alaska farm, a hardscrabble life with little money for pleasure. "I always felt like I was an alien," she says. "I never belonged with those people." Woodhouse knew that farming--and scraping by--was not for her. "I understood somewhere early on that people did make money and that that wasn't how you did it," she says. Woodhouse became a financial planner and then, in her early 30s, decided to go to law school. Today she specializes in family law and financial planning for divorce.<p>Woodhouse says that her parents, like most, never discussed money with her. As a result, in her adult life she had to unlearn the habit of feeling squeamish about discussing money with people hired to work for her. "How many people ask their life insurance salesman how much commission he's making?" asks Woodhouse, who is the author of Divorce and Money (Nolo Press). Most of Woodhouses's clients will ask her: What is your hourly rate? What is your retainer? "But they just don't go beyond that," she says. "Most people don't understand that everything is negotiable. Lawyers need business, and there's a lot you can do to negotiate." <p>Woodhouse is now exceedingly up-front in money discussions. When she and her husband remodeled their house recently, they asked the contractor for a rundown on prices of all the materials as well as what he was making on the job. "He didn't like it," she says. "But that's the way I do business."<p>For many people the money problems inherited from parents are more deep-seated and difficult to change. Psychologist Schiffer, who evaluates top executives to determine their suitability for job openings and promotions, says she sees many clients who come from dysfunctional families. If the parents had problems with gambling, alcohol, or mental illness and there was little money for necessities, the children are often determined, to a fault, to move in the opposite direction. "They become very conservative, cautious people who are afraid to make a misstep lest they end up like their parents," she says. One of the problems for people who grow up in such households is that they become too risk averse, which can then impede their career development. It is also difficult for them to find pleasure in spending money on themselves.<p>Even more damaging are parents who use money as a means of control. They are willing to buy expensive things for their children, but only if the things reflect well on them. When the child chooses something for himself, they are unwilling to pay for it.<p>Another trick is to use money as a reward for good behavior or obedience. The effects of this behavior can be very long lasting. Says child psychologist Fredland: "This creates a child who is never able to completely grow up, because they feel forever that they need to receive money in order to feel that they're good."<p>Fredland sees a number of patients who have money-related problems. "It's never the only problem," she says. "But it can be destructive." For example, one woman grew up with a mother who bought her very expensive, conventional clothes for occasions that were important to the mother. "The mother was extremely interested in having her children perform well socially," Fredland says. But when the daughter wanted money for clothes of her own choosing, she got a quick turndown. "When the girl wanted something teenage and funky, the mother said no," Fredland says. <p>As an adult, the daughter got head over heels in debt. "She overloaded her credit cards and got into trouble," Fredland says. "When she bought clothes, she was giving herself a present and she was rebelling at the same time. She got into terrible trouble for it."<p>Many children who grow up with serious money struggles see money as good or bad; magic or evil. They reward or punish themselves by buying or not buying something. If they are good, they can buy a treat. If they are bad, they must do without. This is the kind of conflict that can require counseling. "One of the things I do when I meet clients is to have them stop and think about their ideas about money," says Cecily Maton, a financial planner in Chicago who specializes in the finances of people who divorce. "If people reward themselves with a spending spree, they need a psychologist, not a financial planner."<p>But most of us can work through these issues ourselves, come to a better understanding of why we react to money as we do, change the things we don't like, and keep from passing them on to our kids. In his 1979 book, Kids and Cash, now out of print, Ken Davis, a stockbroker, wrote: "Money must be recognized as a useful tool, not an object to be sought for its own sake. Recognition by a child that money has no value except in exchange for other things they want or need is important to getting the proper perspective on how money should fit into their lives."<p>Davis suggests that parents help their kids feel comfortable about money; that they avoid attributing magic or evil characteristics to it; that they help their children understand that money itself should not be a goal. "If you spend every dime before it is earned, it will be more difficult to teach your kids to save," he says. "If you save every dime except what is needed for the bare essentials, your kids may learn to save but might never learn how to enjoy what they accumulate." <p>As in other aspects of life, it's balance that we're after. Money is a necessary tool that we must learn to use dispassionately. Once we've accomplished that, we need to teach our kids the very same lesson.<p>Mary Rowland, a columnist for the New York Times, writes about personal finance from New York City. <p><p><p><p>

Four up on Wall Street:  Speed-reading the legends<p>By Curtis Hartman<p>Each fall brings its flood of new investment books. Each spring flushes most of them out again--as soon as investors figure out that they won't get so rich in the next depression that they can retire at age 35 to swim with the sharks and not get eaten.<p>Still there are a handful of books about investment and money management that have lasted. These are the vaunted tomes containing the wisdom, knowledge, and advice every investor needs.<p>They are also, for the most part, extremely boring. <p>You didn't read these books in college. They stared at you through business school, and you've been promising yourself you'll get to security analysis--just as soon as you finish the latest Tom Clancy doorstop.<p>That's where we come in. Like the folks at cliffs notes, whose yellow-and-black-covered summaries have spared generations of students from actually reading middlemarch, worth has boiled down to their essentials four of the most-cited investment classics. <p>We won't go so far as to suggest that you substitute our summaries for the real thing. But we hope that these crib sheets will at least prepare 
you for tomorrow's call to your broker. <p>
Thesis:
Buy low, sell high. The only way to consistently make money is to find stocks with value that the market has not recognized. Over the long term, the market will catch on, and the price of the stock will go up. This requires rigorous statistical analysis; anything less is mere speculation.<p><p>1. SECURITY ANALYSIS BY BENJAMIN GRAHAM AND DAVID DODD
Impact:
security analysis (mcgraw-hill) has been the training manual for professional investors for half a century, and it remains the bible for most practitioners today. Disciples include Sir John Templeton and Warren Buffett, both of whom studied under Benjamin Graham. In general, value stocks--that is, stocks that are priced by the market for less than they'd be worth if the company were liquidated--do worse in fat times and better in lean. From 1980 to '83, for example, value stocks returned 19.9 percent compared with 14.7 percent for growth stocks (that is, stocks that are valued by anticipating their future earnings) and 17 percent for the S&P 500. But between '89 and '91 growth stocks were stronger, returning 20.8 percent to the S&P's 18.5 percent and value stocks' 13.5 percent. In 1992 and the first half of 1993, value stocks have, once again, been in fashion, notching a 14.6 percent gain against the S&P's 8.4 percent and growth stocks' 4.9 percent.<p>Authors:
Graham has been described by investment counselor and writer John Train as "this century's (and perhaps history's) most important thinker on applied portfolio investment." Though he was scornful of speculation, he made his biggest score on a speculative stock play. Sober and magisterial on the page, Graham, a fund manager and a part-time professor at the Columbia School of Business Administration, was messier in his personal life. He was married three times and was once described as leaping "from blonde to blonde like an Alpine goat springing from peak to peak." The same year Security Analysis was published, he wrote Baby Pompadour, a Broadway play that closed after four performances.<p>Graham had been in the money business 13 years when, in 1928, he decided to teach a night class at Columbia to help him get his thoughts together. In 1934, Security Analysis was published, written with David Dodd, a Columbia colleague. Dodd remained true to the precepts of Security Analysis all his life, writing the foreword to the fifth edition shortly before his death in 1988, but Graham disavowed the method in his later years, complaining that it was too much work. He retired to Aix-la-Provence, where he lived with his son's former mistress until his death at 82.<p>Summary:
"Successful common stock investment extends over many years and usually involves many separate commitments," Graham and Dodd warn. To keep principal safe while earning a satisfactory return, the security analyst needs a discipline built on stringent standards and the most technically sophisticated statistical methods available.<p>Because the market is more irrational than it is efficient, the price of a stock only occasionally coincides with the stock's intrinsic value. The goal is to buy stocks when they are priced below intrinsic value and sell when they are priced above it. <p>To that end, the analyst seeks not to predict the future but to understand, and quantify, the financial present. This is not glamorous work. Security analysis focuses on determing the intrinsic value of a security, regardless of its price, by focusing on the company's past perfomance, not on projected earnings (impossible to predict, given the way outside factors can affect stock prices). Instead, analysts pore over financial statements--particularly balance sheets--to measure asset value, cash flow, and earnings. Value is what counts. Not price. Not the nature of a company's business.Just the numbers.<p>Advice:
So what does an analyst look for in determining intrinsic value? A low ratio of price to real earnings--measured as dividends paid plus increase in net assets per share--is often a strong indicator of value. But the true "margin of safety" comes when an analyst can identify the difference between a company's market capitalization and what it would be worth were it broken into parts and sold. Over the long run the market will at least be efficient enough to recognize the imbalance and push up prices. <p>Each new edition of Graham and Dodd has introduced ever more detailed techniques to address the realities of an increasingly complicated financial world. But the basic tenets of security analysis have stayed the same:  "To sustain the traditional Graham and Dodd respect for facts, to distinguish general accomplishments from hopes and expectations, and to reach sound principles of valuation," as Dodd wrote before his death.<p>Caveat:
Not only is the book slow going, but following all of Graham and Dodd's techniques could eat up an entire lifetime. Most of today's so-called value investors don't bother. While value investing has become a growth industry, with databases to spew out ratios and newsletters to offer picks, the sheer number of investors following this discipline has bid most of what Graham and Dodd would have called value out of the market. Today value investors usually look for stocks that are merely less overvalued than the rest of the market.<p><p>2. A RANDOM WALK DOWN WALL STREET BY BURTON G. MALKEIL<p>Thesis:
You can't beat the market with active trading over the long term. No one can--not a broker, not an analyst, not a fund manager--because no one can predict the future. In what has become an inspiration to a generation of business journalists, Malkiel theorized that "a blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper's financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by the experts." And a prudent individual could do better still by holding a diversified portfolio over the long term.<p>Impact:
random walk (W.W. Norton), which synthesizes a handful of academic theories about why the pros can't beat Wall Street, offers laymen a concise explanation of why they could do as well playing the market as the people they pay to manage their money. For obvious reasons, brokers hated this book when it came out in 1973. And they hate it today.<p>Author:
For 35 years malkiel has traveled through the money business, academia, and government, as an investment banker at Smith Barney, a director of the Vanguard Funds, a governor of the American StockExchange, chairman of the Princeton economics department, and dean of the Yale School of Organization and Management. From 1975 to 1977 he served on President Ford's Council of Economic Advisors. <p>Summary:
Most professional investors depend on one of two approaches to the market, Malkiel argues--one based on logic, one based on psychology.<p>The former, the "firm foundation" theory, holds that each stock has a firm anchor of intrinsic value, which can be determined through careful analysis of the company's current position and future prospects for earnings, growth, and income. <p>The latter, the "castle in the air" theory practiced today by the so-called technicians, or chartists, ignores intrinsic value. The chartists proceed under the assumption that what matters is the price people will pay for a stock, not what it is really worth. By studying past price and volume information, they attempt to measure and predict the future movement of the crowd.<p>Malkiel dismisses them both.<p>The fundamental problem with analysis, he says, is that "forecasting the future is inherently a very treacherous occupation." The raw information may be wrong or the analysis faulty. Or the market may disagree, paying a higher multiple for growth today and value tomorrow, depending on the temper of the crowd. "God Almighty doesn't know the proper price-to-earnings multiple for a common stock," he says.<p>If you think you see an undervalued stock, by Malkiel's definition, you are wrong: The market, he says, is an efficient pricing mechanism. The price of a stock perfectly reflects the crowd's attitudes toward that company. If people think a price will go to $40 tomorrow, it will go to $40 today.<p>Malkiel is even more scornful of the chartists. He compares them to the alchemists and diviners of a more innocent age, as they try to discover trends in their detailed, often arcane readings of the charts. Bunk, Malkiel insists. A chartist could find patterns in the toss of a coin 100 times, but he still couldn't predict what would happen on the 101st toss. Stock prices, like a coin toss, move in a random walk. He doesn't deny that the temper of the crowd influences prices, as do value and earnings--but not in ways that a professional can predict, or an individual can profit from, particularly after commissions and fees.<p>Advice:
The way to profit is to understand, and manage, the two kinds of risk--the risk that something will happen to an individual company and the risk that something will happen to the market as a whole. Investors can cut potential losses by putting together a basket of 20 or more stocks and holding them over the long term. The market as a whole will always go up and down, but investors can eliminate individual company risk by constructing a portfolio of stocks whose risks offset each other. A well-constructed portfolio will have a higher return per unit of risk than an investor would gain from simply investing in a single stock.<p>Caveat:
In a perfect world, all stocks would be perfectly priced. But there are always people who will see something or know something that others don't. There's an old joke about the professor of investing--a random walker--who spied a ten-dollar bill on the sidewalk. He didn't pick it up: According to efficient market theory, it couldn't be there.<p><p>3. REMINISCENCES OF A STOCK OPERATOR BY EDWIN LEFEVRE<p>Thesis:
There are two kinds of people in the mar-ket--the operator and the sucker. The smart can feast, if they watch the tape, but everyone else gets eaten.<p>Impact:
Although reminiscences, a fictionalized biography of Jesse Livermore, a celebrated jazz-age speculator, was first published some 60 years ago, its take on crowd psychology and market timing is as timely as last summer's frenzy on the foreign exchange markets. Livermore, whom Lefevre renames Larry Livingston, won and lost millions over the decades leading up to the crash of '29, speculating for the sheer joy of it: commodities or stocks, long or short, it didn't really matter. Usually he worked alone, but he'd play for a group, too, running up stock prices so that insiders could score.<p>In 1925, two years after the novel was published, Livermore pulled his greatest coup, making some $10 million trading grain futures in a few months. In 1929 he was widely blamed for causing the crash with his short selling and was forced to make a public denial and to hire a bodyguard for protection against angry crowds.<p>Margin requirements and SEC regulations may have changed how the game is played, but the nature of the players is the same--and always will be, according to "Livingston." His trading advice, based on the psychology of the bull and the bear, still rings true, while his explanation of the mechanics of insider trading and price manipulation is loaded with hands-on tips.<p>Author:
Trained as a mining engineer at lLehigh University, Edwin Lefevre became a journalist at 19, producing eight books during his 53-year writing career. Only Reminiscences, reviewed as nonfiction in the New York Times when it was published, remains in print. <p>Summary:
Larry Lvingston goes to work at 14, just out of grammar school, as a quotation boy in a stock brokerage office in Boston. He's always been good with arithmetic, and as he starts watching the board, he finds that he can predict which way the numbers will go. But he never actually makes a play himself until another office boy asks him to go in on a tip with him--they put $5 on Burlington in a bucket shop; his share of the profit is $3.12.<p>That is the start of his career at the bucket shops, where any chump with a dollar or two can play against the tape, like betting at the race track. Livingston does well enough to quit his job. When he shows his mother his first $1,000, her jaw drops--but by the time he turns 20, his stake is ten times that. They call him "the boy plunger" at the bucket shops. At 21 he moves to New York and learns how to speculate big-time. Wall Street opens his eyes. He thinks he is smart because he can predict the ticker's turns, but that isn't enough, and he goes bust. He goes to St. Louis and plays the bucket shops there until they run him out. His first big break comes with Union Pacific in 1906. Everyone is buying UP, so he decides to sell and shorts 3,000 shares in a rising market. When the stock goes up, he shorts another 2,000 shares. Then an earthquake hits San Francisco, where UP has its terminus--but the price still doesn't fall. So Livingston doubles up, then doubles up again. He clears $250,000 when the price breaks.<p>Livingston goes on to corner the cotton market. He has a $1 million day during the bull run just prior to World War I. He knows all the great Wall Street personalities and most of the suckers, too.Though he thinks tips are for chumps, he takes them occasionally, to be polite. What counts is understanding how things work.<p>Livingston is bullish in the bear markets and bearish with the bulls. He looks for the big swing. If one of his friends needs a price manipulated for a group of insiders, he takes care of it. You can always move a price up, he says, if you've got the line to run out. The key is to protect yourself by juggling shorts and longs, selling big on the way down. <p>Advice:
Only a sucker gambles on the market. a speculator bets on what he thinks and knows. It's a tough business; you have to be on the job all the time, or you won't have one. Livingston goes broke several times. But he comes back. Losing it all teaches you what not to do. <p>Caveat:
Jesse Lvermore, the real Larry Lvingston, went broke for the fourth and final time in 1934 and was never able to raise a stake again. He tried setting up as an investment advisor in New York and failed; then he tried writing a book explaining his system and failed again. In 1940 he shot himself in the men's room of New York's Sherry-Netherland Hotel.<p><p>4. EXTRORDINARY POPULAR DELUSIONS AND THE MADNESS OF CROWDS BY CHARLES MACKAY<p>Thesis:
"How easily the masses have been led astray," Charles Mackay laments. As individuals we are endowed with God-given reason. But in a crowd, judgment is swept away by unreasoning desire.<p>Impact:
First published in 1841, extraordinary Popular Delusions (Harmony Books) remains the most cited, and least followed, investment book in print, particularly sobering in light of the current bull market. Andrew Tobias, who wrote the foreword for the 1980 edition, called it the greatest money book ever written. Financier Bernard Baruch said in a foreword to the 1932 edition that the book had saved him millions.<p>Politics junkies will relish the section on the delusional scheme to get rid of the 18th century French national debt, while IPO aficionados can savor the tale of insider speculation in new issues in England in the 1720s. The shortest and most famous chapter, "The Tulipomania," about the bidding up of tulip-bulb prices in Amsterdam in the 1630s, has all but become a cliche, used to explain everything from the original Ponzi scheme to 1990's "midsummer madness" in bank stocks.<p>Author:
In syntax and point of view, mackay's as conservative as William Buckley, but he shares P.J. O'Rourke's eye for whimsical detail, delighting in oddities like the French hunchback who rented out his hump as a movable writing desk for speculators or the Dutch merchant sailor who, at the height of the tulipomania, mistook a tulip bulb for an onion and ate it for breakfast--only to wind up in jail, having consumed in two bites enough capital to build, equip, and man an entire merchant ship.<p>Summary:
It would take 50 volumes to chronicle all the instances of crowd madness and "moral contagion," Mackay says, but in 16 chapters he manages to detail everything from witch-hunting to alchemy, the Crusades, dueling, and the passion for slow poisons in Italy. Each chapter instructs, in its own didactic way, but only the first three are must-reads.<p>The first chapter introduces John Law, the wandering Scotsman whose "Mississippi scheme" beggared the French under Louis XIV. Law's plan--to harvest the riches of Louisiana while simultaneously wiping out the French national debt--never made any sense. But would-be buyers mobbed Law in the street and in his Paris home, pleading for shares, while stock jobbers ran a superheated aftermarket, sending prices soaring. The result was predictable: first the crash, then mass penury.<p>John Law at least believed in his scheme. The following year in London, when a group of well-connected British merchants duplicated Law's venture, they added price manipulation to the mix. Incorporating themselves as the South-Sea Company, they proposed to take over Britain's national debt with the proceeds from the fortune to be made trading with Spanish America. No one mentioned that the king of Spain had limited English trade there to one heavily taxed vessel a year. "The English commenced their career of extravagance somewhat later than the French," Mackay writes. "But as soon as the delirium seized them, they were determined not to be outdone." In early 1720, when Parliament voted to sell the country's national debt to the South-Sea company, share prices shot from 100 pounds to 130 and on up to 300. In April, with no revenues, nor even any legitimate prospects, the company offered another 1.5 million shares. They sold in an hour and a half and were trading at 550 by May. An entire market was born, and some 100 similar "bubble" ventures launched, one "for trading in hair," another "for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is." The frenzy lasted for eight months. In August, with shares up to 1,000, word leaked out that some of the directors were selling out. Prices dropped to 700. Then 400. Then 135.<p>Mackay is toughest on the Dutch, who in the 1630s became caught up in a speculative fever over tulip prices. By 1636, when 80 florins would buy a good suit, a single bulb could cost 2,500 florins or more. When two Semper Augustus bulbs, the rarest in the country, came on the market, one fetched 12 acres of land, the other 4,600 florins, a new carriage, two gray horses, and a set of leather harnesses.<p>"Everyone imagined that the passion for tulips would last forever," Mackay notes drily. But it didn't. As always, some of the rich saw the crash coming and got out early, but "many a representative of a noble line saw the fortunes of his house ruined beyond redemption." And the crowd, of course, got creamed.<p>In his 1932 foreword--written when the Dow was at 41, down from a precrash high of 381--BernardBaruch argued that there is only one way to avoid getting trapped in the grip of a popular delusion: When you see a market taking off, remind yourself that "two and two still make four."<p>Then again, for the cynical, disciplined investor, there's nothing quite so profitable as a good popular delusion.<p>
Worth Extra Credit:
Barbarians at the Gate
by Bryan Burrough  and John Helyar
This fast-paced novelistic account of the $28 million RJR leveraged buyout was a best-seller and the best business book of the '80s; its description of how ego and avarice drove the deal that came to symbolize the excesses of the decade alternately fascinates and appalls. If a fiction writer had created the characters, no one would have believed them. Meet F. Ross Johnson, the larger-than-life RJR CEO, who tried to make a fortune bribing his board to let him take the company private, cheap, and the folks who tried to help him, like Shearson head Peter Cohen, a loutish overachiever, and his boss James Robinson III, married to the putative PR whiz Linda Robinson. And Henry Kravis, the paranoid deal-maker who won the costly battle.<p>
The Money Game
by "Adam Smith"
During the '60s, the identity of the writer behind the pseudonym Adam Smith was a topic of speculation on Wall Street. Of course, now we know who Adam Smith is: George J.W. Goodman, former editor of Institutional Investor and the host of the PBS show Adam Smith's Money World. Smith/Goodman's take was that among the biggest players, making money was not the goal.Being in the game was what mattered. Money was just a way of keeping score. His central observation--"if you don't know who you are, the stock market is an expensive place to find out"--has become axiomatic.<p>
Where Are The Customers' Yachts?
by Fred Schwed Jr.
It's long been a cliche that WallStreet has a river at one end and a graveyard at the other. But Schwed points out that that omits "the kindergarten in the middle." The title of Schwed's 1940 book comes from the joke about the rube who visited the harbor. "There are the bankers' yachts," his guide told him. "And there are the brokers' yachts."<p>"But where," the rube asked, "are the customers' yachts?"<p>Writers such as Jane Bryant Quinn have acknowledged their debt to Schwed and his deadly take on the day-to-day workings of investors and brokers. Schwed particularly skewers the crowd at its most bullish and bearish extremes. "When the market is doing well and your friends and neighbors are buying stock," he advises, "sell and put your money in a bank. The market will go higher--maybe quite a bit higher. Ignore it.<p>"Eventually there will be a recession. When it gets so bad as to arouse the politicians to make speeches, take your money out of the bank and buy stock. The market will go lower--maybe quite a bit lower. Ignore it.<p>"This investment advice always works," he says, "but the procedure is so difficult that almost no one can do it."<p>
The Money Masters
by John Train
Voyeurs, as well as anyone interested in the flesh-and-blood people behind the classic strategies, will find these nine profiles compelling. Ben Graham is in here, as is T.Rowe Price, who made a fortune with growth stocks, and Stanley Kroll, titan of the commodities market. In a 1989 sequel, imaginatively titled The New Money Masters, Train gives the same treatment to eight '80s luminaries, among them Jim Rogers, Peter Lynch, Michael Steinhardt, and John Neff.<p>
An Investor's Anthology
Edited by Charles D. Ellis
This is the investment dilettante's dream, mining everything from textbooks and speeches to Playboy magazine and Berkshire Hathaway annual reports. Ellis has chosen 84 brief excerpts to illustrate "the most interesting ideas and concepts from the literature of investing." Keep it by your bedside for leisure time--slip into T. Rowe Price on "How to Pick a Growth Stock" on Friday night, argue with Maynard Keynes about "The State of Long Term Expectation" on Saturday, and spend Sunday with Sidney Homer learning "How (Not) to Explain the Bond Market to Your Wife." The longest piece, Graham and Dodd "On Intrinsic Value," is only 28 pages. The shortest, "The Market and Prices," by Adam Smith, is barely two pages long.<p>

A classy all-around car that happens to be a truck<p>By Stephan Wilkinson<p>Women love this car. Anna Quindlen begged for one in the New York Times. My wife, glaring over the roofs of lesser vehicles, became Parnelli Jones when she drove it, spiking its bluff prow high into the rearview mirror of every <a name="NASD:TOYOY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41889"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toyota</b></a> that dared impede her. My teenage daughter's cutest friend lost control when I pulled up in front of the high school. "Oh. My. GOD," she said. "You've got a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo." (A good suburbanite-in-training, she even knew the model and trimline.)<p>In the mornings, the narrow two-lanes up here in the Hudson River Highlands turn into the Ardennes, as columns of mommies in fat-tired four-wheel-drive Cherokees rumble toward school bus stops like Patton's tanks probing for von Rundstedt. <p>You know what? They're on to something. I hate pickups, have no truck with sport-utility vehicles, and can't imagine why anyone would confuse a van with a good car__but the new Grand Cherokee is one superb piece. Luxury sedans weren't this sophisticated a decade ago. Certainly sport-utility vehicles never were, and the new Grand Cherokee makes Explorers, Blazers, Troopers, Monteros, Pathfinders, and 4Runners seem positively agricultural. If I could have but one all-purpose car for the rest of my life, the Grand Cherokee would be a contender. <p>Cruder Cherokees have long been a phenomenon, popular among Connecticut Marlboro Men__and women__but this is the first iteration of the model that truly deserves to be a hit. Somehow, <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a> has managed to make live axles feel like independent suspension all around, and the handling of this car/truck is taut, the ride luxuriously comfortable. (The steering is less praiseworthy; it's too light and there's a certain on-center numbness, so you find yourself gently tacking down the road, the imprecision leading to small not-enough/whoops-too-much steering inputs.) <p>Except for its Rubbermaid School of Design plastic lower-body cladding, the look of the new Grand Cherokee is rounded yet tough, subtly carlike yet still aggressive, utilitarian. The interior is superbly roomy and the seats almost furniture-caliber in uprightness and comfort. But the instrument panel is conventionally rectangular and fussy, with such odd touches as an oversized vehicle-information screen that constantly reads out the time and date__items that don't seem all that crucial, particularly since the radio also endlessly displays the time. <p>The new Grand Cherokee offers the first V8a torquey 5.2-liter, 220-hp Dodge truck engine__in the compact sport-utility category, but even the Chrysler people will tell you to skip it in favor of the 190-hp straight six unless you have a big boat or a house to tow; the V8's fuel burn ran between 15 and 16 miles per gallon during the typical errand-running, kid-fetching, mall-trolling use to which we put the car. <p>All this comes at a price, however. The cheapest six-cylinder Grand Cherokee goes for about $20,000, but a fully optioned V8 Grand Wagoneer version (leather seats and imitation woodgrain interior accents set it apart) will take you well past $30,000. Stick with the six, tick the options boxes carefully, and you'll end up with change from a $25,000 check. And if you ever run into Anna Quindlen, she'd like a ride. <p> <p><p><p>

Wait__there may be life in those old leathers yet<p>By Carla Koehl<p>Right now, somewhere in the closet, a beloved but decaying leather briefcase is hanging on by a thread, long overdue for the thrift shop.<p>Before dumping it, or any other old or dowdy leather wallets, belts, or purses, consider sending it to Joy Liotta Horvath. From her home office in Norwalk, Connecticut, Horvath has been repairing, restitching, restoring, and hand-making leather luxury items for 16 years for customers as far flung as Australia, and as much-hyped as decorator Mark Hampton. <p>Alligator and crocodile skins are her specialties, but Horvath will work on any leather item except shoes as long as she deems it salvageable. Her inventory of 250-plus skins, mostly from her now-defunct leather factory ("Who could compete with Asia?"), gives her ample material for rebacking worn belts and straps, overhauling exhausted luggage, lengthening or shortening the handle on a handbag, and even cloning the occasional much-loved but clearly expired attach case. <p>Reincarnation comes at a price: from $50 an hour for most stitching and repairs to $2,500 to $4,000 for creation of a small, handmade alligator purse. Horvath quietly brags, though, that she restitches most wallets for just $30 and charges just $125 to fit Louis Vuitton luggage with lookalike replacement handles (LV quotes $200 to $250). Horvath requires four to six weeks for most jobs, though rush orders can be accommodated (203-847-9035).<p> <p><p><p>

To vacation like a native, trade homes and learn about the kindness of strangers.<p>By Sandy MacDonald<p>As a career diplomat, Brian Carlson has seen and lived in his share of opulent embassies. But nothing prepared him for the Paris apartment he and his wife, Marcia, happened upon through a friendly trade.<p>"It wasn't anything palatial," he recalls, "but when we opened the shutters we were literally in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower." For Marcia, even more enjoyable than the view was "the sense of living how the French live." Their hosts had left detailed notes on nearby museums and a list of their favorite boulangeries and restaurants, so that when the Carlsons ventured forth, they weren't just another pair of bumbling tourists trying to eke an authentic experience out of a blur of supposed attractions. As Marcia says, "We knew exactly where around the corner to go."<p>It's this opportunity to play instant insider that inspires tens of thousands of otherwise reasonable Americans to hand over all their worldly goods__house, cars, pets, and occasionally children__to perfect strangers and to head off for parts unknown, there to step into the strangers' lives. Like a mail-order marriage, it's a for-better-or-for-worse proposition__usually, much, much better.<p>"You can live the way you're accustomed to, or would like to become accustomed to," says Vicki Locke, owner/manager of St. Croix's Chenay Bay Resort, who has parlayed her island home and a Florida condo into idyllic sojourns in Provence. This year she and her family of five plus another family of five snagged an English country house with indoor and outdoor pools and a stable of horses. "When you get a mansion, you can do multi-couples, or whatever you want," says Locke. "My friends have been green for years as I go off with my whole family for weeks at a time."<p>Long the province of professors and retirees, home-swapping is fast entering the mainstream. Most exchangers, like the Lockes, make use of a listing service such as Intervac, a 40-year-old organization whose roster has doubled in the past five years. "We could triple it if my partner and I had more time and money," says Lori Horne, who after seven years as a satisfied Intervac swapper bought into the business in 1987. "We've never even done any advertising."<p>For a $62 yearly fee, Intervac's 9,000-odd members get to list their properties__described in a hyper-condensed, Esperanto-like code__and desired dates and destinations in one of three seasonal directories. February's "big book," with a deadline of November 24, is the one that serious summer swappers pounce on, their self-introductory letters and color photos (and/or faxes and videos) at the ready. Typical listers will make 30 to 40 initial offers, in the hope of lining up a handful of viable trades.<p>"You've got to get on the phone and ask lots of questions," advises Horne. "If you feel the slightest discomfort or flakiness__like maybe they're not going to go through with it__move on, because if they drop you, you're in trouble." Having nonrefundable airline tickets is one of the scarier aspects of these site-unseen arrangements, but that hurdle can be cleared with contingency plans__which you have to insist on, Horne warns. Typically, the middle-class Europeans who sign up to swap have both city and country homes, so you can take your pick__or "bank" a later visit__if they're unable to vacate on cue. Usually, though, you end up with both homes. One deep-pocketed Spanish industrialist with whom Horne has traded her Marin County home several times has five houses to put in the pot__including one on Majorca that comes with a fully crewed yacht. He offered the Hornes his Barcelona pied--terre during the Olympics and, upon learning they'd already arranged another exchange, surprised them with tickets to the opening ceremony instead.<p>Such magnanimous gestures are apparently the norm among house exchangers. With no money down, just a commitment of blind faith, swappers go all out to dispense good will. It's customary, for example, to leave a day's provisions (so the exhausted newcomers won't have to rush out to shop) and a packet of information on local attractions and services. Most homeowners, however, embroider these bare minimums, leaving behind a fresh-baked cake, a bottle of fine wine, and a phalanx of relatives and neighbors to see to their guests' every need and show them the country as no average tourist will ever get to know it.<p>These onlookers are helpful not only for their friendly input but also as a crucial safeguard. Massachusetts writer John O'Brien's neighbors, for instance, suspected something was amiss when the family he'd traded with (through the second-largest international exchange organization, Vacation Exchange Club) engaged in what appeared to be a weeklong keg party. One set of friends went so far as to rescue the family dog, but no one wanted to call the O'Briens and ruin their vacation. It was ruined soon enough, though; the first sight to greet them upon their homecoming was their children's toys hanging from the telephone wires. Their house had been thoroughly trashed.<p>"I had an idealistic attitude toward travel, that it's the most valuable thing you can do in your life," says O'Brien, who'd had delightful prior exchange experiences in Paris and a medieval German town. He's still a believer and has encouraged several friends to try exchanging (with uniformly happy results), but as for putting his own house on the line, "No, never again."<p>Intervac's method for weeding out home-wreckers is simple and swift: If a complaint seems at all founded, boom, the listing's pulled and the offender is out of the club__for life. "We never get the same complaint twice," says Horne. "You have to remember, if it's risky for you, it's just as risky for the person coming over." Asking for references is de rigueur, as is a close look at your insurance policies; generally, coverage extends to nonpaying guests. In Intervac's long history, Horne claims, "We've never had anything serious or criminal; it's always little things, like a phone bill." Long-distance calls, in fact, are usually the only extras incurred. Exchangers customarily offer up all their perks, including country club memberships, live-in au pairs, and the family car(s), perhaps agreeing beforehand to a mutual cap on mileage. One visitor to Great Britain was so surprised to find a Bentley in the garage, he never dared set foot in it and took the Underground instead.<p>Because foreigners tend to be inordinately intrigued with all things American, even would-be exchangers in what Horne would call "a no-place place" (the coasts have the greatest cachet, with Colorado following close behind) have a shot at the big time__within reason. Michael McGinn, a political consultant who lords over County Cork's Mallow Castle, where Edmund Spenser penned "The Fairie Queene," happened to mention to a syndicated columnist that he might be amenable to a trade. "I was deluged with offers of timeshares in Orlando," he sighs. Unless you have something pretty special to pony up, you might have to be prepared to trade horizontally or even down. But that can work out just fine. One of Vicki Locke's favorite perches in Provence was "a small, sweet place" where the exchange partner's parents took Locke's family under their wing, and where every morning her boys would traipse down the hill to get pain au chocolat from the bakery.<p>"You get to be a part of the place," she recalls fondly. As a hotelier, she has an open-ended professional courtesy pass to resorts throughout the world. Yet she and her family prefer the quirky pleasures of other people's homes: "Even if it takes a couple of days to figure out how the washing machine works," she says, "I wouldn't do it any other way." <p>For an introductory kit, contact Intervac U.S., P.O. Box 590504; San Francisco, CA 94159, 415-435-3497. A thorough, if occasionally hokey, exegesis on the intricacies of home exchanging can be found in the book Trading Places, by Bill and Mary Barbour (Rutledge Hill Press; 513 Third Ave. S., Nashville, TN 37210; 615-244-2700; $9.95).<p> <p><p>

At last, beer buffs get their own boot camp<p>By Kevin Caliendo<p>Norm Petersen, phone home. This month, and again next spring, your fellow beer fanatics from across the country will be gathering in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, for a weekend beer camp hosted by the six-year-old Oldenberg Brewery, one of America's most acclaimed microbreweries, best known for its German-style lagers.<p>This is serious business, dedicated to those who like to talk, drink, and learn about beer. Instructors include hops-heads like Daniel Bradford, founder of the Great America Beer Festival and publisher of All About Beer magazine, and Alan Eames, described by the Yale Journal as "the world's only beer anthropologist." (Eames will speak on "Dumb Places I Have Been in Quest of Beer.") Lab work will be stressed, too, at a hands-on home brewing class in which campers can expand their skills by experimenting with Oldenberg's various malts and barleys. <p>But there's more than just work scheduled. The activities include a five-course beer-tasting lunch, followed by a three-and-a-half-hour pub crawl in nearby Cincinnati.. Campers may well be receptive to the Temperance Hour held on Sunday between beer brunch and graduation ceremonies.<p>The camp runs from September 17-19 and again in March. The weekend costs $275 per person (double-occupancy) at the three-star Drawbridge Inn, with meals and beer included. For information call 800-426-3841.<p><p><p>

Premium bourbons give a smooth answer to the single-malt challenge.<p>By John Mariani<p>Time was when a man who liked bourbon drank what his father and grandfather drank, learning to handle the kick and the bite on the back of the throat. But those days are gone. Domestic sales have dropped more than 50 percent since 1970, a downturn that has pushed tradition-bound Kentucky distillers of America's only indigenous spirit to copy the producers of single-malt scotch and French cognac and promote what are called premium single-barrel and small-batch bourbons, which are generally smoother and more expensive than their traditional predecessors.<p>The model came from Maker's Mark, a small, historic-landmark distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, owned by booze giant Hiram Walker. Selling for about $15 a bottle, Maker's Mark took on a cult status on the basis of the unorthodox notion that a mellower, more fully rounded bourbon could be produced using expensive winter wheat, rather than cheaper rye (all bourbon must by law contain at least 51 percent corn), and production methods deliberately promoted as old-fashioned. Maker's Mark's success inspired such giant distilleries as Jim Beam and Wild Turkey to make their own premium products, some costing $50 a bottle, some sold in crystal decanters, and others sold only at duty-free airport shops in the Orient.<p>Today there are at least a dozen premium bourbons, but it's not always easy to distinguish what makes one distinctive from another, or in fact, from the standard bourbons produced by the parent company. Jim Beam, for example, makes four small-batch bourbons, each made only in limited quantities. The press release for Beam's Baker's Bourbon says that it is made with a special strain of yeast "developed long ago and maintained for generations." Yet this is the same strain used in several other Jim Beam products. The claim for the same company's Knob Creek bourbon is that it is aged in white-oak barrels whose insides are charred to the maximum number "4" level (which adds flavor and tannins to the whiskey), but the press release neglects to say that all Jim Beam bourbons are made using the number "4" charring and that many other distilleries use this method, too.<p>In fact, most premium bourbons are not distilled separately from bulk bourbons but are only bottled blends of bourbons from various barrels selected by a master distiller for their particular fineness and flavor. Some may be aged longer than standard brands (up to 12 years in some cases). Others may be drawn straight from the barrel at "barrel proof" rather than being distilled at higher proof and then diluted with water. Others may or may not be filtered. And some are not blends at all, but are taken from a single barrel. All producers would lead you to believe their premium bourbons are based on age-old methods handed down over generations or saved only for special occasions, but the truth is that most of these small-batch whiskeys have come on the market only in the past two to five years. <p>However arch the claims for distinctiveness, there's no doubt that these premium bourbons are very different from the harsh, traditional whiskeys still produced in enormous bulk. To find out how distinctive these premium bourbons are, Worth did a tasting of 12 currently being sold nationally. We also threw in a few bulk bourbons and one Tennessee whiskey, none of which compared favorably with the rich character of the premiums. We tasted them straight, then cut with distilled water, discovering (as with cognacs, vintage champagne, and single-malt scotches) that one's own preference for the style of one producer's bourbon is more important than the rarity or price of the liquor. Cutting them with water diluted some of the tastes that made one different from another. These are bourbons better sipped in a snifter after dinner than served on the rocks with water as a pick-me-up before. They're listed by proof, from lowest to highest. <p>Rock Hill Farms__80 proof, $38. A deep amber color and a delicate bouquet full of caramel and vanilla. This is an enchanting lightweight bourbon with many layers of flavor that heavier alcohol might knock out. The bottle is a heavy squat beauty etched with an illustration of Kentucky horse country.<p>Basil Hayden__80 proof, $30. A Jim Beam product distilled separately from the firm's other bourbons. It contains higher percentages of rye, barley, and malt, which give it its richer flavor. Amber in color. Lighter than most bourbons because of the lower proof, and very smooth, with a gentle bite. Pleasant and easy to drink.<p>Hancock's Reserve__88.9 proof, $39. A nice middle-place finisher for a premium bourbon, extremely smooth, with a sweet toasted undertone. Gorgeous stoppered bottle and beautifully crafted cylindrical wooden gift box, which add to the cost. <p>Maker's Mark__90 proof, $15. The first premium to enter the market and still the benchmark. Deep color, medium nose but an interesting bouquet. Nice and warm in the mouth without any real bite. This is a delicious, mellow bourbon with terrific flavor, either before dinner with water or after in a snifter.<p>Evan Williams__90 proof, $10. Made by Heaven Hill. Aged a minimum of seven years. A powerful but nice, mellow aroma, with a slightly caramel undertone and a traditional bite at the end. Better cut with water as a before-dinner drink. <p>Blanton's__93 proof, $38. From Ancient Age. A single-barrel bourbon, unblended. Deep, rich color, light lovely nose, full of vanilla. A very good after-dinner drink, with body and flavors that start and finish elegantly on the palate. Beautifully packaged with horse-and-jockey stopper. <p>Elijah Craig__94 proof, $14. Named after the man who gave bourbon its distinctive taste by aging it in charred barrels. Aged 12 years. Very deep, rich color, a pretty, mellow bouquet, and a sweet undertone. The kind of bite you expect from a bourbon, but not at all a head-wagger.<p>Knob Creek__100 proof, $25. A Jim Beam product, aged for nine years. Medium color, high-alcohol nose. A balanced bourbon, with everything in synch, but nothing exceptional. <p>Wild Turkey 12__101 proof, $50. Very deep color and high alcohol in the nose and finish. Taken from selected barrels. A formidable whiskey, but it tastes harsh even after 12 years of aging, with a massive bite. It lacks the complexity in finish of other premiums.<p>Baker's__107 proof, $30 to $35. A Jim Beam product distilled at a lower proof than most whiskeys and sold in a wine bottle. Deep caramel color but a light, delicate aroma. This is a powerhouse, with an enormously long finish on the back of the palate. Some finesse, but the alcohol makes it one-dimensional.<p>Wild Turkey Rare Breed__About 110 proof, $30. A blend of six-, eight-, and 12-year-old stocks undiluted with water, so that barrel proof varies from bottle to bottle. Rich color but light nose full of wood and vanilla. This has too much bite and burn because of the high alcohol content.<p>Booker's__About 125 proof, $45. When it was introduced in 1987, this was a single-barrel bourbon, but now it is made as a blend, in small batches. With its barrel proof uncut, this unfiltered bourbon has a very big alcohol kick in the nose. Very woody, with lots of tannin and tobacco taste. Unique; the best choice for fans of a high-alcohol gargantuan style.<p> <p>

The farther you wander, the more important it is to pack traveler's health insurance<p>By Kevin Caliendo<p>It's a traveler's worst nightmare. He's out fishing for Nile perch, say, on the Ugandan side of Lake Victoria, when he feels a terrible pain in his chest. Who to call? The local doctor, who speaks no English, specializes in cattle. And the nearest hospital won't admit a foreigner without payment up front.<p>Few of the 500,000 Americans who will need immediate medical attention outside the United States this year will face such a drastic situation. But anyone who travels abroad, especially to remote or dangerous places, would do well to buy travel health insurance. Although most U.S. insurance policies are accepted abroad, only a good travel insurance plan will guarantee immediate payment on claims, a necessity since many hospitals overseas either require advance payment or hold a patient's passport until all the American paperwork clears. Other benefits typically include access to a hot line that will provide medical advice and help you locate the closest available English-speaking physician, evacuation to the closest appropriate hospital, and assistance in filling prescriptions. In serious cases, family members will be flown in to be with the injured. Most of these policies cost less than $100 per week, kick in as soon as the taxi leaves for the airport, and have a maximum payout of $100,000.<p>Travel policies are valid only outside the 48 contiguous states and will not cover trips to U.S. State Department-designated "danger zones," such as Bosnia and Iraq. Consumers with pre-existing health conditions, such as heart ailments or diabetes, will need to purchase riders to their policies. And these policies don't cover injuries you might receive while pursuing high-risk activities, such as parasailing or uncertified scuba diving. Routine doctor visits are also excluded.<p>Of the 20-odd companies that offer travel health insurance, these five offer the best comprehensive direct-payment policies: Access America, 800-284-8300; HealthCare Abroad, 800-237-6615; International SOS Assistance, 800-523-8930; Travel Assistance International, 800-821-2828; and The Travelers Companies, 800-243-3174. Evaluating a provider is as simple as presenting a company representative with the specifics of your upcoming trip and asking what's covered.<p> <p><p>

Worth magazine/Departments  
<p>
 Q & A 
<p>
Readers' questions answered  
<p>
 Q:  For several years I've been putting money in a 403(b) plan
at work. I have not been able to reach the maximum annual contribution
allowed, but I expect to do so sometime in the next year. I have
read that 403(b) plans have a "catch-up" provision that can be
exercised before retirement. How can I calculate the amount I
can put in, and when can I start?  
<p>
 A:  When you set up a 403(b), your employer automatically diverts
a portion of each paycheck into the plan. But you can also make
voluntary additional plan paymentsup to certain limits.  
<p>
Ordinarily, the annual voluntary contributions to a 403(b) cannot
exceed $9,500. If you are already making contributions to a SEP
or 401(k), this amount may be lower.   
<p>
 If you have been working for your current employer for at least
15 years, and your previous contributions averaged less than
$5,000 a  year, you can make annual contributions to bring your
contributions up to the $5,000-per-year figure. However, the
annual contribution cannot exceed $3,000, and your total contributions
cannot exceed $15,000. What's more, the sum of your total annual
contributions can't exceed 25 percent of your reduced salarythe
salary remaining after the contribution amount has been deducted
from itin any given year.   
<p>
 And finally, the law limits the total amount you can invest
in a 403(b), based on a variety of factors, including your employment
history and your use of other retirement plans. The calculations
are complex. Your best move is to check with your employee-benefits
administrator to see how each limitation may affect your 403(b)
plan participation.  
<p><p>
<p>
Q: I would like to start investing in stocks, but need to learn
the basics. What are the best sources of information?  
<p>
 When it comes to investing, information is an asset you can't
afford to do without. Fortunately, useful sources abound.   
<p>
 For starters, here are a few excellent, common-sense books that
every investor should have on the investment shelf. How to Buy
Stocks by Louis Engel and Brendan Boyd (Bantam) is the all-time
best seller on the stock market, an excellent primer. The Intelligent
Investor by Benjamin Graham (HarperCollins) is considered the
classic on value investing. It provides guidance for both the
defensive and the aggressive investor. By focusing on company
financial statements, Graham has taught two generations of investors
how to buy stocks that are currently worth more than their market
price. In One Up on Wall Street (Penguin) and Beating the Street
(Simon & Schuster), Peter Lynch, a Worth columnist and the most
successful mutual fund manager of all time, shows individual
investors how to identify promising industries and stocks by
using knowledge they already have from their daily lives.  
<p>
 Then there are the stock information services that are available
at most libraries. The Value Line Investment Survey provides
some of the best analysis in the business on the 1,700 stocks
it covers. The Standard & Poor's Stock Reports provide substantial
analysis of historical and current performances of thousands
of stocks. S&P also publishes a monthly Stock Guide, which tracks
the performance of more than 5,000 stocks. Moody's manuals also
provide substantial company data that investors can use to gauge
the health of a particular prospect.   
<p>
 There are also analysts' recommendations. Every full-service
brokerage firm produces numerous reports on particular companies,
industries, and even the economy in general.   
<p>
 And, of course, investors can request company annual reports.
An annual reportusually free for the askingis a company's summary
statement about its past and most recent financial status. In
it investors will find the company's financial statements, as
well as a healthy dose of company hype. And though annual reports
aren't the best source of information, they're a useful way to
familiarize yourself with a particular company.  
<p><p>
<p>
Q:  My broker has been touting stock in a company that's about
to go on the market. I realize that IPOs are high-risk, but I'm
curious. How can I research the company and the prospects for
the stock so that when it goes public, I can intelligently take
it or leave it?   
<p>
 A:  Investors generally have one of two reasons when they purchase
initial public offerings: speculating that interest in a new
company will drive up the price in the short term, or investing
on the company's anticipated performance over a longer time.<p>
<p>
 Timing is the most important criterion for short-term speculating.
Because IPOs usually involve a relatively small number of shares,
the ebb and flow of investor interest can send shares sky-rocketing
one day and plunging within a few months, weeks, or even days.<p>
<p>
  As a result, stock prices at any point may bear little relation
to the company's actual value. Regardless of a new company's
eventual success or failure, investors may reap short-term profits
from an IPO that stimulates a high level of investor curiosity.
But investors who aren't comfortable with the gut-wrenching feeling
that a roller coaster induces should steer clear of IPOs.  
<p>
 On the other hand, the long-term performance of many IPOs can
be excellent. After all, every stock was an IPO at one time.
But the number of stories about the fabulous successes far exceed
the number of investors who got in on the ground floor of truly
spectacular IPOs. There are several questions about a company's
financial health that can give investors a sense of the long-term
prospects:   
<p>
         Is the company an established organization with a proven
record of profitability, or is it just starting up?  
<p>
         Is the company operating in a growing industry?   
<p>
         Does it have a proprietary product or service?   
<p>
         Does it enjoy a significant market share?  
<p>
         Does the company plan to use the money it raises by
selling stock to improve the business, or merely to line the
pockets of the original investors?  
<p>
 A company's financial record is probably the most important
part of the prospectus. Declining earnings or a short history
of earning profits may be warnings of things to come. Investors
also should generally avoid companies with high debt levels.<p>
<p>
 The prospectus may contain valuable nonfinancial information
as well. For example, legal actions against a company may have
troubling implications. The prospectus should also reveal how
long the current management has been in place, as well as the
background and experience of key managers. And finally, look
at why the company is issuing stock. If a portion of the proceeds
go to corporate officers, they are, in effect, reducing their
own stake in the company. So much for their confidence in the
company's prospects.  
<p><p>
<p>
Q:  I am going back to school and my income will be very low
for the next few years. However, I have accumulated a significant
amount of money in an IRA. Will I be able to finance some of
my educational expenses with my IRA money?  
<p>
 A:  Unless you become disabled, just about the only way you
can make penalty-free IRA withdrawals before age 5912 is through
a life annuity, whereby you agree to pay out your account in
equal installments, based on your life expectancy. Of course,
if you don't have much in your account, or you're relatively
young (and therefore your life expectancy is many years), you
won't be able to take a lot out each year. Here's how to calculate
your allowable withdrawls:  
<p>
 Step 1: Determine your life expectancy from the life expectancy
tables contained in IRS Publication 590, "Individual Retirement
Arrangements (IRAs)."  
<p>
 Step 2: Project the amount your IRA will grow over your projected
life expectancy using a reasonable rate of interest, which is
contained in the "Internal Revenue Bulletin" published at the
beginning of each month.  
<p>
 Step 3: Set up an annual schedule for taking distributions out
of your account. When you do so, you must:  
<p>
 Establish absolutely equal payments; you can't take out one-third
of the balance one year and one-sixteenth the next  
<p>
 Make distributions at least once a year; you can make payments
more frequently, but not less frequently.  
<p>
 The payment schedule must be in effect for at least five years,
or until you reach age 59, whichever period is longer.   
<p>
 Warning: Failure to follow these rules will likely cost you
a retroactive penalty of 10 percent on everything you take out.<p>
<p>

Rafting the Zambezi, the world's wildest day trip<p>By Pam Houston<p>I am passionate about white-water rivers for many reasons. First because I love seeing untamable country and because white-water rivers often cut wild country__gorges, mountains, and deep canyons__that there's no other way to see. I love the light and shadow on the canyon walls, the colors__browns, reds, oranges, and grays__that change with every bend of the river, every movement of the sun. I love the pace of life on the river, five or six miles an hour, accelerated to nine or ten miles an hour in the rapids; it is just the right speed to see scenery that huge.<p>What I love most of all, of course, is the acceleration; the moment when the current catches the flat underside of my big inflatable raft and pulls me toward what I can hear but sometimes cannot see: the roar of water washing over rocks, the smooth green slick of river that plummets toward a three- or six- or nine-foot wall of white water, the joyful drenching as my boat makes contact with the wave, the exhilaration when I come out, right side up and whole on the other side.<p>Or I don't.<p>Sometimes my boat flips and the big wave holds me under, tossing my arms and legs as if I were a cat in a washing machine, then spits me out to swim like mad for the boat.<p>Or it doesn't.<p>Maybe the wave holds me in there until I gulp down so much water I drown, or the wave picks me up and slams my body into the rock that has made it, and I die on impact. Because up to now this last scenario has not happened, and because I know there is no passion without risk of loss, I will continue to run white-water rivers until I've beaten the odds so many times I start to get nervous, and then I'll have to turn to some other, tamer passion: men with foreign accents, say, or books.<p>And though I wish it were not true, it is a fact that I can't get passionate about anything that doesn't risk my physical, emotional, or spiritual health (here I could list as evidence either the expeditions I have taken or the men I have dated). I can't get passionate about anything I think I can own.<p>Passion, for me, is born in the same place as desire; it depends upon the possibility of its not being fulfilled in order for it to exist in the first place. I am not passionate about rivers I'm sure I won't die on, any more than I'm passionate about a man I know I can have forever. I can like those other rivers, love them even, but passion for me is a love-plus-fear equation. Passion on the river happens in the long second when the nose of the boat dips downward and I hear the roar of the water in my ears, and the river says, "How could you have thought you were in charge here?"<p>For that moment, that gut-gripping, adrenaline-rushing, mind-focusing surge of excitement, there is no river I know of like the Zambezi on the Zimbabwe-Zaire border, as it flows away from Victoria Falls.<p>They call it the "world's wildest day trip"__six hours and fifteen rapids (numbered five through nineteen), five of which are larger than anything in the United States, all large enough to get seared indelibly on even the most experienced boatwoman's memory. And unlike most of the world's great white-water trips, on this one, for a day and $100, anyone can go.<p>The tiny town of Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, is home to many of the world's best river guides. In season (March to December) about 35 guides from three river companies take as many as 300 people a day down the Zambezi. Some of the clients are seasoned river rats like me, but the vast majority of them are on a white-water river for the first time.<p>The day starts out with almost two hours of training in boating and safety procedures. Our guide, whose name is Jason, tells us he has flipped in rapid No. 18 every day for the last two weeks, so we had better pay attention: This is how to tighten our life jackets, this is what to do if we find ourselves in the water, this is what to do if we're in the boat and he's in the water.<p>"Yes," Jason says, "there are crocodiles between rapids, so if you do fall out, try not to stay in the water too long."<p>Then it is into the boat for some command training. Jason will man the oars, he says, but he needs our active cooperation if we are to get through waves this huge. When we enter a rapid, we are to wait for his command, and when he gives it, we are to hurl our full weight against whatever part of the boat is about to hit the big wave__"highsiding," it's called__and, if we are lucky, we'll punch the boat through.<p>Having rowed inflatable rafts through America's biggest rapids for six years, I am skeptical about the value of passenger participation. It's just a way to keep us all entertained, I think, wishing they'd give me my own boat to row. How big can these rapids be, I think, and then I see rapid No. 5.<p>Or hear it, to be more precise. I can't actually see rapid No. 5 until we are pointing nose down into it about 20 degrees off vertical, bracing for Jason's "NOW" command that will send us hurtling into the massive white wave. (Later Jason will tell me I went a little pale in the entry to five; he'll say that's where everyone goes a little pale.) Suddenly I'm glad I'm not the one rowing; suddenly I understand why he needs the weight of six people to punch through the wave.<p>"NOWWW!" Jason says, and we all hit that wave screaming. There is a surge of whiteness, a drenching, a momentary stoppage of time in which the thunder in our ears becomes the thunder in our ears, and we rise out of the wave and back to the surface as if from an incredible depth. We ride a few smaller standing waves and lose ourselves in cheers and hollers. Jason's tight features loosen, and he passes the bail buckets around.<p>The word comes back from the boats ahead of us: Three boats have turned over; everyone is back aboard safe. We are the last of 12 boats and we're designated "clean-up." It is our job to save any strays.<p>Rapid No. 6 is just as big as No. 5, and No. 7 is slightly smaller, wave-wise, but almost half a mile long. The Zambezi is known as a pool-and-drop river, which means the rapids are mostly huge amounts of water pouring over steep rock falls and ledges with lots of slow-water recovery time in between. This is actually a safer type of river than the much smaller-volumed but more technically challenging rivers of Idaho or Appalachia, where there is constant moving white water and where the rocks that bash your boat and your body are much closer to the surface.<p>On a pool-and-drop river, the guide has to do only two things right: position himself right in the middle of the V-slick (the green, V-shaped pour-off at the top of a rapid) and hit the wave with his boat perpendicular to it (pointing forward or backward); perfectly straight on.<p>Rapid No. 7, on the Zambezi, is the exception to the pool-and-drop rule. It is long, complicated, and full of rocks that are not safely buried beneath hundreds of feet of rushing water. But Jason proves to be as smart as he is strong, and we glide past the Crease, Indicator Rock, and Land of the Giants, unscathed.<p>All the rafts have to portage at rapid No. 9, which is a class-six rapid. A class six, according to the international river classifying system, is a rapid that's unrunnable, likely to cause severe injury or death.<p>Tell that to the Zambezi video kayakers, who precede the rafts down the river every day catching all the action on video (copies of which they will sell in great number that evening). These extremely passionate (or slightly insane) young men give the portaging tourists what most of them don't know is the kayaking demonstration of their lives, as they plunge off a 60-foot cliff into white-water chaos, which turns out, on our day, not to mean certain death.<p>Rapid No. 11 has the steepest drop of any of the 15, and when we hit the wave, it feels like concrete; it stops our boat dead and won't let us go for six or seven seconds, the water churning beneath us, rattling our hold on the safety line and each other.<p>Of course, what we've been waiting for all day, is rapid No. 18, home of the wave named Oblivion, the one rapid that at this river level flips 80 percent of the boats.<p>I've seen No. 18 on yesterday's video tape, and frankly, I'm not too worried. There's plenty of water and no rocks near the surface in the main channel, and on the video I watched, boat after boat of people turned over, only to wash right out and get rescued.<p>I'm not too worried, that is, until we hit a rock in rapid No. 17 that breaks both our oars, and I see Jason's face turn from responsible and serious to helpless and panicked as we float toward Oblivion with two little stubs coming out of the oar locks.<p>We are in a bad position. We can't stop or slow ourselves by rowing upstream, can't row to shore and wait to be rescued, can't maneuver the boat at all toward where we need to be in No. 18, and if we don't enter the rapid in the right place, who knows where we'll end up? We have one spare oar, which we cracked earlier in the day and will do us almost no good. We have no boats behind us, and the boat in front of us is about to enter No. 18.<p>Jason shouts ahead and, luckily, Pennant, who has rowed boats on the Zambezi for 11 years, is strong enough to row upstream and give us his spare oar. While my shaking hands hold the two pieces of the cracked oar together, Jason's shaking hands bind it with an old piece of inner tube. We secure the oars again and are ready to face Oblivion with 30 yards to spare.<p>Rapid No. 18 contains three big waves. The first two are big enough to flip a boat if you don't hit them straight on, and the third one__Oblivion__will flip you almost no matter what you do. Jason's plan is not to go "highside" on the first two waves; we want to have all our strength and timing to hit Oblivion together.<p>Will there be anyone to rescue us? I wonder, looking below the rapid and seeing only overturned boats and swimmers everywhere, but I say, "Didn't anyone make it through?"<p>"I doubt it," Jason says. "It's been getting worse every day. Hold on in here," he says, as the speed builds under the boat, "This pool's got crocs."<p>I have, in all the excitement, forgotten about the crocodiles.<p>We hit the first wave just fine, but the second wave turns us sideways. Our cracked oar breaks for good, and we head for Oblivion between sideways and backwards, as bad a position as we can be.<p>"NOWWW!" Jason says, and we hit the big rubber side tube as hard as we can and climb up on it with all our weight, and somewhere under all that watery chaos, the video camera finds our boat standing right up on end, the raft a thin divider between madly pounding wild water and seven dangling bodies.<p>Seconds later it is over. Jason jumps up and down and hugs each one of us and throws the broken oar up in the air. We are the only boat to make it through without flipping today, the only boat anyone can ever remember making it through sideways. We go to work pulling swimmers from the river.<p>That night, over dinner, I ask Jason how long he'll run the Zambezi, and he says, "Until it kills me or until my adrenaline runs out." What passion lacks in intelligence it makes up for in obstinacy.<p>And if love locates itself between head and heart, then passion must live between heart and guts: some tiny irrational space in the body that loves all things dark and mischievous, that celebrates excitement, chaos, and everything it cannot own.<p> <p><p>

						 <p>By John Mariani<p>The catalogs may offer a well-made flannel shirt, durable gardening shears, or a good discount on a laser gunsight, but is there really any reason to order frozen beefsteaks through the mail? Readers of the ads in the back of magazines such as The New Yorker and Gourmet might think the best beef in the world is to be had only by sending away for it. The superlatives used in these ads__"world-famous," "prize-winning," "exquisite," "restaurant-quality" and so on__seem to promise that only the finest hand-picked beef is slaughtered, packed up, and sent to you for that "buttery, melt-in-your-mouth flavor."<p>Don't believe it. Worth tried four of the most readily available mail-order steaks, and only one was worth the cost or effort involved. Only Palm Pak (a branch of the famous national steakhouse chain), uses USDA prime meat, the highest grade available. The rest ship USDA choice__good, but never as good as prime, and in most cases no better than you'd find at your local supermarket. <p>Furthermore, only the Palm Pak steak had the requisite marbling and thin exterior fat that give great beef its unique, hearty flavor. The rest needed enhancement__butter, barnaise, anything to perk them up. <p>Although most shippers offer several other cuts of meat in their catalogs, the magazine ads offered only filet mignons, which we used for our tasting. The ads also offer deeply discounted prices at various times of the year, which can save you up to $30 on an order. We cooked the filets in a super-heated black iron skillet medium-rare, with a seared exterior and a juicy red interior. All were tasted on their own, then with a light sauce made with butter, shallots, and red wine.<p>America's Blue Ribbon Beef; 485 Crossroads Parkway, Bolingbrook IL 60440; 800-873-4538. Six 6-ounce filet mignons at a special offer of $29.95 (regularly $59.95) plus $6.95 shipping.
Nice beefy flavor, though not especially rich, and trimmed of all fat. The size and weight of these six-ounce filets makes them ideal for one person, and they sear nicely on the outside and stay rare within because of their thickness. Only USDA choice shipped.<p>Omaha Steaks international; 4400 South 96th Street, P.O. Box 3300, Omaha NE 68172; 800-228-9055. Six 5-ounce steaks at a special offer of $29.95 (regularly $51.95) plus $6.50 shipping.
Tender, but very little flavor, and that livery. At five ounces, they'd make decent tournedos, but they need sauce to make a meal. Omaha Steaks says it may ship "either choice or prime," but customers must request prime, which adds to the cost.<p>Classic Steaks by Skylark Meats, Inc.; 4430 South 110th Street, Omaha NE 68137-1217; 800-288-2783. One dozen 4-ounce filet mignons for a special offer of $57.25 (regularly $72.25) plus $6 shipping.
Very tender USDA choice, with some beefy flavor, but the flavor fades fast on the palate and the meat needs more marbling. The four-ounce size is skimpy and cooks quickly, making it hard to sear well enough to keep the inside rare.<p>The Palm Pak; 1010 16th Street NW, Washington, D.C. 20036; 202-775-7256. Six 12-ounce filet mignons at $100, shipping included.
By far the best tasted, in every respect. The USDA prime beef has rich flavor and terrific texture that is tender and buttery, and the veneer of fat and marbling makes you forget this is filet mignon, not sirloin. Weighing in at a big 12 ounces, this is quite a mouthful for one and may be easily sliced (after cooking) to serve two people because the fat content is so satisfying to the palate.

						 <p>By Stephan Wilkinson<p>The Lexus GS 300 sneaks up on you. Straight out of the box, there is nothing that particularly grabs you about this newest luxury sedan (other than its $42,500 equipped price, that is). No enormous torque, no asphalt-fracturing acceleration, no be-the-first-on-your-block styling, no phony race-car-body cladding.<p>The interior is luxurious, but nothing so over-the-top that it tempts you to black out the windows and get naked. The car's architecture is conventional: lots of front overhang, a long six-cylinder engine driving the rear wheels, a Jaguaresque variation on generic big-Toyota lines. All of this means plenty of front-seat room, only moderate rear-seat space and headroom, and a trunk high bustled to recapture some of the volume sacrificed to the back seats.<p>Take a short drive and you'll initially notice four things. A neon/electroluminescent instrument display that gives new meaning to the word vivid. An engine so quiet at idle that those  brightly glowing gauges are the only sign that it's running. A steering wheel that robotically motors up out of the way or back into place when you remove or insert the ignition key. And ride and handling that utterly insulate you from the harsh realities of the road. Perhaps cars are getting too good, too cool and emotionless, for the GS 300 is exciting in the way the latest mega-ram notebook computer is exciting: the soulless new machine.<p>But remember, this is a subtle machine. At first, you might think it little more than a highly refined rolling cocoon with a superb sound system (Nakamichi, seven speakers, a 12-CD changer in the trunk, $1,900 extra on the order form). The GS 300 has all the right luxury cues, such as please-touch-me polished walnut here and there, gathered leather (another $1,300), thick carpeting, and switches and controls that all show intense attention to tactile satisfaction.<p>After a few hundred miles, you'll find yourself increasingly intrigued by the car's incredible suppleness, its balance and comfort, as you sculpt back-road corners and bends. Bend on some more throttle and awaken a polite but distinct metallic wail from the three-liter, 24-valve, dual-overhead-cam six. Steering that first seemed too light and delicate will start to feel more linear and remarkably precise.<p>Some automobiles__German cars, particularly__transmit through steering wheel and seat cushion a sense of the road that encourages you to drive hard. The GS 300 is a bit different; you get the sense that somewhere under you, there's an enormous amount of work going on__suspension bits and driveline parts doing a Gregory Hines on the blacktop, an electronically controlled automatic transmission folding in seamless shifts__and that it accomplishes the major part of the driving job for you.<p>In a world that offers a number of excellent upmarket cars for $30,000 or less__Volvo 850, Mazda 929, Mitsubishi Diamante LS, Saab 9000 Turbo, the just-introduced <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a> New Yorker and LHS__the GS 300, at a base price of nearly $38,000, is good enough that it might make you reassess even the harshest value-versus-esthetics equation you've developed. <p> <p>

						 <p>By Carla Koehl<p>Whether the motivation is travel or business__or the debatably noble idea that one really ought to be bilingual__choosing how to learn a new language shouldn't be harder than actually learning it. <p>Still, the sheer number of methods for learning, say, Spanish, is enough to make anyone quit before even beginning. We've picked some of the best choices available, offered up reviews and prices, and noted proficiency levels the average student should be able to achieve. Despite all this, it should be noted that the best known methods for achieving complete fluency are still a bottle of Rioja ($5 to $50) and a flight to Costa Rica ($720 to $920 round trip from N.Y.C.).<p>LANGUAGE BOOKS<p>Mastering Spanish, Level Two, Barron's
Cost: $14.95; Time: 1 hour a day Result: Beginners who study Barron's for 6 months will be able to read and write basic Spanish phrases.<p>Spanish: A Short Course, Harper
Cost: $38.95; Time: Too long. Result: As densely written as it is dull, it manages to pack 5 years into one. Numbing but totally thorough.<p>LANGUAGE TAPES & CDs<p>Living Language: Spanish
(includes 2 tapes or CDs, dictionary, and lesson book)
Cost: $20.00/tapes, $30.00/CDs; Time: Beginners should listen to the 90-min. tapes at least twice. Result: Updated phrases and clear explanations of grammatical patterns bring these lessons out of the "Did you have a good crossing?" dark ages, and into the "How was your trip?" present.<p>Mastering Spanish, Barron's
(includes 11 CDs; companion book) 
Cost: $100; Time: Listening to 12 hours of CDs the suggested five times could take the rest of one's adult life. Result: Beginners and intermediates can go as far with these CDs as time and patience allow, achieving near-fluency. <p>PRIVATE TUTOR<p>College student, 
found through campus newspapers' classified ads. Cost: $10/hour; Time: 10 hours. Result: Beginners will learn basic grammar and phrases. Intermediates can hone conversational skills.<p>Spanish Institute, N.Y.C. Cost: $40/hour; Time: Minimum of 10 hours. Result: Intensive program gives beginners the needed skills to travel abroad. Another 20 hours will teach them to converse, read, and write fairly fluidly. <p>IMMERSION COURSES<p>Spanish Institute, N.Y.C.
Cost: $975; Time: 1 week. Result: Beginners learn conversational confidence, basic grammar. Advanced students get solid reinforcement of all language skills. <p>Harvard Summer School, Cambridge, MA
Cost: $2,350 (+$1,950 for room and board); Time: 8 weeks, intermediates only. Result: Students are expected to achieve moderate fluency in intensive course study. <p>International Homestays, Miami, FL
Cost: $6,670; time: 4 weeks. Varying time commitments available. Result: Taking 25 hours a week of instruction and living full-time in a Spanish- speaking home results in near-fluency. __Carla Koehl

						 <p>By Carla Koehl<p>If the idea of sitting still at the beach for more than ten or fifteen minutes at a time induces terminal nausea, be assured escape is possible. There are enough new sports gadgets and toys in this summer's lineup to exhaust even the most zealous weekend athlete__and not one of them involves Velcro Ping-Pong paddles.<p>Self-respecting runners with too much dignity to bounce, Tigger-like, along the shore on NordicTrack's new Exerlopers ($199.95 a pair; 800-445-2209) will want to opt for the best all-terrain running shoes on the market: Asics Gel Trail-Lytes ($85). The tongueless, wraparound design keeps out pebbles and errant seaweed, and the hard-rubber outsoles are responsive even in the deepest sand. Anyone who can stand the colors__gray specks splattered on the midsoles, with hot pink and purple for women; plum, "papaya," and blue for men__will find these lightweight (9-oz.) shoes are the best things that ever happened to their hamstrings (Asics 800-766-2742). Sport sandal lovers who are sick of scuffing boat decks and sailboards with their black-bottomed Tevas now have the option of white-bottomed ones, new this year from Deckers Corp. (800-433-2537). The Deck Contour sandals ($62 a pair) have new, non-skid neoprene and rubber treads that minimize slipping in any direction. Teva's standard nylon woven straps are adjustable in the heel and toe. <p>The smallest and newest in hi-tech sports gadgetry for 1993 should more than satisfy the speed-obsessed: The Skywatch windmeter ($64.95 from Windsurfing Express, 800-843-7873) fits in the harness pocket of any sailboard, and the Blade Trainer computerized speedometer ($44.95 from Inline USA, 800-685-6806) clips on the toe of any in-line skate. Express Line skating gloves ($29.95 at 800-521-0549) come complete with detachable rearview mirror, Velcro'd to the back of the left-hand glove, and hard plastic palm guards. Mid-collision, it's also worth clutching a pair of Ray-Bans with DiamondHard Scratch-Protection from Bausch & Lomb (800-828-1430). The new surface makes the sunglasses ten times more scratch-resistant than regular glass, and repels water to reduce spotting (available only on certain Ray-Bans, from $110 for Cats to $128 for Wayfarers).<p>Despite efforts to the contrary, there are still those who remain convinced the beach was meant for the prone. For them, there's the new Crazy Creek chair (about $50) in an extra-wide 17.5 inches, with a full half-inch of foam padding, and two extra inches of height for neck support, coming out in August from Crazy Creek (800-331-0304). And anyone who's been dragged, kicking and screaming, to the beach from the office can console himself with Bare's new fake cellular phone water bottle ($6) with antenna as nozzle, available at Sailboard Warehouse (800-992-SAIL). <p>Those still fiercely clinging to childhood should pick up a SlingKing Jr., the only hand-held Day-Glo water-balloon launcher that hurls wet ones up to 50 yards (adult size launches up to 75 yards). "Target use only" is the not-reassuring disclaimer printed on each launcher, but it's so tough to stretch back the rubber tubing that even Mom and Dad will have a hard time doing any damage with it ($24.95 for one, $21.95 for two, and $19.95 for three from SlingKing, 800-788-5553; 100 balloons included with each launcher).<p> <p><p><p>

					<font size=4>
						 <p>By Margaret Opsata<p>John and Linda Cifarelli and their daughters, two-year-old Nina and five-month-old Annabelle, moved into their Burlington, Vermont, lake-front home in August 1988. Four months later, with accumulating snow in the overnight forecast, the family turned on, for the first and last time, the gas-powered driveway de-icer that had come with the house. By morning, Nina and her parents were dead, poisoned by carbon monoxide fumes that had seeped into the house from the de-icing heater in the adjoining garage. Little Annabelle and an overnight house guest survived.<p>The state of Vermont charged the previous owner of the home, Stephen Converse Brooks, with three counts of involuntary manslaughter for failing to disclose the dangerous condition of the heater to the buyers. The prosecutor argued that Brooks was well aware of the problem because his girlfriend and child had been hospitalized for carbon monoxide poisoning only a year earlier. But the former Republican Party chairman for Burlington and Chittenden County maintained that he had had the defective appliance disconnected soon after his near tragedy. He blamed the local gas company for reconnecting the device without alerting the Cifarellis to the danger. The jury, however, concluded that Brooks had been criminally negligent, and the judge sentenced him to 15 years for each death.<p>Caveat emptor__"let the buyer beware"__has been the rule of thumb in real estate transactions dating back to English common law. But these days, a new credo, caveat venditor ("let the seller beware"), may be more accurate.<p>Indeed, although it is unusual for a former homeowner to face a prison sentence, today sellers can incur severe penalties for not disclosing material defects in their properties. Courts generally support the view that buyers should be told not only about malfunctioning equipment, but also about roof leaks, plumbing problems, structural flaws, hazardous wiring, and any other conditions that could jeopardize health, safety, or property value. Some juries have even ruled that a seller is obliged to reveal that a murder or suicide occurred on the premises or that the house may be haunted.<p>And to save home sellers from this legal onslaught of litigious home buyers, an industry has sprung up, offering products from errors-and-omissions insurance to home inspections. But in most cases, people would be better off keeping their money and just telling the truth. <p>HOME WARRANTY<p>One such booming business is sales of home-warranty protection, which is growing by 50 percent a year, according to John M. Kinker, president of the National Home Warranty Association and founder of his own home-warranty company, Guaranteed Homes, in Lake St. Louis, Missouri. A handful of national firms and dozens of regional and local companies offer service agreements for repair or replacement of heating or air conditioning system components and of built-in appliances that work at the time of sale but break within 12 months. Home warranties have a $35 to $200 deductible and they cost between $350 and $500. By purchasing warranty protection for buyers, sellers are told, their houses may sell more quickly and their chances of being sued for equipment failures should diminish.<p>It's true the cost is relatively low, but then what's the real chance that something will happen in the first year after sale? If the need for this kind of coverage didn't exist while the seller lived in the house, why is it necessary now?<p>Moreover, sellers who decide to buy a home warranty cannot do so on the open market__the only people who offer the policies are real estate brokers, who earn up to $60 for each contract they sell, if they are fortunate enough to do business in a state where such payments are permitted. In addition, brokers who agree to sell home warranties can also receive discounts on their own errors-and-omissions insurance, a product designed to protect them from suits by disgruntled customers. <p>E&O INSURANCE<p>People who've put their homes on the market over the past few months may have been offered one such new product, "sellers' errors and omissions insurance," from Homeowners Marketing Services (HMS) in Hollywood, Florida. Their high-powered sales brochure, which is illustrated with realistic-looking bullet holes and pictures of spent cartridges, advises buying the new insurance "before you become a target" of buyers who can sue for "any situation or condition that happened in the past, is scheduled to happen in the future__or even might happen in the future__that may directly or indirectly affect your property value." <p>For only $200, payable at closing, a seller can buy $100,000 of E&O coverage for one year with no deductible. (Sellers who list with HMS member brokers automatically get $25,000 of insurance with a $5,000 deductible.)<p>Again, the cost is low (free if sellers take the automatic coverage), but the benefits may be equally as valuable. The HMS brochure describes coverage for "Innocent omissions. Accidental errors. Frivolous statements you don't even think twice about, that turn out to be false or misleading." A better strategy may be to think twice about any representations and to provide a full and frank disclosure about the house.<p>HOME INSPECTIONS<p>Another group that stands ready to serve home sellers for a price are the companies that provide home inspections. For $250 to $350, an inspector will provide a written report on the current condition of a home, pointing out existing and potential problems with construction and equipment. <p>"We promote home inspections at the time of listing, so the seller can have a report available for buyers to peruse," says Kenneth T. Austin, chairman of Bound Brook, New Jersey-based HouseMaster of America, the largest franchiser of home inspection companies in the country. For an additional $95, a HouseMaster inspector will walk a prospective buyer through the home to explain the report. <p>Proponents contend that a home inspection can focus attention on details like rust stains or cracks that the seller might not otherwise disclose because they seemed so insignificant but which, to a trained professional, are clear symptoms of trouble ahead that buyers should know about. "Homeowners could have problems if they knew about a condition but ignored or lived with it," says Harry S. Rosenthal, general counsel to the American Society of Home Inspectors. <p>However, an inspection also can reveal unpleasant surprises, such as construction that is not up to code or high levels of radon gas__facts the seller would then be obliged to disclose to prospective buyers. "Once you have an inspection, you can no longer say you didn't know about it," Rosenthal points out.<p>Consequently, a home inspection may do more harm than good, at least from a legal standpoint. "The last thing you want to do is uncover an expensive problem like a leaking underground oil tank," says Gordon C. Duus, who heads the environmental practice at the Hackensack, New Jersey, law firm of Cole, Schotz, Bernstein, Meisel & Forman.<p>People who sell protection products want sellers to believe that they could be liable for not disclosing defects they knew nothing about. But, in reality, courts do not expect homeowners to have X-ray vision or to be psychic. The buyer has to show that the seller knew or should have known and concealed the information. "Ignorance is a defense," emphasizes Harvey A. Miller of Cole, Schotz. Adds Diane Tiberend, an associate at the law firm of Cox, Castle & Nicholson in Irvine, California, "A homeowner does not have any obligation to rip the house apart to check it out before selling it." Of course, if the buyer requests an inspection, it will be hard to refuse. But let the buyer ask.<p>DISCLOSURE FORMS<p>The cornerstone of any seller's defense is disclosure, and to be sure they've covered everything, many realtors recommend use of a disclosure form, a detailed questionnaire about the condition of the property. To date, nine states (Alaska, California, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Wisconsin) have made seller-disclosure forms mandatory, and more state legislatures are considering the idea. Unfortunately, some forms actually do more harm than good. "A good disclosure form should protect the seller, but some are so awful that they put the seller in a completely untenable position [by asking questions no reasonable person could answer]," says Jerilyn Coates, an agent for 15 years with Carriage Trade Realty in Wayne, Pennsylvania. "I have seen some that even I couldn't fill out for my own house."<p>A disclosure form is a legal document; anyone who fills one out should seek the help of a real estate attorney, who can advise what disclosures are required by law and how best to word the responses. A lawyer typically charges from $400 to $1,200 for this kind of advice, but this should not add to the costs of sale, because most states require sellers to be represented at closing anyway. Having an attorney review the disclosure statement (and, later, the sales agreement) is really only getting full value for the fee.<p>Attorneys advise clients to be factual and forthcoming but not to volunteer extraneous information and never to guess at answers on a disclosure form. If a form asks the age of the roof, for instance, the seller may be tempted to estimate the time based on what the previous owner may have said or the recollections of a neighbor, who is pretty sure the roof was installed right after her youngest child had the chicken pox. However, unless the seller has a receipt from the roofing contractor or other written documentation that firmly fixes the date, the correct response should be "I don't know."<p>AS IS<p>Do the words "as is" added into the contract really protect the seller? Not according to HMS. "If you think putting 'as is' in the contract lets you off the hook  you may be wrong. And it could cost you a bundle," proclaims the bullet-riddled brochure. However, the examples of "innocent omissions" and "accidental errors" that HMS supplies seem neither innocent nor accidental: "not remembering" to mention that a halfway house is being built next door, misrepresenting the zoning, warranting plumbing and mechanical systems without inspections, promising that a home will double in value over a short period of time. Some would say that homeowners who behave so irresponsibly deserve to be sued.<p>The truth is, offering a house "as is" does protect sellers who allow inspections requested by buyers, offer no warranties, and make clear that buyers have no future rights or remedies for undiscovered problems. The words "as is" may frighten away some buyers, but these people are likely to be litigious sorts who are better avoided anyway.<p>Rather than falling prey to scare tactics, sellers can save the money they might otherwise spend on protection products and perhaps stay just as safe simply by being honest, choosing a broker whose interests are inseparable from the seller's, and following the advice of an experienced real estate lawyer every step of the way. <p>As further protection, clauses in the real estate contract that have the prevailing party in a lawsuit agreeing to pay the attorneys' fees for both parties should be lined out. Some lawyers view such provisions as a free ticket to a fishing expedition, since they get paid regardless of the outcome. "People are more cautious about litigation," Tiberend notes, "when they have to pay for their own lawyer." <p>An award-winning journalist, Margaret Opsata has written about real estate investments for the past 20 years.<p>-----<p>BE OPEN WITH LIMITS<p>If a prospective buyer requests an inspection and is willing pay for it, homeowners should agree to it, as a token of good faith and to show that they have nothing to hide. But they should also establish some ground rules. Since buyers often procrastinate, there should be a time limit for inspections, so the house will not be kept off the market by a buyer who eventually backs out of the deal; a clause, for example, stating that if the buyers do not meet a deadline, they waive any right to claim for damages. 
Decide in advance who will pay to repair any problems the inspector finds. "We try to put dollar limits on what the seller will spend__for example, anything up to $3,000 the buyer must take care of; anything over that amount, the seller will consider fixing, or we will renegotiate the contract," says Harvey Miller of Cole, Schotz.

Federal Express, every MBA student knows, owes its success to the realization that the parcel-post business is less about planes, trucks, and boxes than about the software that routes and tracks them. Now FedEx has put that capability in everyone's hands by fixing it on the Web (<a HREF="http://www.fedex.com">www.fedex.com</A>): Users can send packages by merely working a keyboard. Obtaining a FedEx account takes but a minute, and airwaybills can be printed on your own plain paper. The site can direct shippers to thousands of FedEx drop-off spots where supplies are available and where packages can be deposited for delivery or a courier summoned for pickup; the site will estimate when a driver will show up. Packages can be tracked easily and delivery confirmed. United Parcel Service (<a HREF="http://www.ups.com">www.ups.com</A>) has also parked on the Web. Its site won't print a label, but users can calculate costs, identify drop-off locations, summon a truck (for air shipments), and track packages. The U.S. Postal Service (<a HREF="http://www.usps.gov">www.usps.gov</A>) lets users track parcels sent via its premium Express Mail service. But the site's real virtue is its wealth of information, including tables that let users locate zip codes and calculate postage.<p>

						The Sovereign Individual
By James Dale Davidson and Lord William
Rees-Mogg (Simon & Schuster, $25)<p>
One World, Ready or Not
By William Greider (Simon & Schuster, $25)<p>
By Walter Russell Mead<p>
There is nothing more fashionable these days than talk about the rapid pace of economic and technological change, but the ability to imagine true change is still rare. Conventional futurists project existing trends out to infinity and predict more of the same: China will continue to get richer as industry keeps shifting from the West to the East; Medicare costs will rise as America gets older; computers will be faster and cheaper.<p>
This kind of forecasting has had a bad track record over the past 200 years. Betting on the status quo has been the surest way to lose money since the time of Louis XVI and George III. From the industrial revolution on, the world has experienced one upheaval after another. Each generation has had to live in a world radically different from anything known or expected by its parents. In 1915, virtually no one had heard of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin or Adolf Hitler; Communism and fascism hardly existed. A couple of decades ago, leaders like Jeane Kirkpatrick and Richard Nixon believed that Western democracies were fighting a defensive battle against the powerful and confident Communism of Leonid Brezhnev. Financial analysts assumed that inflation was here to stay, and many predicted that gold and oil prices would skyrocket through the 1980s. Today most people think that the triumph of Western democracy and market economics in the Cold War has set the stage for an indefinite period of American supremacy, democratic stability, and economic prosperity.<p>
On the other hand, unconventional futurists, the ones who won't draw a smooth, straight line into infinity, commonly descry a fall off the cliff. Writers like Ravi Batra offer advice on how to survive the coming great depression; goldbugs have built an industry on predicting an imminent collapse of the paper-money system. In short, to build a convincing future scenario that resembles neither a financial apocalypse nor a continuation of the present seems one of the most difficult things in the world to do.<p>
Yet two books from very different perspectives, one on the right and one on the left, successfully challenge both dooms-day scenarios and the comfortable views we are used to. Neither The Sovereign Individual, by James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg, nor One World, Ready or Not, by William Greider, is perfect, but both illuminate issues important to anyone investing over a time horizon beyond a couple of years.<p>
Start with the latest contribution from Davidson and Rees-Mogg, a former editor at the right-wing Times of London who can be as dotty as his name. Rees-Mogg and Davidson loathe patriotism, the United States, and democracy. They think all three are doomed and may turn ugly as they die. Their advice to Americans: Forget patriotism, get a second passport, move money out of the country before it's too late, and give up on the American experiment in democracy.<p>
U.S. readers will find this book peculiar. Some of the thinking in it is obviously flaky, particularly the acceptance of the extreme charges against the Clintons (Vince Foster was murdered; Bill Clinton knowingly consorted with major drug figures). Whatever their faults, the Clintons are almost certainly not as bad as Rees-Mogg and Davidson believe, and like so many Brits from the days of Lord North up to the present, the authors seriously underestimate the resiliency and inner strength of the American political system. Yet readers would be mistaken to throw the book across the room in disgust, because it has some fascinating things to say. The central insight is that the relationship between rich individuals and the state is changing in unpredictable ways and that the ideological and political ground is preparing for a radical shift. The authors argue that the nation-state was a creation of the old, industrial-based technology. The increasingly dominant information-based technology is eroding the foundation of the nation-state.<p>
From below, the rise of organized crime erodes the authority of government. From above, the globalization of the economy and the increased use of electronic commerce, which lets people conduct their affairs far from the prying eyes of tax collectors, shrink the capability of national governments to manage their economies and collect revenues. Add in the demographic squeeze (the obligations to fulfill generous pension and Social Security promises to an aging population), and you've got a death spiral of rising costs and shrinking revenues. Rees-Mogg and Davidson welcome this process: Existing levels of taxation on the rich are fundamentally unjust, the authors claim, and far exceed the value of any government services the rich receive in exchange.<p>
The future forecast here looks in some ways like the Middle Ages, when people did not think of themselves primarily as members of a national group or assume that the state would provide basic services to most of the population. Big nation-states will break into smaller privatized units. Just as how in the Middle Ages the poor and weak sought protection from powerful knights and lords, so in the future ordinary people will look to the rich and powerful for protection and justice, offering obedience and loyalty in return.<p>
The Sovereign Individual has little counsel for governments in places like the United States. Rather, it offers advice to individuals: Get out while you can. Populist rage will grow as our government fails to reduce the growing gap between economic winners and losers. Strapped for revenue, the government will raise taxes on the rich and increase its use of "exit taxes" to punish wealthy individuals who renounce their U.S. citizenship to avoid tax obligations.<p>
William Greider's vision of the future, as revealed in One World, Ready or Not, comes from a very different place on the political spectrum. Greider is a convinced democrat and an American patriot who thinks the nation-state should remain a strong feature of political life. Where Rees-Mogg and Davidson see the state as a morally neutral or even immoral political unit, Greider believes the concept of a national society bound by duties and moral obligations is an essential part of the world picture. Still, he identifies many of the same forces at work that Davidson and Rees-Mogg do, and he, too, predicts rough sledding ahead for the nation-state as we know it.<p>
What separates these two books is Greider's belief that the governmental redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor is, economically speaking, a good thing. The great danger of rapid economic development, Greider argues, is that income tends to shift from the mass of the population to the most affluent parts of society, which have the skills to take advantage of new technologies and opportunities. Income redistribution not only assures political stability -- insuring the rich against social catastrophe and class war -- but also stimulates economic growth. If money is not moved to the middle class and other mass-market consumers, there will not be enough demand to buy the products industry turns out. This would result in slower growth and, under certain conditions, economic depression.<p>
Davidson and Rees-Mogg counter that redistribution transfers assets from wealthy individuals, who know how to invest them, to government bureaucrats, who don't. A classic example: Government-funded pension programs, such as Social Security, put money in government bonds rather than in stock markets, reducing the returns on invested capital for the system and cutting the availability of cheap capital for the entrepreneurs who could make the economy grow.<p>
Where Rees-Mogg and Davidson worry about Luddite populists destroying the economy in pursuit of short-term interests, Greider concentrates his fire on a runaway affluent class that neglects its social responsibilities -- a class also in hot pursuit of short-term goals.<p>
Both dangers are, I think, real -- and globalization aggravates them to a large degree. Redistribution has actual economic costs, and economic globalization puts redistributive jurisdictions, such as Germany and the United States, at a competitive disadvantage to open, low-tax countries like Switzerland and, especially, to offshore bank havens like the Cayman Islands. Yet Greider is also right to argue on behalf of the nation-state's still enormous moral authority; Americans feel that other U.S. citizens ought not to perish for lack of housing or health care. It may be irrational, but we believe we owe one another and our country more than we owe citizens of other countries. Also, such transfer payments result in higher consumer demand and stronger economic growth.<p>
Clearly, the future is going to be bumpier than most people think. These books can be seen as opening shots in a new class war between the rich, who want to exploit and extend their gains from globalization, and the rest of the population, who want to rein them in. Investors should study both books carefully; to read them is to get a sneak preview of the forces and passions likely to transform our investment and political horizons over the next generation.<p>

						THE CASE AGAINST MICROSOFT
Why a great company is no longer a good investment<p>
By Jim Jubak<p>
It's almost hard to believe that a company so large (nearly $9 billion in annual revenue) and so well established (22 years old) can still be performing this well. True, Microsoft has made a habit of success. But even by its standards, 1996 was an extraordinary year.<p>
It was a year in which the company defied the skeptics and mobilized its resources to meet the competitive challenge posed by Netscape Communications. In which sales rose an estimated 40 percent while earnings grew even faster. And in which the price of Microsoft's stock doubled, propelling chairman Bill Gates's personal wealth even further into the ionosphere.<p>
Wall Street deeply believes in Microsoft. The market has priced the company's stock at 46 times annual earnings per share. Figures compiled by Zacks Investment Research show that 23 of the 30 analysts who follow Microsoft still recommend it as a buy even at its recent price. Collectively, these analysts expect the company's earnings to rise at least 23 percent annually for the next five years.<p>
Microsoft, in other words, has now achieved one more noteworthy feat: It has become a sure thing. <p>
Which is exactly why I think there's good reason to be concerned about the stock. By bidding the price up to 46 times earnings, investors have given themselves almost no leeway for bad news, let alone room for improvement. Most of the good news is already baked into the price of the stock, so how much more upside reward can there be? <p>
By my calculations, even if Microsoft's earnings growth keeps pace with analysts' estimates, from this price the stock should deliver no better than an 11 percent annual return in the next few years. Basically, Microsoft would match the long-term performance of the market as a whole. If growth slows even slightly, investors would make more money by buying a 30-year Treasury bond and clipping coupons.<p>
I probably wouldn't be such a skeptic if one other person hadn't also recently expressed concern about Microsoft's future: Bill Gates. At the annual shareholders' meeting this past November, he said: "We have a number of competitors that are working in concert...that pose a major challenge to us -- perhaps the largest challenge that's faced us in a long, long time."<p>
Microsoft is a great company -- the world's best-managed software outfit. But it still has its work cut out for it. It's not the sure bet Wall Street believes it is.<p>
A fair appraisal of Microsoft has to take into account that many of its products hold dominant positions in mature markets. This means there's little or no room left to grow at the expense of competitors or to increase overall sales at previous rates. Moreover, regardless of who wins the browser wars between Microsoft and Netscape, the Internet almost certainly is going to pose a continued serious threat to Microsoft's entire lineup of software products, including its most important offering: the operating system that runs 90 percent of the world's personal computers.<p>
By the end of this year, the familiar files-and-folders format of the Windows operating system will begin its slow trek into computer oblivion -- both Microsoft and Netscape will make their browsers the first thing a user sees when a computer gets turned on. Also headed for extinction, as consumers get accustomed to downloading whatever tools they need over the Internet: the $499 shrink-wrapped PC-software program. Say good-bye, too, to the market for the expensive biannual upgrade package. Upgrades will be easily accessible over the Net.<p>
Bill Gates is right: Microsoft is moving toward its biggest challenge since it first crawled out of the entrepreneurial ooze in 1981 -- the year the company purchased the DOS operating system from Seattle Computer for, according to legend, $75,000. <p>
I don't doubt that Microsoft will survive all of these challenges and remain a force to be reckoned with for years to come. The folks at Microsoft are too aware of what they did to IBM to let the same thing happen to them. <p>
But will Microsoft be able to preserve its near monopoly and juicy profit margins? Infatuated as it is with Microsoft at the moment, Wall Street certainly appears to think so. I'm less sanguine.<p>
Wall Street's current love affair with Microsoft stands in sharp contrast to the rocky relationship between the two as recently as 1995. Perhaps you remember: The development of Microsoft's new operating system, originally slated to launch in December 1994, was running horribly behind schedule. With the company's credibility at stake, Gates drew a line in the sand by naming the product Windows 95. The birth finally took place in August of that year with a multimillion-dollar marketing blitz and a mountain of publicity.<p>
While all of this was going on, though, a previously unknown (to Wall Street) company called Netscape stole the limelight. Netscape's innovation was a browser that enabled computer users to easily download the graphics-heavy information on the World Wide Web, the fastest-growing part of the Internet. On August 9, 1995, Netscape rocked the market with a red-hot initial public offering. That day, Netscape shares soared from $28 to a high of $75 before settling back to close at $58.<p>
Microsoft's stock, on the other hand, had stalled out. After rising from $31 a share in early February to $52 on July 14, its trading price drifted downward just as the arrival of the long-delayed Windows 95 product and the company's huge marketing and press campaigns should have been driving it higher. <p>
Analysts concluded that Microsoft had missed the boat. Although it had rushed its own Web browser to market, its Internet Explorer was clearly inferior to Netscape's product -- and the gap just seemed to get larger when Netscape launched its second-generation Navigator on September 18.<p>
By then, the word was out: Microsoft didn't have a credible Internet strategy. All anyone needed to do to confirm this suspicion was check out the Microsoft Network, a lame new online service that adopted the outdated membership structure of America Online -- a company itself challenged by the Web. On November 16, 1995, Goldman Sachs removed Microsoft's stock from its recommended list, citing the company's lack of an Internet strategy. Others on Wall Street quickly followed.<p>
The Street was right about one thing: The Internet poses a serious challenge to Microsoft and its monopolistic grip on the market for computer operating systems. Windows not only generates an estimated $35 in revenue for each program installed by a computer maker, but its ubiquity gives Microsoft enormous clout in its other software lines. Microsoft programmers working on a spreadsheet or word-processing product simply know more about the underlying operating system than do independent software producers. They also have the inside track on updates. (Microsoft shares all this information with independent companies. The speed and extent of its sharing is a matter of industry debate.) Finally, Microsoft leverages its relationships with computer makers to ensure that its spreadsheets, games, and word-processing software come already installed on new machines.<p>
Netscape's Internet browser seemed like it could end Microsoft's lock on the operating system and, in turn, weaken its hold on the software market. How come? Because Navigator, linked with the Java software language from Sun Microsystems, is platform neutral. That means it will run on a Windows machine, a Macintosh, or in Unix. Java enables programmers to write applications that can be understood by any platform. Operating systems cease to matter.<p>
But on December 7, the anniversary of Pearl Harbor, Gates launched a counterattack that, at least in the opinion of Wall Street analysts, would successfully blunt the Netscape challenge. At a news conference, the software magnate pointedly quoted Japanese admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's 1941 fears that Japan's sneak attack had awoken a sleeping giant. Gates then disclosed plans to send wave after wave of products and near-products out to battle Netscape. The assault, Gates said, would include the next generations of Windows and Microsoft Office, both of which would be linked to the Internet. Windows NT, a new operating system for corporate networks, would provide easy access to the Net as well. And he promised that a revamped Microsoft Network would make its proprietary content accessible to all users of the Net.<p>
Some of the products and initiatives Gates trumpeted on December 7 turned out to be vaporware -- a standard Microsoft tactic that sets out to freeze the opposition in place simply by announcing a product that doesn't yet exist. But an impressively high percentage of the new offerings Gates listed that day are already on the market. MSN was relaunched as a full-service Internet gateway last November. Office 97 added the ability to communicate and publish information on the Net to old standby programs such as Excel. Internet Explorer 3.0, meanwhile, closed the technology gap with Netscape's Navigator.<p>
Microsoft's performance was so impressive that Wall Street couldn't help but kick itself for losing faith. <p>
"I thought that Microsoft was about to get smoked. It looked to me like they simply didn't get it," recalls Roger McNamee, general partner at Integral Capital Partners, an investment partnership in Menlo Park, California. But somehow, he marvels, within nine months the company got its act together. "I'm amazed at the religious zeal they've applied to reinventing themselves."<p>
"Gates did a remarkable thing," adds Michael Murphy, editor of California Technology Stock Letter. "The clich about big oil tankers is that the captain decides to change course and 12 miles later the ship begins to turn. But Gates managed to turn a $9 billion company virtually on a dime."<p>
As far as Wall Street is concerned, December 1995 marked the high-water mark for Netscape and its threat to Microsoft: Netscape's stock peaked at a pre-split-adjusted $171 a share just days before Gates's speech. No one on Wall Street now wonders if Microsoft will survive. Now Netscape is seen as the company with the questionable future.<p>
The problem with this version of events -- the story as Wall Street now sees it -- is that it radically simplifies the challenge facing Microsoft (just as the Street's fears about the company may have been overblown in the first place). And it overestimates the kinds of returns an investor can expect from Microsoft.<p>
In some ways, the account doesn't give Bill Gates and his team enough credit. The task wasn't simply to galvanize a 20,000-employee company to squash an 1,500-employee upstart like Netscape. The true challenge cut much closer to the company's core.<p>
Microsoft is an incredibly complex enterprise, but it earns its money in a straightforward manner. It sells new software -- $499 (retail) for Office 97, for example. It also charges current users to upgrade to the newest version -- $209 (retail) to upgrade Office. Both parts of this revenue stream are showing disquieting signs of maturity.<p>
Since Microsoft already has about as large a share of the market for existing users as it's likely to get, growth in first-time sales of programs is pretty much limited to the increase in sales of new personal computers -- which was about 15.5 percent in 1996 and is expected to slow to 14.5 percent in 1997.<p>
The upgrade business, meanwhile, traditionally works on a two-year cycle. Every other year, Microsoft rolls out new versions of Windows and Office. Users plunk down $60 for Windows and $210 for Office. This revenue stream, however, depends heavily on the consumer's appetite for newer, faster, and more -- an appetite that is showing signs of satiety (partly because software upgrades force users to make costly hardware upgrades). The incremental improvements that Microsoft made in Windows 95, for instance, did not send every Windows 3.1 user racing to the store. Dataquest, a market-research firm in San Jose, California, estimates that when all the figures are in Microsoft will have sold 46 million copies of Windows 95 by the end of 1996, 27 percent fewer than Dataquest originally projected. <p>
Office 97, which is expected to account for more than $3 billion in annual sales, may be facing an even bigger upgrade problem. The very complexity of the package, which is about 20 percent larger than Office 95, gives many users a reason not to risk overtaxing their machines to gain marginal improvement. Only 25 percent of users made the jump to Office 95 when the program was last upgraded.<p>
The Internet offers Microsoft a way to keep users upgrading and a potential source of new growth. Microsoft is "Web-enabling" all its software to make it easier to move directly from a program to the Web then back to the program. Work is under way to seamlessly link the next generation of such programs as Excel with the Internet so that a user can download information from the Web into a spreadsheet. Adding the Internet to the next upgrade, Microsoft's marketers have decided, provides the kind of improvement that will help drive sales. "The thinking is," says McNamee, "that people aren't paying for the functionality we've been adding so we'll Web-enable everything and people will pay us for that."<p>
The Internet also offers Microsoft opportunity for growth. Most Internet users now pay about $20 a month for Internet access. MSN is Microsoft's attempt to capture some of those dollars. Computer users who want MSN to be their gateway to the Internet can put the entire $20 into Microsoft's pocket.<p>
Microsoft also wants to get paid for content it creates, the primary reason for its investment ($220 million up front and $70 million a year) in MSNBC, a combined cable-TV news channel and Web page. Other Microsoft content either already on the Internet or under development includes Mungo Park, an adventure travel show that transmits video of its explorers to the Net, and Slate, a magazine of politics and culture edited by Michael Kinsley, formerly of The New Republic. Microsoft has said it plans to spend $300 million to $400 million annually to develop such content for at least the next three years.<p>
Microsoft's current course, while probably the best one the company could have adopted, should be seen for what it is -- a risky transition strategy whose success rests on proper timing and an unproven Internet business model. Web-enabling the newest generation of Office and the one thereafter gives the company a chance to preserve its revenue stream from upgrades of that product. "If Microsoft can maintain the value of the Office franchise, then it will keep growing at 25 percent a year," says McNamee. He also notes, however, that upgrading to a Web-enabled Office 97 makes no sense for much of the market. McNamee rates the company's chances of convincing a bare majority of users to upgrade to Ofce 97 as no better than 60-40. <p>
But Web-enabling its software is also risky: Microsoft may succeed in fending off Netscape, but its strategy will also accelerate the growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web.<p>
That has far-reaching effects on Microsoft's business model. Java makes it possible to embed programs in information. As a result, computer users won't need to activate a program like Excel to read or interpret data downloaded from the Internet. Instead, the data will arrive with their own spreadsheet or word-processing application -- an applet, in Java-speak -- already attached. <p>
Such downloads won't be free, of course. Data providers and software companies aim to collect fees for these transactions. Microsoft wants to sit "at the center of this huge array of transactions and collect a few cents every time someone uses their software in an application," says Murphy.<p>
This strategy could potentially channel a lot of revenue in Microsoft's direction but almost certainly at lower margins than Microsoft now enjoys. This won't be catastrophic for the company, but it could have big consequences for investors. As the table on page 67 shows, Microsoft's huge market capitalization hinges on its immense profitability. The company's 24.8 percent net profit margin humbles even such earnings machines as Coca-Cola and Merck. Put those high margins together with the company's extraordinary growth rate, and it's clear why Wall Street believes Microsoft is worth three Boeings -- even though Boeing's annual sales exceed $21 billion.<p>
But now consider what even a slight drop in margins does to the growth rate in Microsoft's earnings. If margins stay steady, sales growth of 35 percent a year translates into earnings growth of 35 percent. But if margins drop from their current 25 percent to just 22 percent -- still above the levels at Coke and Merck -- profit growth falls to 18 percent. (Microsoft's margin was 22 percent in the mid- to late 1980s, a period when the company still faced significant competition in the software market; it makes sense to expect the company to earn similar margins in the competitive Internet environment of the future.)<p>
If Microsoft can do no better than increase its earnings at an 18 percent annual clip -- still an impressive performance by virtually any measure -- investors should count on earning about 5 percent a year on the stock through the year 2001. Take a look at the chart titled "What If...," to see the troubling details.<p>
That chart, in fact, clearly lays out the choices facing an investor. If you believe this analysis is wrong and Microsoft will increase earnings at 25 percent a year or better, you should buy the stock. If earnings grow at 30 percent for the next five years, an investor in Microsoft should earn about 27 percent a year. Earnings growth of 25 percent annually should produce a 19 percent yearly gain.<p>
It's hard for me to imagine Microsoft increasing sales and earnings -- while keeping margins intact -- at those rates for that long. Microsoft's mature businesses won't produce those rates of growth and revenues from the new Internet business, which, though it's growing quickly, is pegged by Microsoft at no more than $2 billion a year at the end of this period. That doesn't make it another Office.<p>
No, the other growth scenarios in this chart are much more likely, and they result in annual returns to investors of just 11 percent and 5 percent. That's certainly not good enough to make me want to buy Microsoft at current price levels. I can find other software and technology stocks that are earlier in their growth cycles or had their prices knocked down in 1996 and are likely to give me higher returns than I can earn with Microsoft.<p>
Would I sell the stock at its recent price if I owned it? Not yet. Wall Street typically overvalues a stock by assuming current growth will continue forever. Microsoft is headed for such a banner 1997 that the market could well give the stock a more excessive valuation than it has now. Knockout December and March quarters could put even more of the company's future performance into the stock price. Which would, of course, give an investor even less reason to hang on for the long term.<p>

						Wine lovers can't get enough of the Napa Valley auction<p>
By Rudy Maxa<p>
Here's the first rule for wine auctions held in fabulous settings: Don't expect bargains. Not that celebrations of the grape staged in such bucolic locations as Sonoma Valley and Napa Valley aren't terrific fun. The dinner parties, the vineyard tours, and the entertainment are all top-drawer. But when it comes to actually bidding on wine, that's more about charity and showmanship than about snaring a case of the grape below retail. <p>
Would you pay $28,000 for a six-liter bottle of the second release of Colgin-Schrader cabernet sauvignon? Or $42,000 for three three-liter bottles of the 1991, 1992, and 1993 Araujo Estate cabernet sauvignon? Those were winning bids last summer at the granddaddy of all the oh-so-social wine events, the Napa Valley Wine Auction, a fund-raiser held in Saint Helena, California. <p>
"The charity auctions have built up such a momentum now, people go to them not even concerning themselves about cost or price -- they've become events," says Jack Daniels, co-owner of Wilson Daniels Ltd., a prestigious wine-importing firm in Napa Valley. "The charities are the purpose behind them all, and that's why people are there. They have a tremendous time and do tend to get caught up in it."<p>
Since its inception 16 years ago, the big Napa auction has raised more than $11 million for local health-care organizations. And this four-day event (involving about 1,600 guests, who pay around $1,250 per couple) is so much fun that getting a ticket has become difficult. Invitations for this year's auction, scheduled for June 5 to 8, will be mailed in February, so now is the time to call for one (800-982-1371 or 707-942-9783, extension 901).<p>
The first day of the Napa auction, Thursday, is devoted to tasting unbottled wine from barrels (you may bid on cases during the weekend's silent auction). That evening, attendees dine in small groups (averaging 25 guests) at about 50 participating wineries, many of which hire celebrity chefs. Last summer, for example, Paul Bertolli of Oliveto in Oakland drove the stove for Robert Mondavi and his guests, while the chef and pastry chef from Manhattan's Les Celebrites did the honors at Beringer Vineyards.<p>
On day two, Napa wineries and restaurants offer special luncheon menus for auction guests as a prelude to the weekend's largest social event, the vintners' dinner at the sprawling Meadowood resort in Saint Helena. Always themed, the dinner is a raucous affair held under an enormous tent, with dancing till midnight. And the Napa crowd is big on dancing.<p>
Saturday is auction day, and with as many as 300 lots up for bid, the event can last seven hours. Local restaurants provide outdoor booths that offer house specialties. Staff circulate through the auction tent, liberally pouring from bottles of Napa wine carried in wire baskets. <p>
Casual and social as the auction is, the bidding reaches serious heights. Last summer's top lot fetched $150,000 from one of Napa's own, Vine Cliff owner Chuck Sweeney. What did he get for his winning bid? Four dinner parties -- one for each season -- anywhere in the U.S., hosted by groups of Napa vintners, plus an astounding 90 magnums of wine, one from each member of the wine growers' association. <p>
The second-highest winning bid bought a re-creation for six people of the historic 1976 Paris Tasting, a two-night event: Julia Child and Thomas Keller (of the Napa restaurant the French Laundry) prepared the first dinner at Stag's Leap; Wolfgang Puck cooked the next night at Chateau Montelena. Throw in a couple of nine-liter bottles of 1993 wines, and you've got the package that fetched the $100,000 winning bid from Dan Lynch, who got seriously rich seven years ago when he sold his computer trade-show company to publishing giant Ziff-Davis.<p>
You don't have to be Mr. or Ms. Gotrocks to enjoy the lovely June weather in Napa Valley or the festivities that surround the auction. But along with your ticket, you'll probably need a rental car and lodging. Meadowood resort and Auberge du Soleil are the two most coveted addresses; Accommodations Referral (800-240-8466), a local agency, can help you with a range of options. <p>
If Napa sounds a bit over the top, Sonoma Valley hosts a much more informal auction weekend over Labor Day for about half the cost of the Napa package. And with visits to Sonoma vineyards, wine seminars, and an auction with buffet dinner and dancing, it's just as much fun -- you get to see winemaker and comedian Tom Smothers do tricks with his yo-yo (for details, call 707-935-0803). "If Napa is a Mercedes, Sonoma is a pickup truck with a half-breed dog in the back," says Anthony Dias Blue, chairman of the Sonoma Valley event and a regular at the Napa auction. "But everybody likes it that way."<p>

						New ways to find out if that deal really is too good to be true<p>
By Tom Nawrocki<p>
Sure, just as the endless late-night infomercials promise, there are fortunes to be made in real estate and franchised businesses, but even more fortunes have been made pushing shady get-rich-quick schemes. That's why the Federal Trade Commission, in cooperation with the North American Securities Administrators Association, has published a new series of free booklets to help consumers detect scams. <p>
The series includes the brochures Wealth-Building Scams, Work-at-Home Schemes, Multilevel Marketing Plans, Franchise Business Opportunities, and Business Opportunities: Avoiding Vending Machine and Display Rack Scams. Each contains pertinent questions to ask of potential business partners, as well as resources for more information and places to register complaints. To order any of the above titles, or for "Best Sellers," the FTC's complete list of consumer and business publications, write to Public Reference, Room 130, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. For more information, call the FTC at 202-326-3650, or check out the FTC Web site at <a HREF="http://www.ftc.gov.">http://www.ftc.gov.</A>

						It's definitely not Avon calling. Say hello to Excel Communications and the new face of network marketing.<p>
By Andrew Tilin<p>
"You guys are getting paid less, you're not living as good, you can't take care of your kids as well, and you know why?" shouts Linden Wood from the stage, his reddening face filling two of those big screens you see at rock concerts. "Because those companies you work for have decreased salaries for ten consecutive years. I'm interested in building a company on people's hopes and dreams!" At that, the boisterous, pom-pom-shaking crowd -- 5,000 men and women who have given up a temperate spring evening to sit in the still air of the Dallas Convention Center -- breaks into giddy applause. "We're not stopping in 410 cities, we're not slowing down. In fact, we're speeding up!" The twangy voice booms over the sound system, and the crowd is so riled you figure that the "Amen!'s" are right around the corner. Or that the bespectacled Wood, himself in a pretty good lather, will double over and suddenly windmill his arms gloriously skyward in the wave, which would no doubt spin around the auditorium all night long.<p>
The Super Bowl party never quite forms, but then again, the speaker has to pace himself. Ahead of Wood are two more days of this rally, a motivationfest for <a name="NYSE:ECI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=48058"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Excel Communications</b></a>, quite suddenly the fourth-largest provider of residential long-distance service in the country. But this is much more than a celebration of a phone company. It's also a love-in for network marketing -- that line of business, pioneered and still typified by Amway, where success is determined more by the number of salespeople you draft than by the sales you make. These pitchmen and -women all sell Excel.<p>
The heated rally is also an impressive manifestation of a determined movement to make much of American business anti-corporate. The way network marketers see it, big companies have become as heartless as they are shortsighted, showing their gratitude for your hard work by shrinking your income or transferring you and your loved ones to some faraway outpost, if not handing you your hat altogether. America's 200-odd network-marketing companies play against that, and none more so than Excel, whose express goal is to take network marketing upscale. The pitch is: Amway may want your mother, Mr. or Mrs. Executive, but we want you. And we can pay you.<p>
Linden Wood is proof. With an act that's part Tony Robbins, part Robert Reich, and a dash of Jed Clampett, Wood is widely reported to have a $500,000-per-month take. Somehow the Oklahoman, who proudly wears jeans with fraying hems and a blazer, still manages to brand himself a "30-year-old, broke travel agent." But these 5,000 people in Dallas are just a portion of the Excel representatives Wood educates, motivates, and makes money from. Wood's Team Excel (Team is an acronym, naturally: Together Everyone Achieves More) is 30,000 strong.<p>
What's drawing bigger and bigger crowds to the likes of Wood and network marketing isn't just the potentially fat paycheck either. It's the promise of a decidedly anti-1990s business ethos: Leave the world of cutthroat competition, and instead chum your way into happiness! Friends! A guaranteed future! Network marketers call their way capitalism with a conscience. In this business, you get everyone else to do what you do, and then everyone heads down the yellow-brick road together. Spreading the good word, direct-marketing veterans like to boast, is as easy as "telling a bunch of people to go see a good movie." Linden Wood's particular genius is that he turns old-fashioned motivational speaking into a clarion call for the oppressed white-collar masses. "In ten years," he says, "the question's not going to be, Are you in network marketing? but, What network-marketing company do you represent?"<p>
Of course, getting everyone else to do what you do -- a conversion that network marketers unabashedly term "duplication" -- might be considered the hard part. In this business, you have to be a salesperson. You have to get others to believe in the product you're pitching, and then, to become truly successful, you need to persuade them to push it as hard as you do. The sign of true duplication is when your recruit has given up job, exercise, and Monday Night Football to talk incessantly about "the opportunity." As recruits for the opportunity are told, Excel is an easy sell: The Dallas-based company has seen triple-digit growth for the better part of this decade and will easily crest $1 billion in revenues for 1996, its eighth year in business. Excel's rates are low, the service and features are on a par with <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>'s, and, well, everyone needs a dial tone.<p>
Wood lifts his crowd to peaks, sets it down gently, lifts it again -- it's an overwhelmingly skillful preacher-teacher performance. Now, under the concrete beams and the hand-painted posters with messages like WE LOVE YOU MAN, TEAM ST. LOUIS, Wood reaches for a big moment.<p>
"When I discovered Excel, I was still waiting for life to come to Linden," Wood says, walking through his own salivary spray, his cheeks becoming ruddier on the grainy monitors. "Well, that's the day I got an attitude and decided to meet destiny. We're here this weekend to get that attitude!"<p>
All this alternative-capitalism sturm und drang didn't form into a groundswell yesterday. In 1959, Jay Van Andel and Rich DeVos founded Amway, the granddaddy of all network-marketing companies, as a patriotic tribute to free enterprise. Back then, it wasn't corporate downsizing that gnawed at the collective unconscious of the American-business workforce; it was Communism. DeVos stumped for network marketing in school auditoriums and churches, banging a gong of optimism that still reverberates in the meetings held by Amway, Mary Kay, Shaklee, Herbalife, Nu Skin, Excel, and all the other network-marketing companies. "We call our company Amway," DeVos would say to crowds heavy with housewives and factory workers, "because the American way of private ownership and free enterprise is the best way."<p>
Then DeVos would sign 'em up to buy and sell all those products destined for the cabinet under the kitchen sink. Today, the process is similar, but the interested parties have evolved. More and more, network marketers are well-paid baby boomers, and so are their recruits.<p>
But corporate recruits can be difficult to pry loose. They may be grumpy, but they're mindful of the advantages of the nine-to-five: paid vacations, health insurance, retirement plans, expense accounts. Network marketing takes all these things away as it turns recruits instantly into independent representatives. Self-employed salespeople, in other words. As for organizations like Team Excel, the name perhaps misleads. Team Excel is just one of perhaps dozens of representative associations connected with Excel Communications. These associations aren't officially recognized by Excel and don't get much more from the company than a mixture of exhortation, materials, and occasional stern reminders about protocol and procedures. What a representative association primarily offers are an inspirational figure, such as Linden Wood, and a sense of community -- no small thing for people who work out of their homes, face a lot of prejudices and suspicions about their line of work, and spend most of their time hearing "no." <p>
Why would a company choose to sell itself this way? In Excel's case, network marketing allows the company to run a billion-dollar operation with no advertising budget and with just 2,200 employees (Sprint, the third-largest long-distance company in terms of revenues, has 47,500 employees). Excel's sales force is 950,000 representatives strong, and not one of those reps draws a salary, receives benefits, or gets paid for anything except pure production. If you don't bring in long-distance customers, Excel owes you nothing. It might even make money off you, because every representative is required to pay a refundable $50 fee to get on board, and the overwhelming majority step up to the $195 starter package of motivational and educational materials. Multiply those numbers by the three quarters of a million people expected to apply to sell the product in 1996, then add a few hundred dollars more per committed rep each year (for additional materials, plus, perhaps, a dedicated satellite dish and a subscription to the company-produced programming on Excelevision), and it's easy to see how 18 percent of Excel's revenue actually comes from the reps.<p>
Predictably, the work really begins once a network marketer lands a recruit. At that point, the two take on the respective roles of, in industry lingo, "upline" and "downline." The upline is something of a hybrid between benevolent shaman and Little League parent. Uplines work hard at what they call "selling the dream": Do as I do, and we'll all live like dukes. Uplines promise downlines that their hours will decrease as they become uplines in their own right and their downlines work to earn them money. The flip side is that, until a downline is well on the road to duplication, an upline must badger him or her relentlessly, always prodding the downline to bring more people to business presentations.<p>
The work is hard, in the way of any job that requires successful people always to be up. But the potential for prosperity is real, according to the numbers generated by the Direct Selling Association, a trade group representing some 200 direct-selling companies. (Direct selling is an umbrella term that covers both network marketing and single-level marketing, a simpler arrangement in which a salesperson buys products from a company and sells them. Avon is the best-known example of a single-level direct-selling company.) In the 1990s, annual sales by direct-selling companies have increased a total of about 30 percent to $18 billion -- 51 percent of it through network marketing. The number of salespeople has grown at approximately the same clip to 7.2 million -- 58 percent of them network marketers. Though direct sellers who go at the business full-time are a distinct minority, more than half the full-timers make over $50,000 annually, and one in ten makes $100,000 or more. "But don't believe anyone telling you that most new millionaires are coming out of network marketing. That's an absurdity," says DSA president Neil Offen. What's also absurd is the industry's turnover: Excel has an annual rep-turnover rate of 86 percent, and among network-marketing companies, that's considered low.<p>
Network marketing is built on stories. I was successful, I had the corner office, but someone showed me this opportunity one night and I quit my job the next day. Or,Women in my former business are only going to get so far. I wanted more. Or, I had to borrow the $195 to get into this business, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. The particulars differ, of course, but inevitably the message comes down to this: Opportunity is close, ridiculously close, for anyone with the eyes to see it and the heart to seize it.<p>
Nelson and Mark Morgan, two friendly, solidly built brothers in their early 40s, have both seized the opportunity within the past year, as they're explaining to new and old friends the morning of the second day of the Dallas rally. They're having coffee at the hotel that is serving as de facto headquarters for out-of-town rally-goers, and they're surrounded by buzzing, happy colleagues.<p>
The Morgans' story is that Nelson was a doubter, pitting his cynicism against the good sense of his entire family. For months, he refused to see the beauty of what his older brother had got involved in -- even after their father joined Excel, too, even when their mother said Nelson was just being a fool. When Nelson finally gave in and went to an opportunity meeting, it was almost entirely to get his family to change the subject. "I wasn't going to do nothing with it," Nelson says, laughing. "I was going to pay $195, become a rep, go through training, and quit. Just to keep peace in the family."<p>
The night after his training, though, Nelson had a bout of Excel insomnia. "I sat up in bed and said, 'Jiminy Christmas,'" he remembers. "I know literally hundreds of people who need this opportunity. Then I realized, I need this opportunity -- it's my way out."<p>
Both brothers are holding other jobs until their network-marketing businesses gather sufficient steam. Nelson is the director of management information systems for the Oklahoma Housing Finance Agency in Oklahoma City; Mark is a stockbroker in Dallas. Having been so difficult to bring over, Nelson is, of course, without peer in his passion for Excel, to an extent that shows up even in his vocabulary. "You don't go out to Excel," he exclaims. "You go out and live your life and Excel. I have my brochures, I have my business cards, I have my things, and while I'm out living life, I'm talking to the filling-station attendant, I'm talking with my accountant, I'm visiting with the sacker at the grocery store, I'm talking to the grocer. To put a number of hours on it is tough because you're living it." Mark sits with his arms crossed, smiling, enjoying his brother's performance.<p>
The Morgans say long-distance and pager services are just the start of the Excel empire; with the deregulation of utilities, the company can expand into services like water, gas and electric, cellular, cable, and Internet access. The Morgans chuckle contentedly about the differences between their businesses and traditional network-marketing franchises -- the "lotions and potions" companies. Excel is a white-collar network-marketing program, Mark confides, not condescendingly. "Another company might say, 'We just created a whole new line of income potential for you,'" Nelson bellows. "'You can now sell garbage cans!'" Excel is different, the brothers concur. It's cutting edge. It's money.<p>
"We're taking folks that corporations have stomped and beaten and calling on them to work in a business with integrity," Nelson exclaims. "In Team Excel, it's do what you say you're going to do, help people, trust people, build them up." Mark, who in his business has seen a lot of careers built on much different premises, takes a long drag on a cigarette, reflects for a moment, then exhales. "The reason everyone gets so excited about this is that they know in the pit of their stomach that it's the way business should be," he says. "We're doing something very un-American."<p>
The last comment bangs around the brain. That we've come to expect no more from our corporate footholds than the fear of cutbacks and an every-middle-manager-for-himself mentality is depressing. The idea of a company that values its employees over its stockholders seems quaint. So when the Morgans hammer away at the premise that the qualities we value in our everyday lives -- compassion, friendship, loyalty -- needn't be left next to the bathroom sink when we go to work, you want to believe. You want this system to work.<p>
The Morgans could sit there communicating all day, but it's time to get back up the freeway to the convention center, where the audience is sponging up the determined words of the final guest speaker. And then it's Linden Wood's turn again, this time to provide closure. The chief of staff, his voice raspy from his multiple appearances, implores the huge audience to go back to their hometowns and inspire others to do what they do. Squeezing out one last bit of charisma, Wood concludes: "Repeat after me: I'm financially independent! I'm an Excel Maniac!" The crowd is on its feet.<p>
In the weeks following the dallas rally, Excel Communications is so hot that reps are regularly throwing around the M word in a chest-beating attempt to find a peer. In some ways, the comparisons to a young Microsoft aren't so silly: Excel reports that revenues quadrupled in the first quarter of 1996 versus the first quarter of 1995 -- the fifth straight quarter of triple-digit revenue growth. The number of applications for new representatives was up nearly 500 percent to almost 250,000. At this rate, there will soon be a million people a year applying to sell the product. <p>
Such successes can only make a guy feel that much wilier about saying no thanks to corporate America. It's a breezy afternoon in suburban Dallas, and Lance Wagers is, for a change, less than impeccably groomed. At the Team Excel rally, he'd been the master of ceremonies, and each day he'd looked sharper than he had the day before. In his home, he's wearing jeans and new running shoes.<p>
Lance and Carol Wagers have worked hard to land in this quiet neighborhood north of the city and this sand-colored brick house. For more than two and a half decades, they moved up the ranks in a corporation they appear to have been chiseled for: Until recently, the handsome pair headed the Dallas-based National Cheerleader Association. Both Lance and Carol were collegiate cheerleaders, and after they met at the NCA in the 1970s, they traveled separately and together all over the United States and Europe conducting camps and competitions for tens of thousands of children and young adults. Ultimately, they both ended up in the front office of what became a multimillion-dollar organization. Lance became president in 1992.<p>
By any measure, that was success. Yet it brought with it some dissatisfactions: Lance spent more and more time making managerial and budgetary decisions and less time working with people. The company changed hands four times, and each time he had to prove himself to the new owners. Not a big deal, but not enjoyable either.<p>
"In the summer of 1995 came the potential for another buyout, and that was enough," Wagers says. "It took Carol and me about five minutes to agree to leave."<p>
Wagers's story is that he's put more into Excel, and got more out of it, than he'd anticipated. He and Carol had figured that between their nest egg and Lance's part-time Excel commitment they would be fine. It's worked out differently -- better. Two weeks a month, Lance spends his days at home on the phone -- poolside, weather permitting. The other two weeks, he spends on the road. His days are whirlwinds of business presentations, training classes, and appointments.<p>
In six months, Wagers received confirmation that he'd done the right thing. It was his monthly Excel commission check. He was already earning more than the NCA had paid him after 25 years. Wagers works hard to attract people like himself. In Arkansas, he once did a presentation just for businessmen. "I got drilled," he says. Yet he won over a banker, a lawyer, and a doctor. "I presented to a millionaire, who sat there with his arms crossed," Wagers remembers, "and he looked at his wife and remarked, 'I don't think our circle of friends would be interested.' She replied, 'Honey, I've already written down three names,' and he joined that night." At that, Wagers cracks a smile and places his hands behind his head.<p>
Even if experience shows that most network marketers fail in both the short term and the long, the success stories can be riveting. Every Excel salesperson makes his first pitches with a scenario like the following ringing in his ears.<p>
The recruit, having been sold the dream at an opportunity meeting, pays his $50 or $195 application fee. (He probably also switches his long-distance service to Excel, and why not? It's cheap, and he's about to start making a lot of calls.) The recruit is now a downline.<p>
But, though he's made money for Excel, he hasn't yet produced for his upline. That begins when the recruit gets some Excel customers: If he gets three within 60 days, he earns his upline $100 in a commission check from Excel. Now, assuming at least one of these customers also becomes a representative, the recruit has himself become an upline. Excel will pay him $100 for each of his downlines who can bring in three customers in 60 days. It goes on from there, in a system set up to ensure that everyone is ceaselessly pushing, pressing, exhorting everyone below. <p>
Uplines also earn commissions based on the long-distance use of the people to whom they've sold Excel. The commission rate begins small, but it increases as levels of customers and downlines are added. Say our original recruit brings in five people -- that's his first level, and he earns a quarter of a percent of their monthly long-distance bills. Now, say each of these people brings in another five -- that's our rep's second level, 25 people strong. The sixth level will comprise 15,625 people spending roughly $25 a month each on long distance and earn our rep a commission of 1 percent. At the seventh level -- 78,125 people -- the commission shoots up to 5 percent. At $25 per customer, that's almost $98,000 a month.<p>
But long-distance dollars are just a starting point. To be serious about this business is to be focused on promotions and bonuses.<p>
Our Excel rep will immediately aspire to the advanced-rep level, which he achieves by gathering a sufficient number of customers, sponsoring a sufficient number of reps, and paying Excel for additional training. An advanced rep earns, in addition to the normal $100, an extra $30 for each of his downlines who signs up three long-distance customers within 60 days. What's more, he makes $30 each time one of his downlines' new downlines signs up three customers within 60 days, and his downlines' downlines' new downlines, ad infinitum. The process is interrupted only when a downline himself makes the leap to advanced-rep status and thereby creates his own chain within the chain.<p>
The ambitious rep also picks up money for training and managing reps and for a handful of other duties and privileges, but ultimately he'll be thinking about the four promotions that stand between him and the title of senior director. The SD, as his downlines will call him in respectful tones, earns $210 more at each step than an advanced rep. In other words, he makes $340 when an immediate downline signs up three customers in 60 days, and $240 when any new downline at any other level in his organization signs up three customers within 60 days. It is theoretically without limit. That's where Linden Wood numbers come from, or Paul Orberson numbers. Orberson is a former basketball coach and a legend in Excel circles. He has 60,000 downlines, according to rep lore, and cashes a million dollars in Excel commission checks every month.<p>
The least likely Excel story of all would have to be the one that ends this way: Linden Wood's contract is terminated by the corporation.
There have been private tensions between Wood and Excel, but at a rally in San Antonio, Wood does what he always says no one should: He brings negatives to his downlines. In full-blown Excel Maniac style, he fills in a thousand reps on his fight and what it should mean to them.<p>
The villain of Wood's story is Steve Smith, executive vice president of marketing for Excel and the man who devised the particulars of Excel's network-marketing arrangement (as well as the man who gets five dollars, for as long as he lives, for every rep who signs up to sell Excel). The gist of Wood's complaint is that Smith and the corporation have abruptly decided to change some wording in the company's policies and procedures, thus forbidding Team Excel from selling or even distributing its own training materials. Materials, Wood argues, that have been instrumental to the organization's success. "The battle here is for all reps across the country," Wood rails. "Excel's policies are oppressive!"<p>
Word of Wood's speech travels quickly through the Team Excel ranks, and for the believer it's painful to hear: Linden Wood saying that Excel is no better than any other corporation. It's as painful as learning, as the reps quickly do, that Wood and three others have sued Excel for $405 million. How can this be? This kind of stuff is supposed to take place only at General Motors and IBM.<p>
Even before Excel terminates Wood's agreement, his downlines begin a scramble for the lifeboats. They stand to lose everything they've devoted themselves to building. Many of them agonize over the decision, but they do what they have to.<p>
They move on. Lance Wagers is among a group of prominent Team Excelers who quickly cut their ties to Wood and form a new representative association called Excel America. Mark and Nelson Morgan follow. Team Excel eventually fades altogether.<p>
Wood, whose lawyers keep him from the press, is reportedly "crushed." But by the fall, his former associates have begun to hear the details of Wood's next deal: He won't be fighting management this time, because he'll be management. He's setting up his own long-distance company, to be sold by direct marketing as a competitor of Excel's.<p>
Above all, Excel shrugs off the trouble and bulls forward. Four days after Wood files his suit, Excel debuts on the New York Stock Exchange. Wall Street apparently couldn't care less about some internal difficulties -- the stock opens at $15 a share and within a few weeks it's at $47. By June, it's settled around the $30 mark, where it remains. While many traders are guarded, in part because of Excel's marketing methods, some analysts label Excel a "dream stock."<p>
In October, the company reports earnings for the third quarter -- the first full reporting period without Wood. Revenues have grown at a triple-digit rate yet again -- the seventh straight quarter. Earnings per share have more than tripled compared with the same quarter a year earlier.<p>
And the company is still offering the opportunity. At an 86 percent turnover rate, it won't be long before the organization includes almost no one associated with the strange and ugly days of mid-1996. Excel will be represented by new men and women, inspired and uncynical, selling the dream and looking for more dreamers.<p>

						As a whole, the U.S. economy can do no better than the sum of its parts. So here's an industry-by-industry look at the year ahead -- from inside and out.<p>
Worth Staff Report<p>
The climate for business in the year ahead appears to be shaping up as a subdued version of 1996. Revenue and earnings growth will slow, but only slightly. Consumer spending will increase, but again, only slightly. Consolidations will be lower in number and in profile. <p>
The real action will be closer to the ground, within individual industry sectors. The profiles that follow summarize the outlook for 22 separate areas of enterprise -- from the most basic (steel and trucking) to the most complex (biotech and aerospace). They include perspectives from within each industry and from Wall Street.<p>
AGRICULTURE
OUTLOOK: Fields of genes.
Biotechnology will have a big impact throughout the farm belt. The first large-scale plantings of genetically altered crop seeds occurred in 1996, with encouraging results. New insect- and herbicide-resistant seeds produced significantly higher yields. Farmers' costs declined as well, because of the reduced need for chemical spraying. In 1997, usage will expand sharply, both in the U.S. and abroad. Not surprisingly, there is also a lot of legal scuffling over the patents for hybrid-seed technology. Industry alliances are basically split into two camps: one led by <a name="NYSE:MTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11010"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Monsanto</b></a>, the other by <a name="NASD:MYCO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14178"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mycogen</b></a>. <p>
The excitement over mutant seeds notwithstanding, global agricultural prices are expected to decline in 1997.<p>
What the industry says: "The market just got a taste of this technology -- limited quantities in cotton, corn, and soybeans. In 1997, there are going to be significant quantities available. The technology's going to have a very high profile in terms of the value it delivers to farmers." (Carl Eibl, president and chief operating officer, Mycogen) <p>
What the Street says: "We're looking at a quantum leap in what genetic engineering can bring to the farmer, to the grain processors, and to the end user. But the proprietary-technology base is in the hands of a small number of companies. This ultimately could lead to the formation of agricultural-industrial complexes." (Sano Shimoda, analyst, BioScience Securities)<p>
Stocks to watch: Monsanto (NYSE: MTC) has made a number of outright and partial equity purchases in key biotech areas. It's dominant in herbicide-resistant hybrids. Mycogen (Nasdaq: MYCO), a much smaller company, has the jump in insect-resistant hybrid technology. <a name="NYSE:PHB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14440"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pioneer Hi-Bred</b></a> (NYSE:  PHB), the world's largest corn-seed company, has the biggest pool of germ plasm, the genetic material used to make hybrids.<p>
AIRLINES
OUTLOOK: Less turbulent.
Fares are expected to stabilize nationwide, except in the northeastern United States as <a name="NYSE:LUV"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11377"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Southwest Airlines</b></a> continues to infiltrate that market. The reinstatement of a 10 percent excise tax on tickets, scheduled to take place around midyear (perhaps May), will hurt industry profits. Fuel-price uncertainty is also a concern. <p>
What the industry says: "Fare wars on the East Coast are going to be the story of the next couple of years." (Harry Lehr, vice president of finance, <a name="NYSE:ALK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10046"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Alaska Air Group</b></a>) <p>
What the Street says: "The year 1997 will be strong for profits but poor for profit growth." (Sam Buttrick, analyst, PaineWebber)<p>
Stocks to watch: Alaska Air Group (NYSE: ALK) has cut its costs faster and further than any other air carrier in the history of the industry. Its ticket sales have also improved. Southwest (NYSE: LUV) is already in Baltimore and Providence. This airline is considered the best in the business in terms of financial discipline and performance, but it may have trouble maintaining its historic growth rate. Analyst Buttrick believes Southwest's stock may even take a short-term hit before resuming an upward trend.<p>
AUTOMOTIVE
OUTLOOK: High idle.
Barring a sharp hike in interest rates, which would raise the cost of auto loans and leases, automobile makers should come close to repeating their 1996 sales performance. <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a> forecasts industry-wide sales of 15 million to 15.5 million new cars and trucks in the U.S. for 1997, while 1996 is expected to come in at around 15 million units. That's below the 1986 U.S. record of 16.3 million, but still a respectable performance. Price increases should at least keep pace with inflation.<p>
U.S. automakers continue to benefit from rising demand for trucks (including minivans and sport utility vehicles), which bring in more profit than cars do and which have accounted for much of the strength in the market. U.S. producers also hold an edge in this area over the Japanese. <a name="NASD:TOYOY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41889"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toyota</b></a>, <a name="NASD:NSANY"></a><b>Nissan</b>, and <a name="NYSE:HMC"></a><b>Honda</b>, however, intend to change that.<p>
What the industry says: "We don't see the Fed raising rates much. The consumer mood is good. There's some concern about the level of consumer debt -- we've been looking at higher delinquencies -- but we have not seen a falloff in auto sales because of it. Right now, we're running at pretty close to 95 percent of straight-time capacity. <p>
"What's got me worried the most is the position of the yen, which has weakened more than we had anticipated. This allows the Japanese to take a lot of profits home to reinvest." (Gary Valade, executive vice president and chief financial officer, Chrysler)<p>
What the Street says: "I expect a slight rise in interest rates in 1997, leading to flat sales and somewhat lower earnings." (Ronald Glantz, analyst, Dean Witter)<p>
Stocks to Watch: <a name="NYSE:OEA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12200"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>OEA</b></a>OEA (NYSE: OEA) makes air bags. Its sales have been growing at a 13.6 percent annual rate over the past three years, and this growth is sustainable. <a name="NYSE:AIZ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10072"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Amcast</b></a> (NYSE: AIZ) has spent a fortune on aluminum-component factories, an investment that should begin to pay off as the industry continues to use more of this lightweight, durable material.<p>
BIOTECHNOLOGY
OUTLOOK: Elevated moods.
Biotech companies are once again finding it possible to raise capital for research and development, either by tapping the equity markets or by partnering with established drug companies. One reason for this: Many biotech companies now have drugs in late-stage clinical trials and should continue to benefit from recent initiatives by the Food and Drug Administration to speed up the approval process, especially for products targeted to combat diseases like cancer and AIDS. <p>
What the industry says: "To be successful in our industry, you must have a strong pipeline of drugs." (Dr. Francesco Bellini, chief executive officer, Quebec-based BioChem Pharma, whose recently approved 3TC has quickly become one of the top-selling AIDS medicines)<p>
What the Street says: "There's an explosion of new products coming to the market." (Tim Wilson, analyst, UBS Securities, who also notes that 30 to 50 percent of the nearly 300 drugs in stage-two or -three clinical trials could eventually reach the market) <p>
Stocks to watch: <a name="NASD:BCHXF"></a><b>BioChem Pharma</b> (Nasdaq: BCHXF) manufactures Lamivudine, a version of 3TC that could --  pending regulatory approval -- be used for the treatment of hepatitis B. <a name="NASD:CHIR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12972"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chiron</b></a> (Nasdaq: CHIR) has recently become profitable and has a number of promising drugs in late-stage clinical trials. <a name="NASD:LGND"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13469"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ligand Pharmaceuticals</b></a> (Nasdaq: LGND) has partnerships with a half dozen large drugmakers; these should help its broad product line.<p>
CHEMICALS
OUTLOOK: Lull before the fall.
The cyclical chemical industry is about to head into one of its down phases as capacity additions outstrip demand. Prices, and therefore profits, are expected to decline for the next several years. Prices for styrene monomer and its derivatives have already suffered steep declines and are hovering slightly above the breakeven point. Prices throughout the polymer chain (ethylene, polyethylene, and polyesters) are expected to weaken later in the year. <p>
What the industry says: "The real story in the near and long term is Asia and Latin America. We look forward to very strong growth in each of those areas. World economies will be improving in the next year." (Walter Tusinski, vice president and chief financial officer, <a name="NYSE:RCM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10024"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ARCO Chemical</b></a>)<p>
What the Street says: "Assuming demands stay good and costs high, prices become the swing vote. Capacity is going to be booming in the next few years." (James Kelleher, analyst, Argus Research)<p>
Stocks to watch: <a name="NYSE:DD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10487"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Du Pont de Nemours</b></a> (NYSE: DD) should benefit from improving demand in Europe and Asia. It may also sell its petrochemical company, Conoco; the sale would contribute about a dollar a share to its 1997 earnings. <a name="NYSE:APD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10042"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Air Products & Chemicals</b></a> (NYSE: APD) provides a service to plants and refineries that helps them comply with pollution and safety standards. With most of its equipment in place, and capital spending thus winding down, the company is positioned for substantial profit growth. <p>
COMPUTER HARDWARE
OUTLOOK: NCs battle PCs.
Corporations spend $13,000 a year for each personal computer linked to a local area network, yet only 21 percent of that goes for the actual computer hardware and software, according to the Gartner Group, an information-technology research company in Stamford, Connecticut. The other $10,000 goes to technical support, system administration, and lost productivity as employees futz with their machines.<p>
In 1997, though, corporate buyers will have another way to go: the network computer. These machines offer the same network connectivity as the PC, but at a lower cost. They aren't encumbered with hard-drive storage or floppy disks. Instead, software applications and data reside in the network server, not on the desktop.<p>
<a name="NASD:SUNW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14833"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sun Microsystems</b></a>' JavaStation (list price: $742, without monitor) is the only network computer actually to reach the corporate market, but many of the top software and hardware companies have announced plans to produce their own versions in 1997.<p>
Interest in the new machines could spark industry sales. But they aren't likely to seriously dent the PC market for a while -- if ever. Most analysts still expect PC sales to grow at healthy double-digit rates in 1997. More powerful PCs that use <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>'s Pentium Pro chip and <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>'s Windows NT operating system will become an increasingly popular alternative to some low-end workstations.<p>
The downward pressure on prices should continue. U.S. computer makers also face increased competition from Japanese manufacturers.<p>
What the industry says: "It's going to be an interesting year, because for the first time in a very long time you are going to have a choice. Part of the real attractiveness of the NC is its minimalist functional utility." (Scott McNealy, chief executive officer, Sun Microsystems)<p>
What the Street says: "Personally, I think it's absurd to think there will be a mass migration to that machine." (Edward Keely, portfolio manager, Founders Growth Fund)<p>
Stocks to watch: Direct selling enables <a name="NASD:DELL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13193"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dell Computer</b></a> (Nasdaq: DELL) to keep its inventories low, giving it a big cost advantage over most other PC makers. <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>'s (NYSE: IBM) mainframe business could be surprisingly strong. As for Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW): Does NC stand for no chance?<p>
COMPUTER SOFTWARE
OUTLOOK: More freebies.
Microsoft has made several bold moves to maintain its dominance, including marshaling PC makers to support its concept of a network computer that uses a Microsoft operating system (in response to the stripped-down, non-Windows machines offered by <a name="NASD:ORCL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14337"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oracle</b></a> and Sun Microsystems). But as the focus of the industry shifts to applications that work on multiple computer-operating-system platforms, Microsoft may lose its control over the rate of software innovation. <p>
What the industry says: "What is really changing is that there's a new software platform -- based on [Sun's] Java script -- that people are using to create applications across platforms. The platform is now a level above the operating system and makes you less dependent on any given vendor." (Jim Clark, founder and chairman, <a name="NASD:NSCP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42472"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Netscape Communications</b></a>)<p>
"There is no one solution, no panacea. The reality is that everyone runs non-homogeneous, multivendor environments." (Charles Wang, chief executive officer, <a name="NYSE:CA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10383"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Computer Associates</b></a>)<p>
What the Street says: "We'll see an increasing level of data, and then functionality, get off-loaded onto the Internet. Ultimately, all local processing and storage could move to the network." (Jonathan Cohen, analyst, Smith Barney) <p>
Stocks to watch: Computer Associates' (NYSE: CA) multiplatform systems-management software is going to become increasingly important as more and more corporations network. Microsoft's (Nasdaq: MSFT) Office 1997 software could be another blockbuster for the company; the software integrates Internet tools with Microsoft's existing word-processing, spreadsheet, and database programs. Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) CEO Larry Ellison has been one of the biggest proponents of network computers.<p>
DEFENSE AND AEROSPACE
OUTLOOK: Opportunity enters the industry's orbit.
Military contractors have been on a rice-cakes-and-water diet since the end of the Cold War. But some have learned to cope without the fat defense budgets of the past. <a name="NYSE:MD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10975"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonnell Douglas</b></a> achieved record earnings in 1995, though its total payroll is now half of what it was in 1989. One bright spot: the boom in demand for space satellites, coming primarily from communications companies. Defense contractors best positioned to benefit from Sputnik Round Two include Hughes Electronics, <a name="NYSE:LMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10903"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lockheed Martin</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:LOR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=47548"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Loral</b></a>, and <a name="NASD:ORBI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13046"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Orbital Sciences</b></a>. Orbital, in particular, is known for quick development of smaller, cheaper satellites. Its sales are expected to grow at a rate of 25 percent a year for the next three years. <p>
Of the few new major program initiatives, the most watched is the Joint Strike Fighter -- a $100 billion prototype program for the air force, navy, and marines. Boeing and Lockheed Martin are vying for the final contract. The winner will get an estimated $750 billion contract that will keep assembly lines humming for a generation. McDonnell Douglas, which is the largest military-aircraft manufacturer in the United States, suffered a painful blow when it was eliminated from the Joint Strike Fighter competition in November.<p>
The continued division of power between the White House and Congress following the November elections should neutralize the impact of politics on the industry.<p>
What the industry says: "The industry has a strong core base. The key issue is which companies are going to take advantage of that base and expand their business." (John Montague, vice president of financial strategies, Lockheed Martin) <p>
What the Street says: "It's the first time since the 1950s that the aerospace industry has had such a high growth opportunity." (Wolfgang H. Demisch, analyst, BT Securities, referring to the increased demand for space satellites)<p>
Stocks to watch: <a name="NYSE:BA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10221"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Boeing</b></a> (NYSE:  BA) is positioned for rapid earnings growth. Its production of commercial aircraft has nearly doubled -- from 18.5 planes a month in January 1996 to the current rate of 36 a month. The purchase of Rockwell International's defense-and-space division should also give Boeing a boost. Philip M. Conduit, Boeing's new chief executive officer, is well respected throughout the industry and the company. A host of commercial-jet suppliers -- all feeding at the same trough -- will benefit from Boeing's exploding commercial-jet business, including <a name="NYSE:UTX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11559"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>United Technologies</b></a> (NYSE: UTX), an engine manufacturer; <a name="NYSE:ALD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10062"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Allied Signal</b></a> (NYSE: ALD), which produces instrument panels; and <a name="NYSE:FA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10180"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fairchild</b></a> (NYSE: FA), which manufactures fasteners.<p>
ELECTRIC UTILITIES
OUTLOOK: Many shocks to the system.
Deregulation is coming, though it's far from clear whether this industry is prepared for it. The jolt will be cushioned, however, if the California model becomes a template that other states follow. California has mandated a deregulated pooling system to take effect as of January 1, 1998. But utilities will be compensated for assets that become worthless as a result of the change. Meanwhile, expect the frenzied pace of mergers and acquisitions in this industry to continue. <p>
What the industry says: "Companies that circle the wagons and try to defend their retail monopolies are ultimately going to lose out." (Stephen Baum, president, <a name="NYSE:ENA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11316"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Enova</b></a>, the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric)<p>
What the Street says: "Utilities need to figure out what business they want to be in, whether it's distribution, transmission, generation, or marketing. Companies that want to stay in the generation business had better work out plans with regulators to recover their investments." (Steve Fleishman, analyst, Merrill Lynch)<p>
Stocks to watch: <a name="NYSE:CIN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42531"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CINergy</b></a> (NYSE: CIN) is the result of the combination of Cincinnati Gas & Electric and PSI Resources. This is Indiana's largest electric utility and a solid low-cost producer in the Midwest. <a name="NYSE:PSR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11220"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Public Service Company of Colorado</b></a> (NYSE: PSR) is merging with Southwestern Public Service, a Texas gas company, to form New Centuries. The combination creates a stronger corporation.<p>
FOOD
OUTLOOK: A recipe for improved corporate earnings.
Falling commodity prices should cut costs and improve profit margins, but many food-industry stocks are already selling at relatively high prices. That's partly because investors see this industry as a defensive play; it is likely to fare better than other categories if economic growth slows. Price competition in the cereal category is expected to fade.<p>
What the industry says: "In 1995 and 1996, we were looking at flour prices that had reached 20-year highs and packaging costs that went up about 25 percent. Now ingredient and packaging costs are falling. We're looking forward to good things." (Carl Watts, president and chief executive officer, <a name="NYSE:TBC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12367"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tasty Baking</b></a>)<p>
What the Street says: "Packaged-food companies should benefit from lower commodity prices, which might give them an edge in an otherwise inflationary economy." (Leonard Teitelbaum, analyst, Merrill Lynch)<p>
Stocks to watch: Tasty Baking (NYSE: TBC) has an arrangement with the 7-Eleven convenience-store chain that will expand distribution of Tasty's products and lower its distribution costs.<p>
HEALTH SERVICES
PROGNOSIS: Slow recovery.
The pressure to reduce costs and lower prices will persist. Health-maintenance organizations, however, may see some relief after two especially tough years. Whether that will happen in 1997 or 1998 is difficult to foresee. Hospitals face a tougher road; they have too many beds that they can't fill. <p>
What the industry says: "There is going to be continued cost pressures, especially on single-product companies." (Robert L. Ryan, senior vice president, <a name="NYSE:MDT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10981"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Medtronic</b></a>)<p>
What the Street says: "The issue in 1997 will be a renewed focus on changes in Medicare. It's not going to be easy to adjust to that. The government has been pumping 10 percent more into this industry every year." (Clifford "Kip" Hewitt, analyst, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.)<p>
Stocks to watch: <a name="NYSE:AET"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10039"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Aetna</b></a> (NYSE: AET) is in the midst of a major shift toward managed care. Medtronic (NYSE:  MDT) is expanding the use of implantable cardiac defibrillators.<p>
HEAVY MACHINERY
OUTLOOK: Downshifting in the U.S.
This business is at the peak of its cycle in the U.S. Sales of construction equipment are running at record levels. In contrast to past cycles, however, domestic equipment makers are better positioned to compete overseas and therefore soften the blow as sales in the U.S. taper off. John Deere, for instance, doubled its net sales with 30 percent fewer employees in the past ten years. <p>
What the industry says: "Investors are generally unaware of the growth potential for our businesses in Asia and the Pacific Rim." (Francis Corby, executive vice president, <a name="NYSE:HPH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10708"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Harnischfeger Industries</b></a>) <p>
What the Street says: "Any domestic sluggishness could be offset by growth in Asia. If Europe starts to show improvement, that would help even more." (Tobias Levkovich, analyst, Smith Barney) <p>
Stocks to watch: Harnischfeger Industries (NYSE: HPH) should benefit from new products, additional acquisitions, and gains in market share. <a name="NYSE:CAT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10304"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Caterpillar</b></a> (NYSE: CAT) does 50 percent of its business overseas, where sales should continue to rise.<p>
HOME BUILDING
OUTLOOK: Lots of for sale signs.
Demand for new homes hasn't kept pace with production, and the inventory of unsold homes has been rising. Builders have been offering incentives -- ranging from cash discounts to free Buicks to island vacations -- and that's helped prop up buying but has hurt margins. Expect at least a modest decline in housing starts for 1997 -- to about 1.38 million from an anticipated 1.46 million in 1996.<p>
What the industry says: "We characterize the U.S. market as a 'preference market' as opposed to the 'shelter market' it used to be. Demand for housing no longer exceeds supply. We've got to entice people with lifestyle enhancements -- designs that make our homes attractive as well as affordable. We're not projecting a huge jump in interest rates, but we're already seeing a slowdown in sales with rates at very reasonable levels." (Robert K. Burgess, president, <a name="NYSE:PHM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11137"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pulte</b></a>) <p>
What the Street says: "During the next 6 to 12 months, I expect this sector to drastically underperform the market." (Greg Nejmeh, analyst, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette) <p>
"We're not recommending buying any home builders." (Steve Dobi, analyst, Goldman Sachs)<p>
Stocks to watch: <a name="NYSE:LEN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10891"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lennar</b></a> (NYSE: LEN) and <a name="NYSE:CTX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10308"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Centex</b></a> (NYSE: CTX) are both experiencing slowing home sales, but they have other businesses that are healthy: title insurance, captive mortgages, and construction products (Centex is the majority shareholder in Centex Construction Products, for example). <a name="NYSE:TOL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11488"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toll Brothers</b></a> (NYSE: TOL) and <a name="NYSE:DHI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15714"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>D. R. Horton</b></a> (NYSE: DHI) do nothing but build homes. Yet both have record backlogs and strong order flow. <p>
MEDIA
Outlook: Less favorable than 1996.
Publishers, especially newspapers, should benefit from sharply declining paper prices. Radio, a major beneficiary of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, is now facing opposition to some of the perks that came with the legislation, including provisions that relax and even remove the limitations on radio-station ownership. Broadcasters are focused on an upcoming Federal Communications Commission ruling that may allow one company to own two radio stations in a single market. <p>
What the industry says: "Radio has always been a kind of mom-and-pop business. But with the improved services to advertisers and listeners, the radio business is now able to compete with other media far better than it could in the past." (John Gehron, cochief operating officer, <a name="NASD:AMRD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=43796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Radio Systems</b></a>)<p>
What the Street says: "A rapid decline in both imprint and white-paper prices could produce cost savings, particularly in the newspaper business." (John Reidy, analyst, Smith Barney)<p>
Stocks to watch: <a name="NYSE:GCI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10623"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gannett</b></a> (NYSE: GCI) has yet to win the Street's notice for multimedia acquisitions that have greatly diversified its base. American Radio Systems (Nasdaq: AMRD) has favorable intermediate growth prospects because of the number of "sticks," or start-ups, it has. These start-ups could soon contribute to the company's revenue in a meaningful way. Though still thought of as newspaper outfits, <a name="NYSE:TRB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11508"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tribune Company</b></a> (NYSE: TRB) now gets 45 percent of its revenue from broadcasting, while the <a name="NYSE:WPO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12444"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Washington Post Company</b></a> (NYSE: WPO) derives more than 50 percent of its revenue from broadcasting and cable. These companies should become more attractive as higher-growth hybrids. <p>
OIL AND GAS
OUTLOOK: Neutral to positive.
The return of Iraqi oil, or anticipation of its return, will cause prices to fall at some point during 1997. But in the longer term, the pricing trend is still upward: Worldwide demand for petroleum continues to increase at an annual rate of about 2.5 percent. Refiners and drillers will do better in 1997 than the exploration and production companies.<p>
What the industry says: "If everyone weren't convinced that we are in store for a long sustained demand for energy, the big international oil companies wouldn't be drilling in expensive waters like the deepwater Gulf of Mexico." (David Lesar, executive vice president, <a name="NYSE:HAL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10697"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Halliburton</b></a>)<p>
What the Street says: Earnings of exploration and production companies "may suffer due to the negative impact on pricing from the return of Iraqi oil to the market. But oil stocks in general may still benefit in the long run." (Michael Mayer, analyst, Schroder Wertheim)<p>
Stocks to watch: <a name="NYSE:MOB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11006"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mobil</b></a> (NYSE: MOB) has above-average earnings and dividend growth as well as above-average growth in oil-and-gas production. Yet it is trading at a discount on earnings and cash flow to its peer group. <a name="NYSE:PZL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11164"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pennzoil</b></a> (NYSE: PZL) could achieve a 50 percent increase in earnings, thanks in part to its joint venture with Conoco and an upgrade of its refinery in Shreveport, Louisiana. <p>
PHARMACEUTICALS
OUTLOOK: Companies will be surfing a demographic wave. 
Older people use more drugs, and the number of people over age 65 will grow 17 percent by the year 2000. <p>
The ongoing pressure to reduce health-care costs also points toward an increase in the use of drugs. Drug sales through managed-care firms are expected to grow anywhere from 53 percent to 90 percent by the end of the decade. <p>
Industry profit margins have also been improving -- the result of cost cutting by drugmakers, higher industry-wide prices, and rising volume. A regulatory environment that is more friendly to this industry hasn't hurt either. One concern to keep in mind: A number of important, high-volume drugs lose their patent protection in 1997 and face competition from generics. These big-name drugs include <a name="NYSE:GLX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41781"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Glaxo Wellcome</b></a>'s Zantac, an ulcer treatment with $3.5 billion in sales in 1995, and Zovirax, an antiviral drug with $1.3 billion in 1995 sales. Patents expire in 1999 for <a name="NYSE:MRK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merck</b></a>'s Mevacor, a cholesterol medicine with $1.2 billion in sales in 1995, and in 2000 for Vasotec, a high-blood-pressure medicine with $1.9 billion in 1995 sales.<p>
What the industry says: "The pendulum is swinging in managed care, as there is more agreement that many drugs provide cost-effective treatment of chronic disease as well as help prevent illness." (David Shedlarz, chief financial officer, <a name="NYSE:PFE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11175"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pfizer</b></a>) <p>
What the Street says: "In this economy there are a lot of reasons to invest in defensive growth companies. Many of the pharmaceutical companies offer consistent earnings growth at reasonable valuations to the market and on a historical basis." (Kenneth Nover, analyst, A. G. Edwards & Sons)<p>
Stocks to watch: Pfizer (NYSE:  PFE) is the industry darling. It will bring nine new drugs to market in the next few years, including Aricept, an Alzheimer's treatment, and Atorvastatin, a cholesterol treatment. It also recently won approval to broaden the use of Zoloft, an antidepressant that competes with <a name="NYSE:LLY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10509"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Eli Lilly</b></a>'s (NYSE: LLY) Prozac. Zoloft is the number-two seller behind Prozac in the $4 billion antidepressant market, and Zoloft's earnings are expected to grow 20 percent in 1997 and 17 percent in 1998.<p>
<a name="NYSE:PNU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11570"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pharmacia & Upjohn</b></a> (NYSE: PNU) is the result of a 1995 merger of these two companies that paved the way for substantial cost savings. The quality of the company's future product offerings, however, remains uncertain. <p>
RAILROADS
OUTLOOK: On track.
Two competitive railroad systems emerged in the West when Burlington Northern merged with Sante Fe in 1995 to form <a name="NYSE:BNI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10250"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Burlington Northern Sante Fe</b></a> and when <a name="NYSE:UNP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11544"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Union Pacific</b></a> acquired Southern Pacific in 1996. A similiar scenario has unfolded in the East, where <a name="NYSE:CSX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10274"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CSX</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:NSC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11084"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Northfolk Southern</b></a> have vied to buy Conrail. Efficiencies resulting from these mergers will help the industry become more competitive with trucking.<p>
What the industry says: "If we can avoid ice storms and auto strikes, 1997 will be a good year for the rail industry." (Howard Keen, chief economist, <a name="NYSE:CRR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10395"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Conrail</b></a>) <p>
What the Street says: "This industry continues to get more efficient. It is also leveraging its efficiency by improving service." (Anthony B. Hatch,  analyst, NatWest Securities)<p>
Stocks to watch: CSX (NYSE: CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) are in a battle to buy Conrail (NYSE: CRR). Whoever wins could emerge as the dominant railroad force in the East. <p>
RETAIL
OUTLOOK: <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a> founder Sam Walton spins in his grave.
When the final numbers are tallied, the Christmas selling period will turn out to have been a pretty good one for retailers -- not spectacular, but not nearly as bad as the pessimists feared. Sales in the spring, though, could be weak. They aren't likely to equal the strong first quarter of 1996. Such a scenario could leave retailers overstocked by April, forcing markdowns. Retailers that keep the reins on inventory should enter summer in the best shape. <p>
What the industry says: "People are buying more for need than when the urge hits them. This is leading to more-compressed selling seasons." (Robert G. Galvin, chief financial officer, <a name="NYSE:NIN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15956"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Nine West</b></a>) <p>
What the Street says: "For every success story, there's another retailer in Chapter 11 that will never come back." (Saul Yaari, analyst, Piper Jaffray)<p>
Stocks to watch: Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT), the world's largest retailer, has struggled in recent years after saturating its prime rural markets. Same-store sales rose only 4 percent in 1996, compared with 6 to 7 percent in 1994 and 1995. International expansion has yet to pay off. Price competition throughout the retail sector could cut further into Wal-Mart's profit.<p>
<a name="NYSE:TIF"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11481"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tiffany</b></a> (NYSE: TIF) hasn't had to advertise a sale since 1985. Its same-store sales grew 12 percent in the first half of 1996. The recent opening of a flagship store in Tokyo was well received. Tiffany plans to increase retail space by 5 to 7 percent over the next few years. Earnings are expected to increase at a 20 percent annual rate for several more years.<p>
SEMICONDUCTORS
OUTLOOK: Back in the chips.
Demand has begun to turn around (sales fell an estimated 10 percent in 1996), helped by strong personal-computer shipments and an increased need for specialized chips used in consumer electronics. Industry experts expect semiconductors to emerge from their down cycle by the second half of 1997. One caveat: The semiconductor industry is global -- about two-thirds of its sales are now generated outside the U.S. -- and its turnaround depends on improvements in foreign economies as well. <p>
What the industry says: "My 35 years of [chip-making] experience leads me to believe that, by the second quarter of 1997, production and consumption will be in balance and prices will tend to stabilize." (Pasquale Pistorio, chief executive officer, <a name="NYSE:STM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42481"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>SGS-Thomson Microelectronics</b></a>) <p>
What the Street says: "We're moving back to an era of diversified electronics driving demand." (Drew Peck, analyst, Cowen & Co.) <p>
Stocks to watch: Intel's (Nasdaq: INTC) Pentium Pro sales will feed its microprocessor monopoly, but analysts say Intel's stock may be volatile in 1997 because its fortunes are so dependent on PC sales. <a name="NYSE:MU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14116"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Micron Technology</b></a>'s (NYSE: MU) 16-megabit dynamic random-access-memory chip has sold well, and the company's costs are falling, but don't expect Micron Technology's share price to come anywhere close to its 1995 highs. Only a quarter of SGS-Thomson's (NYSE: STM) sales are PC-related, and its broad mix of differentiated chips are well positioned for the next up cycle.<p>
STEEL
OUTLOOK: Flat at best.
New mini-mills are starting up, existing mills are operating at peak capacity, and foreign producers continue to glut the U.S. market. Upshot: price wars and lower profits. The falling yen has played a major role in this equation, as has a lackluster European economy, by prompting producers to ship greater volumes to the U.S. Upcoming negotiations with the Big Three automakers could prove pivotal. <p>
What the industry says: "My crystal ball tells me 1997 will be a lot like 1996, with slow, steady growth." (John Correnti, president, Nucor) <p>
"If you ask me what I lie awake at night and think about, it's exchange rates. The Japanese yen, for example." (Paul J. Wilhelm, president, U.S. Steel Group of USX) <p>
What the Street says: "Automobile sales have been relatively flat but very strong. So steel producers in the United States will go into contract negotiations with an advantage. We would not be surprised to see trade suits -- in the form of dumping and subsidy actions against importers -- implemented much as they were in late 1992." (Robert J. Schenosky, analyst, Merrill Lynch) <p>
Stocks to watch: <a name="NYSE:OS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12208"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oregon Steel Mills</b></a> (NYSE: OS) is a mini-mill that manufactures pipe and tubing used by the oil-and-gas industry. <a name="NYSE:AKS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=17195"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AK Steel Holding</b></a> (NYSE: AKS), an integrated steel company, has the highest profitability in the business. <a name="NASD:WTHG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Worthington Industries</b></a> (Nasdaq: WTHG) processes steel sheet and is refocused on growth.<p>
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
OUTLOOK: Busy signals.
Telecommunications will continue to grow rapidly. Yet who will benefit and who won't remains unclear. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was supposed to create the framework for the future. But several key issues -- such as whether to allow long-distance and regional Bell companies to compete on one another's turf -- will remain tied up in the courts until at least mid-1997.<p>
Meanwhile, the Baby Bells continue to seek growth through increased services, such as installing new types of phone lines that transmit data faster. The planned $21.8 billion merger of <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:BTY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41763"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>British Telecom</b></a> -- with the new company to be called Concert -- puts even more pressure on <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a> and the Bells. The full impact of this transaction, however, won't be felt until after its completion, which is scheduled for the end of 1997.<p>
The much-anticipated shift in the United States from analog to digital technology will pave the way for an upgrade to digital phones and allow for increased transmission of data. Handset makers await the shift to higher-margin digital phones. Meanwhile, the wireless industry is bracing for the arrival of personal communications services, or PCSs. <p>
What the industry says: "The confusion in the marketplace right now is creating more opportunity and choices than ever before." (Irwin Mark Jacobs, chairman and chief executive officer, Qualcomm)<p>
What the Street says: "I'm not bullish on anything." (Bette Ann Massick Colombo, analyst, Bear Stearns, referring to the three long-distance carriers and the regional Bell telephone companies)<p>
Stocks to watch: <a name="NYSE:BEL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10197"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bell Atlantic</b></a> (NYSE: BEL) could benefit from its pending acquisition of <a name="NYSE:NYN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11044"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>NYNEX</b></a>, as well as from a strengthening economy in the Northeast. <p>
Can AT&T (NYSE: T) bounce back the way IBM did? Or will it follow Western Union on the long, downhill slope into oblivion? The appointment of R. R. Donnelley & Sons' John R. Walter as AT&T's president has done little -- so far -- to resolve that question.<p>
TRUCKING
OUTLOOK: Computerizing.
Capacity has fallen back in line with demand in the past few years; this has helped to ease the pressures on pricing. But carriers are continuing to focus on cutting their costs and improving their margins rather than on expansion.<p>
What the industry says: "The industry is aggressively looking for ways to cut costs through the use of better technology. It can't raise prices." (Edward Arnold, chairman, Arnold Industries) <p>
What the Street says: "Investors need to be vigilant. Trucking stocks are undervalued right now, but only if the economy remains stable." (Jeffrey Kauffman, analyst, Merrill Lynch)<p>
Stocks to watch: <a name="NYSE:CNF"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10393"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Consolidated Freightways</b></a> (NYSE: CNF) is spinning off its unionized CF MotorFreight unit but retaining its more nimble, non-union short-haul and airfreight businesses. <a name="NASD:SWFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15252"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Swift Transportation</b></a> (Nasdaq: SWFT) has a successful acquisition strategy, a clearly defined market niche, and the ability to grow regardless of economic conditions. <a name="NYSE:CBB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14596"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Caliber System</b></a> (NYSE: CBB) has disappointed investors consistently but remains the only trucking stock with a chance to double.<p>

						Trucking stocks, long the market's laggards, look like bargains -- a few actually are<p>
By Amy Barrett<p>
Buying trucking stocks over the past three years has been the investing equivalent of purchasing an Edsel. Shackled by high operating costs and intense competition, even the better-managed trucking companies have been unable to find favor on the Street, and their stocks have been left in the dust.<p>
**Yellow Corp. -- which hasn't turned a profit since 1993 -- may make money next year.**<p>
A group that has languished during this market rally while virtually every industry has surged is enough to make any bargain hunter salivate. Especially when analysts start predicting that industry bellwether <a name="NASD:YELL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15192"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Yellow Corp</b></a>. (which hasn't had a profitable year since 1993) may make money next year. Yellow is expected to turn its $1.07-a-share loss in 1995 into a 71-cent gain in 1997, according to earnings estimates collected by Zacks Investment Research. And Yellow is not alone -- Wall Street expects the trucking industry's earnings to jump 32 percent next year. "Certainly there is a value story to be told here," says Douglas Rockel, a trucking-industry analyst at New Yorkbased broker Furman Selz. <p>
An industry full of undervalued stocks just waiting to rally -- it sounds too good to be true. And it is. Not every trucking company is headed for a turnaround, says Rockel, and investors will have to pick carefully. As he says, "There are some good trucking companies out there.'' And some laggards that will remain stuck in low gear. <p>
**How to find a worthwhile trucking company.**<p>
To find the good companies, start by understanding how the trucking industry as a whole suffered such a wreck. As analysts tell it, the companies got sideswiped by wildly fluctuating demand. They ramped up their fleets in 1994, only to see freight traffic nosedive in the wake of the Mexican peso crisis in December 1994. Burdened with excess capacity, they lowered prices in hopes of filling all those empty trucks. Many lost money.<p>
That situation isn't going to turn around quickly. Competition can be brutal, because the barriers to entering this business are virtually nonexistent (it takes only one enterprising person to start a trucking company). That's why Jeffrey Kauffman at <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> thinks it could take the trucking industry many years to consolidate, pare costs, and become more efficient. So for now, analysts advise investors to choose among two segments of the industry with the greatest growth potential: the truckload carriers and the regional less-than-truckload companies. <p>
**These trucking companies are worth further investigation.**<p>
Truckload carriers travel directly from the shipper to the drop-off point, while LTLs concentrate on a single area of the country and bundle cargoes at their own shipping terminals. Companies worth considering are <a name="NASD:AIND"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12659"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Arnold Industries</b></a> and <a name="NASD:ODFL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10432"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Old Dominion Freight Line</b></a> among the regionals and <a name="NASD:SWFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15252"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Swift Transportation</b></a>, <a name="NASD:WERN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15136"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Werner Enterprises</b></a>, and <a name="NASD:LSTR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16155"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Landstar System</b></a> among the national truckload carriers. <p>
These companies should benefit from three important trends. First, many manufacturers are finding it more efficient to outsource their shipping operations than to maintain a private fleet, in part because of the increasing use of technology to provide better and faster service. Merrill's Kauffman expects some $15 billion in revenue to migrate from private fleets to LTLs and truckload carriers over the next five years. Second, the shift to just-in-time inventory means companies are using truckers more frequently for smaller, more time-sensitive shipments. And third, last year's deregulation of intrastate shipping (interstate trucking was deregulated in 1980) is beginning to separate the wheat from the chaff. Companies that have been able to cut costs are stealing business from competitors. <p>
**Arnold and Yellow illustrate the concerns in the trucking industry.**<p>
Consider the divergent fortunes of industry giant Yellow Corp. and a regional carrier such as Arnold Industries. Yellow has struggled to reorganize its overbuilt hub-and-spoke networks by offering more direct point-to-point service along the most heavily traveled routes. Yellow's stock -- recently trading at 19 times 1997's projected earnings (the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index show an average multiple of 14 on 1997 estimated earnings) -- already discounts a turnaround.<p>
Arnold Industries, however, offers more direct service through truckload and LTL subsidiaries. And its stock trades at just 13 times 1997 earnings estimates. Also, Arnold, which plans to acquire a private company in Salt Lake City, has been steadily adding business. <p>
LTLs "are a good value versus the rest of the market now,'' says Renee Weaver, analyst at Wheat First Butcher Singer, a brokerage based in Richmond, Virginia. Wall Street projects an earnings rebound at Arnold: to $1.26 a share in 1997, up from an estimated $1.03 this year. Weaver thinks Arnold could reach $28 a share in the next 12 months from a recent price of $16. <p>
**Old Dominion may be a big bargain due to a dip in the stock price in the last 3 months.**<p>
Old Dominion, an LTL based in High Point, North Carolina, may be an even bigger bargain, says Weaver. The company's stock suffered a major slide in the past three months, at one point dipping below its book value of eight dollars a share. (Book value is the net value of all the company's assets divided by the number of shares outstanding.) That alone signals a good buy. What's more, Old Dominion could increase earnings per share by almost 50 percent next year, thanks partly to the company's expansion into Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico, Weaver says. She thinks the stock could return to $13 a share in the next 12 months. <p>
Salomon Brothers' James Valentine has whittled down his dream fleet to Swift Transportation, Werner Enterprises, and Landstar System, all truckload carriers. They should benefit this year from stabilizing shipping rates, he believes. At Landstar, which has been helped by cost cutting and two acquisitions in 1995, Valentine sees 20 percent earnings growth next year. Werner's earnings could rise 15 percent in the second half of this year, says Valentine, who calls the company "one of the best-run truckload carriers." Valentine predicts earnings at Swift Transportation will jump 38 percent in 1997. <p>
Investors headed down this highway could still suffer a flat if costs kick up. Although the LTLs and truckload carriers use cheaper non-union labor, a recent shortage of drivers could force some companies to boost their pay. And if the economy starts to stall, revenues will sputter. But even with such caveats, these stocks look like relatively safe buys. Their low prices give investors a safety margin in a high-priced market.<p>

						Welcome to the world of investing newsletters, where YOU HAVE TO SHOUT TO BE HEARD!<p>
By Mike Steere<p>
Asking Bill Bonner to talk about his life and work is probably a mistake. Bonner -- sworn enemy of the equivocal and the un-grandiose, a man who has done for investment-newsletter marketing what Richard Wagner did for grand opera -- ought to introduce himself via direct mail.<p>
**Newsletter editors like Bonner tend to use stylized text to make their points.**<p>
You DON'T know this man, but you should -- he's the KING of the long-copy, big-idea NEWSLETTER promo.<p>
Meet BILL BONNER and Learn how direct-mail VIRTUOSITY and a stable of way-off-center financial GURUS have brought one 48-year-old...<p>
      A chateau in France. 
      Maryland's premier goat-cheese-producing rural estate. 
      A booming international company with $75 million in annual     sales.<p>
Meet him TODAY and get FIVE BONUSES, absolutley FREE!<p>
ONE Boggle at what Bonner and his people do to call attention to their mailings.<p>
TWO Wonder if Bill has telepathic connections with the night terrors, hopes, and anger of cranky gray-hairs with a few hundred thousand in the market -- the core readership of investment letters.<p>
THREE Discover newsletters' ugly secret -- atrocious graphic design pays!<p>
FOUR See behind the hype into Bill's private world of intellect and high ideals.<p>
FIVE Puzzle over the contradictions between a quiet and gentle man -- idolized by staffers, liked and admired even by competitors -- and his frantic, ego-driven business.<p>
**Agora Publishing specializes in the "magalog."**<p>
Of course, Bonner and his company, Baltimore-based Agora Publishing, would do it in some much more artful and engaging way. They'd keep doing it, too, for many thousands of words. Then they'd send out a few hundred thousand pieces. A magalog (direct-mail talk for a magazine-like promo or catalog) can run 30 pages, the length of "Who Murdered Vince Foster?" a political-conspiracy pitch for James Dale Davidson's Strategic Investment letter. A bookalog can go well over 100 pages, as did "The Coming Mutual Fund Meltdown." This pseudo-paperback, with full-color mushroom cloud on the cover, was testimony for Dr. Gary North's apocalyptic biblical-financial Remnant Review.<p>
Coming from Agora, with the imprimatur and often the hands-on involvement of William Robert Bonner, every word in these things is a jab at humanity's animal core -- fear, greed, will to power. They're also wonderful, if sometimes twisted, entertainment.<p>
**Meet Bonner -- who seems to be the opposite of his direct-mail personality would lead you to believe.**<p>
In person, Bonner turns out to be quieter than his thunderclap copy. He speaks in resonant bass, in an accent both Northern and plantation South, like his native seaboard Maryland. You think of a prep-school English teacher who also coaches basketball. He's lean and angular in khakis, button-down shirt, and tie, his dress of choice for as long as anybody can remember. The face, under sparse raven hair, is all planar surfaces and bridge-girder jaw.<p>
Bonner folds his six feet, three inches into a booth at City Cafe, a yupscale spoon in Baltimore's Mount Vernon district, a few blocks from the restored Victorian-era mansions where Agora is headquartered. "We're succeeding," he says. The numbers say it more emphatically than he does. In the past two years, Agora's sales have grown from $55 million to $75 million. This growth is flat by Agora standards; the company has been digesting the book and newsletter publishers it bought in a 1994 binge. Agora owns newsletter-publishing companies in England, New Jersey, and Florida, as well as general-readership book publishers in the U.S. and England. It publishes 40 newsletters with a combined circulation of about 650,000.<p>
**The investing newsletters reach for people eager to be richer, happier, and more productive.**<p>
The most provocative of these are the investment letters that emanate from the home office in Baltimore, including six "guru" titles published in partnership with outside personalities/authorities (i.e., gurus). Agora does guru-less letters, too, and operates an investors' club with its own monthly letter. A new division of the company publishes newsletters from health gurus, including the celebrated diet rebel and medical contrarian Dr. Robert Atkins.<p>
The investment letters have paid for this diversifying empire, but not necessarily because they're making subscribers rich. Bonner, who characterizes his letters as bear market and hard money, even apocalyptic, says the early-1990s market run-up has been tough. Lately, Mr. and Ms. Buy-and-Hold have gotten fat returns in mutual funds without resorting to Swiss annuities, as Dr. North recommends, or the Bulgarian Brady bond, favorably mentioned in Strategic Investment.<p>
"Being contrary in the last couple years was not a good posture," Bonner says.<p>
Bonner speaks a refrain he uses to pump up his staff: "People don't wake up in the morning and say, 'Gee, I think I'll subscribe to a newsletter. Honey, we're out of newsletters!'"<p>
Nor do they want more information. They want what information can yield. "They want to be richer, happier, healthier, more productive," Bonner says. "We try to go directly to those emotional points.<p>
"Boredom is the great enemy," he says. "There is no glory in softness."<p>
**Mark Hulbert and his crew sort through financial newsletters to find the ones whose suggestions make the most sense.**<p>
Unlike the rest of us, who reflexively throw out envelopes bellowing BECOME A WALL STREET MILLIONAIRE THE NO-RISK WAY! Mark Hulbert and his staff date-stamp and file every single investment-letter pitch they get. By year's end, the collection overflows a deep drawer in the Alexandria, Virginia, headquarters of The Hulbert Financial Digest, an influential newsletter about newsletters.<p>
The Financial Digest pierces the fog of newsletter hype with rigorous statistical science. Since 1980, it has produced ratings and rankings of the real-market performances of investment letters' recommendations. Staffers mine the mail-package collection for periodic attacks on inflated performance claims.<p>
The 40-year-old Hulbert and his numbers have brought newsletters greater respect in the mainstream investing world, which traditionally has regarded them as dclass, if not frauds. The Financial Digest has validated letters by proving that letter gurus' investment advice is every bit as good as anybody else's. Four out of five newsletter editors fail to beat the market. But so do 80 percent of other investment pros. Hulbert says his work shows that the best newsletter gurus are world-class, "doing work that is the envy of the top finance researchers in the country."<p>
(Hulbert avoids personal opinions and lets his numbers do the talking. They speak loudest about The Chartist and The Value Line Investment Survey, both of which earned 15.8 percent annual returns over the past 15 years.)<p>
"I feel somewhat defensive of the industry as a whole, that people are going to throw out the baby with the bathwater," Hulbert says. Given his oblique and precise manner of speaking, this is powerful personal testimony.<p>
PART II<p>
Hulbert receives about 400 letters and rates 160 of them. His role, as Dr. Statistical Science, requires him to put the cold "what" of performance above the "how" and "why" and other distractions. "If they're looking at tea leaves, if they're looking at a comic strip [as a guru once did], I don't care what it is if they can beat the market in a statistically significant way," Hulbert says. "We take an absolutely, ruthlessly empirical approach."<p>
**The Hulbert Financial Digest used to be one of Bonner's letters -- until Hulbert bought him out.**<p>
This seems like a long way from Baltimore and Bonner, whose stock-in-trade is the screamingly anti-empirical side of the business. But The Hulbert Financial Digest is the firstborn financial newsletter of Bill Bonner, who was a founding partner of Hulbert's. After the then-infant Agora added other investment letters, Hulbert bought full ownership of his digest to avoid conflicts of interest.<p>
"I'd call him a friend, yeah," Hulbert says of Bonner. Friendship does not, however, get in the way of the mission. Hulbert's most recent ratings show that none of the five Agora letters he rates beat the market in either the first half of this year or multiyear periods.<p>
**Hulbert's drawer of newsletters inspires based on the sheer number of outlandish claims.**<p>
Digging through Hulbert's drawer of direct mail is a supreme adventure in shameless braggadocio and bad taste. Even Hulbert shows a gut reaction. "The stereotypic newsletter editor is a lunatic self-promoter," he says. "You look at some of these advertisements and see why that stereotype is perpetuated." But he also acknowledges the primacy of direct mail in the business: "Newsletters are a stepchild of the direct-mail industry," he once told the Baltimore Sun.<p>
If so, the mailings are the demon seed. The first hour of gaudy megalomania, saying "I'm right, and the rest of the world is wrong; I see the future, but your stupid broker doesn't have a clue," bolstered with insane performance claims -- gain 1,213 percent! -- brings on perceptual shock. If copy were audio, I'd be deaf. As it is, I'm suffering visual trauma caused by huge type in horrible colors, geeky photos of the letter- writing gurus, and page upon page of cramped text.<p>
**Tricks used by direct-mail publishers are attempts to extend survival time.**<p>
You can't blame the mailers for making a commotion. A direct-mail package lives or dies in something like four seconds. The tricks used by publishers to disguise pitch pieces -- as magazines, tabloids, books, personal letters -- are attempts to extend survival time. A magalog might be stacked with magazines, to be read later instead of thrown out, says Denny Hatch, editor of the industry letter Who's Mailing What! Then, when you pick it up, he says, "it just screams!"<p>
What it screams depends on the product. "Traditional investment letters appeal purely to greed," Hatch observes. This explains the headlining of gains. With less traditional, more ideological letters, the pitch may probe for a core of political antipathy or fear. Direct mail is a portrait not just of newsletters but also of their subscribers.<p>
Investment letters exist in a sort of statistical vacuum. The best estimate is that there are 1,000 to 1,100 of them. Since a 1985 U.S. Supreme Court decision freed their editors from mandatory Securities and Exchange Commission registration as investment advisers, nobody has kept an official count. No outside group audits circulations, so circulations are self-reported, if they're reported at all. George Wein, who brokers subscriptions to some 500 letters through his Select Information Exchange, says that less than 10 percent have 10,000 or more subscribers. The leading guru, in total subscribership, seems to be Louis Rukeyser, whose stock and mutual-fund letters report a combined circulation of about 350,000. Only a few letters are in the 100,000-subscriber range.<p>
**There is a definite target audience for the newsletters: Well-off males older than 50.**<p>
Estimates of the number of prime subscription prospects converge at about four million. The pros are absolutely in sync about who this core readership is.<p>
"You're male. You're in your 50s or older," says Walter Pearce, a publisher of investment letters for KCI Communications in McLean, Virginia. <p>
"Not super, super rich, but people who are definitely well off," Pearce goes on. "Basically, they're do-it-yourselfers. They've been burned by their brokers, or they've been dissatisfied with their financial advisers. They think they can do better jobs themselves."<p>
The profile in three words:<p>
Grumpy old men.<p>
**The letters yell the sorts of things grumpy old men yell at one another.**<p>
Once you know the target, the strange, peevish style of investment letters -- the way they're marketed, the letters themselves -- makes perfect sense. When they're not yelling about huge returns from brilliant stock picks, timing calls, and political-economic analyses, the letters yell the sorts of things that grumpy old men yell at one another.<p>
The common thread is us versus them, beginning with distrust of the financial establishment. "Newsletters are offering themselves as an alternative to Wall Street," Mark Hulbert says. "They're saying, 'Don't go with your personal broker....Wall Street is not the defender of the small guy.'" Beyond the antipathy toward Wall Street are politics that lean anti-government right, as part of a general phobia of institutions. The Ron Paul Survival Report asks, with a straight face, "Is Bill Clinton a Spy?" Anti-Clintonism, a staple of investment letters, redlines in a bogus top-secret government report from The Wall Street Underground letter, which lays 56 murders at the White House door.<p>
Low-circulation letters look exactly like what they are -- one-man, kitchen-table productions banged out fast and on the cheap. Large-circulation letters have the resources to be gorgeous but generally hew to the kitchen-table look. Ugliness is stagecraft; the spindly typewriter-style lettering is the pancake makeup. Long after the last Selectric has been scrapped, we'll be straining our eyes on pseudo-IBM typing generated by computers. Dick Wambach, who edits the industry letter Newsletter Design, says the ransom-note look appalls him. On the other hand, slick and pretty would probably lose readers. The information might seem less fresh, the voice of truth less lonely and embattled. "If success looks like garbage," Wambach says, "make your letter look like garbage."<p>
PART III<p>
It stands to reason that investment letters don't shout about their connections with big multi-letter publishing houses. Agora and its two counterparts, Phillips Publishing and KCI Communications, reveal themselves reluctantly in Hulbert's drawerful of direct mail. To see them at all, you've got to watch return addresses. Promos for Elaine Garzarelli's recent launch, The Garzarelli Outlook, and John Dessauer's Investor's World originate in Potomac, Maryland, home of Phillips. Subscription forms for Louis Rukeyser's Mutual Funds and Stephen Leeb's Personal Finance go back to KCI and its corporate siblings in McLean. From Baltimore comes the sound and fury of the Agora letters.<p>
**Phillips, Agora, and KCI are the big three in newsletter publishing.**<p>
These three publishers began in the 1970s in the manner of Silicon Valley start-ups, with very little to offer the world but the ideas, brains, and energy of their founders. They're clustered around Washington, D.C., because of the city's enormous traffic in specialized communications from trade, industrial, and political interest groups. Phillips is this sea's giant octopus, with annual sales of $227 million, versus $75 million for Agora and $45 million for KCI's parent company, National Information Corporation. Counting investment newsletters and nothing else, however, the companies are more closely matched.<p>
Investment-letter editors join publishers for the same reasons that feudal lords once threw in with kings. "It's tough out there," says Doug Fabian, a second-generation guru in Southern California, who just came under the Phillips umbrella with a pair of namesake letters. "A lot of the smaller  publishers are looking to the strong management of big companies." By "management," he means production, subscription fulfillment, and, above all, large-scale direct-mail assaults.<p>
**If an editor can hang on to readers year after year, publishers can go after a larger audience.**<p>
A publisher's critical function is to go out and get the readers. It's up to the editors to keep them, year to year, with winning investment advice, on-point analysis, and whatever written entertainment they can manage. The contrast between a mail piece and the letter it's fronting can be stunning. Picture a carnival barker outside Finance 301. You go from "Get Rich Now!" in huge and lurid type to cramped copy and technical-analytical graphs and portfolio listings.<p>
The difference applies, in an Agoran sort of way, to the solicitations and letters coming from Baltimore. The  big end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it themes carry into the letters, but much more quietly. Even Agora's Old Testament prophet, Gary North, waxes mild. The July 1996 Remnant Review walks his 10,000 readers through the Internet and E-mail then segues into a jeremiad against mainstream investment advice. Like the Bible, which provides its inspiration, Remnant Review is short on specifics and subject to interpretation. Less than one page out of eight is nuts-and-bolts investment information.<p>
**Distaste is often part of the criteria in sending out direct mail.**<p>
Editors generally seem nervous about the publishers' campaigns for their letters. They're worried about being embarrassed by promotional excesses. But distaste is also dependence. Editors know that they can't get new subscribers the way the mail wizards can. Says Agora's Strategic Investment editor James Dale Davidson, he of the "Who Murdered Vince Foster?" come-on, "If the direct mail doesn't alarm me, it probably isn't any good."<p>
Phillips and KCI play their direct mail and letters loud but pretty straight. The pitch pieces stick close to the gurus' investment triumphs, with emphasis on the numbers. Agora's franchise is the melodramatic and bizarre.<p>
One magalog for Strategic Investment is three-ring global apocalypse. It announces a coming plague ("like the Black Death"), a world-banking collapse, nuclear gangsterism in Russia, narco-lord ownership of U.S. politicians, a looming oil crisis, and a real-estate collapse. These aren't half the doom buttons that the piece pushes -- every one of which, somehow or another, equals a wonderful investment opportunity, just like those already uncovered by the letter's "Investors' CIA." Deep intelligence lets readers enjoy recent windfalls shorting the British pound and Swedish krona, the pitch claims.<p>
**The newsletters often provide a rather entertaining read -- combining the best from different genres.**<p>
It's a harrowing trip from the front-page banner, invest along with the world's richest gangsters, to page 28's sign-off, "With warmest regards, James Dale Davidson." It's also hilarious entertainment, combining James Bond, science fiction, the Book of Revelation, and Wall Street Week. "Read this briefing. It may be a matter of life and death importance," Bill Bonner writes in a tense note from the publisher. Non-investors might be tempted to send in the special one-year rate of $59 just to see what happens next.<p>
Flipping through Agora packages is like channel surfing. The sniffy BBC import is the mailing for Agora's The Oxford Club, a newsletter-cum-club with extras that include meetings, overseas junkets, and use of a club room in an Agora building in Baltimore. Off-white bond paper bears a stately notice of nomination by club chairman James Boxley Cooke and a lengthy briefing on "the most remarkable fellowship in the world." You go from there to the religious channel, with bear-market survivalist Bible thumping ("Let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains") for Remnant Review. Then there's the History Channel infomercial for Taipan, which takes grand century-spanning looks, both forward and backward. <p>
You could forget about investments altogether and love the showbiz. If, as more than one marketing sage has observed, direct mail is theater, its greatest producer, playwright, director, promoter, and leading man is Bill Bonner. The main stage is Agora.<p>
**Agora's attractive offices have a dizzying effect on one who visits after reading drawerfuls of Agora materials.**<p>
Coming to Agora after looking at the company's mail pieces brings on a sort of vertigo. The experience is like going to a professional wrestling match, then beginning to suspect that the action is for real.
This sense of for real begins with Bonner's earnestness. The chosen media of expression -- direct mail and off-plumb newsletters -- have "sham" written all over them, but Bonner seems to be trying to send serious messages. "We live or die by our ideas," he says. "We believe that the way we see the world is essentially righter than the way most people see the world."<p>
Bonner's tenets reach back toward the age that begot the row-house mansions in which Agora's American operations are centered. The buildings are mid-19th-century museum pieces. The square they stand on is so beautifully preserved that a movie crew has been here shooting a film adaptation of a Henry James novel.<p>
The buildings connect the company not just to a time but also to a way of thinking: of Adam Smith's economics; of civil society as opposed to political society. "We believe in people acting independently, building wealth, maintaining health through individual responsibility and individual action," Bonner says. The purest expression of the Bonnerian worldview, according to staffers, is the guru-less letter Taipan, which manages to be both fantastically optimistic and pessimistic. It predicts an upcoming technological golden age in which the prosperous, including the letter's readership, will live like yesteryear's merchant princes. Meanwhile, misery and violence will rule the rest of the world. Hulbert doesn't rate Taipan, so there's no outside assessment of the readership's race to become royalty, but the publisher, J. Christoph Amberger, claimed returns of 35 percent for 1995.<p>
PART IV<p>
The Agora letters' emphasis on ideas -- as much as buy-this, sell-that recommendations -- derives from another big idea. Bonner says he's a  believer in the "efficient market" hypothesis, which, put very simply, says it's hard as hell to beat the averages.<p>
**Some of the newsletters manage to succeed in spite of poor investing returns.**<p>
The big idea, in this case, is also a good idea. Ruth Lyons, group publisher of Agora's guru investment letters, points out that a high-personality, high-concept letter -- Strategic Investment, in this case -- can bomb in portfolio performance but still prosper. (According to Hulbert, Strategic Investment's recommendations have lost an average of 7.3 percent annually for the past five years.) "People read it for the focus, rather than the investments," she says. "The renewal and conversion rates are pretty good." Lyons also explains why a political rant like "Who Murdered Vince Foster?" can make good marketing sense. Exposing somebody else's conspiracy fosters a sense of inclusion. "There's an undertone," she says. "'We've got a secret that can help you, if you're one of us.'" <p>
Lyons, an attractive and manifestly bright thirtysomething with degrees from the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University, represents the other dimension in which Agora is surprisingly for real. Whether or not the staff is serious about Bonner's core ideas, they're way serious about advancing their careers and the company.<p>
**Agora's young staff is energetic and low-key, lead by Bonner's powerfull pull.**<p>
Agora is charged up, highly educated, sleek. It's even sort of hip. One recent estimate put the average age of the 150-person headquarters staff at about 30. The company encourages employees to act their ages. Agorites break for weekly basketball games, eschew formal office dress -- unless they're in the mood -- and are spontaneously hospitable in a way that says they love what they're doing. Bonner's backward-leaning libertarianism translates into a very 21st-century no-chart, nonauthoritarian organization. Bonner exercises his leadership by low-key but powerful pull, rather than push.<p>
I see him doing it in a morning of franchise meetings for Agora's health letters. "Franchise," in the Agora lexicon, means something like mission statement. It is a letter's editorial and marketing essence. Groups of eight to ten Agorites sit at an enormous table in a room walled with buttery wooden paneling and murals. These teams include representatives from marketing, editorial, and customer service. (Much of the raw editorial content and direct-mail copywriting comes from outside the building -- the former from the letters' gurus, the latter from freelance specialists.) While Bonner stares, shifts, and drums his fingers, his teams review financial performance and hash out how they can hit present and future readers harder. A purple-inked brochure, welcoming new subscribers to a health letter, elicits the most dramatic response of the morning from Bonner. He shows his distaste more loudly than he speaks it.<p>
"It's soft. Its colors are soft. The message is soft. Everything about it is soft," Bonner tells the franchise team. "And I think that's a mistake."<p>
**Bonner and Davidson's relationship goes back to childhood.**<p>
Bonner found his vocation by a long and complicated series of accidents, which started on his family's farm near Annapolis. Bonner's father worked as a carpenter and farmed tobacco. Bill was best friends with his mother's best friend's boy, James Dale Davidson, who would later reveal Bonner's gift for direct-mail marketing and become the editor of Strategic Investment.<p>
Davidson, a trim redhead whose utterances are careful and hyper-literate, remembers Bonner, the boy and teenager, spinning out entrepreneurial ideas. But Bonner's higher education shows more of the 1960s search for self than business sense. He majored in liberal arts, graduating from the University of New Mexico after a junior year at the Sorbonne in Paris. Smitten with both writing and France, Bonner went back to Paris as correspondent for a countercultural magazine called Zygote, which flopped before he saw a paycheck. "I wrote some pieces and wondered why they didn't respond or send me money or anything," he recalls. "You can imagine dumbbell written over my face."<p>
Bonner looked more left leaning than he was ("During the Vietnam War, it was hard to distinguish civil libertarians from the lefties," he says), to the point that Parisian police once mistook him for a student protester and beat him up. But this was a son of Ayn Rand, not Chairman Mao.<p>
**Davidson's National Taxpayers Union introduced Bonner to direct marketing.**<p>
His friend Davidson turned new-right politics into a vocation, founding the Washington-based National Taxpayers Union. Bonner, meanwhile, made a feint at a conventional profession, finishing law school at Georgetown University. But he gave up on law even before his 1978 graduation. "I was thinking of a career building houses," he says. If it weren't midwinter, he would have started right away. Davidson, who says he couldn't stand to see his friend waste his time, asked him to help out at NTU. "He ended up doing most of the marketing, because he was very good at it," Davidson says.<p>
At NTU, Bonner had a pivotal "Aha!" which he described to the Baltimore Sun: "I discovered the world of direct-response advertising...that you could ask people for money in the mail and they'd send you some."<p>
Both Bonner and Davidson hankered for richer financial rewards and went commercial. Davidson would move into international finance. Bonner followed his predilection for the written word. The proto-Agora in Washington put out a political-satirical newspaper called The Public Spectacle, which died almost immediately, and a magazine called Frontiers in Science, which had a lengthy living death, sucking time and energy and cash. "I ran out of money over and over again, had these losing propositions," Bonner says. Publishing success arrived in 1979 with International Living.<p>
**Bonner and Davidson's first success, International Living, now has a circulation of 100,000.**<p>
The newsletter, which still has a circulation of 100,000, is a ratatouille of advice about low-cost travel and overseas living, with emphasis on affordable retirement havens. Bonner opines that the core subscribers are retired schoolteachers. "The nice thing about International Living is that it doesn't go to those grumpy old men," he says. He would have done more in the IL vein, but nobody was buying. Subsequent successes were investment letters.<p>
During the company's lean years, he met and married his wife, Elizabeth, a staffer who worked his kind of long hours and got an equity stake in the company because there wasn't enough money to pay her what she was worth. Bill and Elizabeth now have six children, four of their own and two from an earlier marriage of Bill's.<p>
In 1983, Bonner bought a building in slummy near-downtown Baltimore for one dollar. The move to the mansions took place in 1994, as did the international buying spree. And suddenly, little Agora was a $75 million company notable not only for the brazen wackiness of its main product but also for an appealing eclecticism and a kind of institutional lan.<p>
PART V<p>
Two of the company's purchases in 1994 were Pickering & Chatto, an English academic press that publishes quality-bound editions of such books as The Political Writings of Mary Wollstonecraft and The Works of Aphra Behn, and Santa Febased John Muir Publishing, which specializes in guidebooks, including the eco-kid number Extremely Weird Frogs. Pickering & Chatto's books are the foundations of Agora's big ideas, Bonner says. He had the notion of selling Pickering & Chatto tomes to investment-letter customers, who could then do in-depth studies. So far, it hasn't worked.<p>
Earlier this year, the Bonner family moved to Chateau d'Ouzilly in the South of France. This is, on an obvious level, an International Livingstyle retreat to gorgeous surroundings. But it also establishes a new European command for Agora. The company offers foreign-language editions of Taipan and hopes to do huge things in Europe with American-style direct mail and newsletters. The whole world -- the subject matter of Agora's big-idea letters, after all -- may someday be screamed at by Agora mailings.<p>
**A control to a copywriter is what a no-hitter is to a pitcher.**<p>
The word "control" has a special meaning in direct mail. It refers to the package that outperforms all others for the same product. A control is to a copywriter what a no-hitter is to a pitcher. High-volume mailers, like Agora, never send out a control alone. There's always at least one test package, the creators of which do everything in their power to knock off the control. If a test does win, it becomes the control, until it gets beaten. Publishers study returns and play with ink color and other near-molecular details to squeeze a few more respondents out of each mailing. They strive to beat themselves so that the market doesn't beat them.<p>
The day their publishers quit playing the control game, investment letters like Agora's start dying. They exist like mountaineers at 8,000 meters, in a death zone, where expensive and hard-won supplements -- oxygen for climbers, new subscribers for letters -- are the only sustainers of life. Direct mail is the only effective way to get new subscribers. But it's so expensive that the first year of a new subscription is a wash. A typical 300,000-piece mailing, which might cost $150,000, is a success if it breaks even. Such mailings, or even bigger ones, go out every six or eight weeks for every major newsletter. In most cases, break-even success means a response rate of 1 to 2 percent. But then only about a quarter of first-year subscribers opt for a second year -- and thus start to generate profits. Thereafter, about half drop their subscriptions every year.<p>
The numbers mean that newsletters are living or dying by the mailings going out now. Letters that succeed next year will do so because of people who haven't been moved to subscribe yet,  by mailings as yet unsent. "With ideas we haven't had yet! Connections we haven't made yet! People we haven't met yet!" Bonner goes on.<p>
**A good control can gain almost mythic proportions -- if it works.**<p>
About ten years ago, Bonner wrote a package -- the control of controls -- that is happily at home in the death zone. The control for International Living is a longevity legend. Agorites know it by heart. When one starts reciting, others join in, sounding eerily like a congregation at prayer. "You look out your window, past your gardener, who is busily pruning the lemon, cherry and fig trees...amidst the splendor of gardenias, hibiscus and hollyhocks." <p>
The writing seems at first pretty obvious -- clear blue sky, deep blue sea, nah nah nah. But about the time the maid brings in breakfast in bed, there's this horrible ache to have every single thing the words are about. The inner being is howling, "I want it! Tell me how to get it!"<p>
"For a moment, you think you have died and gone to heaven," the control says.<p>
**If readers aren't reaping the benefits promised in his control, Bonner certainly is.**<p>
Bonner, at least momentarily, must be getting the same heavenly sensation. When he wrote the IL control, paradise in a faraway land was mostly a copywriter's image. Now he's got a castle in France, huge and vastly more expensive than the retirement cottage in the promo package. Getting up and working, instead of having breakfast in bed, is purely a personal choice. He could loll indefinitely, while "a gentle breeze comes drifting in from the ocean, clean and refreshing." Bonner's immortal pitch piece and its kin -- and the newsletters they're pitching -- have done more for him than the most outrageous promises to subscribers.<p>
"When I tell people what I do, they are sort of generally amazed that you can earn a living doing the sorts of things I do," he says. "It's great." But then Bonner gets uncomfortable with the notion of success. "I'm afraid to look at it too hard," he admits. "I can't take it too seriously....I'm cautioning, warning against a feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment."<p>
Bonner is flat incapable of congratulating himself, and perhaps that's key. If he were better at making noise about himself, he might not be so good at making the written noise that has made him rich, that keeps him mightily entertained, along with his Agorites and their  readers. Hype, when Bonner is doing the hyping, has the power to bend reality -- his way. <p>
Bonner/Descartes: I think, therefore I hype, therefore I am.<p>

						Keep a clean house? Teach school? A discount is in order.<p>
By Morey Stettner<p>
In Idaho, you can save on homeowners insurance by cleaning your house. In Massachusetts, you can lower your premium by taking a six-hour class on home safety. In California, you can pay less to cover your car if you're a scientist, engineer, or teacher.<p>
Insurers are increasingly eager to reward their customers for taking steps to prevent claims -- from doing home maintenance to choosing public transportation over driving. If your odds of filing a claim are lower, some insurers figure, then you deserve a price break. You probably know about the typical discounts: Drivers who have anti-theft devices or passive restraints in their cars usually pay less; homeowners who install security systems or who have the same insurer cover their car and home may also cut their costs. But the savings don't stop there.<p>
"The industry trend is to encourage people to take steps to protect themselves and their homes," says Loretta Worters, public-relations director at the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York City. "The industry is just starting to do things like offer discounts for homeowners who have fire-retardant shingles or who install roof clips to guard against hurricane damage in high-risk areas."<p>
Agents may not always tell you about every discount you qualify for, so it's important to know what sort of behavior can get you a cheaper rate. And you should always ask if any discounts are available, then compare prices among a range of companies for the same amounts of coverage after all discounts have been applied to your quote. "Don't lose sight of the bottom line," says Bob Hunter, director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America in Washington, D.C. "Some of the companies with the most discounts start off charging the highest rates."<p>
You don't have to install expensive upgrades to earn a discount -- at least in Idaho. Idaho Mutual Insurance takes 5 to 10 percent off a homeowners-insurance bill for "outstanding housekeeping and maintenance," a new program that began last summer. "We look for a homeowner who keeps the place neat as a pin inside and out," says Brian Henman, Idaho Mutual's executive vice president. "That means no boxes piled up, no weeds covering the windows, no engine block being repaired in the driveway for a long time. Of course, we require photographs of the premises before we issue the credit."<p>
Classroom learning can also help you reduce your rates. <p>
Massachusetts offers a free six-hour course called HomeSafe on such topics as weatherization, home repair, and lead-paint hazards, which can earn homeowners a 10 percent discount with some insurers. And in many states, individuals who have completed a class in defensive driving can shave 5 to 15 percent off their auto premium.<p>
"These discounts involve trading behaviors," says Linda Ruthardt, Massachusetts insurance commissioner. "If the consumer promises to take steps to prevent claims or keep the claim from getting too big, the insurer will lower your premium."<p>
If you live in a community that enforces its building codes, you may also save money. Insurance Services Office, a nonprofit statistical-research group, has recently begun rating areas on how well they enforce their building codes. If your city earns a high score in promoting and overseeing the construction of safer buildings, some insurers will take 5 to 15 percent off the price of homeowners insurance. The ratings, now available in Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina, will be expanded nationwide in the coming years. <p>
Even your personal life can help you save on insurance. In California, 20th Century Insurance gives auto-insurance price breaks to scientists, engineers, and educators. "We've found that people in these careers are safer, more careful drivers," says Ric Hill, a 20th Century vice president. Plymouth Rock Assurance, which operates in New England, offers to reduce auto rates by as much as 15 percent if the applicant works for certain employers or belongs to groups such as churches, unions, or social clubs. "We think members of nonprofit organizations may be a better class of risk," says Plymouth Rock vice president Alan Hines. "Do-gooders are a different class than price shoppers."

						The form of money is changing again -- and new middlemen will reap the profits.<p>
By Curtis Lang<p>
Point and click. the computer screen reads, "Welcome to CDworld." Point and click. Browse 100,000 CDs on-line. Point and click. Order a CD. Point and click. Now it's time to pay.<p>
But forget about cash or checks. This electronic merchant will accept digital cash -- money in the form of ones and zeros stored on a computer's hard drive -- but not any form of paper money.<p>
Since the Lydians of Asia Minor minted the first coin 2,600 years ago, money has been invented and re-invented countless times. During the past hundred years, gold-backed paper money has been replaced by promise-backed paper money, for example. And now, driven by the proliferation of electronic retailers and the increasing ease of electronic bill paying, the form of money is changing again.<p>
The transition will not be bloodless. Every form of money produces its own group of middlemen -- goldsmiths in the Middle Ages or credit-card issuers in the 20th century -- who become rich from helping it circulate. Every time a dollar changes hands, a few pennies stay behind in ATM fees or credit-card interest. The number of pennies is immense. The Nilson Report estimates that in 1990 transactions in the U.S. economy involved $1.2 trillion in checks, $1.6 trillion in cash, and $446 billion in credit-card debits.<p>
Electronic money will make up only a very small piece of that pie by 2000. Jupiter Communications in New York projects that on-line shopping (transactions that will be paid for largely in electronic money) for entertainment, clothing, software, airline tickets, and other goods will grow from $575.6 million in 1995 to $7.3 billion in 2000. But that $7.3 billion is just the opening wedge that the companies that make digital money or provide electronic bill payment hope will let them grab a share of the entire pie.<p>
For example, <a name="NASD:CYCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=47308"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CyberCash</b></a>, founded in 1994, runs a service that lets merchants receive payments on the Internet -- a substitute for cash, checks, and plastic. Consumers use its software "wallets" to pay for and track on-line purchases. Merchants pay fees for each transaction. CyberCash went public on February 15, 1996, at $17 a share (see "<A href="/articles/Z9606C.html">Finding the Next Microsoft</A>," June 1996).<p>
Banks and their credit-card companies, such as Visa and MasterCard, don't oppose electronic money -- they just want to control it. Their major weapon? Smart credit cards that use simple computer chips to access checking accounts and credit lines.<p>
Smart cards aren't well suited for at-home electronic shopping: Like conventional credit cards, they need to be swiped through a piece of hardware to transfer money over computer networks or phone lines. "My belief is that the successful payment vehicle in the next five years is going to be credit cards," says David Weisman, director of money and technology strategies at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts. "People are used to them. There's frequent-flier miles and other benefits." Digital cash, on the other hand, is "going to feel like foreign currency."<p>
Although the fight over electronic cash is just heating up, the battle to control the home desktop has reached a fever pitch. Rather than doing battle against banks and credit-card companies, players like <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> and <a name="NASD:INTU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16001"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intuit</b></a> are signing them up as partners; both see a chance to dominate a home-banking marketplace expected to grow from 750,000 home-computer bankers in 1995 to 13 million by 2000, according to Jupiter Communications. The banks suffer a distinct disadvantage -- with a few exceptions, they lack the technological savvy to build their own gateways.<p>
Microsoft is facing a stiff challenge from the much smaller Intuit. In February, Visa and Microsoft announced a partnership to provide home banking using Microsoft Money -- which has an installed base of more than two million users -- as the gateway. But for on-line banking, Microsoft Money is widely considered an interface inferior to Intuit's Quicken, which also has a larger installed base of more than nine million users. To counter Microsoft's partnership with Visa, Intuit has struck deals with America Online and Electronic Payment Services, which provides ATM networks for 2,000 banks.<p>
<a name="NASD:CKFR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=43345"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CheckFree</b></a>, a third rival in this market, began as a company offering automatic-payment systems for health-and-fitness centers. The company, which went public in September 1995, now plans to offer its own brand of digital cash and is branching out into personal finance and home banking. CheckFree recently acquired Servantis, which makes electronic-commerce software for more than 70 financial institutions.<p>
But "CheckFree has been looking for a strategy for about a year," says new-media analyst Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Maryland. "They're an unknown quantity to a lot of banks who are very hard pressed to figure out where they fit."<p>
Companies building the pipelines to link the desktop with the merchant and then to the bank or credit-card company don't face competition from established financial middlemen. But large full-line computer makers are poised on the sidelines just waiting until the market gets big enough to justify their entry.<p>
For example, <a name="NASD:OMKT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=43511"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Open Market</b></a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which makes software for transaction processing on the Internet, has carved out the high end of the Internet commerce-software market for itself, but <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>, Microsoft, Visa, and <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> all plan to offer a wide array of high-value-added services soon. In a deal that should garner market visibility, Open Market recently licensed its software to high-end Internet service provider BBN Planet in Cambridge.<p>
<a name="NYSE:VFI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13718"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>VeriFone</b></a>, on the other hand, already has a big share of the mass market. The company all but created the automated-credit-card-authorization industry out of thin air 15 years ago and now has 65 percent of the worldwide installed base of credit-card swipe machines.<p>
Building on that base, the Redwood City, California, company, which owns 9 percent of CyberCash, plans to roll out electronic wallets for consumers and Internet gateway products for credit-card customers and issuers. VeriFone has inked alliances with database-software maker <a name="NASD:ORCL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14337"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oracle,</b></a> <a name="NYSE:
WFC"></a><b>Wells Fargo Bank</b>, <a name="NASD:NSCP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42472"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Netscape</b></a>, and Microsoft. In addition, this year VeriFone acquired Enterprise Integration Technologies, the principal architect of the leading public key-encryption standard for secure transactions on the World Wide Web. That acquisition makes it all but impossible for another party to lock VeriFone out of the marketplace.<p>
Those deals push VeriFone into unproven markets -- but the risk will be worth it if the company can gain a big share of all those pennies.

						Gas prices are headed just one way. Get the difference back, and more, with oil company stocks.<p>
By Peter Lynch<p>
In this space back in february 1995,  I made a case for the possible revival of the oil-service companiesthe drillers and rig operators that Wall Street had left in a scrap heap. It turned out that the survivors shook off the rust and ironed out the balance sheetswhich was a pleasant surprise to investors in <a name="NYSE:SLB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11327"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Schlumberger</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:HAL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10697"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Halliburton</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:WAI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=17140"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Western Atlas</b></a>, and some others. The analysts I talked to at the time were optimistic about energy services, and it looks like they had the right idea. Schlumberger has gained 62 percent in about 20 months. Western Atlas is up 40 percent. Shares of <a name="NYSE:GLM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10662"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Global Marine</b></a> have risen almost fourfold, to $15 from $4.<p>
Now is a good time to deliver what I promised in that earlier column: a follow-up on the rest of the oil-and-gas industry, namely the refiners, the pure producers, and the integrateds, which find, pump, refine, and sell oil and often do more besides. These three groupswhich account for 90 percent of the oil business worldwideinclude thousands of tiny companies with oily holes in the ground, plus the big names at the gas pump: <a name="NYSE:XON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10537"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Exxon</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:MOB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11006"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mobil</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:CHV"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10328"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chevron</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:BP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41759"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>British Petroleum</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:TX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11458"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Texaco</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:RD"></a><b>Royal Dutch/Shell</b>.<p>
Oil is a timely subject on several counts, beginning with the current 3.8 percent dividend yield on the major oil stocks, which is nearly double the yield on the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index. (Dividend yield increases, of course, when a company raises its dividend more rapidly than the market bids up the stock price.) The relatively high yield in the sector is evidence that oil companies did not keep pace with the market in the past decade. This is the widest spread between oil yields and the S&P yield in 45 years, suggesting either that oil companies are in lousy shape (which they aren't) or that Wall Street is giving them less credit than they deserve.<p>
I'm reminded of the Baby Bells, which also lagged the market in the early 1990s and then had a nice rally. The parallels between the six Bells and the Six Sisters (the big names at the gas pump mentioned above) are intriguing. Both were created in antitrust breakups: AT&T in 1984 and Standard Oil Trust in 1911. Both are widely held by individual investors and narrowly held by the pros at the institutions. In fact, only two of the Six Sisters appear in the top 20 holdings of equity mutual funds, according to the research firm CDA/Spectrum.<p>
For this to become another example where the public is right, crude prices will have to rise from here. Just as there's no sense owning <a name="NYSE:K"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10841"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kellogg</b></a>'s if you're bearish on cornflakes, there's no sense owning oil companies unless you're convinced that oil has a profitable future. On that subject, I'm not about to make any brash predictions, but I've begun to notice signs that the trend may be upnot for next month or next year, necessarily, but sometime before the Icelandic beach-volleyball team wins the gold medal.<p>
On the demand side, you've got the commuters of the emerging nations driving more cars more often and developing an American appetite for high octane. Meanwhile, U.S. residents are holding up our end as the undefeated champs of gas guzzling. It seems like the 1970s all over again, with off-road vehicles as big as tanks and oxymoronic minivans filling the lanes where tiny Volkswagen Beetles once crawled. The national speed limit was raised to 65 with hardly a peep from the energy-conservation faction, and this, along with the bigger cars and the widespread boredom with switching off the lights in empty rooms, will surely result in more barrels burned.<p>
The daily world demand for oil now exceeds 70 million barrels, more than double the 31 million barrels a day we turned into heat, speed, and exhaust 30 years ago. More promising than that for oil investors, the annual rate of increase in demand has accelerated from 1.5 percent over the past decade to a projected 2.5 percent for the next two years.<p>
There's no doubt the latest high-tech methods of drilling and exploring will capture oil in areas that were thought to be tapped outit's already happening in parts of the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. But so far, the fancy probes with longer straws haven't produced enough oil to reverse an obvious and long-term decline: U.S. oil production peaked during the Nixon administration at ten million barrels a day. Today it's 6.5 million.<p>
The price of oil went through the roof in the early 1970s, after the Arabs declared an embargo and stopped pumping. Adjusted for inflation, the price has gone nowhere since that expensive trauma. Because oil has been cheap all these years, people have begun to think we'll have cheap oil forever, the same way they thought the price would go up forever when it rose to $40 a barrel during the embargo. As it turned out, their predictions of $100 a barrel were completely off base, because the $40 price stimulated so much production among suppliers and conservation among consumers that it's taken a quarter century for demand to catch up to supply.<p>
Because the cycles are very long, it's easy to forget that oil and natural gas are cyclical commodities that move with the vagaries of supply and demand. Today, we've got tight supplies and low reserves in both oil and natural gas, while demand continues to grow.<p>
Stock pickers have Saddam Hussein to thank for the bargains that can be found in the oil sector on Wall Street. The threat of Iraq's opening the valve on its big pipeline has been weighing on these shares since the Gulf War. For four years, investors have worried that the world will be glutted with oil and the price will collapse as soon as Saddam resumes pumping. But if Saddam had continued to pump at the prewar rate of 3.5 million barrels a day, they wouldn't be worried. Meanwhile, worldwide consumption has grown by two million to three million barrels a day since the war, so the increased demand has already sopped up Iraq's potential supply.<p>
If you expect oil or gas prices to go higher and you want to take advantage of it in the stock market, there are two ways to proceed. You can invest in the giant integrated companies, such as the Six Sisters, or you can sink your assets into the smaller, so-called pure producers, of which nearly 300 are publicly traded. Both strategies have potential merit. Investing in the integrateds is likely to be a safer bet with a more modest potential payoff. The pure producers are riskier, by and large, but they offer a more spectacular payoff if you invest in the right one.<p>
The integrated companies are multinationals that work both ends of the pipeline, from the "upstream" wells and deposits through the refineries and neighborhood filling stations "downstream." And many of them have large petrochemical operations that at times produce substantial profits. Of the top 15 oil companies in the world, Exxon is the largest that's publicly traded.<p>
The Six Sisters have reduced debt in recent years, and their dividend payout is a comfortable percentage of their cash flow. Their aggressive cost cutting enables them to make a profit on a lower price of oil. However, the strength of the Exxons and the Mobils is also their weakness. While their size and their clout protect them in hard times, they also hold these companies back when conditions are favorable. Mobil is a perfect example. Since it refines almost three times as much oil as it produces, Mobil is a buyer of oil as well as a seller, so a higher oil price doesn't automatically translate into higher earnings. What it gains selling oil downstream, it may lose buying oil upstream.<p>
A more serious drag on Mobil's potential gain from higher oil prices is that it is also a chemical company. This helps when the chemical business is good, but lately it's been sluggish. Otherwise, Mobil and the other integrateds might be doing better in the stock market, given the sharp rise in the price of oil.<p>
You won't find either the pluses or the minuses of diversity with the pure producers. These companies work the upstream side of the pipeline, finding oil and then selling it. They run the gamut from low-budget operations with six employees, such as Bellwether Exploration, to midsize companies, such as <a name="NYSE:APA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apache</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:BR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10251"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Burlington Resources</b></a>, which have around 2,000 employees eachstill quite small when compared with Exxon's 90,000.<p>
Unlike the integrateds, pure producers can't be counted on to pay a steady dividend or even to stay in business if oil prices fall below the point where they can afford to pump it. But if oil prices take a jump, these stocks will tend to follow the same trajectory.<p>
I contacted several top analysts who cover the integrateds and the pure producers. Here are a few of their candidates for investment, starting with the small companies.<p>
Mike Barbis at UBS touts <a name="NYSE:NBL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11082"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Noble Affiliates</b></a> (NYSE: NBL), based in Ardmore, Oklahoma. What he finds most attractive about Noble is that it owns more natural gas than oil; Barbis is more optimistic about natural-gas prices than oil prices. Noble earned 35 cents a share in 1995, and Barbis expects it to earn $1.50 this year and $2.05 in 1997. He also likes <a name="NYSE:LLX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10917"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Louisiana Land and Exploration</b></a> (NYSE: LLX), which has cut its production costs for oil from $9.27 a barrel to $7.20. Jim Clark at CS First Boston likes a Texas refiner called <a name="NYSE:VLO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11574"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Valero Energy</b></a> (NYSE:VLO).<p>
Many pure producers are found in Canada. Martin Molyneaux at FirstEnergy in Alberta likes <a name="AMEX:CXY"></a><b>Canadian Occidental Petroleum</b> (AMEX:CXY), a subsidiary of U.S.based Occidental Petroleum. Among smaller companies, he likes <a name="NYSE:AOG"></a><b>Alberta Energy</b> (NYSE:AOG) and Renaissance Energy (Toronto:RES).<p>
Of the big companies, Michael Mayer from Schroder Wertheim likes Mobil (NYSE:MOB) and Texaco (NYSE:TX), to which he has assigned target share prices of $127 and $94, respectivelybumps of 14 percent and 9 percent from where the stocks are trading as I write. Jim Clark likes <a name="NYSE:UCL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11569"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Unocal</b></a> (NYSE: UCL)at its current price of around $34 a share. He's also recommending Texaco and Chevron (NYSE: CHV). He sees a jump in Texaco's earnings from $3.90 a share in 1995 to $5.55 in 1996 and $6.10 in 1997. Other analysts are projecting similar jumps for many companies in the oil group.<p>
Remember my mention of the underweighting of these stocks among institutions? If good earnings reports convince institutional buyers that they've been wrong about oil, they'll rush in to buy. That will be nice for the individual investors who get there before the big players do.<p>
And there's one more potential attraction to the integrateds: They may add ballast to a portfolio, because oil companies often thrive on bad news, such as wars. The oil embargo of the 1970s was a shock that seemed to come out of nowhere. Who knows where the next disruption could arise: a revolution in Saudi Arabia, a shutdown of the Soviet oil fields, an uprising in Venezuela? An oil crisis could even result when Japan or Germany emerges from its economic woes. It would take a shortage of no more than a million barrels a day to produce another shock in which oil and gas stocks would likely go up while most stocks were going down.<p>

						By Ted C. Fishman<p>Do you dream of elves sneaking in at night and cleaning up your desk or office? If so, then give some thought to scanners during the waking hours. <p>They haven't received the attention of the World Wide Web, but these amazing, now affordable computer add-ons will prove just as indispensable to homes and offices as an Internet connection. By turning real pages into digital bits, these "paper management systems," as one manufacturer calls them, will put the contents of our desks and drawers into our computers. Then they'll rid our lives of fax and copy machines, too.<p>Consider the PaperPort Vx or PaperPort ix, from <a name="NASD:VSNR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=47703"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Visioneer</b></a>. The Vx is about a foot long and a few inches wide, and the ix is a computer keyboard with a trim scanning barrel at the back; each can devour a deskful of paper and reduce every sheet or stack of pages into thumbnail-sized images on a virtual desktop. To do this, the scanners employ the additional magic of Visioneer's software, which enables users to manipulate and sort documents as images on a computer screen. <p>Now that a single computer mouse can accomplish everything a typing and clerical pool can, the virtual desktop is far harder to clutter than a physical one. Optical-character-recognition software can convert documents into different formats -- that of a favorite word processor, for example -- almost instantly. With an attached modem, documents can be routed by E-mail or sent to a fax machine elsewhere. Scanners can also function as a simple copy machine, reproducing scanned materials through a printer.<p>The PaperPorts scan only in black and white, however, and can handle only one loose page at a time. This makes them less than ideal for those other great scanner uses: getting color pictures and bound material into a computer. Multimedia presentations and graphically interesting Web pages demand as much; also, computers are increasingly becoming the repositories of family photo albums, photographic household inventories, and miscellaneous gimcrack-like greeting cards and children's drawings.<p>Color flatbed scanners, such as <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a>'s ScanJet 4p, make this possible, swallowing just about any picture or document thrown at them and yielding computer-screen reproductions with the clarity of good slides. The 4p, like most flatbed scanners, is sold with useful software for scanning and manipulating images. (The good news is that Visioneer's PaperPort software comes with all of Hewlett-Packard's color flatbed scanners; the bad news is that it works only with Visioneer and Hewlett-Packard scanners.) Beware: The 4p can prove hard to install. It requires a special adapter card (included), which tends to conflict with many Sound Blaster brand sound cards. The best solution is to have the scanner installed where purchased or to attach it only to late-model machines with "plug and play" cards that automatically resolve most conflicts in a computer's hardware.<p>Plustek's OpticPro 4800P color flatbed scanner creates fewer installation headaches. It connects easily to the back of a computer -- no special adapter cards are required -- and can be used without disconnecting the printer. <p>The machine fits lengthwise on a standard desk (most flatbeds cannot) but letter-sized materials are the largest it can handle. Still, its ability to fit in a briefcase makes it ideal for lawyers or others who might need to take a scanner to the documents, rather than vice versa. It's fast, too, and produces higher-resolution scans than others in its price range. However, the OpticPro's software works less seamlessly with other applications than Visioneer's products do, though revisions are promised.<p>Those with more ambitious scanning needs, or who want to add scanning and document-management software to scanners they already own, should turn to Envisions (800-365-7226), a mail-order house devoted to scanners and scanning. Its excellent high-end scanners sell for prices considerably lower than those of comparable models from other makers. <p>Take the 4cx color flatbed scanner, for example, which permits sharper resolutions than the PaperPorts. Envisions bundles it with <wam-co>Adobe</wam-co> Photoshop (the most powerful imaging software available to consumers) and a full suite of optical-character-recognition, document-management, and presentation software for $849. That's $50 less than the suggested retail price of Photoshop alone. Envisions also mixes and matches packages to suit more specific needs.<p>Prices for scanners are proving just as volatile as those for personal computers, so shop carefully. Models and features change quickly, and vendors aren't shy about passing off older models as new ones; don't count on them to pass along a price drop, either. Be aware of scanning's hidden costs, too -- chief among them the increased need for memory of all kinds. Color-image scanning requires at least 16 megabytes of memory on a Windows 95 system; more is preferable. In addition, images of all kinds eat up disc storage space. A high-capacity external storage device, such as the Iomega Zip Drive, which saves information onto 100-megabyte discs, may be needed to spare hard drives the cluttered-desk fate the scanner was meant to cure. Still, it beats those low-tech piles of paper.<p><p><p>

						By Laurence Hooper<p>A sleek black box only slightly bigger than a pack of cigarettes, FaxView ($499) is based on a nifty idea: Instead of getting printed faxes, users peer inside this device to see them displayed as glowing red images. This works better than you might imagine. Pages, which can be viewed at a couple of magnification levels, are relatively easy to read. So hook FaxView to a cell phone or a phone line and -- presto! -- a portable fax machine.<p>Well, sort of. The problem is that real fax machines also send documents. FaxView can only transmit short messages pecked out on an on-screen keyboard -- which gets mighty tedious. The device can't handle graphics or scan in existing documents, either (though it can store as many as 25 pages of received faxes and re-send  elsewhere).<p>My laptop computer, which also sends and receives faxes, is much better at creating documents. FaxView is much smaller and lighter -- it looks like it belongs on Mr. Spock's utility belt -- but I'm not going to stop carrying my laptop when I'm on the road. So even at less than eight ounces, FaxView is deadweight.<p>I guess there are folks who'd love FaxView. Workaholic lawyers come to mind: They could receive confidential documents in traffic jams. Reflection Technology, which makes FaxView, suggests that construction workers could use it while on a building site -- a rather desperate scenario, I think.<p>Basically, this gizmo is a solution in search of a problem. It's a pretty cool-looking solution, I'll admit, and it's a kick to walk around knowing there's a fax machine in your pocket. But that thrill, at the end of the day, is FaxView's main benefit.<p><p><p>

						By Ted C. Fishman<p>The media love media, so it's no surprise the book industry has embraced the Web. Publishers can tempt readers there with reviews, sample chapters, and even audio snippets from the authors themselves. When it comes to business and finance -- perhaps the most crowded niche in publishing -- HarperBusiness offers the best site: HarperBizNet (http://www.harpercollins.com/business/indextop.htm). At one point earlier this year, a third of the books on Business Week's hardcover best-seller list were featured on the site, as was The Dilbert Principle trivia game. A regular element is a schedule of speaking engagements for HarperBusiness authors, many of them celebrity gurus who usually speak only to paying crowds but who often turn out for free when peddling their books.<p>For other book-related resources, try BookWeb (http://ambook.org) from the American Booksellers Association. It provides current news on the book industry and includes links to information on authors. Or visit BookWire (http://www.bookwire.com), which sponsors, with Publishers Weekly, "Authors on the Highway," a comprehensive list of book tours searchable by author, title, or publisher.<p><p><p><p>

For new biotech companies, the goal isn't to become the next Merck anymore<p>By Pamela J. Black<p><a name="NASD:INCY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16850"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Incyte Pharmaceuticals</b></a> does not make a single drug -- nor does the Palo Alto, California, company aim to develop any drugs itself. The company's products are instead databases of human- and microbial-gene sequences that someday may lead to drugs that can wipe out diseases at their source. However, some other company will develop those drugs -- Incyte (Nasdaq: INCY) has sold nonexclusive rights to parts of its database to pharmaceutical giants such as <a name="NYSE:JNJ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10824"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Johnson & Johnson</b></a>. Ten such deals will bring in more than $160 million over the next few years.<p>Welcome to the new financial model for building a successful biotech company. The founders of the previous generation of biotech companies -- <a name="NASD:AMGN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12623"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Amgen</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:GNE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10628"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Genentech</b></a>, <a name="NASD:CNTO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12923"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Centocor</b></a>, and Genex, to name just a few -- set out to build the next <a name="NYSE:MRK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merck</b></a>. Companies in the new wave, however, aren't trying to do it all; they plan to grow in partnership with the big pharmaceutical companies, which will fund their research efforts in exchange for marketing rights on new drugs or licenses on any new discoveries. "One company doesn't have to go from a dead halt to <a name="NYSE:BMY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10232"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bristol-Myers Squibb</b></a> in ten years," says Cynthia Robbins-Roth, editor of BioVenture View, a newsletter in San Mateo, California.<p>Investors who want to figure out what to pay for a biotechnology stock have to change their thinking, too. In the old public-markets model, investors had to figure out how much more money -- after they purchased their shares -- the company would need to raise before it made a profit. In effect, they had to figure out how much smaller their current stake in the company would be by the time the company stopped raising money. For companies following the new model, investors must calculate how much of future sales the company has promised to its partners in exchange for current financing.<p>The reason for the new model is pretty simple: Biotech companies learned the hard way that public markets are an expensive place to raise the $300 million it takes to develop a new drug -- the cost of research, clinical trials, manufacturing, and marketing.<p>To get a sense of just how expensive, look at Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN), which is arguably the only biotech to join the ranks of the drug giants. Founded in 1980, the Thousand Oaks, California, company first turned to the public markets in 1983, raising $40 million. Subsequently, Amgen raised $38 million in 1986 and almost $75 million in 1987. Because of all the shares issued in those offerings, an investor at the initial public offering saw his ownership of the company diluted by more than 50 percent by 1987 -- his shares had that much less of a claim on the company's earnings. "If you own a biotech from the start, each time the company sells stock, your holding gets diluted," says John McCamant, associate editor of Medical Technology Stock Letter in Berkeley, California. "You end up owning a smaller chunk of it."<p>Fortunately for those shareholders, Amgen turned a corner in 1989 when it got FDA approval for Epogen, a drug that stimulates the production of red blood cells, and by 1995 net profit had hit $538 million. Even though the company issued more than eight million shares in the public markets to finance its growth, by 1995 earnings came to $1.92 a share -- up from one cent a share in 1987. A share purchased for $18 in 1986 was worth $657 in July 1996.<p>But most old-model biotechnology companies didn't turn out nearly as well for investors. More typical is <a name="NASD:IMUL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12015"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ImmuLogic Pharmaceutical</b></a>(Nasdaq: IMUL), a 1987 start-up. The Waltham, Massachusetts, company went public in 1991 at $10 a share and sold more stock to the public in 1992, 1993, and 1995. Shares outstanding grew from 9.85 million in 1991 to 20.2 million in 1996, a 105 percent increase. Sales (since the company is still losing money, it has no earnings) have more than doubled from $3.2 million in 1991 to $7.8 million in 1995. But because of the dilution created by all those shares, sales per share have increased only 21 percent. Since the company lost $19 million in 1995, more dilution may lie ahead.<p>Contrast ImmuLogic to <a name="NASD:AGPH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12537"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Agouron Pharmaceuticals</b></a> (Nasdaq: AGPH), a company following the new financial model in its efforts to develop drugs. To fund its research on an HIV drug called Viracept, Agouron has turned to financing from Japan Tobacco: Agouron receives $30 million from Japan Tobacco for reaching strategic milestones. In exchange, Agouron has given Japan Tobacco exclusive rights to sell Viracept in Asia. Meanwhile, Swiss pharmaceutical giant Hoffmann-LaRoche is paying the San Diego biotech $55 million to fund development of a cancer drug, Thymitaq, in exchange for worldwide marketing rights and co-marketing rights in the U.S. The money from each partner is almost as much as Amgen raised in 1987 in its third public offering.<p>So what's a partnership-financed company such as Agouron worth? 
Fortunately, the deals themselves are good barometers of the value of a stock. Some of them are, from an investor's point of view, better than others.<p>For example, investors should probably take a pass on companies that have already sold most of their future to a partner. Genentech, for example, has limited appeal for investors since 68 percent 
of it is owned by Roche Holdings. Roche has the right to buy the rest of the company in the next five years for just over $60 a share. "There's not a lot of risk but no upside either," says John McCamant. "They come up with a blockbuster drug, and Roche will buy them out."<p>Partnerships can help an investor focus on the products that are most likely to actually reach the market. "The shareholder uses the partner as a due-diligence proxy," says John McCamant. In other words, since an established company that presumably knows the drug market has decided this potential product has a future, investors can try to figure out how big the future market will be rather than worry about the validity of the basic science practiced in a company's laboratories.<p>Biotech companies are usually valued at four to eight times anticipated revenues, says Jim McCamant, John's father and editor of Medical Technology Stock Letter. He expects Agouron's Viracept to be approved in the first half of 1997. Because it has shown fewer side effects in clinical trials than other HIV products, it could capture 20 percent of what Jim McCamant estimates will be a $2 billion market for HIV drugs at the end of 1997. Discounting that $400 million by 30 percent (since the drug is a year from market) and then, to be conservative, multiplying by the lowest multiple -- four -- McCamant figures that if Agouron produced Viracept alone its market value should be $1.12 billion.<p>Thymitaq is harder to evaluate because it's not known which cancers it will treat effectively. Jim McCamant estimates that sales of the drug will be about $200 million in two years. Since Agouron is splitting revenues with Roche, it will see only $100 million of that. Discounting those revenues by 60 percent (since revenues are two years in the future) and again applying the multiple four, McCamant arrives at a market cap of $160 million for a company selling only Thymitaq.<p>Add the two together, and Agouron is worth at least $1.28 billion -- without counting the value of other drugs in the pipeline. The company's stock traded at $42.50 in early July, giving Agouron a market cap of just $451 million -- a big discount to McCamant's estimate. With about 10.6 million shares outstanding, Agouron should sell at approximately $121 a share within two to three years. "It's a no-brainer that Agouron is undervalued," McCamant says.<p>Don't assume that a market value like this is guaranteed. A competitor could undercut prices. So investors should look for companies with drugs for diseases that are currently untreatable. These companies "have pricing flexibility, at least until competition comes along," says Cowen & Co. analyst David Stone.<p>Companies built on a broad enabling technology that can be applied to many different markets and drugs are also more likely to achieve a projected market cap. Technology that has earned a patent provides additional security. <a name="NASD:RZYM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=51693"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ribozyme</b></a> (Nasdaq: RZYM), 
a Boulder, Colorado, start-up, licenses the patents to the discovery by Nobel winner Thomas Cech of a form of RNA that can destroy disease-causing proteins. "Anyone who wants to use them to treat a specific disease will have to deal with us," says David Morgenthaler, managing partner of Morgenthaler Ventures, an investor in the company.<p>And anyone who wants to buy the next wave in biotechs -- while they are still out of favor -- can use these methods to figure out how much to pay.<p><p><p>

						They offer the very best returns on Wall Street, and mutual funds can't buy them. You and I can. Welcome to the small time.<p>By Clint Willis<p>Shock waves as big as tsunamis have staggered even such seaworthy blue-chip stocks as <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a>. Surges of pessimism have hammered many smaller recent favorites, such as <a name="NASD:USRX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15388"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>U.S. Robotics</b></a> and <a name="NASD:IOMG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13832"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Iomega</b></a>. Why then would any investor want to put a dollar into microcaps -- the smallest stocks that trade on the public markets?<p>Simply because no other sector of the market so amply rewards the
individual investor willing to do the hard work of independently evaluating companies. "the few people who have the time and the talent to find these stocks can get a bigger reward for the risk they 
take than anywhere else in the financial markets," says Mark Boyer, a managing partner at ROI Partners in San Francisco.<p>That's not what most of the experts told me, however. According to them, microcaps -- stocks with a total market value of $25 million or less -- are poison for individual investors. "The smaller the company, the lower the quality of the business franchise and the management team," says Neal Bradsher, managing director of Campbell Advisors, a New York City money-management firm that specializes in microcaps. "When you have a market cap that small, there's probably something wrong with the company," says David Warnock, a partner with Cahill, Warnock in Baltimore.<p>What these professionals, most of whom make their living investing in these stocks, didn't feel compelled to stress is that this part of the stock market can be extraordinarily profitable. Thanks to Ibbotson Associates, the Chicago investment-research firm, everyone knows that small-company stocks have beaten the tar out of blue chips over the long haul: From 1926 through 1995, while large-company stocks returned 10.5 percent a year on average, small-company stocks returned 12.5 percent. But what most investors don't know is that much of that extra return results from the performance of the smallest of small stocks. "Almost all of the superior returns offered by small stocks come from micro-cap stocks with market capitalizations below $25 million. $10,000 invested in that group on December 31, 1951 soared to over $29 million in value [through 1994], achieving a compound growth rate of over 20 percent for the 43 years reviewed," reports James P. O'Shaughnessy in his 1996 book, What Works on Wall Street.<p>Returns like that come from investing in companies that are so small that the big institutions that dominate Wall Street avoid them: There aren't enough shares available to do high-volume deals. That means this part of the market is inefficient -- no analysts track earnings, and no computerized traders keep prices from getting out of line. Individuals can find the best of these tiny companies -- and invest in them -- before anyone on Wall Street even knows they exist.<p>That's what Jim Seward, a Kansas City, Missouri, money manager, did in 1985. Cook Data Systems, which was then launching a chain of video-rental stores, had a market capitalization of about $10 million -- a mere flyspeck by the standards of most investors. But Seward dropped by the company's first store and then met with the owners. "They had a lot of cash and a good business plan, so I bought it," he recalls. The company became Blockbuster Entertainment.<p>Finding companies like that -- and small fry that will make an investor a healthy profit without ever growing up to become a Blockbuster -- doesn't require sophisticated methodologies. "Microcap stocks are really one of the easiest arenas for small investors to work in," says Marc Robins, editor of The Red Chip Review in Portland, Oregon, which tracks tiny companies and their stocks. "The businesses are typically very simple, and their annual reports are easy to read. They don't have silly tax rates or overseas divisions or goofy pension plans to figure out." What it does take is hard work. Coming up with the list of eight recommended microcaps for this story took me about 240 hours -- or about 30 hours of work per stock. That may seem like a lot, but think of it this way: If you own a thousand shares of a single $4 stock that goes to $12, you will have earned more than $250 an hour from your investment of sweat on that one pick.<p>I began by building my own list of potentially interesting microcap stocks. No investment bank, no brokerage firm, no mutual fund keeps a list of the kind of microcap stocks you want to find. Institutional investors call any stock a microcap that has a market capitalization -- the value of all the company's issued shares multiplied by the current price per share -- of less than $100 million. For the really small stocks, an individual investor is truly on his own. (See "First, Find the Haystack," on page 78, for more on how to build a list.) My initial list contained 45 companies.<p>Getting lots and lots of information on each of these companies turned out to be extremely easy -- too easy, in fact. It's clear that institutional investors don't avoid the market for microcaps because they can't find out anything about these companies. I wound up buried in information. Companies gladly sent me annual reports, brochures, press clippings, and anything else that could tell me their story. It's just not worth a big investor's time to study a company this small -- holding even 10 percent of a microcap's total stock, which would come to $2.5 million, isn't enough to give much of a kick to a $1 billion portfolio. That, and not the lack of information, is what keeps this part of the market reserved for relatively few investors.<p>In some cases, the information made it easy to eliminate a company, and I got down to 25 companies in short order. Coin Bill Validator (market cap: $16.1 million), which makes paper-currency-validation systems for the gaming and vending industries, looked interesting, but press releases told me that costs were up and profits were way down.<p>Other companies seemed like quality stuff. Jim Hjelm's Private Collection (market cap: $3.2 million), a New York City firm that designs, makes, and sells bridal gowns and bridesmaids' dresses, sent me some pictures. The dresses were absolutely stunning. Profits are rising; debt is low.<p><a name="NASD:AILP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=45012"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Alpnet</b></a> (a market cap of $24 million when I spotted it and $33 million at presstime), in Salt Lake City, is the largest publicly owned dedicated supplier of worldwide translation and "product-localization services," which involve modifying products to work in foreign markets. For example, when <a name="NYSE:CPQ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10381"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Compaq Computer</b></a> enters a foreign market, Alpnet translates the maintenance manuals and operating instructions. Revenues grew more than 30 percent in 1995. I was interested.<p><a name="NASD:REXL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14581"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Rexhall Industries</b></a> (market cap: $17.9 million), a Lancaster, California, company that makes recreational vehicles, posted 21 percent sales growth in 1995, a slow year for the industry.<p>If these were blue-chip companies, I would have had to rely on market analysts and research reports to get the inside dope on each one. That's not true with microcaps. "The guys at these firms say, 'Look! A shareholder! Grab him!'" says Boyer. "The companies that I visit are so willing to talk about themselves, they'll tell you anything."<p>Investor relations? Hah! Ask to talk to a senior manager, preferably the CEO. "If they're not cooperative and communicative, cross them off the list," says Seward. A few of the companies out of the original 45 on my list didn't call back. Only one flat out refused to talk.<p>From all my reading, I had developed a list of several dozen questions to ask these companies -- covering everything from profit margins to legal issues. But after a few interviews, I threw out all but four or five. If the manager's answers didn't impress me, I moved on. "For these firms to become big-cap companies, their management teams will have to articulate their business plan to Wall Street," says Seward. "If they can't even describe it to you..."<p>Question No. 1: How will the company grow? The manager's vision should include a realistic plan for increasing sales and earnings during the next several years and beyond.<p>Alpnet, for example, has a share of the $1.7 billion translation and product-localization market second only to that of <a name="NYSE:BTZ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14371"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Berlitz</b></a>. Moreover, at least one research company estimates that the market will grow 30 percent annually for the next five years. CEO Tom Seal and chief financial officer Kerry Stubbs spent two hours telling me about their plan to take a bigger piece of that growing pie: First, open offices in more countries to get access to more customers; Alpnet is in 22 countries now, up from 9 in 1989. Second, offer one-stop shopping. Alpnet translates information into well over 100 languages, and most of its competitors have a much narrower range. Third, deliver quick results in a world where companies need to get new products to market right away.<p>The three-part strategy is designed to crowd out competitors. "<a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford</b></a> used to have 50 companies translate for them, and now they have 3," said Seal. "We're one of them."<p>Joseph Murphy, president of Jim Hjelm's Private Collection, was equally persuasive about how he plans to make his company grow in a mature market. Hjelm's is the only publicly traded company in the highly fragmented bridal-gown industry, with a 1 percent market share. Murphy's strategy for growth made sense to me. The company has identified emerging fashion trends at the high end of the market and is launching new lines to fill those niches. One such line consists of bridesmaids' dresses that are suitable for other occasions. 
"I think that's a great idea," confirmed my wife, Jennifer, who keeps an $800 bridesmaid's dress in the attic. The firm's Occasions bridesmaids' line is the hottest in the country.<p>Finally, Murphy plans to acquire smaller bridal-gown competitors. "Many of the small, family-owned companies in this industry have older owners who are looking for an exit strategy," he said.<p>Hardest to evaluate, I found, are companies with new products. For example, <a name="NASD:LIFC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=45891"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>LifeCell</b></a> (market cap: $24.2 million), in the Woodlands, Texas, is building a market from scratch for its new product, AlloDerm, which is a patented tissue-grafting method used in periodontal, plastic, and reconstructive surgery. CEO Paul Frison figures that the combined U.S. market for all these uses could reach $300 million.<p>If he can get his product in front of prospective customers, that is. Frison has started by building a sales and marketing staff to sell the product directly to burn-treatment centers. New regional distribution networks will sell AlloDerm to plastic surgeons. The firm also recently signed a deal with a major dental-supply company and has licensed AlloDerm to Medtronic (market cap: $12 billion) for use in heart valves.<p>Some managers couldn't articulate their plans. I was impressed by a statistic in the marketing materials of Trans-Industries, which makes bus lighting, electronic highway signs, and things like that: The company's literature claimed that 9.7 out of 10 transit buses use its products. Forty minutes on the phone with the firm's CFO provided more good news -- the company's lineup of products is broader and deeper than that of its competitors. But I still hadn't heard a strategy for increasing sales or defending market share from potential competitors -- despite asking several times. I reluctantly dropped the company from my list.<p>Question No. 2: Does the possibility of competition from larger, better-financed companies scare you? Most small companies face significant competition or the threat of it. An investor doesn't expect to find companies without competition -- just savvy, hardworking executives who have strategies for thriving despite it.<p>Company executives who don't admit that fear sure frighten me. Bruce Wilson, CEO and CFO of <a name="AMEX:HPP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=45751"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Healthy Planet Products</b></a>, which produces greeting cards with environmentalist themes, confidently noted that "there isn't any significant competition in wildlife- and wilderness-photo greeting cards." Not yet, maybe -- but wait until Hallmark hears about the company's 20 percent annual earnings growth. I crossed Healthy Planet off my list, despite its gorgeous balance sheet and strong earnings record.<p>I liked <a name="NASD:ULTR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=43286"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ultradata Systems</b></a> (market cap: $20.2 million) because, while confident, CEO Monte Ross seemed to have a healthy respect for the competition. The Saint Louis firm sells a line of handheld travel devices that serve as low-tech substitutes for a global-positioning system. For $29.95 a pop, the company's Road Whiz Plus gives drivers information about distances, gas stations, hotels, hospitals, restaurants, and the like along an interstate. Another unit provides details about more than 10,000 golf courses in the U.S.<p>Competition? No one makes similar devices, so the ten-year-old firm has a big head start -- and three patents protect its technology. Global-positioning systems could, in theory, pose a threat as they get cheaper and more portable. But Ross points out that right now a typical GPS costs upwards of $2,000. No threat from that direction for a while.<p>The company's sales have grown about 70 percent annually since 1993, and long-term debt is almost nonexistent. Its return on equity (a measure of profitability) is an eye-popping 32 percent. The capper: Road Whiz Plus is the third-best-selling item on QVC's <a name="NYSE:HSN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12024"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Shopping Network</b></a>, according to Ross. How can I pass this one up?<p>ThrustMaster (market cap: $17.7 million) seems almost paranoid about its competition -- a trait I find scary in friends but like in my investments. The company spends a fair amount of money fending off copycats who try to rip off its line of peripherals used to play games on personal computers. The Portland, Oregon, firm is the market leader in realistic "flight controllers" for games that involve simulated flying.<p>CFO Kent Koski pointed out that the market for PC entertainment software (as opposed to stand-alone game devices, such as Nintendo or Sega) grew 30 percent in 1995; that helped boost ThrustMaster's sales 43 percent. But competition is increasing, so the firm will have to continue churning out first-rate products.<p>Can they do it? I'm no great judge of computer-entertainment peripherals, but presumably George Lucas can afford to hire people who are -- and Lucas Arts is among the companies that buy this little firm's products to make their games more fun. And Koski notes that NASA has bought some joysticks to be used for training in the space-shuttle program, and a defense contractor wants a computer-simulated program for tank commanders. If this company's stuff is good enough for Lucas Arts and guys who drive tanks for a living, I'm certainly interested.<p>Actually, I did manage to find one company where competition isn't a problem. <a name="NASD:MODT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10378"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Modtech</b></a> (a market cap of $24 million when I called and $27 million at presstime), a 14-year-old maker of modular, relocatable classrooms in Perris, California, was hammered when the state's severe recession crimped education spending. In fact, Modtech was the only major manufacturer in its business to survive the five-year drought in orders. Now the company is sitting pretty indeed. The California economic recovery let the state increase its education budget; since the end of 1995 the company's backlog has grown 500 percent to $20 million. Clearly, the world of relocatable classrooms is Modtech's oyster.<p>Question No. 3: Are you really, really good at this? I discovered that it was hard to come right out and ask this one. But by the time I'd talked to most CEOs for 15 minutes, I felt close to an answer. And while it may not much matter who runs <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> (sorry, Lou Gerstner), a company with a market cap of $25 million or less needs a great team at the wheel. "With companies this size, you're betting as much on the quality of the management as you are on the product," says Byron Roth, president of Cruttenden Roth, an investment-banking and brokerage firm in Irvine, California.<p>I rejected any company whose head honcho wasn't smart and articulate. When a manager bowled me over with his enthusiasm, charm, and general smarts, I took that as a good sign. In a few cases, I insisted on it. Take <a name="NASD:REXL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14581"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Rexhall</b></a> (market cap: $17.9 million), the motor-home manufacturer. I knew that the company had serious competition from the likes of <a name="NYSE:WGO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11643"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Winnebago</b></a> (market cap: $219 million) and <a name="NYSE:FLE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10586"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fleetwood</b></a> (market cap: $1.4 billion). Its only hope is to outsmart the big guys.<p>I think founder Bill Rex can do it. After 13 years with another RV company, Rex took the top spot at a struggling competitor; in 18 months he turned it around. In 1986, he and Charles Hall started Rexhall, and by 1990 sales were $39 million. Then the Gulf War devastated the California market, where the firm's sales were concentrated.<p>Since then, however, revenues have climbed 45 percent a year to $60.7 million in 1995. The firm has a 3 percent share of the $2.7 billion market for Class A motor homes -- the biggest and fanciest ones made -- and aims to boost that to 10 percent within two to three years. "Other guys have gotten that kind of market share," Rex said matter-of-factly. "They're not as good as we are, and they don't have our financial strength."<p>What's so great about Rexhall RVs? I could tell that Rex was glad I asked. "Most people use 70-ounce carpeting; we use 90-ounce. Our fiberglass siding is what you'd find in a $300,000 motor home, but ours sell for $60,000 to $160,000. The other guys take a cookie-cutter approach -- they're too big to do anything else...." Twenty minutes of this, and I was about ready to write a check -- for an RV. Failing that, I put the stock on my list.<p>By now, I had zeroed in on about ten companies I liked. But I still had doubts about some of them, and it seemed like a good idea to take another piece of advice from Byron Roth: "Call customers, and talk to suppliers," he urged me. "Get as much information as you can." Who better to judge a company's product versus the competition?<p>For example, I was worried about the ability of Minneapolis-based <a name="NASD:EVMD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=45523"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Everest Medical</b></a> (market cap: $23.2 million) to compete with companies like <a name="NYSE:USS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11558"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>U.S. Surgical</b></a>, so I called some of their doctor customers. Those conversations helped put me at ease. <p>Everest Medical is a leader in bipolar surgical instruments, which help doctors minimize tissue damage during surgical procedures that use electricity to take tissue samples. The market for bipolar instruments -- an advance over monopolar instruments, which require more complicated electrical connections -- is growing, but bigger companies have introduced competing instruments. Everest's strategy is to protect its technology with patents (43 so far) and target specific niches, such as the relatively tiny market for bipolar surgical scissors.<p>Everest's customers don't think the competition is much to worry about. Everest's products are superior to instruments that don't use this technology; moreover, bipolar technology is indeed catching on in the industry. The big guys will take notice, the customers figure, but they would be better off buying Everest than trying to get around those patents.<p>At some point in your investigation of a microcap, it's time to abandon the phone and go for a visit. Managers of small companies will likely be happy to have you drop by for a tour of headquarters or a chat with the CEO. That might be tough if you're investing in firms that are across the country from you -- one advantage to staying close to home. "I do a lot of investing in my own backyard," says Red Chip Review's Marc Robins. "It's easier to drive by and get a better understanding of the company."<p>Robins, Boyer, and other stock pickers treat such visits as 
a chance to notice signals that don't come across on the telephone. Check out everything from the furniture in the president's office to the men's room -- which could turn out to be important. "This sounds dopey, but if you visit a technology company, you want to see how clean their bathrooms are," adds Boyer. "It says something about how they run things."<p>Imponderables matter a lot. "It's like visiting someone at home," says Richard C. Perkins, a money manager at Perkins Capital Management in Minneapolis, who drops in on some 75 companies a year. "You can tell a lot about the person."<p>Site visits are an art, not a science. When I tagged along with Eric Miller, a portfolio manager at Heartland Funds in Milwaukee, on his visit to a small, publicly traded head-hunting and temporary-help firm (market cap: $10 million), I didn't immediately understand what Miller was after. A meeting with the CEO's son (senior executive, head of acquisitions) and the CFO yielded an hour of questions and answers about competition, profit margins, potential risks, and the like -- the kind of thing you could do on the phone.<p>So why did Miller bother to go in person? The real reason didn't dawn on me until after the visit was over: He wanted to make sure these people weren't clowns or free spenders or both. "I had a sense they were in for the long haul," he said approvingly -- and indeed, the CEO's son repeatedly said, "I'm an ambitious character. I'd like to have a big company."<p>Miller also noted that everyone was friendly and that the son of the CEO's office was very small. "I want to see they're not squandering resources," he said. (Unfortunately, this company didn't make my list for this story.)<p>I decided not to visit every one of the remaining ten companies on my list but to concentrate on the one company that raised the most doubt: Jim Hjelm's Private Collection. The company had a great plan, and if it worked it would be a great investment -- but could management execute? A quick trip to New York would give me a chance to visit the manufacturing facility and meet the people.<p>In New York City's garment district, Joseph Murphy greeted me at the firm's headquarters, a showroom with a row of desks for salespeople in the back. The desks are occupied by five employees who keep track of the company's different lines and work with designers to improve them. When I stopped to chat with one of these women, she noted that sales for her line were up 300 percent on the year.<p>One sales representative spent ten minutes explaining to me why the firm's dresses are so great; I came away hazy on details but convinced. "It's ethereal," she said of a blue wedding gown 
designed by Lazaro -- he's one of the firm's two big-name designers and the only one who goes by a single name. "It may not sell, but it will get people's attention."<p>At the manufacturing plant across the street, I met him. Lazaro was wearing a T-shirt and cutting small pieces out of a bolt of satin. Murphy introduced me.<p>"Hi," said Lazaro, looking pleasant but slightly confused. <p>I nodded distantly to hide my own confusion: I didn't know whether to address him as Lazaro or Mr. Lazaro.<p>The plant was busy and crowded, but no sweatshop. I met the pattern cutter and some quality inspectors. Murphy talked some more, but by now I knew enough: These people were smart; their dresses were beautiful. The sales rep claimed the dresses are comfortable, too. I can't confirm that: You have to draw the line somewhere when you're researching a stock.<p>In the end, I wound up with eight picks; they're listed in the table on page 82. Please remember that it takes only a little buying to send the prices of these thinly traded stocks soaring. Readers might want to wait for a correction to buy any stock that has moved up a lot.
But this specific list isn't the point of this story anyway. The process I used to find these stocks is one that any investor can duplicate. Investing in microcaps is hard work -- a lot harder than buying based on a broker's recommendation or a tip in a magazine -- but it's also potentially extremely rewarding. And how often does the market -- let alone life -- actually reward you for hard work?<p>Additional reporting by Sean Donahue and Carol Pickering.<p><p><p>

						Cadillac and Lincoln drivers get some help from above<p>By Jim Mateja<p>You're traveling a desolate road late at night. Suddenly your right front tire blows out. The car careers off the road, over a ditch, and into a clump of bushes so thick that no passing vehicle will ever be able to see you. It's your worst automotive nightmare.<p><a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford</b></a> have both taken steps to relieve motorist anxiety via a global-positioning satellite tied into a series of sensors in some of their top-model cars. The car's cellular phone is linked with a service center that knows the location of your vehicle and can send help in the event of a mechanical breakdown or medical emergency. It doesn't matter if you don't know where you are; the satellite pinpoints your location for the tow truck, which in some cases may already have been summoned.<p>OnStar, the GM system, will be offered as an option for the first time in all 1997 model Cadillacs, except the new Catera. The Ford system, called RESCU (Remote Emergency Satellite Cellular Unit), became an option with the 1996 Lincoln Continental. Both automakers say the system will eventually spread to other vehicles in their lineups.<p>RESCU costs $1,995, while OnStar will cost under $1,000, though with a monthly access fee (expected to be about $20 or $25). RESCU includes a set of four Michelin "run-flat" tires, which can be driven up to 50 miles at up to 55 mph at zero pressure, so you can drive to a safe place to change a flat.<p>OnStar is linked to a service center in Michigan, RESCU to one near Dallas. The cell phone links the driver to the center; in addition, both systems have special buttons to summon emergency aid. With both systems, if you press an emergency button and fail to respond to the staff member who calls the in-car phone, the staffer will immediately send emergency help to your location. OnStar has perhaps the most important safety feature: Any time an air bag inflates, sensors automatically dial up the service center to summon medical help to the site. RESCU doesn't yet have this extra, but Ford is considering adding it.<p>OnStar also offers some novel features that go above and beyond safety. Say you stop for lunch, and after an enjoyable meal you realize that you locked the keys in your car. No trouble. Just call the service center, tell the staffer your tale of woe, and give him or her your personal code. By pushing a few buttons, the staffer can unlock your car door.<p>Say you are running late for a plane, quickly park the car in a lot, and rush on board the craft. At 30,000 feet over Boise, you realize you forgot to lock your car. Call the service center, and the staffer can lock it for you. Or, on your return, you forget where you parked the car in the lot. The service center can set your car horn honking and your lights flashing so that you can retrieve it from the maze of vehicles.<p>That last service can also be a vital safety feature. Remember the car with the flat tire that ran into a clump of bushes so thick a rescue truck might have difficulty finding it? The honking horn and blinking lights can serve as a signal for rescuers.<p>If your car is stolen, OnStar can help locate it. RESCU doesn't have that capability, though Ford is considering adding another anti-theft feature in the near future -- if the car is stolen, the service center would be able to turn the radio up full blast and set either the heater in the summer or the air conditioning in the winter to the highest setting to totally frustrate the thief. <p>OnStar also allows the motorist to call for directions, for example, to the nearest restaurant or hotel. RESCU will provide the addresses and phone numbers of the nearest police station and motor club, but not those of eateries or places to sleep.<p>Ford may eventually add many of the same features OnStar offers, but points out that, while OnStar has a more varied menu, the motorist will pay for those conveniences through the monthly access fee. As with all other automotive accessories, the bottom line is that you get the luxury you pay for.<p><p><p>

FCC to couch potatoes: We're with you -- and your dish<p>By John Fried<p>Have you been forced to paint your satellite dish forest green to camouflage it in the shrubbery, fearful of the wrath of your homeowners association? Fear no longer. When President Clinton signed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, he gave the Federal Communications Commission the power to overturn local and private restrictions against satellite dishes smaller than one meter in diameter__which can cost as little as $200. The FCC has since preempted existing local zoning restrictions, and similar rules regarding bans by homeowners associations and community boards should be enacted by summer's end. "Homeowners won't have to ask anyone's permission," says Satellite Broadcasting & Communications Association spokesman David Withrow.<p>Satellite subscribers now number more than 5 million, and the new legislation will help fulfill industry predictions of over 14 million users by the year 2000. "The FCC decision reflects a long legal struggle for Americans who are used to freedom of choice and who have had cable forced down their throats by their neighbors and local government," says James E. Scott, editor of Satellite TV Week.<p>Dishes larger than one meter in diameter, which allow viewers to receive hundreds of channels as well as live feeds of unedited news footage, are still considered an eyesore and therefore subject to local and private restrictions, but some regulators feel these rules may also be relaxed in the future. Stay tuned.<p><p>

						Banks have issued millions of new credit cards -- all that plastic will take a big bite out of earnings.<p>By Greg Millman<p>We thought we understood the market," says a rueful Brian J. O'Hare, president of Norwest Card Services, the credit-card division of Norwest in Minneapolis. In 1993 and 1994, Norwest blanketed the country with direct-mail credit-card solicitations. In 1995, the bank had to take an $11 million charge against earnings -- a result of losses on credit-card loans.<p>Norwest has company. Its 1995 write-off was small compared with the $106 million in losses at Mellon Bank. At Comerica, whose credit-card business grew by 80 percent in 1995, write-offs rose from 1.45 percent of receivables in the fourth quarter of 1994 to 8.48 percent in the fourth quarter of 1995.<p>The write-offs banks have declared so far may be only the tip of the iceberg. Banks have applied the same excessive zeal to credit-card lending as they once did to loans to third-world countries and to developers of commercial real estate, two fads that proved dangerous to their bottom lines. Investors who reaped big gains in bank stocks last year need to protect their profits by dumping the stocks of banks likely to face big losses from bad credit-card debt.<p>It's easy to see how banks got into this position again. They sent out more than three billion card solicitations last year. That blizzard of plastic hit consumers already snowed under by debt. Debt service, the minimum amount cardholders owe each month, is rising faster than income, and personal-bankruptcy filings rose 27 percent -- faster than in the depths of the last recession -- in the first four months of this year. A March study by Veribanc, an independent bank-research firm in Wakefield, Massachusetts, showed that credit-card delinquencies -- charges that are at least 90 days overdue -- surged from $2.02 billion in mid-1994 to $3.53 billion by the end of 1995. "The stuff that banks put in the mail in 1994 and 1995 is coming back, and it will take until the latter part of the year to work through the system," says Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein. "Bank provisions for loan losses are low," says Frank DeSantis Jr., an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, "so relative to past times, it doesn't take a lot of deterioration to affect earnings."<p>It's not easy to identify those banks most at risk -- and the stocks that pose the most danger to investors. For example, by itself a high delinquency rate (meaning many credit-card holders aren't paying their charges) may not spell problems, says Veribanc research director Warren Heller. Banks that specialize in high-risk credits charge higher prices (annual fees, interest rates) on their cards, so paying accounts cover bad credits.<p>The chickens are most likely to come home to roost at banks that combine these characteristics: They allowed their credit-card business to grow rapidly, they depend on consumer loans for a big slice of income, they face intense pricing pressure that prevents them from raising interest rates, and they have inadequate reserves to cover losses. Since there tends to be a lag of 6 to 18 months before consumer-credit time bombs explode on bank income statements (and because bad-risk cardholders can keep transferring balances from one card to another before finally defaulting), experts believe the worst is yet to come.<p>The example of Norwest shows how these factors can form a financially lethal cocktail. Despite its efforts to target good credit risks, many of Norwest's offers were accepted by people who later lost high-paying jobs, a risk that hadn't shown up on credit reports. And because of interest-rate competition, Norwest lost some of its best customers. Consumers with good credit chose lower-rate cards, while riskier borrowers couldn't afford to be picky. O'Hare noticed delinquencies rising at the end of 1994, more than a year after the bank began its campaign. The problem didn't hit the bottom line until the end of 1995.<p>So which banks are most at risk? Certainly, stocks of the so-called monoline credit-card companies, <a name="NASD:ADVNA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12489"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Advanta</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:FUS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15687"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>First USA</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:COF"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42309"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Capital One Financial</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:KRB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12449"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MBNA</b></a>, which deal only in credit cards, bear watching. Beginning with almost no market share in 1990, this group had captured 18 percent of the $347 billion credit-card business five years later. Much of that growth came from balance-transfer offers that lured customers from other cards with low initial teaser rates. (MBNA is the exception; it relied on joint-marketing cards through organizations such as the Sierra Club.) Credit-card losses have been rising fast at all the monolines. For example, from the first quarter of 1995 to the like period of 1996, losses at Capital One rose from 2.8 percent of receivables to 4.7 percent and at First USA from 4.1 percent to 5.3 percent.<p>Despite impressive earnings growth, given these risks, valuations of all four stocks aren't attractive, says A. G. Edwards analyst Jack Peirce. Investors pay 16 times 12-month trailing earnings for the group, compared with an industry average price-to-earnings ratio of 11.2.<p>Some regional banks pose an even bigger danger to investors. Collectively, their card losses, as a percent of receivables, rose from 3.2 in the fourth quarter of 1994 to 4.1 in the same period of 1995, and individual stories are even more troubling. Richmond, Virginia's $18 billion Crestar Financial, the nation's 37th-largest bank, has 14 percent of its loan portfolio in credit cards. When Crestar raised low teaser rates last quarter, creditworthy account holders took a hike. Card losses rose from 2.7 percent of receivables in the first quarter of 1995 to 4.5 percent in the first quarter of 1996. And yet, trading at 13 times trailing earnings, Crestar stock remains expensive compared with its peers.<p>At another regional, the <a name="NYSE:BK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10177"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bank of New York</b></a>, charge-offs of bad credit-card debt rose a whopping 19 percent in the first quarter of 1996, according to an April report from Oppenheimer & Co. The stock is trading at 11 times earnings.<p>Investors shouldn't assume that banks see the writing on the wall. The <a name="NYSE:BKB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10175"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bank of Boston</b></a>, for instance, recently launched a credit-card campaign designed to make it the largest issuer in New England by the end of 1997, says director Jeff Slawsky. He isn't worried about the woes at other banks. "We believe we have a good handle on who we target," he says. That sounds familiar.<p><p>

EYEQ -- 800-642-2525
DOW JONES NEWS/RETRIEVAL -- 800-522-3567<p>It's hard to believe, but not much more than a generation ago, print publications were about the only way people like you and me could get security prices, news, and research. Today, lightning-fast products, from on-line computer services to pagers, allow investors to maintain up-to-the-minute tabs on their stocks. This isn't necessarily a good thing. Keeping such a close eye on prices can cause some investors to lose sight of a stock's long-term fundamentals. Instead, the focus becomes short-term fluctuations; this often leads to emotionally based trading decisions. And the use of triggers, which alert investors to a stock's rise above or fall below certain preset price levels, intensifies this short-term myopia.<p>But a lot of people don't want to hear that; they feel compelled to watch their investments closely, minutely, and a growing multitude of software programs and Internet sites have been developed to satisfy this urge. Just enter a bit of portfolio information and these products will update -- some of them every night, some in real time -- the value of your investments. There's plenty these tools should do but don't: They don't produce useful performance analyses -- such as calculating total return over time -- and they can't create tax reports. But the best of them handle their more-limited tasks well.<p>Other than providing the possible entertainment value that comes with tracking investments closely, these services are most useful for their power to strain out items of interest from the daily flood of information sloshing around us. Users can gather news and articles on mutual funds, industries, and specific companies -- valuable stuff for long-term investment decisions.<p>Just don't expect these services to be cheap (which is the attraction of much of the Internet, after all). For example, Quote.Com, whose base rates range from $9.95 to $42.95 per month, depending on the number of portfolios being tracked, requires an additional fee before providing access to information from wire services and Standard & Poor. (Also, although it offers access to a fair number of information sources, the search mechanism doesn't permit "and/or" searching, which is a good way to scan for articles on specific topics.) And Internet News Alert, which provides quotes and real-time wire-service news for an otherwise affordable $3.95 per month, charges $1.95 a pop for more than one article per source in a single day. (It runs "and/or" searches, but has a relatively limited number of sources.)<p>Farcast, on the other hand, is an Internet service that allows users to request stock quotes and news retrievals via E-mail. To save time, summaries are sent initially, but full articles from the major wire services can be requested for no additional cost. This service is $9.95 per month. <p>Rosebud, a $39.95 software program, searches for specific news and finance topics on CompuServe; it minimizes on-line time when the meter's running by conducting its searches while the user is off-line and then storing retrieved information on the user's hard drive, from which it can be read later.<p>A couple other services also require a commercial on-line service such as CompuServe to act as a gateway to their Internet servers. But I'd pass on both. StockTracker ($9.95 per month; free during after-market hours) is limited: It provides information only on the U.S. stock market. PointCast Network, although it is free and can put chosen stock prices onto a computer as a ticker-tape screen saver, is weak when it comes to company news searches.<p>Generally, the aforementioned Web sites are not very user-friendly and often fall short of their marketing hype. For the best news-clipping and information screening, check out software programs such as EyeQ and Dow Jones News/Retrieval. These services can cost more than their Internet competitors, but they also provide more -- access to hundreds of publications and sophisticated search capabilities that allow searches arranged by keywords. They provide current market quotes and let users track portfolios. EyeQ costs $39 per month, $12 per connect hour, and $3 per document retrieved; DJNR is $29.95 a month for eight hours of evening and weekend usage.<p>As for stock quotes, true market addicts with big bucks to spend -- who have to know prices right now! -- will want to consider pagers or even (if they're willing to burn thousands of dollars) Quotron and Bloomberg terminals. But folks following the market this closely are probably traders reacting to short-term events, a costly and bad example for the rest of us. <p><p><p>

						June 1996 
Worth magazine/Need To Know<p>WHAT THEY'RE RECOMMENDING<p>This month Al Frank, editor of The Prudent Speculator, joins our panel of financial-newsletter writers. The price listed with each writer's stock pick is the maximum at which the author considers the recommended stock attractive. The newsletter writer may hold the stock either in a personal account or in a fund he manages, and may have changed his opinion after the April 22 publishing deadline.<p>AL FRANK
THE PRUDENT SPECULATOR<p>Looks for undervalued stocks with the potential for long-term appreciation.<p>Read-Rite (Milpitas, California), a leading manufacturer of magnetic recording heads for computer disc drives, is a deal. The stock has fallen more than 60 percent since last September over concerns about a choppy product transition and the announced merger of Seagate Technology and Read-Rite customer Conner Peripherals. Given that Conner represents only 13 percent of Read-Rite's sales and that Seagate plans to continue doing business with the company, I believe the market has overreacted. Trading at less than seven times 12-month trailing earnings and four times cash flow, the stock looks extremely undervalued. My target is $48 a share within three to five years.<p>JIM McCAMANT
MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY STOCK LETTER<p>Focuses primarily on small biotechnology companies.<p>ImmunoGen (Cambridge, Massachusetts) is developing some promising cancer treatments and is a major beneficiary of the FDA's recent decision to accelerate approval of cancer drugs. ImmunoGen's most advanced product, a treatment for B-cell lymphoma called Oncolysin B, is in phase-three trials. The company also has a full pipeline of other cancer treatments in earlier stages of development. ImmunoGen has a collaborative relationship with Harvard's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute for cancer research and will probably enter into a new corporate partnership sometime in the next few months. This would move the stock a lot higher.<p>MICHAEL MURPHY
CALIFORNIA TECHNOLOGY STOCK LETTER<p>Looks for high-growth high-tech companies.<p>Semiconductor-equipment maker Genus (Sunnyvale, California) dominates two markets: It has a 70 percent market share in tungsten chemical-vapor deposition (which puts layers of metal on the silicon chip) and an 80 percent share in high-energy ion deposition (a process that insulates the circuit lines from the underlying wafer). This latter process is used widely for DRAM chips and increasingly for logic chips. The stock has fallen 60 percent from a September high of $15 a share on the fear that DRAM makers will cut back production. On the contrary, Genus should have a strong backlog of orders. Investors have a good shot at doubling their money this year.<p>LOUIS NAVELLIER
MPT REVIEW<p>Uses modern portfolio theory to identify high-return, 
low-volatility stocks.<p>Iomega (Roy, Utah) is in a great niche. The company makes fancy little Zip drives, otherwise known as removable data-storage devices. The stock is a big turnaround play: Earnings turned positive in the third quarter of 1995, and sales grew 287 percent from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. On top of that, profit margins are expanding rapidly. One of the technical indicators I use__institutional accumulation__shows that Wall Street is very keen on the stock. In fact, Hambrecht & Quist, the West Coast investment firm specializing in technology, recently started pushing the stock, and other big firms have since piled in. <p><p><p>

But don't pick just any route: The Detroit trio are consolidating the number of suppliers they use, says Value Line analyst Alex Silverman. This could mean long-term gains for the stocks of those parts makers with the lowest costs, greatest efficiency, and strongest balance sheets, says Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C. J.

						 <p>The goal: nothing less than the call of a lifetime<p>By Clint Willis<p>Imagine for a moment that you bought $10,000 worth of stock in <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> at the company's initial public offering back in March 1986. Imagine you're still holding on to those shares, and they're worth $869,000.<p>Back to reality. You and I didn't do that -- but we could have. By 1986, most of us had heard quite a lot about the ten-year-old wunder-company and its wunderkind founder, Bill Gates. Microsoft's IPO was among the most well publicized in history. And while it was tough for retail investors to get shares at the initial offering price of $21, the stock traded as low as $26 later that first month.
Now, I'm not the sort to mope about these things for more than a decade or so. So I recently set out to find the next Microsoft. By that, I mean the stock that could make me more or less rich if I was willing to bet my kids' college savings -- or, perhaps better, a modest chunk of my Keogh.<p>My plan was cunning yet simple: Talk to investors who bet on Microsoft early and find out what they saw in it. Then ask them and other farsighted money-management types about public companies that share most of the essential qualities that made Microsoft a huge success.<p>Over the course of two months, I made hundreds of telephone calls. Occasionally, I met with opposition. "When people ask me where to find the next Microsoft, I have a tendency to hang up," growled a fund manager who had bought shares at the IPO. For one thing, he noted, Microsoft circa 1986 was far from a sure thing.<p>Poobash, I figured. Why not ask the only venture capitalist in on the deal -- David Marquardt of Technology Venture Investors?
Well, for one thing, he wouldn't return my phone calls.<p>That's okay. If I'd been the only early-stage outside investor in Microsoft, I wouldn't return my calls, either. Anyway, a friend of Marquardt's told me that even Marquardt hadn't been convinced that Gates had a winner. "Marquardt called me and said he wished he could trade his piece of Microsoft for one of my deals," said the friend, also a venture capitalist. "It was an extremely high-risk situation with a very young, hardheaded guy in charge."<p>Undaunted, I tracked down Ruthann Quindlen, who had been 
a software analyst for Alex. Brown & Sons when that company underwrote the Microsoft deal. She's now a partner in the Palo Alto, California, venture-capital firm Institutional Venture Partners. "Microsoft back then was a very different company," she said. "When we took them public, it wasn't clear that their products or market position were going to make them a success."<p>Yet Quindlen and the rest of them must have seen something. I pressed on. A few dozen conversations later and I had a list of three qualities that defined the Microsoft opportunity. Those qualities would guide my search.<p>I didn't expect to find companies that perfectly met my criteria -- but in the end, I think I came surprisingly close in four cases. Along the way I got a half dozen or so highly speculative but extremely interesting stock picks. What's more, I learned about the Bower-Christensen hypothesis, which has something to do with...I forget. Anyway, here are the criteria.<p>The company must be part of an emerging paradigm shift. For those of you who haven't lately read Thomas S. Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, a paradigm shift occurs when people begin to see the world in fundamentally different terms and behave accordingly. Here I use the phrase the way stock pickers use it: to describe a big change that creates markets with opportunities for investors to make lots of money.<p>It's not enough for a market to be big; it must also be new or changing rapidly. "I look for disruptive technologies," said research analyst Brian Fernandez. "They disrupt the old order and create the kind of wide-open anarchy that produces big winners."<p>The <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>-led emergence of the personal computer, which Microsoft rode to success, was that kind of event. A few weeks into my research, I was convinced that similar events were occurring in no fewer than three fields: the Internet, telecommunications, and biotechnology. Ergo, I decided that the next Microsoft would emerge in one of those industries.<p>The company must have at least a quasi-monopoly on an enabling technology. An enabling technology is, very simply, one that allows people to make practical use of new products or systems. Microsoft's enabling technology was the MS-DOS operating system for PCs, which it bought on the cheap from another small Seattle firm in 1980 and then developed at the behest of IBM.<p>That relationship provided Microsoft with a continuing stream of royalties from Big Blue. It also allowed Gates to sell his operating system to other manufacturers, which had quickly come out with clones of IBM's machine. Soon Microsoft had the enviable position it maintains to this day: a de facto monopoly.<p>Take note, however: IBM didn't have to give Gates such a great deal. "He outsmarted them," said Phil Lamoreaux, general partner of the hedge fund Lamoreaux Partners in Sausalito, California. "IBM should have kept control of the operating system, but they still believed the big money was in mainframes."<p>Several people I called argued that something like this could not happen again: No company as powerful as IBM circa 1981 will make such a dumb mistake. But why ever not?<p>The company must capitalize on its monopoly to create new applications for the technology. "Microsoft didn't make its wealth off the operating system," said Roger McNamee, who bought Microsoft shares in 1987 and is now a general partner of Integral Capital Partners in Menlo Park, California. "It used its market position to develop a leadership position in software applications."<p>Gates used his firm's early profits to provide the clunky MS-DOS with a user interface with superior graphics, which he called Windows. Windows required a new generation of software applications -- and Microsoft seized the chance to introduce a raft of new programs that would eventually blow away then market leaders Lotus and Ashton-Tate.<p>A couple other matters are worth mentioning. First, none of 
this would have happened if Gates weren't a brilliant manager. Many people I called argued that the next Microsoft will be run by a genius like him -- one who understands marketing as well as technology and has a gift for lining up the right partners to provide market access and financial support. "Lots of people can catch a wave," Fernandez pointed out, "but most of them get wiped out."<p>Second, size is not a criterion. "Don't confuse small size with risk," Lamoreaux cautioned. "A small company that is in at the early stages of a market is safer than the third- or fourth-best company in a big, mature market."<p>So I was developing an idea of what the next Microsoft would look like. But how much should I pay for it? That's a tough one. Microsoft would have been cheap at almost any price in 1986. The same probably goes for its true heirs among today's small firms. In the end, I decided to give some thought to valuation but not to let 
a high stock price put me off a company that had a shot at a Microsoft-like position in the right market. That's no way to run 
a portfolio of stocks -- Warren Buffett wouldn't approve -- but I'm not running a portfolio. Anyway, Buffett missed Microsoft.<p>Here's the story of my hunt.<p>FIRST STOP, CYBER-SPACE
Not everyone agreed that the Internet would produce the next Microsoft, but many conceded the possibility. "The Internet is the closest thing we have to the PC market in the early '80s, because of the embryonic stage of any commerce done on it," said Lamoreaux. "It will clearly change rapidly in the balance of this century, and there are lots of opportunities for developers and users of technology. The Internet is a global phenomenon, though, not just domestic. Most of Microsoft's business is in the U.S., while the Internet permits global status instantly."<p>But Lamoreaux and others are still debating whether one company can play the role of a Microsoft. Competition is fierce, with banks (Citibank, <a name="NYSE:WFC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11619"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wells Fargo</b></a>), telecommunications companies (<a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>, <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI</b></a>), entertainment firms (<a name="NYSE:TWX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11482"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Time Warner</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Disney</b></a>), and Microsoft itself investing millions of dollars in products and services they hope will give them choke holds on various markets.<p>The most visible battle is the effort to establish a widely accepted platform that consumers will use to interface with the World Wide Web. <a name="NASD:NSCP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42472"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Netscape</b></a> has distributed more than 20 million free copies of its Internet browser in an effort to grab market share. The company has a stunning $4.2 billion in market capitalization. Still, no one knows how Netscape is going to earn its first dollar. I don't think that was ever true of Microsoft.<p>Meanwhile, everyone says the Net is going to make big money for merchants that sell everything from books to bedroom sets to bank accounts. But I won't find the next Microsoft among those sellers, either; the market is too fragmented. Instead, I must look at the middlemen who get paid to make all of those transactions possible.<p>The prime example, ironically, may be a company that Bill Gates tried to buy last year: software manufacturer <a name="NASD:INTU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16001"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intuit</b></a>. At the moment, the firm is best known for its market-dominant personal-finance and tax software, including Quicken. But some of Intuit's biggest fans are more excited about its early lead in the emerging colossus that is the home-banking market.<p>Intuit chairman Scott Cook is widely considered a visionary almost on the order of Gates -- and like Gates, he's known for building relationships with strong allies. As of early 1996, Cook had forged agreements with 37 financial institutions to offer on-line banking services to Quicken customers. That's the largest customer base (more than ten million accounts) with access to such services, and this gives the firm a head start over competitors like Microsoft and <a name="NASD:CKFR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=43345"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CheckFree</b></a>.<p>The firm's highly profitable software business (Intuit is expected to sell $100 million worth of Quicken alone this year) generates plenty of money to build the infrastructure needed to handle millions of financial transactions. Meanwhile, Intuit is increasing its consumer base by offering free software that lets customers establish home banking with participating banks. "They look benign now giving away this banking system," said Roger McNamee. "But once they get everyone on it and it becomes the de facto standard, they're going to make serious money."<p>Most of that money will come from financial institutions, which might pay Intuit as much as $100 for each customer who signs on. And when the network is established, the company can start charging for home banking as well as on-line investing, insurance sales, and the like. <p>I could go on. The analysts I talked to did. But Intuit has a market capitalization of $2 billion and is a company we all know; it almost felt like cheating to stop there. What about smaller outfits?<p>Many of the companies scrambling for a piece of the Net are tiny. It's generally hard to find among them one with a clear shot at a dominant position in a fat niche. Still, a few people mentioned <a name="NASD:CYCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=47308"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CyberCash</b></a>. The firm is building a system by which companies and customers make fast, secure credit-card and checklike or cashlike purchases on the Net. "The potential market is absolutely enormous," said Steven Birer, senior analyst at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco.<p>A report by Killen & Associates, a research firm in Palo Alto, California, claims that the market for electronic commerce and financial services will grow from $369 billion in 1995 to $774 billion by 2000 and $1.6 trillion by 2005. "There doesn't need to be a lot of payment systems on the Internet," said Birer. "One or two will be enough, and CyberCash's could be in that number."<p>A few more phone calls and I found myself agreeing that it's possible. The firm just might end up in a position to charge fees on huge numbers of credit-card and other transactions over the Net.<p>Right now, CyberCash has the best technology. Its products include the first real-time Web-based credit-card payment system, launched about a year ago; this year, the firm will introduce a service that lets consumers keep money in a CyberCash "wallet" and draw from it to pay for purchases over the Net. CyberCash will also roll out what it calls a coin service, which will let consumers make small on-the-spot payments for information and games.<p>What's more, CyberCash has established relationships with banks that process 85 percent of U.S. credit-card transactions. It has forged alliances with dozens of firms (including <a name="NASD:CSRV"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=43062"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CompuServe</b></a>, CheckFree, <a name="NASD:SUNW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14833"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sun Microsystems</b></a>, and Toshiba), making CyberCash software available to more potential users. Consumers can also download free CyberCash software from the firm's Web site (http://www.cybercash.com).<p>CyberCash co-founder and CEO Bill Melton made his name and fortune as the founder of VeriFone, which developed the technology behind those credit-card terminals you run your card through at the grocery store. "Melton's been bringing technology to the financial industry for the past three decades," enthused CyberCash's other founder, marketing vice president Magdalena Yesil. "He understands the dynamics between banks, merchants, and technology."<p>Unlike Intuit -- or Microsoft in its infancy -- CyberCash has yet to earn a profit. The firm raised $40 million by going public this February and now has a market cap of about $325 million. Revenues will grow from $1 million this year to $25 million in 1997, according to Steve Birer's estimate. He figures the firm will earn its first profit in 1998.<p>But how big can CyberCash get? Let's say it earns a fee of 0.01 percent on 20 percent of the $1.6 trillion in projected Internet transactions by 2005. That's revenue of $320 million compared with Microsoft's $5.9 billion this year.<p>INFORMATION, PLEASE
During the past decade or so, companies such as <a name="NASD:COMS"></a><b>3Com</b> and <a name="NYSE:BAY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15419"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bay Networks</b></a> have made fortunes creating computer networks for businesses. Others such as AT&T and <a name="NASD:ERICY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41776"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ericsson</b></a> have expanded their empires to embrace new technologies such as cellular communication.<p>What's left? Plenty, I gather. Venture capitalists and techno types talk of the "wide-area network" -- the sprawling web of communication devices and technologies emerging around the world. The development of that network includes a shift from analog to high-speed digital networks, from regulated monopolies to free global markets, and from wires and cables to wireless delivery of information. "There is a tsunami of change in the telecommunications market," said Gary Morgenthaler of the venture-capital firm Morgenthaler Ventures in Palo Alto and Cleveland. "If you cleverly design a product, you can lead this market."<p>All right, which product? The cable and phone companies will be spending billions of dollars laying the wires, fiber-optic lines, and coaxial cables to get higher-speed lines into homes and businesses. Forget them, I was told; look for the firms that will supply gear that makes those networks work. Makers of high-speed ethernet switches, for example. These switches allow users on a local-area network to exploit the network's full data-transfer capability, or bandwidth. Without the switches, the networks slow down.<p>Switching companies such as <a name="NASD:CSCO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13494"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cisco Systems</b></a> and <a name="NASD:ASND"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41997"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ascend Communications</b></a>, with market caps of $26 billion and $6 
billion, respectively, are already well known to investors. But Lamoreaux mentioned a small firm ($300 million market cap) founded by Shlomo Margalit and Zeev Rav-Noy. This eight-year-old company, <a name="NASD:MRVC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=17187"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MRV Communications</b></a>, makes ethernet switches that run at 100 megabits per second versus the old standard of 10 megabits per second.<p>Aharon Orlansky at Preferred Technology, a New York City brokerage firm, is by all accounts the man to talk to about MRV. Trouble is, he opened our conversation as follows: "First of all, to say that they are the next Microsoft is not true."<p>I hate when that happens. Orlansky indicated that MRV isn't out to dominate data networking in the way that Microsoft dominates software. But before I could hang up, he added that MRV does manufacture the best 100-megabit switches on the market. And it got to that market quickly enough to beat out much bigger competitors like 3Com and Bay Networks. What's more, MRV is a low-cost producer.<p>Great technology and low costs aren't enough to dominate a market these days, but MRV has also taken a page out of the Microsoft manual by cutting a deal to supply switches to industry giant <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>. Now the rest of the industry might think about changing to MRV.<p>There's also MRV's fiber-optic technology, which helps convert electrical power into light for transmission over high-speed fiber-optic cable. Together, the fiber-optic and ethernet switching markets will account for some $6 billion in sales in 1996. Unfortunately, MRV's share of those markets is less than 2 percent. And while that share will probably grow, I concluded that Orlansky was right: MRV is not the next Microsoft.<p>That said, MRV might be a pretty good investment. The company has no debt and $9.1 million in cash. Orlansky figured sales would grow 60 to 100 percent annually over the next three years and hit at least $400 million by 2000. He thought the company could earn $3.50 a share, justifying a stock price of $125.<p>That's a potential return of 290 percent in four years. No Microsoft, but it's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.<p>Two or three dozen phone calls later, I was excited again. I had become a believer in something called consumer computing devices, or CCDs.<p>Got a minute? The shift to wireless communication and digital technology allows more information to be delivered at higher speeds to an increasingly mobile population -- including a lot of people armed with CCDs, which might range from so-called smart phones (phones that handle both voice and data transmissions -- the latter via screens that display faxes, E-mail, that sort of thing) to handheld organizers. "By the end of the decade, half of all cellular phones will be smart phones," said Todd Bakar, an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco.<p>The market for smart phones and organizers will belong to global telecom and hardware companies, just as <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple</b></a>, IBM, and IBM-clone manufacturers dominated the emerging PC market. But like IBM a decade ago, companies like Ericsson and <a name="NYSE:NOK.A"></a><b>Nokia</b> are looking to outside sources for the low-cost, flexible operating systems that will drive their new machines.<p>Enter Geoworks, with its $400 million market cap and <a name="NASD:GSCI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=51257"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>GEOS</b></a> operating system. The 13-year-old company paid its dues during the 1980s and early 1990s, making a low-cost, efficient operating system that didn't use much memory; it was ideal for primitive computers, such as the old Commodore 64. Microsoft ate Geoworks' lunch along with everyone else's.<p>Geoworks founder Brian Dougherty may have the last laugh. He used the company's seemingly outmoded technology as the basis for a new GEOS operating system, which is cheap and flexible enough to allow CCD manufacturers to design their products around it.<p>This time, Geoworks has a serious jump on the competition, which includes Microsoft as well as Apple and General Magic. Analyst Jeffrey Schlesinger of UBS Securities went further, saying that Geoworks' operating system is a de facto standard.<p>That's what I wanted to hear. <p>Geoworks' list of partners includes Ericsson, Nokia, <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a>, Toshiba, Sharp, and other big names. The by-all-accounts-fabulous Hewlett-Packard OmniGo 100 organizer already uses the GEOS operating system, as does the new Nokia 9000 Communicator smart phone.<p>There's more. Microsoft used its operating system as a base to launch a generation of software applications ranging from Microsoft Word to Excel. Likewise, Geoworks is teaming up with its partners to develop applications that will work on the GEOS operating system. "The real story is going to be the applications and add-on products it develops with the equipment makers," said Schlesinger. "It's very similar to the Microsoft model." <p>Moreover, unlike Microsoft in its early days, Geoworks can look to overseas markets. Digital cellular networks already exist in Europe, Asia, and Australia. "Our biggest markets for now are Europe, Japan, and the U.S. -- in that order," said Geoworks CEO Gordon Mayer.<p>I was briefly disappointed to learn that the company was losing money: Schlesinger estimated it would lose $9.2 million in the fiscal year ended March 1996. But the firm has $50 million in the bank, most of it from its public offerings in June 1994 and November 1995 and from equipment manufacturers who are using the product. Gary Morgenthaler figured there would be 100 million wireless-phone subscribers in the U.S. and Canada alone by 2000 (there are now a fourth that many). And it can't be long before the third world goes wireless. "This is the same kind of paradigm shift that Microsoft rode to success," Morgenthaler concluded.<p>I figured I was getting warm again: Someone had said "paradigm."<p>I TAKE THE CURE
"The next Microsoft will almost certainly be a biotechnology company," according to Michael Murphy, editor of California Technology Stock Letter. Murphy warmed to the topic quickly; he said that buying the right biotech stocks now is like investing in <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a> in 1907. He pointed out that the entire biotech industry has a market capitalization of perhaps $65 billion, not much bigger than Microsoft's alone.<p>Trouble is, most biotech companies don't make any money. Exceptions, such as Amgen, whose 1996 revenues Value Line estimates will be $2.2 billion, are no longer cutting edge. The fortunes of the profitless rest are riding on the quirks of human body chemistry and the FDA approval process.<p>That hardly sounds like the Microsoft model. Still, there was a time -- a very brief time -- when Microsoft was unprofitable. And in the past several years, there has been progress toward new types of treatments such as gene therapy, which has enormous potential to attack ailments ranging from cancer to AIDS.<p>Forget the Internet. If they can cure everything, I'm happy to go back to a world of bike couriers and typewriters. But can they? "During the next 5 to 25 years, you're going to see a whole remaking of medicine," insisted Morgenthaler. "This will be a paradigm shift in the way drugs are discovered and applied to diagnosis and treatment."<p>Then I learned that Bill Gates himself is a major investor in biotech. 
"If I had his money, I'd be investing in biotech, too," added my source. "I mean, the Internet won't save him if he needs an organ transplant."<p>Gates is the largest single shareholder in a little gem called <a name="NASD:ICOS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12419"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ICOS</b></a>, which is developing drugs to treat inflammatory conditions like asthma and cardiovascular disease. ICOS founder George Rathmann, who in another life gave Amgen its start, has Gates-like credibility. "People in biotech are always looking for the next <a name="NASD:AMGN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12623"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Amgen</b></a>," said Jacqueline Siegel, an analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York City. "Well, the guy who founded it runs ICOS."<p>ICOS has a broad lineup of potential blockbusters that are currently in clinical trials or in preclinical research. But the company lacks the kind of single unifying technology or product that will force the world to come to it -- nothing ICOS has looks comparable to Microsoft's original operating system. ICOS could become a very big company some day, but it didn't quite fit my model. Reluctantly, I moved on.<p>Another 30 or 40 telephone calls (but who's counting?) and I found what I was looking for: At least a couple of biotech companies are developing strategic positions that will allow them to siphon off large portions of the money that will be made in the biotech industry's biggest markets.<p>Like Microsoft in its early days, San Diego's <a name="NASD:VICL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16150"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vical</b></a> is working on a technology that industry giants will need to create their next generation of products. The giants are huge drug manufacturers, and the products are synthetic genetic materials used to fight disease -- "DNA as drugs" is how Vical's CEO, Alain Schreiber, described them. "Genes in a vial." <p>During the past several years, companies such as Human Genome Sciences in Rockville, Maryland, have been working to decode the human body's gene sequence. So far, HGS has isolated and sequenced more than 850,000 individual genes; it has used that information to develop more than 120 therapeutic protein candidates and 60 novel protein targets for small-molecule-drug discovery.<p>I don't know what that means, do you? They tell me that, for starters, this information can be used to create anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-osteoporosis, and anti-cancer agents. But the biggest winners may turn out to be companies that control the enabling technology that delivers those applications to the human cell.<p>That's where Vical comes in. Murphy and everyone else I asked pointed out that Vical was the leader in two technologies -- naked DNA therapy and cytofectins -- that allow gene therapy without the use of viral delivery systems. "It's not the only approach, but it has the right combination of ecacy, safety, and low cost," said David Stone, an analyst with Cowan & Co. in Boston. "That makes Vical the first gene-therapy company ready for prime time."<p>Companies such as <a name="NASD:SOMA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13635"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Somatix Therapy</b></a> and <a name="NASD:TGEN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42013"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Targeted Genetics</b></a> are working on ways to deliver gene-based therapy. But most of them rely on viruses to transport the genes. "You can't control viruses," said Murphy. "In one study, 10 percent of the virus ended up in the poor mice's testicles. You just can't go into human trials with that kind of unpredictability."<p>I'll say. Anyway, like Gates before him, Alain Schreiber has parlayed his firm's technology into licensing agreements with big companies -- most notably <a name="NYSE:MRK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merck</b></a> and Pasteur Mrieux-Connaught. Those firms make payments to Vical every time a vaccine that uses Vical's technique passes into a new phase of FDA approval. Better yet, Vical will eventually share in the profits from resulting approved vaccines. Like Microsoft, Vical will make money from the delivery system now and profit from specific applications later.<p>Stone figured Vical probably wouldn't earn its first profit until around 1999; that's okay for now because the company has $50 million in cash, and its cash "burn rate" is an exceptionally low $10 million a year.  Schreiber can always do another public stock offering or tap corporate partners for cash -- barring a series of disasters in trials for the firm's therapies.<p>"It's too early to say they've won the race," Stone told me. "But Vical is in the pole position." He figures Vical could go from its current market cap of $212 million to $4 billion or $5 billion in five years and keep growing from there.<p>Then again, it could go out of business without ever earning a nickel.<p>The same goes for <a name="NASD:ISIP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14081"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Isis Pharmaceuticals</b></a>, a Carlsbad, California, company that has emerged as the leader in antisense technology. Like gene therapy, antisense may be useful in attacking a huge range of problems, from inflammatory diseases to cancer; thus, the potential market is almost boundless.<p>"We believe we are building a strong proprietary position in antisense technology, and we believe that that will be an asset of extraordinary value," said Isis chairman and CEO Stanley T. Crooke. At last count, the firm had applied for over 200 patents, with 19 allowed (the last step on the road to issuance) and 19 issued.<p>Better, Isis isn't content to license its technology to other companies. It has agreements with two major partners -- 
a royalty deal with Ciba-Geigy and a 50-50 split of profits with Boehringer Ingelheim. Isis has also struck a deal with Human Genome Sciences; the companies will work together to develop antisense compounds for pharmaceutical companies. <p>By the end of 1996, Isis will have four or five antisense compounds in clinical trials with human subjects. "Isis is clearly going to be the leader in antisense therapy," said Jim McCamant, editor of Medical Technology Stock Letter.<p>Analyst Paul Boni of Mehta and Isaly in New York City figured that Isis will turn its first profit in 2000. Meanwhile, it's running through some $20 million each year; that money comes out of its cash hoard, currently $75 million. It's still 
a small company, with a market cap of about $275 million.<p>Analyst David Stone acknowledged that Isis, like Vical, has a shot at a market cap of $4 billion to $5 billion in the next five years or so. He didn't want to go further and put a market cap on either firm for a decade or two from now, but he did draw an analogy that I liked.<p>"There's another order of magnitude where the big drug companies with market caps of $50 billion or more are today," Stone said. "Companies like Vical and Isis might 
get there."<p>The next Merck? I'll take it.<p>HOME AT LAST
I like every company I've investigated. You could make me happy by giving me stock in any of them. But I started this job with the goal of picking one best bet, so which of these companies has the best shot at delivering Microsoft-like gains over the next decade?<p>Here goes. Intuit is building a strong position in the potentially huge market for home-banking and related services, and has proved that it can make money creating applications to exploit that position further. But we're a bit late on Intuit. CyberCash is a leader in its field now, but I'm not convinced that it can build 
a monopoly; a bigger company may yet swat it aside.<p>Next, telecommunications. MRV's potential market is too small, but Geoworks...I like Geoworks. It feels like Microsoft. The firm's operating system is clearly an emerging standard. Geoworks is working hard to create applications that will work with its operating system, just as Bill Gates did with Microsoft. And smart phones are probably going to be big.<p>But not as big as biotech. That's why in the end I have to vote for Vical or Isis. Both are still small in terms of market cap; both have a strong lead in developing enabling technologies with potentially huge markets.<p>It's a tough choice between the two, but I have the sense that Isis may be better focused on protecting its lead (people at the company talked a lot about patents), and Isis also works harder on developing products whose profits it will largely keep. Then there's the intangible factor: The people at Isis are tremendously excited about what they're doing; they seem to have a vision. "Maybe they're just more excited about making lots of money," suggested a colleague of mine.<p>Well, fine. Isis it is.<p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> THE RETURN OF BIOTECH <p>Jim McCamant thinks the current rally in emerging drug stocks has a long way to run  <p> By Jonathan Butler   <p> Since the first biotechnology company went public in 1980, Jim McCamant has been widely regarded as a leading authority on emerging drug companies. Although the biotechnology "crash" of 1992 has made positive returns hard to come by in recent years, the stocks recommended by McCamants's Medical Technology Stock Letter rose108 percent during 1995. He also contributes each issue to Worth's"What They're Recommending" column.   <p> Worth: Why do you focus on biotechnology? <p>McCamant: It's probably the most inefficient part of the stockmarket. The frustrating thing is that the inefficiencies tend to last years. The cycle's fairly long, and there are few good analysts --  partly because price-to-earnings ratios don't have anything to do with the value of these companies. What matters is the quality of the science and the people.  <p> Biotech stocks last peaked in January 1992. Where are we now in the cycle?  <p>The last cycle, which began in the second quarter of 1987, was four and a half years. What creates bottoms and tops are excesses, and there aren't many excesses now, so I don't think there will be a downturn until 1997.  <p> Has anything changed since the last biotech downturn? <p>There are now more products in the clinical process and late stages of development. In 1992, at the top of the cycle, there were 25 products in trials; now there are around 150.   <p> If price-to-earnings ratios are not useful, how do you value biotech companies?  <p>One clue is, which biotechs are receiving high premiums from their big-company partners? When Isis did a deal with Germany's Boehrin-ger-Ingelheim, it sold stock privately at $15 a share even though Isis stock was trading publicly at less than $6 ashare. The big drug companies have realized that they're not getting much value for their research dollars and that it's more attractive to buy products or marketing rights from a biotech company that already has a technology.  <p> How do you identify good stocks? <p>I look for companies that can produce many applications from a technology. This decreases short-term risk and increases the potential long-term gain. If investors hold on in the bad times,they should be able to make ten to one on the upside over five years.  <p> Any recommendations? <p><a name="NASD:CHIR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12972"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chiron</b></a> is the best managed of the large biotechs. It's reasonably priced and has the broadest product pipeline. I also like three second-tier companies. <a name="NASD:ISIP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14081"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Isis</b></a>is the leader in antisense technology, which turns off the production of disease-causing proteins in the cell. <a name="NASD:LGND"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13469"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ligand</b></a> is developing hormone products.

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> THE DOWRY IN UTILITY MARRIAGES <p>Low-cost producers will profit as takeovers transform once staid electrics  <p> By Anne Field  <p> Mergers aren't just for such glamour industries as media and high-technology anymore. Dull ol' electric utilities are merging at a steady pace five deals were pending in 1995, up from three in 1994, and analysts predict a dozen major marriages over the next 12 to 18 months. Investors won't reap the premiums that came with such high-pro file deals as <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM's</b></a> acquisition of Lotus Development or <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Walt Disney's</b></a> union with ABC/Cap Cities, but investors who pick the right utility can look forward to a 10 to 15 percent rise in the value of their stocks and possibly to a post-acquisition increase in dividends.   <p> The merger of WPL Holdings with two smaller utilities is typical of the current wave of deals. The Madison, Wisconsin, electric company recently acquired two colleagues in Iowa, IES Industries and Interstate Power. When the deal is complete, investors in the two Iowa electrics are likely to get 11 percent and 15 percent premiums for their shares, respectively. More over, the new company, Interstate Energy, may be able to boost dividends as it finds efficiencies of scale. Management expects such savings to total $700 million over ten years.  <p> A combination of slowing demand for electricity and deregulation is driving utilities into one another's arms. Energy-conservation efforts over the past two decades have substantially cut the need for power driving rate increases to a new low in 1994 and created surplus capacity in some regions. At the same time, the laws governing the sale of bulk power have changed to make interregional sales easier. Until 1992, utilities basically had been limited to selling power to wholesalers in their immediate geographic areas. That year, a new law let utilities and independents sell power to any wholesaler anywhere.  <p> More recently, states have begun considering a practice called retail wheeling, which would allow utilities in neighboring states to compete for direct access to big commercial and industrial customers and, perhaps someday, to all consumers. In other words, customers will be able to shop for the cheapest service, rather than have to buy from the local utility. "The business is going through a profound change. In ten years, it will be totally different," says Edward Tirello, an analyst at NatWest Securities.  <p> In this newly competitive environment, low-cost producers of electricity will prosper and grow while high-cost producers will stagger under excessive generating costs. As a result, utilities have been slashing jobs and overhead for the past decade. Now, with much of the easy cost cutting done, they're seeking further reductions through mergers. "By combining with a nearby lower-cost utility, companies can produce operating ef ficiencies through workforce reduction, smarter use of generation and transmission assets, and increased purchasing power for fuel," says Nancy Messer, an analyst with A. G. Edwards & Sons.  <p> Utility investors need to weed out high-cost producers from their portfolios. These tend to be companies that have hefty investments in nuclear power or other expensive new generating plants, or that operate in high-tax states. Both problems plague Long Island Lighting Company in New York, for example, which charges a whopping 15.3 cents per kilowatt hour to generate power. Interstate Energy's regional competitors, such as Commonwealth Edison in Chicago and Centerior in Cleveland, face similar problems; expensive stakes in nuclear power keep these utilities' rates at about 8 cents per kilowatt hour, slightly above the national average of 7.2 cents but about 40 percent higher than Interstate Energy's rate of 5 cents per kilowatt hour.  <p> Investors should hunt for low-cost producers that will be valuable acquisitions either for companies hoping to expand their low-costoperations or for high-cost electric utilities looking to lower the price of generating power. Three promising candidates are <a name="NYSE:ALS"></a><b>Allegheny Power System</b>, headquartered in New York City, <a name="NYSE:OGE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11115"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oklahoma Gas & Electric</b></a> (OG&E) in Oklahoma City, and <a name="NYSE:WPS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11646"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>WPS Resources</b></a> in Green Bay, Wisconsin. All three offered yields close to the industry median of 5.9 percent in mid-December.  <p> Allegheny is a strong, medium-sized player with a market cap of $3.4 billion and 1.3 million customers in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia. The utility has low rates 5.4 cents per kilowatt hour and 12-month trailing earnings of $1.98 a share as of last December. Earnings are projected to increase to $2 a share for the four quarters of 1995 and to $2.03 in 1996. <p> OG&E provides electricity to about 670,000 customers in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. A $1.7 billion company with a low rate of 5.8 cents per kilowatt hour, OG&E earns a 13.3 percent return on equity above the industry norm of 11.5 percent. Like Allegheny, OE&G gets most of its power from older, coal-based facilities and has no investment in nuclear plants. OE&G's trailing 12-month earnings of $3.05 a share should grow thanks to recent cost-cutting measures. A possible merger would also drive up the value of shares. A likely suitor is Western Resources in Kansas, a $2 billion utility that also has low rates and may be looking to expand.  <p> WPS Resources is the holding company that owns Wisconsin Public Service, which supplies electricity to parts of Wisconsin and Michigan. WPL Holdings almost went after WPS, but agreed to acquire the Iowa companies instead. It therefore may be some time before another company starts courting WPS, but in the long term, the utility is a likely merger candidate. With one of the strongest balance sheets of any utility, WPS increased earnings from $2.21 a share in 1994 to $2.30 in 1995, despite recent rate reductions. Earnings are projected to rise to $2.39 a share in 1996. Most important, the company's power costs are just  five cents per kilowatt hour.   <p> Other low-cost producers that would make attractive merger partners are Idaho Power, one of the cheapest providers in the U.S. (just 3.8 cents per kilowatt hour), and Montana Power (4.7 cents). Both would be especially attractive to a high-cost California utility, such as Southern California Edison (10.4 cents per kilowatt hour), or to a utility looking to sell to the California market. Pennsylvania Power & Light, with a 7.2-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate, poses a threat to overpriced utilities in the high-tax New York area.  <p> Investors who are counting on stock gains from takeovers have to be patient. State regulators must approve each merger, a process that usually takes 18 months. Regulators can also nix the deal, so analysts recommend diversifying with a utility mutual fund such as one of Franklin's utility funds or <a name="FUND:FSUTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FSUTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity Select Utilities Growth</b></a> or a basket of about 15 medium-sized companies. Nevertheless, investors can rest assured that the new current of mergers will keep sparks flying in electric utilities for some time to come: NatWest's Tirello expects the number of investor-owned utilities to decline to 40 from 120 during the next  five years.  <p><p><p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> NET-SURFING UPSTREAM <p>There's more certain profit in the companies that make the nuts and bolts of the internet  <p> By Jonathan Butler  <p> In 1995 every stock touched by the Internet turned to gold.<a name="NASD:NSCP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42472"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Netscape Communications</b></a>, which makes a browser to navigate the Net, was  first offered to the public in August at $28 a share; it closed at $161.25 on December 6. A competitor, <a name="NASD:SPYG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42484"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Spyglass</b></a>, recently traded at $110 a share, up from an offering price of $17. The stock prices of Performance Systems International (PSI) and <a name="NASD:UUNT"></a><b>UuNetTechnologies</b> companies that hook individuals up to the Net doubled and tripled, respectively, during the year.  <p> The Internet itself is no fad. The number of users worldwide grew to 38 million at the end of 1994, and is expected to reach 200 million by 1999, according to International Data Corporation. That's a 50 percent annual compound growth rate over the next four years.  <p> But not every company so fervently embraced by investors will grow at that pace. Some, such as Netscape and Spyglass, or UuNet and PSI, are competitors, and they all face challenges from much bigger outfits such as <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>. "It's hard to see what would stop a phone company from offering the same service," says Nick Moore, an analyst at Franklin Funds in San Mateo, California.  <p> Investors who want to pro fit from the Internet phenomenon, but who shudder at paying 538 times projected 1996 earnings the recent price for Netscape for untested companies facing intense competition, should try a time-honored strategy called upstreaming. The term is most commonly applied to vertical industries suchas oil, where refiners the downstream companies that sell to consumers rely on upstream exploration and production companies for their raw materials. With the Internet, upstreaming means concentrating on the more established companies that providethe raw materials the modems, the routers, and the switches of the information superhighway, as opposed to the untested  firms that sell software and access services to consumers. "You don't know whether or not Netscape is going to win, but either way, the equipment companies that are building the actual physical network are going to do well," says John Segrich, an analyst at Gabelli & Co. in Rye, New York.  <p> Modems and modem-like products connect computers to the Internet, and include anything from small, $100-to-$200 modems that sit beside desktop PCs to T1 carriers high-capacity modem-like boxes that cost thousands of dollars a piece.  <p> Two companies currently dominate this business: <a name="NASD:ASND"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41997"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ascend Communications</b></a>and U.S. Robotics. Ascend, based in Alameda, California, thrives on speed. Its Pipeline product uses a form of digital transmission, called ISDN, that is roughly ten times faster than a traditional modem. Pipeline accounts for 25 percent of Ascend's sales, which are growing at a rate of 40 percent a quarter. Ascend also makes a switch used by 28 of the country's top 30 companies that connect users to the Internet such as <a name="NASD:AMER"></a><b>America Online</b> and UuNet.   <p> Analysts expect Ascend's earnings to rise about 75 percent in1996. So it's not surprising that its stock traded at 92 times trailing 12-month earnings as of December and roughly 75 times the median 1996 earnings estimate.  <p> The modems produced by U.S. Robotics, located in Skokie, Illinois, aren't as speedy as Ascend's Pipeline, but U.S. Robotics is closing the gap. It acquired ISDN Systems last August for about $40 million in stock. Earnings at the company are growing at more than 50 percent a year. The stock recently traded at 68 times trailing 12-month earnings and about 35 times the median 1996 earnings estimate.  <p> Once connected to the Internet, users can choose to download (retrieve) or upload (send) information, or exchange electronic-mail messages with other users. All those transactions pass through a server, which oversees connections and the log-ins that identify different users. Diversified computer-makers such as <a name="NASD:SUNW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14833"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sun Microsystems</b></a>,<a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:SGI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11735"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Silicon Graphics</b></a> dominate the server business. <p> Investors can find purer plays in companies that make routers and switches. Routers act as intelligent traffic directors, selecting the best path for information to travel. <a name="NASD:CSCO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13494"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cisco Systems</b></a>,based in San Jose, California, is by far the biggest producer of routers, which account for 90 percent of its sales. Becauseit makes servers and switches as well, Cisco can offer its clients one-stop shopping, says Tyler Smith, manager of the $1.4 billion <a name="FUND:AGBBX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/AGBBX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Alliance Growth B</b></a> fund. As of December, investors could buy Cisco stock for 46 times trailing 12-month earnings and roughly 29 times the median 1996 earnings estimate.  <p> <a name="NYSE:BAY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15419"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bay Networks</b></a> of Santa Clara, California, is a distant but competitive number two in the router market. The company is the result of a 1994 merger between Wellfleet Communications, a maker of routers,and SynOptics Communications, a producer of intelligent hubs, which connect networks. The stock recently traded at 50 times12-month trailing earnings.   <p> One of the ways to increase the capacity and performance of a router-based network is to add a switch. Similar to those used by telephone companies to process the thousands of calls they receive each minute, switches act as liaisons between the modem-type equipment offered by Ascend and U.S. Robotics and the routers provided by Cisco. The nascent Internet switch market, $25 million in sales in 1995, is expected to double in 1996.  <p> <a name="NASD:CSCC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42090"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cascade Communications</b></a>, located in Westford, Massachusetts,is the nation's largest maker of Internet switches, and supplies three out of the four largest service providers. But San Josebased <a name="NASD:STRM"></a><b>StrataCom</b> is biting at its heels. StrataCom's stock trades at 60 times 12-month trailing earnings, and its recent deal to provide CompuServe with $30 million of equipment could signal an important competitive breakthrough, says Tom Pincince at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In an investment area as rich and volatile as the Internet, excitement can be found even far upstream. <p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> MERGERS, MERGERS EVERYWHERE <p>It doesn't take much looking to find more industries ripe for mergers and takeovers  <p> By Anne Field  <p> Investors looking to profit from the current wave of mergers have no shortage of industries to study. Here are some examples:  <p> CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICAL DEVICES  <p><a name="NYSE:JNJ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10824"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Johnson & Johnson's</b></a> bid for Cordis is just part of a wave of acquisitions rolling through the ranks of companies that make medical devices as hospitals and HMOs increasingly demand one-stop shopping. The hottest candidates are companies that make products used to fight heart disease, such as <a name="NASD:TGET"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14840"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Target Therapeutics</b></a>, which sells brain and heart catheters. Over the past four years, Target's annual sales have grown by about 36 percent and its annual earnings by almost 46 percent. Analysts project that earnings for the fiscal year ending March 1996 will hit $1.42 a share, up from $1.02 for  fiscal 1995. <a name="NASD:VNTX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14920"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ventritex</b></a>, a maker of implantable defibrillators, may be another target. It broke into the black in  fiscal 1994 and then saw earnings stall in  fiscal 1995. Analysts are projecting a loss of $1.15 a share for the  fiscal year ending in June 1996. But they also expect a return to profitability in  fiscal 1997 thanks to a next-generation product that could capture as much as 25 percent of the market.  <p>  <p>LIFE INSURANCE  <p>Slowing population growth and increasing competition for consumers' savings are driving mergers in this mature industry. To bolster balance sheets, larger companies are buying small fry that have excess capital. In 1994 and 1995, there were 156 mergers in the industry, valued at more than $24 billion. Some mergers have boosted the stocks of insurance acquirers more than those of takeover targets (a turnabout from the norm). <a name="NYSE:RLR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14912"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ReliaStar Financial</b></a> may be an ongoing example of this. In early 1995, when it bought USLICO, ReliaStar's stock jumped to $40 from $28. ReliaStar has bene fited from USLICO's distribution system and access to the military market, and earnings are projected to hit $4.34 a share for 1995, up from $3.30 a year earlier. Penn Treaty American may be a hot takeover target because it is one of the few pure plays in long-term nursing-care insurance, which, in turn, isone of the fastest-growing segments of the industry. Thanks to its state-of-the-art policy, Penn Treaty has shown 28 percent annual growth in new premium sales for  five years.  <p>  <p>PAPER  <p>This highly cyclical industry has been in an upturn, giving companies strong earnings and abundant cash flow for increasing capacity either by building new plants or buying other companies. Acquisition is cheaper, and as a result, merger activity should remain strong in 1996. <a name="NYSE:CDP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13084"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Consolidated Papers</b></a> is a pure play in coated paper for magazines and brochures, a highly profitable area coveted by bigger players. Earnings per share are estimated at $5.19 for 1995 and $6.97 for 1996. Since <a name="NYSE:MEA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10978"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mead</b></a> sold its Lexis-Nexis business, it has become an attractive target; about 75 percent of its business is in popular coated paper and another product that's in demand coated unbleached craft board used for beverage carriers. Its 1995 earnings should hit $6.18 a share, up from $1.52 in 1994.  <p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> SCOUTING THE WEB <p>Cyberspace holds more financial and business data than you could ever use.  Here's a guide.   <p> By Ted C. Fishman  <p> Six months ago the hydra-headed cyber-thing called the WorldWide Web was best known as a playground for connoisseurs of certain Danish photographs. No more. The Web has rapidly evolved into the most prolific and democratic provider of investment and personal-finance information ever. About 2,000 Web sites offer advice, data, and financial services, and the number grows daily.   <p> Companies of every stripe but particularly high-tech firms  are everywhere, describing their enterprises and their progress,and listing contact persons to boot. The initial public offering of <a name="NASD:NSCP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42472"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Netscape Communications</b></a> (http://www. netscape. com), the most oversubscribed IPO in history, was built on the enthusiasm of Web surfers who discovered its products online.   <p> The Web is a part of the Internet, the global "network of networks." It is less a thing than a mode of communication employing a common technical format. No one owns it, and it's shaped by whoever invents the best tools for navigating its complexities and "authoring" documents on it. Perhaps half a million groups, companies, and individuals today create Web sites (something like text and image slide shows), which increasingly incorporate sounds and special effects as well. RealAudio's site (hhtp://www. realaudio. com),for example, lets you hear the day's business stories from ABC and National Public Radio through your computer.   <p> For investors, there are two primary benefits to this technology: virtually unlimited access to financial data, and a research medium that weaves together disparate sources of information through "hot links" words or phrases highlighted in the text of a site that transport you to other sites with the click of a mouse.   <p> Take a <a name="NYSE:BA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10221"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Boeing</b></a> investor. When, in December, the news hit CNN'sFinancial Network Web site (http:// www.cnnfn.com) that Boeing had resolved its strike, hot links in the story connected audio recordings of statements by union and company officials, background material from CNN and other news services, and Boeing's own Website (http:// www.boeing. com), which includes annual and quarterly reports.   <p> For those concerned with managing the money they already have, there are free government publications, magazines, news services, and information from brokerage and mutual fund companies. For example, the <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab</b></a> site (http:// www. schwab.com) lets investors read about the 300 mutual funds in its Mutual Fund One Source, and National Discount Brokers' (http://pawws.secapl. com/Ndb_phtml/top.shtml) offers online stock trading.   <p> Finally, because one never knows just what lies beyond the next hot link, the Web is terrific for generating investing ideas through sheer serendipity. The problem is that it can be bewildering to navigate, so it helps to have a reliable guide, at least until you get your sea legs. So we scouted out some sites that will save you time, and maybe money. Good hunting!  <p> ON-RAMPS FOR THE CYBER-SAVVY  <p> CNNfn, The Financial Network http://cnnfn.com  Dow Jones Business Information Services http://dowvision. wais. net  Reuters NewMediahttp://beta.yahoo.com/headlines/ current/business/summary.html <p> These are the best of the business news sites, and all are free. Reuters and CNNfn usually have more breaking news, while Dow Jones puts sections of The Wall Street Journal online. The paper is free, and stories about the companies covered in the news are linked to background information in Dow Jones's databases. CNNfn is allied with Nexis-Lexis, the leading electronic archive of newpapers and magazines, which allows users to search for previous stories on current topics. The Nexis-Lexis databaseis also available separately; it's exhaustive and expensive.  <p> American Stock Exchange http://www.amex.com  Chicago Mercantile Exchange http://www.cme.com  MarketPlex of the Chicago Board of Trade http://www. cbot.com/mplex.htm  <p> Most of the world's major financial exchanges have a presence on the Web (excluding the New York Stock Exchange). These three set the standard, providing information ranging from statistics, to basic educational materials on stocks, futures, and other derivatives, to quotes on their contracts, some of which are delayed. The Board of Trade and the Merc sites supply agricultural statistics on grains and livestock, as well as links to the government and news agencies that collect them.  <p> GNN Personal Finance Center http://gnn.com/gnn/GNNhome.html PR Newswire http://www.prnewswire. com/cnoc/prnewswire.html <p> GNN, the Internet-only off shoot of giant <a name="NASD:AMER"></a><b>America Online</b>, has one of the best-laid-out sites, and its personal finance areas are among the liveliest on the Web. Recent articles include "The Bag Lady Syndrome," on the fear of poverty felt by many financially secure women. GNN also tracks 30 or so of the new finance-related sites that spring up every week. PR Newswire has long been the world's primary outlet for corporate public relations, posting press releases in quantity, from companies large and small. Thisis public relations, mind you, not journalism, but it's still a good place to see what's on the front burner at the companies and industries you watch.   <p> Briefing by Charter Media, Inc. http://www.briefing.com  University of Michigan Gopher Site gopher://una.hh. lib. umich.edu:70/00/ebb/indicators/ei.txt <p> Data heaven. Both sites offer summaries of virtually every economic indicator under the sun, and then some. Briefing charges for some of its stuff. The University of Michigan site, though not technically a Web site, is accessible from the Web and free. <p> Quicken Financial Network http:/ www. intuit.com/quicken  <p> <a name="NASD:INTU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16001"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intuit</b></a>'s latest release of its Quicken personal-finance software is designed specifically to take advantage of the Quicken Financial Network and comes bundled with a customized version of Netscape's Web-navigating software that will take you right to the siteand let you browse it for free. For $9.95 a month, users get seven free hours of Internet access, one of the cheapest Webon-ramp deals. The Quicken site, like the software, includes tools to help you balance your books and keep your tax records up-to-date. It also supports online banking, with links to major banks. The Network is linked to a sister service for mutual fund investors, which mantains detailed ratings, price histories, and analyses of more than 5,000 funds, plus free access to the databases of Morningstar Mutual Funds, the premier ratings service. <p> Insurance News Network http://www. insure. com  Quotesmith Corporation http://www.insure.com/Quotesmith  <p> Insurance News Network offers reliable news, ratings, consumer information, and statistics on the insurance industry. Recent postings summarized crash tests on popular cars. INN also provides Standard & Poor's Insurance Ratings and Insurer Reports, a good resource to determine if your insurer can and will pay out when you need it. Quotesmith offers free and confidential price-comparison charts for term life insurance.  <p> Securities and Exchange Commission http://www.sec.gov  <p> Find out if that cold call came from a broker with the wrong kind of record. The SEC site lists every enforcement action the agency takes. It also holds the largest online repository of corporate information, the EDGAR Database. EDGAR includes the statements companies must file with the SEC whenever they take actions that could affect their stocks.  <p> Internal Revenue Service http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/ bureaus/irs/irs.html <p> An assortment of resources is available for the beleaguered taxpayer, including copies of every form and instructions on filing (electronically if you like) and getting help. If browsing here is too much fun, try checking the tax tables.  <p> Debt Counselors of America http://shops.net/ shops/ GET_OUT_OF_DEBT TRW Information Services http:// www.trw.com/iss/isdiv.html <p> Debt Counselors of America is a not-for-profit organization for those with credit and money-management problems. Its site offers software to help people sort out their affairs, details on credit and money scams, and advice on debt consolidation. TRW, the nation's largest credit-reporting service, gives a straight forward account of how it compiles its reports, as well as instructions for reviewing credit records and correcting them if necessary. <p> PAWWS Financial Network http://pawws.secapl.com  Quote.Comhttp://www.quote.com  MIT StockMaster http:// www.ai.mit.edu/stocks.html <p> PAWWS and QuoteCom provide current price quotes on stocks and other instruments for less than it costs to subscribe to dedicated quote vendors. Both services offer delayed quotes for free. Prices vary, depending on the services ordered, but $50 buys a package of information that exceeds most individual investor's needs, including a large variety of reports and stock ratings.

Go for speed, a modem no slower than 28,800 baud  per second (28.8 bps). Good ones begin at $100. Most computer stores stock several browsers, the Web-navigating software. The granddaddy of them all is Mosaic, but the overwhelming choice at the moment is Netscape. A good alternative, especially for beginners, is to join a commercial online service, such as America Online, CompuServe, or Prodigy, all of which include Web access and browsers with membership. GNN (800-819-6112), a division of America Online, offers a suite of Internet applications, including an excellent Web browser and a very stable phone link, for $14.95 a month. <p> Another option is the all-in-one Internet software suite. WorldWide Web Kit from Ventana (with Netscape) and Quarterdeck's Internet Suite (with Mosaic and additional applications, including electronic mail) are both relatively bug-free and cost about $40. For Windows 95 users, Delrina's CommSuite 95, at $180, integrates a set of Internet programs and a modem fax program. <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> bundlesits Internet Explorer browser for Windows 95 with Plus Pack for Windows 95. Explorer can also be downloaded for free off Microsoft's electronic bulletin board or off its Web site (http// www. microsoft.com). Microsoft's new online service, Microsoft Network, will also connect you to the web.  <p> Once you're online, your browser will show a box near its top for typing in Web page addresses, called Universal Resource Locators. The address line is unforgiving, so enter URLs exactly. A good place to start is Netscape's site (http://home. netscape. com).The Netscape home (or opening) page gives you several ways to search by topics and key words across the Web.   <p><p><p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> THE NEW LANDSCAPE IN TELECOM <p>Deregulation will redivide the industry, creating secure investments as well as short-term growth plays  <p> By Jonathan Butler  <p> In 1984, the justice department forced American Telephone & Telegraph to relinquish its decades-old reign as Ma Bell, our regulated telephone monopoly. <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a> kept its long-distance business but spun off  local service into seven regional Baby Bells. New long-distance providers sprang up, and a blizzard of novel services (from call waiting to high-speed phone lines for data) appeared. The so-called communications revolution was underway, creating a $400 billion global telecom market--which analysts say could grow to $1 trillion in the next ten years.   <p> Now the revolution is about to enter a new phase as Congress designs a Telecommunications Reform bill that will further deregulate the industry. While many of the particulars remain unsettled, the bill's main thrust is in place: to open up local phone service--a market that generates $60 billion in revenue annually and was here to fore the sole preserve of the Baby Bells--to competition. The bill will virtually erase the lines between providers of long-distance telephone, local telephone, cable-TV, and cellular-phone services.  <p> For investors, this means a new playing field. Here's a look at how the major combatants stack up:  <p> AT&T, MCI, AND SPRINT  <p> The big three long-distance firms--AT&T, <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:FON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11560"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>SPRINT</b></a>--now control some 85 percent of the $65 billion long-distance business, a strength they can leverage as they try to enter into local phone markets.   <p> AT&T undoubtedly will profit from its recent decision to split into three parts. It will spin off a laggard computer business, which lost over $500 million this year, and divest its equipment-making arm, which will remove any conflict of interest AT&T has in selling products to rivals. AT&T also became the nation's largest cellular provider by acquiring McCaw Cellular and LIN Broadcasting. Its cellular revenues, which are growing at 30 percent, are expected to hit $3 billion this year. AT&T is the "classic stock that investors ought to be focusing on at this point," says Stuart Conrad of C. J. Lawrence.  <p> MCI has chosen a different route. In September, it paid $190 million for Nationwide Cellular, which buys time on cellular networks at a discount and resells it to consumers. This "lets MCI participate in wireless without making the investment in building a big network," says Bill Deatherage, an analyst at <a name="NYSE:BSC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10191"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bear Stearns</b></a>. MCI used the money it saved on a network to buy a computer database integrator, SHL System house, for $1 billion.This could give MCI an edge by enabling it to design software-based communications systems tailored to client specifications.  <p> The long-distance market share of third-place Sprint has been stuck at 10 percent since 1989. Sprint  has teamed up with three cable companies, Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast, and Cox Cable, to buy $2.1 billion in licenses for personal communications services (wireless phone systems that are very similar to cellular) in 29 U.S. markets. Sprint's plan is to offer a package of local and long-distance calling, cable, and wireless to 10 million homes by 1997.   <p> Will Sprint get bought by a Baby Bell? Perhaps so. The resulting company would be a formidable rival. If this happens, "AT&T and MCI would have to focus on keeping market share in long distance and would have less money to compete for local markets," says Oscar Castro, who manages the <a name="FUND:MNGCX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MNGCX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Montgomery Global Telecommunications Fund</b></a>.  <p> Sprint stock is relatively cheap, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 14, compared with MCI at 18 and AT&T at 20. Since the last two should maintain annual earnings growth in the mid-teens for the next five to ten years, analysts say these stocks are not too expensive.  <p> <a name="NYSE:BLS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10200"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>BELLSOUTH</b></a>, US WEST, AND <a name="NYSE:SBC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11379"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>SBC</b></a>    <p> Deregulation will be a shock to the Baby Bells. They'll lose their exclusive rights to two major sources of revenue: the access charges long-distance companies pay for local hook-ups, and the fees customers pay for calls outside a 12-mile local area but within a Bell's region. These two sources provide about 45 percent of the Bells' revenues.  <p> Three Bells that have already diversified beyond local service are US West, BellSouth, and SBC Communications (formerly Southwestern Bell). BellSouth made early cellular investments in Australia, Latin America, and Germany (where it owns 20 percent of the national license). Its markets include over 50 million potential foreign customers. In addition, BellSouth, benefiting from the housing boom in the Southeast, is expanding its domestic network 50 percent faster than any other Bell.   <p> BellSouth shares are attractive in the low $70s, says Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette analyst Timothy Weller. He thinks the stock could rise to $82 a share in the near term. He also expects earnings to grow 10 percent annually in the next five years.   <p> Colorado-based US West is also remaking itself, with cellular ventures in Russia and Malaysia and a 50 percent stake in Mercury One-2-One, a British wireless company. At home, US West owns 25 percent of cable giant <a name="NYSE:TWX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11482"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Time Warner Entertainment</b></a> and recently began a Midwest test of a system that will allow viewers to selectany video at any time.   <p> Texas-based SBC now derives 35 percent of its profits from nontraditional sources. It owns a 10 percent stake in Telfonos de Mxico and offers directory services in Australia. It also owns two cable stations in Washington, D.C., and one in New York, as well as cable operations in Great Britain.  <p> Experience in the deregulated British telecom market has prepared US West and SBC for a deregulated U.S. market. "They've already been doing there what they will be facing in the U.S.," says Castro.  <p> <a name="NYSE:NYN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11044"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>NYNEX</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:BEL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10197"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>BELL ATLANTIC</b></a>, PACTEL, AND <a name="NYSE:AIT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10094"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AMERITECH</b></a>  <p> The most vulnerable Bells may be NYNEX (New York), Bell Atlantic (Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia), PacTel (Los Angeles and San Francisco), and Ameritech (Chicago). All four rely heavily on revenues from large cities--just the markets the long-distance giants are expected to target. PacTel, in particular, will have trouble sustaining a 7.1 percent dividend yield (versus 4.6 percent for all Bells) in the face of state deregulation in 1996. Any company can then buy PacTel's calling time wholesale and resell it to PacTel customers. Ameritech has an added liability: It has stayed overly focused on its local business instead of diversifying like other Bells.  <p> <a name="NASD:WCOM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15160"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>WORLDCOM</b></a> AND <a name="NYSE:FRO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11281"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>FRONTIER</b></a>  <p> The beneficiaries of deregulation may include smaller long-distance companies such as WorldCom and Frontier, both of which have outpaced their larger rivals by exploiting the $20 billion small-business market, a segment that is growing at an annual rate of 15 percent. <p> WorldCom, based in Jackson, Mississippi, is the fourth-largest long-distance provider. Its price-to-earnings ratio is 50 percent higher than the average for AT&T, MCI, and Sprint, but its earnings are also growing roughly twice as fast as the majors'. WorldCom "derives less than 5 percent of revenues from the hotly contested residential markets," says Weller. And analysts think the Bells will be more likely to buy bulk long-distance time from WorldCom than from the Big Three, their direct competitors.    <p> Frontier, formerly Rochester Telephone, is now equal parts long-distance and local-service provider. The company is now threatened by the clout of AT&T, which invaded its home turf in January 1995. Frontier lost only 2 percentage points of market share, but pressure from AT&T could drive it into an alliance with a Baby Bell, says Michael Mahoney, manager of <a name="FUND:GTTBX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/GTTBX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>GT Global Telecommunications Fund</b></a> in San Francisco.  <p> <a name="NYSE:ATI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16964"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AIRTOUCH</b></a> AND <a name="NASD:VCELA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15058"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>VANGUARD</b></a><p> Only 10 percent of the U.S. population currently subscribes to cellular phone service--leaving plenty of room for the 40 percent annual growth that analysts project over the next decade. Smaller cellular firms can still compete effectively in this environment, or they could be acquired by cash-rich Bells.  <p> AirTouch, recently spun off from PacTel, competes in the California market, but it has the second-largest share of the German wireless business and owns a piece of Japan's exploding cellular market. In all, its licenses cover 80 million potential users globally, including 35 million in the U.S.   <p> AirTouch is an unlikely takeover target, given its $14 billion size and complex overseas alliances. But its share price should rise as investors realize its international potential, says Mahoney: "I don't think its value is understood by the market."    <p> Vanguard Cellular, by contrast, may be taken over by Bell Atlantic or NYNEX. The company, operating under the brand name CellularOne, serves some 7.5 million people in 35 metropolitan markets on the East Coast. Its markets are secure for now because they are not densely populated enough to be invaded by PCS companies.   <p> <a name="NYSE:NOK.A"></a><b>NOKIA</b>, <a name="NASD:ERICY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41776"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ERICSSON</b></a>, AND <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MOTOROLA</b></a>  <p> Manufacturers serving the big telecom companies will flourish. Developing countries are clamoring for phone and video networks, especially cellular, which is easier and cheaper to install than wired systems.  <p> The biggest cellular equipment makers are Ericsson, Nokia, and Motorola. Of the three, Nokia is "by far the most attractive when you compare valuation to growth," says GT Global's Mahoney. With 20 percent of the worldwide equipment market (versus Ericsson's 40 percent and Motorola's 20), Nokia has been growing at an average of 25 percent a year for the past five years. Yet it is selling at only 15 times his estimated 1996 earnings, says Mahoney, versus 22 for Ericsson and 18 for Motorola. Then of course there is AT&T's equipment division, which is slated to go on its own next year. With global sales of $16 billion and the top spot in the U.S.market, its future is bright. By 2002, its total revenues could surpass those of the original Ma Bell monopoly back in 1983. <p><p><p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> FUND BRIEFS  <p> Do This Now  <p> Investors who made big mutual fund profits outside of IRAs, 401Ks, and other tax-deferred accounts in 1995 should call their funds now for estimates of their capital-gains distributions. This year's market rally will make distributions larger than usual. The $3.8 billion <a name="FUND:BRWIX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BRWIX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Brandywine Fund</b></a> expects to distribute a sizable 12 percent of its share price. Jim Hillman, a tax consultant with Coopers & Lybrand, says investors can reduce their liability on these gains by selling their losing funds. Muni shares boughtjust before the 1994 bond crash are good candidates to balance out 1995 gains. Investors can repurchase similar funds after the new year.  <p>  <p>Wellington Stable  <p> When Vincent Bajakian died in a small-plane crash on September 24, Vanguard/Wellington balanced fund, the nation's 13th largest, lost its manager of 23 years. In the two weeks following, the fund's share price dipped but assets grew slightly, to $11.7 billion. Wellington's interim manager, Ernst von Metzsch will probably become permanent, says Dan Wiener, editor of The Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors. Von Metzsch, 55, had assisted on the fund before taking over the $532 million <a name="FUND:VGENX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VGENX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vanguard Specialized Energy</b></a>, where he earned an average annual 12.2 percent a year over the past ten years. <p><p>

						You could say these venture capitalists are building a new economy, funding the high-tech dreams that will transform our society. Theyd say you were underestimating them.<p>By Donald Katz<p>Embedded in a carefully bricked roadway in the center of the 16-acre arsenal for Silicon Valley money called 3000 Sand Hill Road, there sits a burnished brass disk engraved with an image of the sun. The Copernican implications are entirely appropriate to the moment and place, for in the northern California corridor of innovation that stretches from San Jose to Marin, Sand Hill Road is recognized as the haunt of a special class of capital, a supercharged pool of money, and an elite fraternity of individuals who direct its creative powers.<p>A huge redwood sign near the sun disk lists the names of money firms--Bessemer Venture Partners, Institutional Venture Partners, New Enterprise Associates, Oak Investment Partners, Sequoia Capital--that mean nothing at all to any number of ace stock pickers and Wall Street bankers. The Sand Hill Road financiers are venture capitalists who live in something of an underground, an invisible economy of entrepreneurial risk that has spawned many of the most dynamic, innovative, and wealth-producing corporations of the post-World War II era. The VCs occupy a realm of extreme risks and extravagant rewards. It is a tribal world predicated on the aggressive ethos of the hunt--a hunt, as the godfather figure of American venture capital, Arthur Rock, once said, for entrepreneurial dreamers possessed of the potential to change the world.<p>In a good year, a talented partnership of venture capitalists can create 40 or 60 percent profits for investors in their venture-capital fund. A home run in venture-capital parlance might mean that a million-dollar investment in the infancy of a commercial endeavor grows into a stake worth tens or hundreds of millions within a couple of years. <p>The powerhouse VC firm Sequoia Capital, manned by only eight full-time partners, invested from a few hundred thousand dollars to no more than $7 million in some 32 different young companies that went public over the past ten years. When Sequoia, located on the second floor of building four at 3000 Sand Hill in the small, affluent town of Menlo Park, placed its original bets on the companies, the enterprises were little more than the fervid aspirations of young entrepreneurs. Only a few of the companies Sequoia helped fund had anything like revenues when the money was dispensed. Few of them had fleshed-out management teams or fully developed products. Some of them didnt even have offices or completed business plans.<p>But by the late fall of 1995, the combined market value of the public companies Sequoia helped calve--names such as <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple Computer</b></a>, <a name="NASD:AVID"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15999"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Avid Technology</b></a>, <a name="NASD:CSCO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13494"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cisco Systems</b></a>, <a name="NASD:ERTS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14059"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Electronic Arts</b></a>, <a name="NASD:ORCL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14337"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oracle Systems</b></a>, and <a name="NASD:COMS"></a><b>3Com</b>--had ballooned to more than $75 billion, and that figure doesnt include the wealth spun off as the fast-growing companies ascended. The number doesnt tell of the many dozens of other Sequoia-bred companies now operating as divisions of large corporations, of the tens of thousands of jobs created by the many start-ups, or of the innumerable inventions offered up in the process that have helped create new markets for other companies seeded by other VC firms. Nor does it reflect the significant number of Sequoia technology companies that went belly-up since the pioneering venture-capital firm was founded in 1972--total failure being as much part of the venture-capital experience as mythic levels of success.<p>Professional venture capitalists invest $4 billion annually in some 3,000 nascent enterprises. That pales before the more than $400 billion in annual capital expenditures by American corporations, and before the fact that a million new businesses have been launched annually into the American entrepreneurial carnival in recent years. Yet of the more than 600 new companies added to the Nasdaq public market lists over the past five years, more than 400 were in some part spawned through the auspices of professional venture capitalists.<p>A few thousand venture-capital pros, most of them concentrated in a few hundred tiny VC firms, have quietly ridden herd on an essential macroeconomic process: Wealth generated by the mass-production- and natural-resource-based empires of the industrial age has been transferred to enterprises, entrepreneurs, and investors creating an era of information sciences, of electronic machines and the garage-based child-entrepreneurs who are already American legends. The best VCs and their companies become extraordinarily wealthy. But their labor, the VCs will say, is less about the simple pursuit of profit than it is about helping the very civilization transform from the old to the new.<p>A dense veil of mystique and folklore surrounds the seasoned venturers who helped create the entrepreneurial petri dish of Silicon Valley. Donald Valentine, the 63-year-old founder of Sequoia Capital, is particularly decorated by mythos. There are rich tales of his volcanic boardroom proclamations and of young entrepreneurs (sometimes the stories have a salesman or a journalist) becoming so intimidated by Valentines exacting personal style that they pass out on the table (or throw up or burst into tears). This apocrypha is more than matched by the verifiable stories of Valentine making himself, his stable of young genius-entrepreneurs, and many investors in his VC funds extremely rich.<p>It was Valentine who rolled $1.8 million worth of venturers dice before the young techies looking to expand a company called Cisco Systems in 1987. As every technology entrepreneur in northern California or along the silicon corridor of Route 128 in Massachusetts can tell you in some detail, Cisco went public only three years later. If Sequoia had held its ownership in Cisco Systems--instead of dispersing shares from the initial public offering, per VC tradition, to investors who fed the Sequoia fund from which Cisco was seeded--Valentine would control Cisco assets worth $4 billion.<p>Back in 1977, Valentine wrote a check in support of the entrepreneurial aspirations of an aggressive local kid named Steven Jobs, who looked for all the world like Ho Chi Minh, as Valentine recalls it. Jobs would build Apple Computer with the aid of Sequoia money and advice. Valentine also helped guide the founders of Atari, the first company to make computer-based games. He supported a networking company called 3Com, which has become so large and successful that the corporation recently purchased the right to put its name on the former Candlestick Park. The San Francisco Giants and 49ers now play in 3Com Park.<p>The superstar IPO of 1993, <a name="NASD:MCHP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16015"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microchip Technology</b></a>, was another Sequoia-fed corporation, and in this case Valentine and most of his seven partners have held on to the roughly 20 percent of the IPO shares they claimed as payment for their money and services. Microchip was recently valued at 45-X, as the VCs say, 45 times Sequoias original cost. A mere 4-X return, the quadrupling of an investment over three or four years, is a ho-hum performance along Sand Hill Road.<p>A study conducted by Venture Economics, one of the leading quantitative market trackers of the introverted VC trade, indicates that only 7 percent of VC investment accounts for 60 percent of profits. Another study reveals that six of ten companies financed by venture firms go bankrupt. Thats a startling strikeout average, offset by the amazing size of the home runs a successful venture portfolio can produce.<p>There are four buildings here at 3000 Sand Hill, Don Valentine once noted. In these four buildings theres a billion dollars cash. Now, Im not sure how many good ideas exist in Silicon Valley, or on the planet. But a billion can finance them all. The problem isnt money; its the scarcity of good ideas.<p>This place, Valentine declared one recent afternoon, waving one hand toward the sunshine outside his office window, is the center of the universe. The entire venture industry puts but $3 billion or $4 billion to work in a good year. Its nothing compared to the value of trades made in the public markets inside a morning, but money is not the essential point. That we happen to start companies that have come to dominate the Nasdaq is not the point either. Its a footnote, Valentine declared, leaning into each word across the table, staring hard. Its but an amusing anecdotal footnote to the important history being made. People come and ask what I do, and I say Im in the business of building companies. I build companies. Thats what I do.<p>Valentine has short, iron-gray hair swept up and back in a way reminiscent of union officials of the bygone industrial age, or of precapitalist Russian physicists. His corner office is decorated with LeRoy Neiman originals and all sorts of framed stock certificates and other venturing mementos displayed like trophies won in over 23 years of big-game pursuits.<p>Valentine actually hails from New York City, but friends and colleagues know that the ultimate Silicon patriot prefers not to talk about life before he was delivered unto the cauldron of creation, as he puts it, that was northern California in 1955. Valentine learned about hypertrophic technology businesses as one of the tough-guy, whiskey-after-work scientists and executives who jockeyed the postwar electronics industry from vacuum-tube systems to transistors to the brilliant application of tiny circuits on one side of a thin wafer of silicon. Valentine was present when the integrated-circuit guys started calling the power-packed silicon slices chips.<p>Valentine rose to prominence as a marketing strategist at Fairchild Semiconductor and then worked at <a name="NYSE:STK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11407"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>National Semiconductor</b></a>. He began investing small amounts of his own money in the aspirations of some of the customers who bought chips, local techies for the most part, young wizards fresh out of engineering departments.<p>I watched how those young businesses ran or were unable to run, and I thought about why some of them succeeded, Valentine says. To this day, my education as a venture capitalist comes from close observation of what happens to the management teams we fund, from these highly disciplined yet disobedient visionaries.<p>As young scientists began pouring out of Stanford and Berkeley (and the universities clustered in Boston, the other capital of technology venture capitalism), Valentine set up Sequoia as a kind of boot camp for a variety of young geniuses forming a new California subculture of technologist-entrepreneurs. A young ex-Apple Computer whiz named Trip Hawkins was given an office inside Sequoia for months while he wrote a business plan that described the pioneering computer-game company Electronic Arts. Hawkins--who recently founded the high-profile video game-machine venture called 3DO--went on to make tens of millions of dollars when Electronic Arts went public in 1989, and Valentine reaped 20-fold returns for his investors early $1 million stake.<p>Don Valentine is one of the most influential people in my life, Hawkins says now. He helped me grow up as a businessman. If you cant survive the hazing Don puts you through, then you certainly cant survive the crap that comes your way as a company CEO. Even now, I wear Don Valentine in my brain. Sometimes I sense that a new idea must be crushed and people must be sent away to get their shit together--so I simply turn into Don.<p>At the beginning it isnt easy, Hawkins says. When I was writing the Electronic Arts business plan at 3000 Sand Hill, Don took me to his golf club for lunch. If I wanted to run your company, he said to me, why in the world would I need you? He basically announced, We are about to start a relationship in which I will savagely beat you. If you roll over, Don teaches, you wont be successful. Hes kind of like the professor in the movie The Paper Chase. But its hard. Entrepreneurs come from optimism. Don does not come from optimism. Hes the yang to the entrepreneurs yin.<p>Valentine is known for listening quietly to highly produced sound and light shows illustrating the glorious future of a new start-up. At the end of the presentations, he will often look at the young entrepreneur and impassively say, Who cares?<p>I happen to thrive on the precision of Dons language, says David OBrien, speaking in early October on the day after lantec, the chip company of which he serves as CEO, went public on the Nasdaq market. Don is the chairman of our board, and while I know his style intimidates some people, there is never any fuzzy thinking. He has a model in his head for a good company in each of a dozen technology markets, and his goal is to get his companies to fit the model. If hes tough on entrepreneurs, dont forget this is Silicon Valley and there are a lot of techies out here with brilliant ideas that dont include a clue about running a company.<p>Sequoia Partners considers commercial propositions from 2,000 entrepreneurs each year, and from that group perhaps a dozen dreamers are invited inside to be funded and connected to experts and advised. In the process Don Valentine and his partners seek to discern or create the toughness required to build an enterprise. The partners will help a young company develop basic strategy, find key managers, and help forge strategic alliances. Many of the pros within the venture pack have been entrepreneurs and company operators themselves, and all of them have extensive contacts and access to resources. So much legwork is involved in the launching of a young technology business that each of Sequoias eight partners handles no more than four or five companies at a time. In exchange for the connections, cash, counsel, and instant credibility, Sequoia and the other firms will often attain 10 to 25 percent of the company (in privately held shares), along with a seat on the board of directors. Valentine sits on five different boards, is the vice-chairman of Cisco Systems, and is the honorific, nonoperating chairman of the boards of <a name="NASD:CUBE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=17270"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>C-Cube Microsystems</b></a>, <a name="NASD:NTAP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=47100"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Network Appliance</b></a>, and <a name="NASD:ELNT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=44548"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>lantec</b></a>.<p>VCs assess a business plan in terms of risk: market risk, technology-development risk, and management risk. But in truth, the evaluation isnt particularly scientific, Valentine says. Theres nothing scientific about investing in science. Its intuitive. We make a judgment about when we think the science is going to really happen, and we intuitively make a judgment about what were willing to pay.<p>For the two or three days after a business plan is judged worthy of investment, Valentine and his people dicker with an entrepreneur about the current value of future dreams. Thats the only time we want to be adversaries, Valentine says. The entrepreneur is usually presented with a term sheet and illustrations that show the radically enhanced value of the founders hundreds and thousands of freshly minted shares as the company moves through subsequent fundings toward the public marketplace. If some company-creators do turn their heads to the right side of the spreadsheet and the millions of dollars worth of equity that might come with success--this, despite the fact that capitalists, who have participated in the subsequent rounds of financing a fast-growing business requires, might by then own 60 to 90 percent of the company--then most of them focus on the cash needed to make their business grow. Certainly the ones worth betting on do.<p>Once the money is in hand, many entrepreneurs find that the involvement of a seasoned VC pro can be intimidating as well as helpful. Valentines corporate children talk of the monthly specter of their own financial reports coming back with telltale markings from Valentines famous green pen. <p>Trip Hawkins once looked at an early Electronic Arts financial statement on which the operating loss for the month and the borrowing power and cash left on hand were all circled in green. TWO MONTHS LEFT was scrawled across the bottom of the document. But by then, Don had instilled a toughness and a sense of resolve that helped us solve our operating problems and succeed, Hawkins says.<p>When venture capitalists lose faith in an entrepreneurs ability to solve his or her own problems, they will often move in to change a management team or even force the sale of a company. Venture firms draw their capital from sources that must reap rewards within seven to ten years, the preordained life span of the typical venture fund. The timetable leads critics of the industry and disaffected entrepreneurs to contend that some rushed IPOs and sales of companies--and tossed-out managements--are often the result of VC greed or inappropriate expediencies. To spurned entrepreneurs, VCs can be vulture capitalists, financial predators who hide behind a rhetorical wall of altruism and camaraderie. Even amid wealth and success, entrepreneurs will characterize their VCs as necessary evils. They are so glamorous and beautiful at first and deadly like Catherine Deneuve in The Hunger, says one software entrepreneur.<p>In 1976, only a year after Don Valentine funded the young computer scientists behind <a name="AMEX:ATC"></a><b>Atari</b>, arguably the first high-technology company to connect the American obsession with new modes of entertainment to the computer--and certainly a pioneer of what has become a $6 billion computer and video-game industry--he pushed the Atari founders into selling out to Warner Communications. The sale of Atari brought $28 million, $15 million of which went to founder Nolan Bushnell. Valentine quadrupled his grub stake in the process. Atari was able to gallop from $50 million in sales to $2 billion in just five years. But the company quickly followed an Icarian path to extreme success and failure; Atari has virtually disappeared. And thats all people remember, Valentine growls. Atari was one of the great Silicon Valley companies. They only remember that after the sale it fell apart.<p>A typical Sand Hill Road venture fund might include $100 million or $300 million that the partners apportion to a portfolio of young companies. The venture funds are usually designed to be liquefied after seven or ten years, though most partnerships distribute realized profits as takeovers and IPOs occur. <p>One of the interesting ironies of the venture-capital world is that despite the intimacy and hands-on involvement of the VCs, the pros are almost never playing with a lot of their own money. The investment funds hail almost exclusively from the coffers of pension funds and other tax-exempt entities, which invest via a legal provision that allows nonprofits to apportion 5 percent of their portfolios to alternative investments.<p>These are extremely illiquid assets, Valentine says. Rich people would love to invest with us, but rich people die and get divorced. Then liquidity becomes an issue. And with a divorce, I might have some nightmare wifes lawyer on my back trying to force something to happen. Forget it. Its not worth it. Tax-exempt money is a simple solution to a potential problem.<p>Which is not to say that a tremendous level of personal reward doesnt ride on the long-range bets of individual VCs. The way a venture partnership splits up the take is a subject of much secrecy and conjecture, but most partners admit that the carry, or carried interest, that the partnership gleans from profits, comes in at around 20 to 25 percent of returns. The payouts of companies that go public are usually in stock, and in many cases the shares continue to soar. The partnership also collects management fees of 2 to 3 percent of a funds total equity. In the case of some of the recently accrued VC megafunds, such as the $600 million VC fund run by Summit Partners in Boston, a small number of partners are splitting many millions of dollars just for coming to work.<p>The wealth, paternal power, and glamour accruing to high-profile VCs have created a discernible new category of economic superstar. In Menlo Park and San Jose, citizens speak easily of founders stock and carried interest and deal flow. If yet another gearhead is about to relocate from a dorm room at Stanford to one of the biggest houses in Palo Alto, then local chat will carry the news. They talk easily about the comparative IRR (internal rate of return) reaped by various venture firms and trade tidbits about KP (the powerhouse Sand Hill firm of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers). Local gossip also includes news of VCs who--though their levels of conspicuous consumption pale before that of the entrepreneurs they support--have been known to have their fine cars flown to places they want to visit. There is talk of $15 million yachts and of a $16 million VC house built in the image of a Loire chateau. In many ways its like a little Amish community, notes the young Sequoia partner Michael Moritz. But the horse and buggy happens to be a Mercedes 500SL. <p>A glance at the recent eco- nomic history of Silicon Valley reveals a fascinating combination of capital, entrepreneurial impatience, and cutting-edge science. Specialized technology law firms, research think tanks, prototype fabrication plants, and a public full of early adopter citizens fit to test new devices all grew up to join the technology VCs and entrepreneurs. The universities served up new human and technical feeder stock by the academic quarter, and young techies from other parts of the country surged into town. Silicon Valley quickly became a test tube for entrepreneurial creative destruction as young teams of techies constantly bailed out of established companies to start their own enterprises. At least ten new companies were formed by alumni of <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a> alone between 1980 and 1982.<p>By 1982, just before the cynosure of heroic capital switched back to Wall Street and the buyout kings, LBO lords, and other Masters of the Universe, young students of money everywhere wanted to grow up to be Valley-style VCs. From the viewpoint of the venture-pack pros, amateur money and talent then flooded the field and drove up the all-important cost of entering deals. Though individual technology entrepreneurs like Bill Gates achieved unprecedented wealth during the 1980s--and <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>, <a name="NASD:SUNW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14833"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sun Microsystems</b></a>, Oracle, <a name="NASD:ADBE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12518"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Adobe Systems</b></a>, <a name="NASD:ADSK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12689"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Autodesk</b></a>, and <a name="NASD:NOVL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14287"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Novell</b></a> all went public in the same 12-month period in 1985 and 1986--the yearly returns of venture funds dipped embarrassingly close to single-digit levels. <p>The really inept people came in as late stage or mezzanine investors, Valentine says. They bought into companies between the early-stage investments we do and the public markets, but they didnt recognize that late-stage venture investing means finding companies with revenues and profits. They werent able to do the hands-on stuff we do, and after a while they went away.<p>The down market for the VCs continued until 1992, though the pack sent more than 150 new companies into the realm of public-market investors each year. By 1994 the boom was on again, and new funds were turning away money.<p>The soaring tech-company stock prices of early and mid-1995 are indications of fundamental economic shifts that have been going on for some time. One of the few academics who looks closely at the venture community, William Wetzel of the Center for Venture Research at the University of New Hampshires Whittemore School of Business, contends that there are currently some 80,000 American companies growing by a factor of 50 percent per annum and 300,000 companies growing at around 20 percent per year.<p>There is no way that these elevated growth levels can be sustained with a companys internal cash flow, Wetzel says. The new dominance of this technology-based, entrepreneurial economy harks back to 1979--a moment that will someday be recalled in the way we speak of the dawn of the industrial revolution. That was the year the payrolls of the largest Fortune 500 industrial companies peaked. Since then those payrolls have dropped by over 25 percent to less than 25 million jobs. At the same time an ostensibly invisible and unmeasured realm of the economy occupied by the high-growth, knowledge-based or technology-based ventures of entrepreneurs has accounted for over 24 million new jobs.<p>The action, Don Valentine says, his low voice growing passionate, is right here. Route 280. California! The gold vein of entrepreneurialism. People come right here from the Far East to ask how its done. They come from Europe to try to study whats happened here. But they just dont have our visionary entrepreneurs. And they dont have people with the vision necessary to provide the money.<p>Donald Valentine will reside within the pantheon of Silicon Valley heroes whether or not he continues to finance and pummel young entrepreneurs. Valentine has accrued much more than $100 million from his years of venturing. He allows himself a rambling garage full of vintage cars and one of those astronomically expensive memberships at a Pebble Beach club down the coast in Carmel. But he works long hours in an office appointed with used furniture and a lot of college-dorm-wall art. His aggressive, no-bullshit style belies a charming social presence and active interests in the San Francisco Symphony and Italian art. Valentine once traveled on sabbatical to Florence, where he immersed himself in the world of the Renaissance.<p>The younger partners at Sequoia say that when news of a hot young company in need of funds comes into the office, Valentine is the first to hear the fire bells and hit the north-south racetrack of a highway that is Interstate 280. He still loves to punch holes in slick presentations offered by guys in power suits, referring to their mothers and pastors and showing slides.<p>Valentine stands out from many of the other statesmen of venture capitalism in that he doesnt analyze the potential of a nascent company by focusing on the entrepreneur. Much as they might study the minutiae of a business plan, most VCs ultimate rely on the mantra of Arthur Rock: People, people, people, said Rock, a former New York banker who financed technology start-ups like Teledyne and <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>. In the classic Rock model, it all comes down to the entrepreneurs.<p>Valentine focuses not on the guy, as the genius under consideration is often called in VC circles, but on the potential marketplace for an idea. These companies are nonanalyzable, he says. So you try to spend a lot of time with them, and you do a lot of checking on them. But if they dont have a great market, I dont care who they are, they will fail. The dream team with a crummy market will eventually fail. So we go with a viable market. A market is analyzable. People are not.<p>And besides, Valentine adds matter-of-factly, you can always replace the guy.<p>Kicking the original guys out of the companies theyve dreamed up--separating parent from child--is a VC practice that disenfranchised entrepreneurs liken to the family-splitting slave auctions of yore. Management purges loom as a fear of every entrepreneur, though some surveys indicate that nine of ten founding managements of successful companies remain in place for the whole ride.<p>Don Valentine remains extremely loyal to the entrepreneurs he has helped. Good luck, he wrote to the deposed Apple founder, Steve Jobs, when Jobs unveiled his NeXT Computer. Then in a reference to the Apple executive who deposed Jobs, he concluded: Stick it in [John] Sculleys ear.<p>But Valentine also seems to think that once a young entrepreneur has achieved success and fame, an element of the original fire is lost. After Apple hit, he says, Steve Jobs began wearing Armani and having lunch with Jerry Brown. He even got an apartment on Central Park. I dont finance guys who have lunch with Jerry Brown and have apartments 3,000 miles away. I want a guy who doesnt even know who the president is, someone driven to a single agenda, to 15-hour days and six-day weeks.<p>When Jobs sought support for his NeXT project, Sequoia turned him down. And when Trip Hawkins came in to see Valentine about helping create 3DO, Valentine turned him down too. Hawkins came in to see his former mentor wearing an outfit that included an elaborate insignia over the breast pocket. Why, Trip, Valentine said to his rich and famous former tutee. I see youve acquired a family crest. <p>The generational distance between venture-pack kingpins like Valentine and the young entrepreneurs he likes to help in business is replicated up and down the Valley by a generational gap inside the VC firms. In some outfits, the transfer of the mantle has gone smoothly, but three first-line Valley firms--including the powerful Merrill, Pickard, Anderson & Eyre partnership--have moved to disband because of internal intergenerational conflict, some of it having to do with the splits on the all-essential carry.<p>Michael Moritz works in the office next to Don Valentines. Moritz is a 41-year-old Oxford-educated Welshman who worked at the San Francisco office of Time after business school. This was 1981 and one of those periodic moments when East Coast publishers wanted a lot of news about Silicon Valley, Moritz says. So I began cruising Interstate 280, and I met the Valley people. I met Tom Perkins of Kleiner Perkins, and I met Don. A few years later I came back to him when I knew it was time for me to make a change.<p>Moritz had come to believe that it was the very small and aggressive companies that would inherit the future, not the traditional behemoths of media and publishing (where the entrepreneurs have been dead for two generations) or even the huge technology corporations. The moribund companies went into a blind panic over not understanding what theyve got to do to be in their business in the world of tomorrow, Moritz says. They stumbled all over themselves like drunken corporals.<p>Moritz says he wanted to be a part of the technology-born grand transition instead of just covering it. Last year he brought $80 million back to Sequoia from three portfolio companies going public (<a name="NASD:FLEXF"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=46895"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Flextronics International</b></a>, <a name="NASD:GVIL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16980"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Global Village Communication</b></a>, and <a name="NASD:SDTI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42534"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Security Dynamics</b></a>) and was listed ninth in a ranking of top VCs under 40.<p>Valentine bristles at the suggestion that he has served as a mentor to Moritz (Nah, he says, the mentors are the companies), but Moritz seems to have internalized Valentines axioms. Compared to starting a company, Moritz says, what I do is easy street. The heavy lifting in this industry is not done on Sand Hill Road. Its done in Sunnyvale and Santa Clara and all sorts of other gorgeous spots within area code 408.<p>Among the eight Sequoia partners, there is a Welshman, an Englishman, a Frenchman, and an Italian. All of them have come to be Silicon patriots. All of them believe the viability of markets supersedes the vision of the guy.<p>Don happens to be very thoughtful about the generational issues inside venture firms, Moritz says. Hes watched guys in the business who are 15 years older than he overstay their time and become ponderous and repetitive--telling stories about the 70s and all. Perhaps Don is staving off mortality and staying young by continuing as he does, but like other powerful and vital people around the Valley, he still thrives on the intellectual energy you find. There is just such a rush you can get from being involved with young people who have got great plans and ambitions and are prepared to break down walls by force of energy and ideas.<p>On a late autumn Monday, 40 miles north of the sunny placidity of Sand Hill Road and just a bit south of 3Com Park and the San Francisco airport, various leaders of the local and nonlocal venture pack gather at a hotel to listen to presentations by entrepreneurs and compare notes. The name tags at the Technologic Partners Digital Media Outlook gathering bear gigantic Californiate first names--CHAD, GAYLE--with minuscule last names printed underneath, but there are far fewer overt techies in the crowd than can usually be observed at industry conclaves. The belting-leather attach cases outnumber the canvas bags with laptops by 50 to 1.<p>Jim Clark, the former Silicon Graphics entrepreneur and instant paper half-billionaire by virtue of his 9,720,000 founders shares in Netscape Communications, the highest-profile IPO of 1995, mingles with partners from Kleiner Perkins, whose early, seven-figure contribution to Netscape was now worth some $225 million. Also present is Scott Cook, the former Procter & Gamble brand manager who became another rich Valley entrepreneur through the early-80s start-up of Intuit, maker of the ubiquitous Quicken line of personal-finance software.<p>Few of the VCs in the crowd seem excited by the stock markets technology issues exhilarations of late, a run that, as they talk, has taken the general technology-sector issues up 46 percent and the semiconductor stocks up 75 percent for the year. The VCs prefer to focus on the tiny glimmers of companies to come that might deliver 10-, 15-, and 100-fold appreciations within the biblical seven-year, or ten-year, time horizons venturers prefer. <p>The kids from Yahoo!, an Internet indexing service capitalized entirely from Michael Moritzs Sequoia portfolio, are on the conference agenda. So are Yahoo!s competitors from Lycos (funded by CMG@Ventures). Another company, founded by six Stanford kid-entrepreneurs, developers of yet another system of indexing and navigating the digital tower of babble that the Internet has become--Architext is the name of their company--have chosen to rent a room where selected invitees can play with a software demo. According to the estimates of VentureOne, a VC-pack tracking firm in San Francisco, VCs invested $42 million in Internet companies in 1994--this, it should be said, is a world in which hardly any company has figured out how to reap substantive revenue. In just the first half of 1995, the figure reached $68 million. <p>Between 20-minute presentation sessions, the gifted new-wave technology investor Roger McNamee stands near a gigantic bowl of potato chips reading messages from his alphanumeric pager with one hand and holding a cellular phone to his ear with the other. McNamee receives a hundred messages on his pager during a busy day, the missives ranging from flash reports of large moves in some of his considerable stock holdings to family news from his brother. McNamees PowerBook contains close to 140 megabytes of E-mail messages that include queries from journalists, messages from bankers in Hong Kong, queries from Kleiner Perkins, and a steady influx of data related to his Rotisserie baseball team.<p>McNamee, who resembles a preppy investment banker gone digital and running hard on speed, attends more than 25 technology conferences and 20 industry trade shows inside a year. Wired, the digital-scene feature magazine also born of Silicon Valley start-up funds, has referred to McNamee as his holiness, and another business magazine described him as techs top investor and a venture capitalist--the latter of which, by all conventional definitions, McNamee is not.<p>From 1988 to 1991, McNamee ran the T. Rowe Price Science & Technology mutual fund well enough to offer a 100 percent return to investors who stuck by the fund. Four years ago he raised $104 million through a Wall Street bank and moved to Sand Hill Road to disperse his Integral Capital Partners investment fund as a sort of hybrid of a technology mutual fund and a venture-capital fund. Though hes pulled a loser or two into his two portfolios since moving west (a second fund of $126 million was launched in 1994), the huge winners he bought into before they went public--Intel, MapInfo, Spectrum HoloByte, Alantec, Flextronics ... his list goes on for quite a while--have contributed to stunning gains for his investors. The total value of the two Integral funds stands at $450 million.<p>We are venture-like, but the venture guys are different because they help create businesses from raw clay, McNamee says. We evaluate business plans, but we dont help create them. What I might do every so often is go to a private company thats doing well and try to get the founders to sell me stock. I offer to help educate them about the process of going public. Thats what I did with Intuit. The venture guys take tremendous risks early on. We try to cherry-pick the best companies later in their life cycle.<p>But what were doing is also a lot different from what they do back on Wall Street, McNamee continues. Wall Street has a really hard time understanding technology. Economic cycles and interest-rate cycles might be well-related to automobiles and banks--but if you look at the thousands of tech companies in the public markets, there are technical issues, tremendous rates of change, and all sorts of other things that call for a micro-focus.<p>The success of the Integral Capital Partners funds is indicative of the latest wave of financial concentration in the later stages of the high-growth-company life cycle. Later investments tend to be larger, and if they work, the returns come back much faster. Though venture funds have raised more money this year than ever, the early-stage outlays and seedings have not kept pace with later-stage investment.<p>The lower end of the venture food chain, likewise, has seen the emergence of a new breed--a crop of venturing angels, often baby-boom-aged entrepreneurs with $10 million or $20 million or $50 million to their names. The army of Microsoft millionaires alone, former senior employees of the Bellevue, Washington, company whose vested Microsoft stock option shares have made many of them extremely rich, has fueled an ongoing explosion of Seattle-area software start-ups.<p>By some estimates there are a quarter-million angels now investing in more than 30,000 start-ups every year. They tend to invest much less than a million dollars at a crack, but according to Jeffrey Sohl, director of the Center for Venture Research, angels put out $10 billion in venture capital a year-- more than double the capital invested by professional VCs.<p>At the Digital Media conference, several angels move in and out of the circles of entrepreneurs and Sand Hill stars. I built a computer-reselling business called Morris Decision Systems to $40 million in sales before I sold it to Businessland in 1986, says a Boston-based angel named Anthony Morris. I thought about becoming a VC, but I thought it would be more exciting to do private seeding deals. I do two a year. Ive funded nine companies, and four were acquired in 1993 and 1994. One more should be taken over within the next few weeks. The truth is, Ive earned a higher rate of return as an angel than I did selling my company.<p>Many of the more skilled and successful angels are drafted as new partners of VC firms. Observers of the early-stage investment scene often note an irony in the fact that many of the wealthy young angels are one-time entrepreneurs who were themselves nurtured by professional VCs. What I love about this recent surging of angels, notes one Boston-based VC pro at the conference, is that it turns entrepreneurs into venture guys, the very thing they all love to say they hate.<p>The love-hate relationship between the entrepreneurs and their VCs defines one of the more emotionally charged junctures within the business culture. After completing his presentation to a room full of venturers at the Digital Media conference and being assured anonymity, one entrepreneur backed by several leading firms said, Sometimes I sit with them and I think, Who the hell are they to judge me! A lot of them are a bunch of God-damned M.B.A.s who think theyre rock stars. If you dont act greedy enough, they dont want you. All they want you to do is optimize their values and sell out as quickly as you can.<p>A harsh critique of VCs is easy to come by in the world of company-builders, and even more so among the would-be company builders VCs refuse to fund. Though mutual nondisparagement agreements are invariably signed when VCs and other members of a board of directors remove managers, the venomous stories emerge quickly.<p>As soon as an enterprise falters, saiys one veteran Bay Area entrepreneur, the human side can disappear in an instant and you are left to see that in the end, capital rules.<p>Don Valentine took his board chairmans seat with Elantec, the company that went public in October, after Sequoia moved to replace the founder in charge. At the launch of the company, the technologist had focused on the military market for lantecs analog chips. Sequoia wanted him to move into the commercial realm. When he couldnt or didnt do that, a new manager was brought in to pursue the business plan.<p>The only thing worse than having to work to replace the original entrepreneurs, when that is required, Michael Moritz says, is the specter of letting them stay on.<p>What often happens is that the true visionary gets bogged down in the comparatively boring day-to-day work of an ongoing concern, Valentine says. But lets face it. Creating companies is not an act of altruism. This is a world where people believe in Ayn Rands virtue of selfishness. This is all about creative destruction. Thats the stuff that makes it work. And when it stops working that way, then this business will stop working, too.<p>There are VCs who indeed resemble bankers motivated by expediency or greed or ego. But there are also many underground capitalists who labor at their venturing as a calling instead of a job. The economic and cultural transformations born of technological innovation have profoundly changed the course of contemporary life. And though they may be as famous as film stars only within certain elite circles of entrepreneurial finance, the best of the VCs can say they were there at the creation.<p>The amazing thing is that people ask why I want to continue doing this, Don Valentine said before heading off to Scotland to golf and visit some companies hed heard about. I can be a student forever. Imagine the chance to discover and work with the most creative minds on the planet. Imagine the possibility of discovering a new Steven Spielberg six or seven times each year.<p>I honestly believe the people I work with know the future. I sit with them and I can see the world in the next century. Of all the things someone can do in the world, I cannot think of anything more important and exciting than that. All the best dreams in the world are right here. This is the modern world in the making. This is the true frontier. <p><p>

						January 1996--Special Issue <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> THE BUILDING BLOCKS <p>Here's the outlook, sector by sector, for the industries that propel the economy  <p> By John Koten   <p> The U.S. economy will do better in the coming year than most economic prognosticators expect. According to Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter out of Sedona, Arizona, the consensus prediction among economists is that the gross domestic product will grow 2.5 percent in 1996--a forecast that, coincidentally or not, is the same as the White House's. Wall Street likewise believes that 2.5 percent is the Federal Reserve Board's target. While the experts may be paying homage to the Fed's prowess under Alan Greenspan, they may also be underestimating what he has in mind. After surveying the major U.S. industries reviewed below--and second-guessing the Fed ourselves--Worth believes that the domestic economy will achieve at least 3 percent growth in this election year. Only 3 of the Blue Chip's 52 economists are more optimistic. In this case, though, we don't mind being so near the top.  <p> HEAVY MACHINERY <p>Frank Manfredi, editor of the industry newsletter Machinery Outlook, forecasts a 7 percent decline in unit sales for construction-equipment makers in 1996. Still, Steven Colbert of Prudential Securities in San Francisco predicts that <a name="NYSE:CAT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10304"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Caterpillar</b></a>'s earnings will rise to $5.65 a share in 1996 from an estimated $5.40 a share in 1995. The silver lining in the sector is agricultural and farm equipment. Crop prices in countries like China, Taiwan, and Japan have risen in 1995, benefiting farmers who are in turn buying new machines. <a name="NYSE:CSE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42141"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Case</b></a>, spun off in June 1994 from <a name="NYSE:TEN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11455"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tenneco</b></a>, is a particular favorite among analysts. Its stock price shot up 80 percent in the first ten months of 1995.   <p> DEFENSE <p>The revenue outlook for the defense sector is the same as 1995--flat, or even down moderately, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Pierre Chao. Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Lior Bregman believes that "revenues will stabilize in 1996 after years of decline."That may be good for the bottom line. "After 45 years of gluttony, defense businesses have become cost-driven and have to answer to the same market pressures as everyone else," says Chao. "They've been doing that through unparalleled consolidations." Indeed, despite large cuts in overall U.S. spending every year since1990, the sector has improved its profitability by 470 percent in five years. This includes gains by companies formerly guilty of commercial diversification that have since hewed to the straight and narrow, such as <a name="NYSE:LMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10903"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lockheed</b></a> (profits up 216 percent in five years) and <a name="NYSE:GD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10633"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Dynamics</b></a> (up 540 percent). Since General Dynamics shed its electronics group and Cessna aircraft, it has been averitable cash-generating dynamo. Improved efficiency at <a name="NYSE:MD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10975"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonnell Douglas</b></a> undoubtedly made it a more attractive potential merger candidate for <a name="NYSE:BA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10221"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Boeing</b></a>.  <p> Although some still see commercialization as a potential positive for the industry, Chao hotly disputes that. "I vehemently disagree with the idea that diversification is good for the companies in this industry," he says. "To quote Norm Augustine [the president of Lockheed Martin],  Defense companies have a record unblemished by success outside the industry.'"  <p> FINANCIAL SERVICES <p>As a group, banks, thrifts, insurance providers, mutual fund companies, and stock brokerages are as healthy as they've ever been, thanks to declining interest rates, a rising stock market, increased merger and acquisition activity, and a strong market for initial public offerings. In the first three quarters of1995 alone, bank-industry earnings reached an estimated $36.3 billion--a record. Jim Coons, chief economist of Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio, predicts another record year in 1996. <p> Restructuring and consolidation will remain a major theme. According to the American Bankers Association, there were 329 bank consolidations in the first half of 1995--involving 18 of the 50 largest banks--compared with 550 for all of 1994. Analysts expect this  activity to spill over to the insurance and mutual fund businesses as well. Henry Dickson, an analyst at Smith Barney, suggests that investors steer toward banks that are buying back stock and have good dividend yields and sustainable earnings growth.  <p> PHARMACEUTICALS <p>Joseph Riccardo, an analyst at <a name="NYSE:BSC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10191"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bear Stearns</b></a>, believes the revenues of this sector will grow at a rate of between 9 percent and 10 percent in 1996 and that the trend toward mergers and other forms of consolidation will continue. A shortening of the period required for federal approval of new products has also helped stir this industry, though pricing pressures remain. "The case for the drug industry's improving earnings growth relative to the S&P 500 has been solidified," writes <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> analyst Margo Vignola. "We estimate a 9 percent gain in 1995, a 12 percent gain in 1996, [and] a 13 percent gain in 1997."   <p> By the last week of September, most major stocks in the sector had reached 12-month highs and were trading above their historic price-to-earnings valuations. But Riccardo believes pharmaceutical stocks remain underowned and  undervalued, making them a reasonably safe place for  defensive investors in 1996.   <p> RETAILING <p>"Right now, retail doesn't look good, particularly in apparel," says Karen Sack, an analyst at Standard & Poor's. "Nineteen ninety-six doesn't look too promising either." The problem is pretty straight forward: too many stores chasing too few customers. Expect retail Darwinism to be the theme of 1996 and beyond. "We expect mass consolidation," says Richard Baum, vice president of investment research at Goldman,Sachs. "Investors should be playing the powerful companies that will absorb the weaker ones." Baum advises avoiding companies with high levels of debt.   <p> One surprising bright spot is <a name="NYSE:S"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11338"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sears, Roebuck</b></a>, which has been posting increases in same-store sales of late. Steven Schuster at First Manhattan notes that Sears's stock is selling at only12 times next year's projected earnings. "You'll make money if you buy Sears," he says. "It's guaranteed." William Julian at Lehman Brothers says, "People are spending less, and when they do spend, it's on items for the home or products that have a specific use." His favorite pick: <a name="NASD:BBBY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14933"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bed Bath & Beyond</b></a>, which sells better housewares and home furnishings at a discount.   <p> AGRICULTURE <p>Responding to higher prices and crop shortfalls in 1995, both domestically and abroad, farmers will increase their planting in 1996--good news for companies that supply farmers with seed, chemicals, and equipment.  <p> "Farmers are in a buying mood," says Richard Elam, an investment analyst at Everen Securities, who predicts that 81 million acres of corn will be planted in 1996, up from 71.3 million in 1995." A big corn year is coming," he says, "and corn benefits fertilizer companies even more than soy." Bigger yields will benefit suffering agricultural processors such as <a name="NYSE:CAG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10388"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ConAgra</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:ADM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10124"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Archer Daniels Midland</b></a>, too, though Elam believes they're not likely to see relief from high commodity prices until mid summer.  <p> BIOTECH <p>The biotech sector, which rises and falls with the success of new product launches, has been boosted by streamlined  approval procedures at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and by reduced concerns over the enforceability of biotech patents. The revenue outlook is positive as the sector continues a climb out of the doldrums that began in 1994, when a dozen different product launches failed outright or failed to meet lofty expectations.   <p> J. Kevin Buchi, vice president of finance at Cephalon, a West Chester, Pennsylvania-based maker of therapeutic products for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease, thinks the biggest challenge facing the sector is financing the seven-to-nine-year period required to launch a new product. He predicts that mature companies with broad lines will have few problems obtaining adequate backing but that newer companies may face a shortage of funds. He doubts health care reform will have much of an impact on the sector--still a tiny fraction of the overall health care industry. <p> R. Brandon Fradd, an analyst at Montgomery Securities, recommends that potential biotech investors "wait until the last two weeks of December, to avoid profit taking and benefit from the January effect." Biotech stocks remain prone to big price swings: According to the biotech analyst report from Montgomery, the volatility of the average biotech stock is eight times greater than that of the S&P 100.  <p> HEALTH SERVICES <p>Health care spending is now growing 10 percent annually--a rate that may very well decline if congressional Republicans succeed in reforming Medicare and Medicaid. Clifford Hewitt, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., says a growth rate of 7 percent to 8 percent would be "enough to sustain most of the companies in the sector." But he adds that many weaker companies would be in trouble if the 6 percent rate the Republicans seek is reached. "There's no end in sight to pressures on cost containment," says Cliff Hotte, chief executive of Health Management Inc., a Long Island sub-acute care provider. "I think we're moving inexorably along a continuum of care, from acute to sub-acute to the community setting."  <p> HMOs, however, should continue to do well regardless of what happens in Congress. "We're witnessing a total conversion from fee-for-service to one in which providers are rewarded for holding down costs," says Hewitt. His favorite HMOs are <a name="NASD:OXHP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15344"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oxford Health Plans</b></a> and <a name="NASD:PHSYA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14364"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PacifiCare Health Systems</b></a>. Kurt von Emster, the manager of the <a name="FUND:FKGHX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FKGHX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Franklin Global Health Care fund</b></a>, believes the best-run HMOs will build on 1995's 30 percent revenue growth and that earnings could rise at an even higher rate in 1996.  <p> Hospital stocks have remained in a kind of suspended animation, as investors await the outcome of health care reform. Says Hewitt: "People over react to news of legislation because the effects are so difficult to quantify."  <p> HOME BUILDING <p>Home-building stocks kept pace with the broad market in 1995--meaning a better than average year for the industry. This is a cyclical business that typically does well during the early part of an economic expansion, not late in the cycle. Still, says Sam Stovall, editor of Standard & Poor's Industry Reports, home-building stocks could be a good buy for the next few months because they are still trading below their historic price-to-earnings ratio average of 19.5.  <p> Low mortgage rates have helped to boost home sales and pare down high inventories. Stanley Duobinis, economist with the National Association of Home Builders, says this has paved the way for a 3.7 percent growth in the new housing market for 1996. The nation's largest single-family-home builder is Dallas-based <a name="NYSE:CTX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10308"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Centex Corp.</b></a>, with $3.27 billion in fiscal 1995 revenues. In the third quarter, its orders were up 21 percent from the year-earlier period. Pulte, the country's second largest home builder, saw its third-quarter orders shoot up 48 percent.   <p> TELECOMMUNICATIONS  <p>Watch for a scramble in the major telecommunications segments--local, long-distance, wireless, and cable--following the passage of the federal telecom legislation. The bill will allow the local companies to compete in long distance and long-distance companies in local.  <p>The long-distance giants have the advantage of existing nationwide networks and powerful name brands. The big question for them, though, is whether they can make any money in the local markets. They can buy bulk local access from the Baby Bells and resell it to customers, but the margins in the few places where this has already happened are very slim. The long-distance guys can also bypass the Baby Bells in the big cities, where competitive access providers like <a name="NASD:MFST"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16208"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MFS Communications</b></a> and <a name="AMEX:ICG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15924"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intelcom Group</b></a> have set up networks in high-density business areas. Or the long-distance players can build their own networks, which is hugely expensive. Meanwhile, a Baby Bell that wants to get into the long-distance market can expect the four major long-distance carriers to bid for its business. Perhaps the Baby Bells' biggest obstacle is that they aren't used to operating in a competitive environment. Still, it's not a zero-sum game: With the pie getting bigger, there doesn't necessarily have to be a lot of losers.   <p> A third telecommunications group is wireless, which includes cellular and personal-communications providers. These companies' revenues are increasing at more than 35 percent a year. With only 10 percent of the U.S. population currently subscribing, there's plenty of room to keep growing. Cable companies also are attempting to secure a chunk of the market. These outfits have the advantage of already having routes into the home, but their wires are one-way, so they'll have to spend a lot of time and money upgrading.   <p> FOOD <p>The fierce competitiveness of a mature industry with little room for domestic growth has made it difficult for food companies to offset the high costs of raw materials (including paper forpackaging) by raising prices. As a result of these and other factors, many companies have restructured in the past 18 months. This positions the industry well for 1996, according to John M. O'Neil, an analyst at Oppenheimer. Lower commodity costs would, of course, amplify this benefit.  <p> Some industry analysts expect food stocks to benefit from sector rotation if the economy remains sluggish or slows in 1996. Says O'Neil: "They're stable-demand stocks: the economy may weaken, but the purchasing of food continues." O'Neil's favorite stock is <a name="NYSE:CPC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10268"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CPC International</b></a>, whose brands include Skippy, Mazola, and Knorr, and which derives 60 percent of its earnings from outside the U.S. "In Europe, Knorr is a bigger brand than Kellogg's or Kraft," says O'Neil.  <p> OIL <p>The leading petroleum companies today can be as profitable with oil at $17 a barrell as they were a few years ago when the price was $20 a barrell. <a name="NYSE:MOB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11006"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mobile</b></a>, for instance, has reduced annual expenses by approximately $2.5 billion in the past year. Oil industry shareholders should benefit from this trend even though analysts forsee significant increases in the price of crude anytime soon. Value Line does expect a tiny hop in industry profitability, forecasting that total industry net income will reach $28 billion in 1996, up from an estimated $27.5 billion in 1995. As much as some OPEC countries would like to raise prices, the organization can't do it without losing business to non-OPEC producers like the U.K., Norway, and Columbia.  <p> STEEL <p>Demand for steel began to improve late in 1995, helping to trim inventory levels that rose to excessive levels due to early in the year. (Predictions of steel shortages ended up causing a glut.) The prospects for 1996 look better--with domestic industry production expected to rise to 112 million tons from 109 million in 1995, according to Peter Marcus, at Paine Webber. Over the longer term, however, planned capacity expansions may outstrip demand, hurting prices and industry profits.  <p> AUTOS <p>The Big Three automakers may sell more cars in 1996 than most analysts and economists expect--bolstered by an economy that also may be somewhat better than expected. Value Line projects total industry sales of $360 billion in the coming year, up 4.7 percent from an estimated $344 billion in 1995.  <p> Few analysts expect Japanese auto makers to increase their market pentration in the U.S. this year, though the German car companies may very well gain further ground in a market that continues to favor higher-priced vehicles. With the outlook for Europe anything but rosy, neither <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>GM</b></a> nor <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford</b></a> are expected to get a major boost from overseas sales.  <p> General Motors has the most potential for improved unit profitability, because it still has more room to cut costs than either Ford or <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a>. But the Number Two and Three auto makers are leveraged to earn hefty returns on even a modest increase in sales. David Bradley, an auto analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities, forecasts that GM's earnings will rise to $7.90 a share from an estimated $6.92 a share in 1995; Ford's will jump to $3.70 a share from $3.10, and Chrysler's to $8.00 a share from $4.85.   <p> MEDIA  <p>Cable companies, previously stalled by rate inquiries, will be able to offer new and different programming services in 1996, up the prices they charge, and improve cash flow into their core business. This trend was already underway in the latter half of 1995. The telecommunications bill probably will allow broadcasters to own more stations and expand their reach. Of course, buying stations is costly, and competition for these outlets could intensify. Two big plusses loom: the elections and the Olympics. By consuming lots of advertising space, both events will push up the prices for what's left. "This is quite good for broadcasting," says Tim Wallace, an analyst at S.G.Warburg.  <p> Print publishers face higher paper prices and advertisers who are unreceptive to off setting the cost difference. Newspapers and magazines will "try to increase ad rates, but I'm skeptical,"says Brian C. Oakes, a J.P. Morgan analyst.  Ad growth may only reach five percent.   <p> Several analysts recommend such stocks as <a name="NYSE:DJ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10472"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dow Jones</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:GCI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10623"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gannett</b></a> because they have expanded beyond newspaper publishing. <p>"Broad-based publishers are better off than newspapers because probably more of them are viewing electronic stuff as an opportunity. Plus, each has something particular to offer. For example, Thomas Nelson has the inspirational market, Scholastic has the children's, KIII has strong business-to-business publishing.  Finally, the demand for their product is better than the advertising climate."   <p> COMPUTER SOFTWARE <p>For computer-software companies, 1996 will be the year they can no longer avoid the Internet. Jamie Kiggen, a technology analyst at Prudential Securities, suggests that investors should scrutinize their software investments to be prepared. "A company without an Internet strategy is a cause for concern," Kiggen says. "The Internet will change the way companies sell products and interact with consumers," he says. For those who doubt the growing importance of tailoring products for the net, look no further than <a name="NASD:NSCP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42472"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Netscape Communications</b></a>, which sells software for cruising the Internet's World Wide Web. Netscape had the hottest initial public offering of 1995, going public at $28 and climbing to $75 on the first day. The stock later reached $105.50 before settling into a range of $95 to $102. Another company to monitor is database-software concern <a name="NASD:ORCL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14337"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oracle</b></a>. Analysts note that Oracle recently moved into providing software for Internet server computers.   <p> Internet or no Internet, though, analysts expect <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> to continue its dominance of the software industry in 1996. This will be the year that sales for Windows 95 operating software kicks into high gear, driving both the software and hardware markets. The company sold 3 million retail copied of Windows 95 in its first two months on the market, but Rick Sherlund, software analyst at Goldman, Sachs, points out that there's more to the company than just Windows 95. "Microsoft's growth will be sustained by its diversity of products," Sherlund says. He's excited about Microsoft's Blackbird, a set of tools for programming on -- you guessed it -- the Internet, and its Gibralter Internet server application.   <p> Analysts are also looking for merger and acquisition action in the software industry for 1996 on the heels of <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>'s $3.5 billion purchase of Lotus Development and Computer Associates' $1.5 billion take over of software maker Legent. "While the leaders in the software industry are cash-rich, I expect them to continue to purchase smaller companies that make strategic and financial sense," says Kiggen.  <p> COMPUTER HARDWARE <p>There's no escaping the Internet on the hardware side of the computer industry, either. Analysts expect that the continuing clamor to get wired will fuel demand for personal computers and related hardware.   <p> Another driving factor will be Microsoft's sales of Windows 95, says William Gurley, an analyst who tracks computer companies at CS First Boston. "Hardware may lag slightly behind software sales, but there is a direct connection between these two markets," he says. Windows 95 doesn't work as well on older personal computers, so companies and individual users who want to take full advantage of the software can be expected to purchase new PCs. That benefits all of the top personal-computer companies -- except for <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple</b></a>, whose Macintosh computers use their own operating system instead of Windows. Among PC companies, Gurley likes mail-order giants like <a name="NASD:GATE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16706"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gateway 2000</b></a> and <a name="NASD:DELL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13193"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dell Computer</b></a>. He thinks they'll benefit from customers purchasing their second PC; those customers are more likely to feel comfortable ordering their computer over the phone.   <p> One factor that could actually hamper the business of top PC makers is the decision by <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a> to begin manufacturing computer motherboards. Intel, already atop the semiconductor industry because of demand for its Pentium microprocessors, will begin taking its chips and installing them on circuit boards for resale to computer manufacturers. The ability to buy motherboards from Intel could well allow smaller PC companies to save on research and development costs and compete more effectively with the big players. For 1996, analysts expect Intel to earn around $5.10 a share, according to the consensus estimate from First Call.  <p> Though computing trends continue to favor computer workstations and personal computers over mainframes, Ed Monterio, a portfolio manager at CIC Asset Management, thinks International Business Machines will enjoy another good year in 1996. IBM staged a sharp recovery in 1995, climbing to $114 after a low of $74 in January. But Monterio thinks there's further room in the stock, and he looks for IBM to reach $140 to $160 in 1996. "It's very cheap compared to earnings, and it has good dividend potential," he says.   <p> AIRLINES <p>It's conceivable that airline investors one day will feel they are treated as well financially by the industry as discount travelers. But it remains to be seen whether 1996 will be that year. The industry does appear closer to achieving its long-sought oligopolistic structure. Airlines have been raising fares, eliminating shorter (and less profitable) routes, negotiating tougher wage deals with employees, and playing hardball with travel agents. <a name="NYSE:CAI.A"></a><b>Continental Airlines</b> completely scrapped in CALite service, and <a name="NYSE:UAL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11520"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>UAL</b></a>'s United Airlines revamped its Shuttle offerings. <a name="NYSE:DAL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10448"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Delta Air Lines</b></a> mandated a new commission structure with travel agents that should save the industry approximately $400 million in1996.   <p> Airlines have also been trying to stop adding new planes faster than they are adding new customers. Analysts expected that the industry would fill 64 percent of its available seats in 1995, up from 62.2 percent in 1994 -- a trend that could continue in1996. One threat to profits is a fuel-tax hike currently being considered in Congress. The higher levy (which would take the form of the industry losing a special exemption it has had for years) could cost the industry about half a billion dollars annually. <p> The Street's consensus on airline stocks is that the industry should perform better in 1996 than it did in 1995. Of the major carriers, <a name="NYSE:LUV"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11377"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Southwest Airlines</b></a> remains a favorite because of its strong balance sheet. It is also the only major carrier that hasn't lost money in the past five years.   <p> CHEMICALS <p>Midway through 1995, prices for commodity chemicals began to weaken. It's not a sure thing that these prices -- which reflect the industry's health -- will rebound in 1996, but some analysts believe they will.   <p> Sales, meanwhile, are rising. <a name="NYSE:DOW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10471"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dow Chemical</b></a>, for instance, reported a 16 percent increase in 1995 third-quarter sales. Monsanto has been benefiting from management changes and higher prices for its agricultural and industrial products. <a name="NYSE:DD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10487"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Du Pont</b></a> is expected to overcome litigation for its breast-implant products and report record gains next year, according to analysts.   <p> Paul Raman, an industry expert at S.G. Warburg, predicts the major chemical companies will all do well in 1996 because they will get higher prices for their products. He's forecasting a 20 percent improvement in fourth-quarter 1995 earnings and a similar jump in 1996. He's especially optimistic about stronger sales in China.   <p> Paul Leming of C.J. Lawrence, however, is far less sanguine. He expects prices to soften further because of excess inventory and sees a "huge downward momentum" in earnings over the next four quarters.   <p> CONSUMER ELECTRONICS <p>Several analysts believe sales of the two leading electronics retailers, <a name="NYSE:CC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10343"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Circuit City</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:TAN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11441"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tandy</b></a>, could increase by as much as 20 percent in 1996, though declining prices and increasing competition could restrict improvement in their bottom line results. What's hot? Computers and big-screen televisions.   <p> Otis Bradley, an analyst at Gilford Securities, believes Tandy's stock price could gain as much as 50 percent in 1996, thanks to the ongoing profitability of its 6,800 Radio Shack stores and the apparent recent success of its Incredible Universe and The Edge stores. Scot Ciccarelli of Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York estimates that Tandy will have $320 million in net cash by the end of 1996 to spend growth projects and to reduce debt. <p> Circuit City plans to add 70 new stores next year to its 300 current locations. Analysts expect the company's stock to earn about $2.25 a share in 1996, up from an estimated $1.75 a share in 1995.   <p> Reported by Jonathan Butler, Monica Corcoran, Maxwell G. Dale, Manjeet Kripalani, Ken Kurson, Deborah Pont, and Dean Robinson. <p><p>

						June, 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> MY PARTNERS' WIVES ARE ALL NAMED TANYA  <p> By Andrew Tobias  <p> It all started, if you don't count the time I was arrested by the KGB for selling my blue jeans, in the summer of 1992. That was when I read in "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" that you could buy 30 seconds of commercial time on the Russian nightly news for$3,000.  <p> Three thousand dollars? To reach the entire former Soviet Union? <p> Remember, this was a country that then had just two or three channels; where viewers couldn't zap you with the mute button (because they had no mute button - about the only remote function Soviet-made TVs were know for was spontaneous combustion); and where they couldn't go into another room for a beer during the commercial because they had no other room. So for $3,000 you capture 100 million eyes.  <p> I have $3,000, I thought. With a little scraping, I even have $30,000. Wouldn't it be neat to run ads ten nights in a row to tell Russians the story of tobacco? The true story? Wouldn't that just annoy the heck out of the fine tobacco lobbyists from RJR and <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a>?  <p> A little background.  <p> Chapter 1.   <p> "I am 12."  <p> All the smart kids were opting for French, Spanish, or German. I signed up for Russian. I liked the alphabet. It was like a secret code. I have been fascinated with things Russian and Soviet ever since. Not least because...  <p> Chapter 2.  <p> "I am arrested."  <p> Junior year, at the ripe old age of 16, in 1963, I coaxed my parents into sending me on a trip behind the Iron Curtain with 20 other kids. My two most vivid memories were, first, airing in Czechoslovakia and finding that it was in color. I had somehow not expected this. And second, being framed by a very junior division of the KGB - specifically, the division charged with scaring the wits out of inquisitive 16-year-old Americans who strayed from the group.  <p> While the other kids were dutifully following our Intourist guides around monuments and museums, a friend and I would regularly strike out on our own and just see what we could see. We made a good team: He spoke no Russian but possessed a magnetic sense of direction; I get lost at every opportunity but knew a little Russian. We would board the Moscow subway, headed no place in particular, and ask perfect strangers to "guess where we're from."("Germany?" was the closest anyone got. "The moon" is probably what they were thinking.)  <p> This was fun for us but angst-making for our Intourist guides, so a small team was dispatched to strike the fear of ... not God, presumably, this being an atheist state, but ... something in me, and they sure as heck did. I handed over a pair of blue jeans, expecting to get enough rubles to buy a ten-volume Soviet children's encyclopedia (which I did wind up buying anyway), and instead found myself being interrogated for four hours with the prospect of many years in jail.  <p> They let me go because I was so young but claimed the "purchaser"(who was almost surely in on the sting, I realized later) would be executed. I can't remember if I every got the jeans back. But the main thing is that we stopped misbehaving for at least a week, until we got to Poland. There, Soviet books were subsidized even more heavily than in Russia, so great was the supply and so slight the demand. I got a second set of the same encyclopedia at half the already ridiculously low price - something like $20 worth of black-market zlotys - as a gift for my high school. <p> I came back to the U.S. something of a socialist for reasons only a 16-year-old would understand. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life, but business - capitalism - was clearly out of boundski. My dad, who was an advertising executive, had already placed the ad game off limits. Anything but that, he said. (He was a man who could have written great novels but wound up writing great jingles. Remember "Man, oh, Manischewitz"? His. "Ronzoni, sono buoni?" His. "Calling all boys to Barneys"? I used to get all my clothes from Barney's son at 20 percent off.)  <p> Chapter 3.  <p> "I am converted."  <p> I remained steadfast in my socialist principles until I wound up running the student business conglomerate at Harvard. Funny what a profit share will do to your political philosophy.  <p> I still wanted to end the Cold War - I knew the Soviet people were peace loving, with nice if impractical ideas. So I majored in what I thought of as "Soviet stuff" but Harvard insisted on calling Slavic Languages and Literatures. This meant reading"WAR AND PEACE" in English and taking Czech long enough to discover that all Czech words are accented on the first syllable, except those also accented on the second syllable. Hello? Does this just mean you are supposed to say the whole word louder? I dropped the course the next day.  <p> It is a matter of no small personal shame that after four years of high school Russian, a major in Slavic Languages and Literatures, and decades of talking to Russian-born cab drivers in New York, I still haven't mastered it. The cab drivers compliment me on my Russian accent, but that is about the only thing they say that I can understand. "Slower, please. Slower!" I beg in Russian, hoping they will enunciate each syllable. But they just hit the brakes.  <p> Chapter 4. <p>"The tobacco thing."  <p> Well, the Cold War ended, and I had absolutely nothing to do with it. But now - 1992, a full 29 years after my trip to Russia- I am reading this thing in the "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" about being able to advertise for $3,000.  <p> Separately, I have become one of those really boring, obnoxious people on the subject of tobacco. I think people should certainly be allowed to smoke if they want to, but not where I have to breathe it. And I think it's nuts that we spend $4 billion a year in this country promoting the leading cause of preventable death.  <p> So I've done some things here and there to try to help the pro-health activists in the ongoing dialogue. But in the U.S. - or practically anyplace else in the world - what kind of impact can you really have?  <p> That's why this $3,000 notion was so startling. I knew that U.S. tobacco companies were rushing into the former Soviet Union.Wouldn't it be neat to issue a warning? "The Hessians are coming! The Hessians are coming!" - under the appealing cloak of the Marlboro man, Joe Camel, and all those healthy, athletic, glamorous smokers who've been banned from U.S. television since 1965. Listen up, I would say, because I can only afford to tell you once. And then I'd tell them all the things we now know about tobacco and the cynicism of the tobacco companies.   <p> I checked. Three thousand dollars was not a misprint. You really could buy airtime that cheap. (In fact, cheaper, as I would ultimately discover.) But producing Russian TV spots? Where would you even start? I just sort of filed this idea away. Like most of us, I have a large file of such ideas.  <p> Chapter 5.  <p> "Opportunity knocks."  <p> A few months later, serendipitously, I got invited to join a delegation to Moscow. Well, delegation sounds awfully grand -it was actually about 15 of us, led by Congressman Barney Frank, hoping to persuade the Russian authorities to repeal "Article121," Stalin's 1937 decree making intimacy between two adults of the same sex punishable by up to five years in prison. (And in fact, not long after our visit, very possible thanks in some measure to the congressman's efforts, the rule was quietly repealed and some prisoners released.)  <p> Had the invitation been to Indonesia or Peru, I might not have gone. But Russia! I had been waiting 29 years for a reason to go back to Russia!  <p> And I remembered "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL."  <p> One thing led to another, and pretty soon I was faxing furiously to Moscow, to an American friend-of-a-friend named mark Slater who was over there producing documentaries with directors Lina Wertmuller and Werner Herzog.  <p> "Sure," Mark faxed. "Why don't you write up some scripts and we'll try it."  <p> Chapter 6.  <p> "Excuse my pronunciation."  <p> Our little delegation reached Moscow on December 1, 1992, and got to do some neat things. One was to tour Butyrka prison, build by Catherine the Great and cleaned only twice since then. Well, that's not fair. But it is the single most depressing place I have ever been. It's here Russians are sent while awaiting determination of their guild or innocence. This frequently takes three years. If guilty, they are sent elsewhere for the remainder of their term. If innocent, they are released. They cannot make outgoing calls.  <p> It was very good to get back out into the cold Moscow air. <p> Actually, fresh air of any type is welcome in Moscow, because this is a country where everyone smokes. We visited Moscow's huge cancer institute and were told that 70 percent of the doctors there smoke.  <p> This in a country where the average life expectancy was not so great to begin with, but is now slumping precipitously - down to 59 or so for a male versus 72 in the U.S.  <p> Yes, yes, if you had their problems, you'd smoke, too. But really: Should Russian kids give up on life just because communism has collapsed? Should they become lifelong slaves to the tobacco companies?  <p> So there I was in Moscow with my scripts, which we had translated into Russian and which a crew had stayed up all night typing into a sort of makeshift TelePrompTer.  <p> "Hello," I said at the outset of the first. "I'm a writer from Miami. Excuse my pronunciation, but I have something important to tell you."  <p> I was reading from the monitor, following the stress marks that had been penned in for me. (Unlike Czech, Russian words are all stressed on just one syllable - and only a Russian knows which.) <p> "Not long ago, with the aid of some wonderful New York City school children, I wrote this little book [HOLD UP THE BOOK],"KIDS SAY DON'T SMOKE." Now we are translating this book into Russian and hoping to distribute it to schools and hospitals. Over the next several evenings, I want to share with you some of the things I learned in writing this book.  <p> "In America, every pack of cigarettes [HOLD UP CAMELS, LEFTHAND] carries a strong warning. For example: 'Smoking in pregnant women can cause fetal damage.' Yet in Russia, the exact same cigarettes [HOLD UP RUSSIAN CAMELS, RIGHT HAND] from the same manufacturer have no warning label. How come? Are Russian fetuses not important?  <p> "Well, until tomorrow."  <p> The idea was to come back night after night for 15 nights with some factoid about smoking or the tobacco companies. We had been promised airtime for even less that $3,00 - and for a full minute, not 30 seconds! - so we decided to tape 15 spots. Of course, it was anybody's guess whether we could pull this off technically, and if so, whether we could actually get them on the air. From the difficulty I was having pronouncing some of this stuff -"toy boat" is nothing compared with "byeryemyenikh zhenschchin"- I had grave doubts.  <p> We had one guy standing by with a stopwatch - the ads had to be approximately a minute each, give or take a few seconds (is that how NBC does it?) - and another whose sole job was to listen with his eyes closed to see whether he could understand what I was saying. Plus the cameraman, a makeup woman, Mark (our director), and people from the studio running the monitor.  <p> The ads in fact made it on the air in early 1993, broadcast on both main networks, Ostankino and RTR, and on the regional (70 million viewers) Petersburg TV. I was back in sunny Miami when they aired in dark and freezing Moscow but got copies taped off the air.  <p> A not terribly scientific poll of 125 youngsters (okay, a terribly unscientific poll) determined that about half the kids in the country remembered seeing the ads. Comments ranged from "Keep doing this!" and "Please convince people not to smoke!" to "Make video with interesting plot. It's so boring just to see you lecturing."(The kid had a point.)  <p> Better still, the ads were parodied. On what seemed to be asort of Ed Sullivan hour, a team of powder-blue-tuxedoed stand-up comics did a bit where one of them stepped up to his mike and said, in what even I could tell was a bad American accent: "My brother-in-law quit smoking and three weeks later he was dead. My sister quit smoking, and three weeks later she was dead. And their dog died. They were hit by a car. Well, until tomorrow." <p> Finally, we heard a number of stories of adults being really annoyed with the ads, because their kids were bugging the hell out of them to stop filling the apartment with tobacco smoke. This made me very happy.  <p> Chapter 7.  <p> "World Smoke-Out Day."  <p> Mark and I had "KIDS SAY DON'T SMOKE" translated and arranged to print 50,000 copies. The first price we were quoted - by the publishing arm of Tass, struggling as it was to adjust to the new market economy - was about 10 cents a book, payable (in advance) in U.S. dollars. This was a sensational price, and we shook on it around the table. The next day, when I returned to sign the final papers, the price had doubled. "Ah," they explained. "In our calculations, we forgot to include paper."  <p> The books - which even at 20 cents cost barely a third what they'd have cost in the West - were delivered only a few weeks behind schedule and looked pretty good. With the help of the Russian journalist Vladimir Gubarev (first on the scene at Chernobyl and highly respected throughout the country), all 50,000 were distributed across 11 time zones. For some reason he adopted our little project, even going so far as to hand one of the books to the president of Kazakhstan.  <p> I was invited back to Moscow by some arm of the Health Ministry to hand out the first copies of "KIDS SAY DON'T SMOKE" and to participate in World Smoke-Out Day, May 31. Moscow is a lot nicer in May than December.  <p> A few weeks before the trip I got word that Russian TV wanted me to come on as a guest. "I can't," I said. "I don't speak Russian."The word came back: "Oh, you speak Russian very well." They thought I was being modest. They actually believed this, because they had seen me speaking on TV. What they hadn't seen was the monitor with the stress marks. "No, I mean I really don't speak Russian!" <p> A simultaneous translator was engaged, and there I was on Russian TV, and later on a popular national radio show broadcast from Ostankino. (Five months later, gunfire would crackle in the same lobby I passed through to go to my interviews, as the hard-liners attempted to overthrow Yeltsin.)  <p> At a press conference, Vladimir Gubarev arose from the back of the room unexpectedly, came forward, and announced that -with our permission - he would be sending a copy of "KIDS SAY DON'T SMOKE" up into space with a Russian cosmonaut pal. The first such book in space.  <p> It was so loony, and yet somehow he pulled off the moment with a plomb. I don't know whether the book ever orbited, but for a few seconds it all seemed to make sense. Of course he'd be launching our book. Or course this was newsworthy. Of course the proper etiquette in making the announcement was to ask our permission. ("No! You may absolutely not send a copy of "KIDS SAY DON'T SMOKE" into space. We only have 50,000 copies, and we need them all down here.") To read more about the wonderful Mr. Gubarev, and even see his photo, pick up "ABLAZE," by Piers Paul Read, author also of "ALIVE," about the rugby team that crashed in the Andes. <p> We got a bunch of press, and then the following winter we aired some more spots. This time we got two little Russian girls, six and ten, to look into the camera and read a letter to President Yeltsin.  <p> "Dear President Yeltsin," they read. "The Supreme Soviet has passed a law banning tobacco advertising on TV, but everyone ignores it. Yet the companies that advertise tobacco on TV here can't show those same ads at home. Isn't the health of Russian children important to you? Please, President Yeltsin, enforce the law."  <p> Night after night for two weeks, if memory serves. First the six-year-old, then the ten-year-old, on alternate nights. <p>I don't know whether Yeltsin ever saw these annoying ads, but I did his number two, Viktor Chernomyrdin, stormed into a cabinet meeting one day and asked what is it with these kids.  <p> This past February, many months after those ads appeared - and most likely not in any way was a result - Yeltsin did decree the end of tobacco (and alcohol) advertising. A few days later, the highly popular head of Russian TV announced he was dropping all TV advertising for a while, while they reassessed its impact... and a few days after that, at the age of 38, in front of six witnesses, he was shot to death in the lobby of his apartment building.  <p> But hold that very sad thought, because I'm getting ahead of myself.  <p> Chapter 8.  <p> "We start a business."  <p> The thing is, I was dazzled by what Mark was able to accomplish. In a country where back then nothing worked, no one answered the phone, Kinko's was decidedly not on every corner, and you had to carry your own toilet paper, Mark managed to work miracles. Here was a 35-ish Minnesotan who had just started learning Russian when he got to Moscow, whose accent was worse that yours, but who remembered everything, coordinated everything, managed to get everything done, and never dropped a ball.  <p> I quickly developed two basic refrains in my communications with Mark:  <p> (1) "Thank you." I said that a lot. (He did all this smoking stuff for free. Also some ads we did to warn about AIDS.)  <p> (2) "Find some business and let me back you." I said that a lot, too, because Russia was - is - a country where you could easily lose you shirt, and we still may, but where the potentialis enormous.  <p> So Mark began looking for businesses to invest in, and a little more than a year ago settled on a small ad agency/computer graphics business run by three Russian partners, Ilya, Dmitri, and Alexei, all 26 or so, and all married to women named Tanya. They had brains, energy, integrity, some rudimentary computer equipment, and clients. What they lacked was $150,000 in Silicon Graphics work stations, Wavefront computer-graphics software, international connections, and a nice office. We supplied all that in return for a controlling interest in the business, which was renamed Media Arts.  <p> When friends asked me what "computer graphics" really are, I explain it this way. You know that winged horse at the start of all Tri-Star motion pictures? It's not a real horse. Not tha twe did that particular horse, or have done anything at all just yet for Tri-Star. But our equipment is in use virtually 24 hours a day.  <p> And we've started a media-monitoring business. At an office a few miles away, we have a bank of TVs and VCRs and a crew employed to tape everything that plays on Russian TV, keeping a log of what commercials are played when. That way, advertisers can verify they got the ad time they paid for - and get a clear idea of what their competitors are doing.  <p> My role in this is as a wire clerk. And although the novelty is beginning to wear off, it's head stuff. Picture it. To get the Wavefront software to our new office in Moscow, I wired dollars from our account in Miami to the Taipei account of the Dutch company that represents Wavefront in Russia. It then delivered the software in Moscow and (presumably) forwarded payment to Wavefront in California. Ah, brave new world.  <p> Meanwhile, some of our business comes direct to the States (1-800-MEDIART- I kid you not), so again I get to play wire clerk. In February, the bank called to tell me that a $450,000 wire had just comein from France. This was to pay for commercial time on Russian TV, so a few days later my partners E-mailed me instructions on wiring most of it back out: $235,000 to an account in Moscow and $201,000 to an account in Latvia. (Latvia!)  <p> I dutifully fired off the wire instructions and the bank dutifully fired off the wires.  <p> Normally, that would have been the end of it, but later that day I got a call from Ilya in Moscow. "Have the wires gone out?" he asked.  <p> "I think so - why?"  <p> "Can you stop them?" he asked.  <p> "I don't know - I doubt it," I said, growing ever so slightly nervous. "Why?"  <p> Ilya reported that the a forementioned highly popular 38-year-old TV czar, Vladimir Listyev, had just been assassinated. Chaos reigned. Ilya thought it would be a good idea to stop the wires. <p> It was seven minutes to five in Miami (nearly one A.M. in Moscow), so I hung up and called the bank. "Well, it's not 100 percent guaranteed," I was told, "but we can recall the wires in the morning and chances are the money will come back."  <p> So I asked them to do that - all of this confirmed in writing, of course - apologizing for the inconvenience. "The irony," I said, "is that things are likely to settle back down in a day or two and we'll have to send the darn wires out all over again. But better safe than sorry."  <p> Sure enough, a day or two later, that's just what happened. I received word from my partners that it was okay to send the money.  <p> The $235,000 from Moscow had already come back, so I instructed the bank to send it back out. "And if the $201,000 comes back from Latvia, send it back out, too."  <p> Twelve days passed. I was out of town thinking about other things, but then came an E-mail from Moscow. Where's the $235,000?  <p> I called my counterpart at the bank. "Oh," she said. "I was going to call you this morning."  <p> "Yeah?"  <p> It seems that instead of resending the $235,000 that had comeback from Moscow, she had accidentally resent a second $201,00 to Latvia.  <p> I won't take you through every twist and turn. Suffice it to say that Latvia is not Cleveland. The Latvians apparently thought this second $201,000 was a miracle. An answered prayer. Can you imagine how much money $201,000 is in Latvia? When the Latvians were apprised of the error and asked to return the money, they said, "No." The Latvian bank was contacted directly by a vice president of the Miami bank. "Forget it," he was told. "You're not getting the money back."  <p> This made the Miami bank, which acknowledged it was their problem not ours (but which showed a $170,000 overdraft in our account all the same), highly nervous. The FBI was contacted; Kroll Associates, a private investigative firm, was poised to strike. At the 11th hour, our partners in Moscow prevailed on their partners' partners in Latvia to force the bank to return the money. Something like that. All I know is that the money came back.  <p> And now a nice wire has come in from Hong Kong, from a client who wants to sell TVs in Russia.  <p> Chapter 9.  <p> "He's baaaaaa-ack."  <p> The second World Smoke-Out Day I attended, in May 1994, got us a plug on the front page of "IZVESTIYA" and was a chance to meet my Russian partners in the flesh and to see our offices. They are fine partners. And, by Moscow standards, snazzy offices. I also saw the computers our money had bought. Given what they cost, they sure seemed small. But with them, our skilled artists and technicians can make goobers dance and horses fly.  <p> While there, I made another series of commercials that aired this past winter. Taking pity on the Russians, who have a lot to bear as it is, I made just 5 spots instead of 15 - and we jazzed them up with computer graphics. My favorite of the five talked about the economics of this whole deal. The Russians feel they must play ball with Philip Morris and the rest because of the jobs new cigarette factories create and because of the ad dollars that come pouring in. What I tried to point out is that Philip Morris et al. aren't doing this as a favor. They clearly expect to take far more out of Russia than they put in.  <p> Chapter 10.  <p> "Heads you lose, tails you win - big."  <p> So far, we're making money, most of it will probably go to the accountants for trying to figure out how to pay U.S. and Russian taxes. And there's the obvious and real possibility that we will lose everything. Russia is a volatile place.  <p> Then again, there's the possibility we will one day sell out for a big profit. As Michael Katz, who runs Glenrock Global Partners in New York, told "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" not long ago, Russia's a coin toss: Heads you lose everything, tails you make 20 times your money. It's irresistible.  <p> One of these days it will be easy and perhaps even safe to invest in Russia. By then, of course, it will be time to invest someplace else. Latvia, maybe.  <p> P.S. Tobacco adds are continuing to run on Russian TV as before, with the difference that they no longer contain shots of cigarettes or smoking. For example, the Marlboro cowboy rides the range to familiar music, and the logo appears, but that's all.  <p> Time to haul out the six-year-old (now seven) to read another letter to President Yeltsin?  <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>ALL THAT GLITTERS IN GOLD STOCKS
Mining shares offer both growth and value.<p>By Kenneth Gerbino<p>Stock market investors are often confronted with this quandary: Should they buy the shares of a company with strong growth prospects? Or should they opt for a stock that represents a good, intrinsic value for the price? Rarely do these scenarios exist simultaneously. At the moment, the shares of gold-mining companies may fit that picture.<p>Traditionally, investors have used gold as a hedge against economic uncertainty or as a way to protect capital against the scourge of inflation. But the stocks of gold-mining companies offer other attractions as well. For one, their economic prospects aren't entirely dependent on the price of gold. Most of these companies are adept at hedging the price of future production just as wheat and soybean farmers do -- so a small decline in gold prices doesn't necessarily spell poor profits for gold miners.<p>Most mining companies also typically sport decent margins because it costs far less to mine an ounce of gold than it does to buy the stuff on the world market. On average, the top 20 producers in North America spend roughly $220 in cash costs for each $395 ounce of gold mined. Thus, the spot market -- where commodities are sold for cash and delivered immediately -- would have to decline precipitously for these companies to get hammered.<p>These high margins also mean that gold companies offer attractive leverage. Suppose the world market price is $395 an ounce but a mining company can dig gold out of the ground at a total cost (cash costs plus production expenses and depreciation) of $295 per ounce. Now assume gold prices increase at a conservative 6 percent annually, to $419 an ounce, with half the rise due to a 3 percent increase in inflation and the other 3 percent from a boost in Asian demand. Because the industry has been getting more efficient, mining costs aren't likely to rise. So that $24 increase gets added right to a company's bottom line. The $100 profit becomes $124, a 24 percent net increase on just a 6 percent jump in the price of gold.<p>Surging demand for gold also has allowed companies to boost their revenues and profits by starting up more new mines. According to Gold Fields Minerals Services, an industry publication, today the total world appetite for gold stands at 3,257 metric tons per year, which surpasses the current mine output of 2,281 total tons. Moreover, gold held in reserves by central banks rarely gets dumped on the market, so there doesn't appear to be much danger of a gold glut. <p>Mining companies also are growing by upgrading their existing mines. This not only boosts capacity but also tends to lower production costs. A case in point is <a name="NYSE:FCX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10606"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold</b></a>, based in New Orleans. It has steadily upgraded its Ertsberg/Grasberg mine in Indonesia since 1990. Since then, the company has lowered its costs and raised annual production from 284,000 ounces to 800,000 ounces. Meanwhile, its stock rose from a split-adjusted $5 per share to a recent $23.25. <p>On the value side of the ledger, gold-mining shares can be hidden asset plays because vast amounts of precious metal reserves are usually not officially stated in a mining company's annual reports. Highly valuable properties that have been drilled and tested can't be officially considered viable until they pass standard metallurgical and engineering tests. That often results in off-balance-sheet surprises. The recent bidding war over Toronto-based Lac Minerals is an example of this. Last July, 11 days after <a name="AMEX:RYO"></a><b>Royal Oak Inc.</b> made a $1.3 billion offer for the company, Lac's board announced it had an additional 5 million ounces in reserves worth $2 billion. Upon hearing that news, American Barrick in Toronto bid $1.7 billion, an offer the company finally accepted on September 7.<p>Another reason to be bullish on gold: As world populations increase and whole countries move from agricultural to industrialized societies, the demand for gold should continue to rise. In the last three years, the demand for gold jewelry has outstripped Western Hemisphere mine output by 655 metric tons per year. That amounts to 23 million ounces annually, or almost 10 percent of the U.S. Treasury's gold reserves, the world's largest. Asian demand could also easily kick in more than a 3 percent annual increase over the next three years. Asian gold demand steadily rose from 200 metric tons per year in 1983 to 1,000 tons in 1993, a 400 percent increase. The main reason is China. The Chinese, like most other Asians, are firm believers in the value of gold. Throughout the 1920s and '30s, Shanghai was the third-largest gold market in the world, after London and New York. After a debilitating bout of inflation during the late 1940s, China learned a tough lesson on the merits of owning gold. <p>So, if you're looking for growth and value, check the list of six gold mining companies below. These investments now shine bright.<p><p>BEST BETS IN GOLD STOCKS

Bill Clinton might not believe it, but our economy is likely to follow our currency into the tank. Ditto his presidency.<p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p>President Clinton, the chief engineer of our economy, is steaming ahead, full throttle, with a cheap-dollar policy. So what if the greenback is in a virtual free fall against the Japanese yen and the German mark? Clinton has made it clear to investors both here and abroad that the U.S. needn't fret about a weak currency.<p>Nobody knows where the dollar's fall will end. It won't go straight down; there will be periodic blips upward. But temporary action matters little, for the damage has been done. As Clinton seems willing to let the dollar fall further, even more damage can be expected. What kinds of damage? Higher inflation and interest rates, reduced purchasing power, and declining markets. American investors are about to find out how ugly things get when policy makers trash their currency. <p>Clinton's decimation of the dollar -- though egregious -- is only the latest in a series of devaluations, intended or otherwise, that have brought our currency to its knees. In less than ten years, the dollar has gone from 3.46 deutsche marks to 1.55; from 263 yen to 98. In just the past 12 months, the buck has fallen 4 percent against the J.P. Morgan index of 19 currencies. Since 1950, the dollar's purchasing power, measured by consumer prices, has fallen 83 percent. <p>These declines have very serious consequences for our economy's future as well as for our own personal wealth creation. Don't be fooled into believing that a falling dollar is good for our economy. The benefits -- greater sales of our goods overseas, which creates higher employment at home -- are short-term in nature. The effects of a weak dollar are exceedingly deleterious and last a long time.<p>As far as the dollar is concerned, Americans have lived a blissfully ignorant life until now. Unless you were planning a trip abroad, you weren't likely to think about the value of the dollar versus other currencies. Because our country and its economy are so vast, we haven't been forced to learn how a strong or weak dollar will affect our lives tomorrow or next year. We could maintain an isolationist's attitude. <p>Few countries can afford this complacency. More common is the attitude taken by Europeans and Latin Americans. There, economies are more dependent on neighboring countries and their currencies. As a result, every consumer is an expert in foreign exchange. The French know the exchange rate of the Germans, and vice versa. Such knowledge can pay off. If the franc is stronger than the mark, that makes it cheaper to cross the border and buy German goods with francs.<p>Isolationism on currencies is no longer an option for American investors, however. This is because we depend on foreigners to fund our government's deficits, a fine scenario for everyone when the dollar was strong and interest rates relatively high. But now that the buck is plunging against world currencies, foreign investors are decidedly less interested in buying dollar-denominated investments because of the losses they must take in currency translations. <p>This is especially important for investors to understand now, because in coming weeks, stock and bond markets may have vehement reactions to the dollar's decline. Bonds dropped 0.5 percent in early July when the dollar crisis began but bounced back. Stocks seem to have shrugged off currency concerns altogether. The S&P 500 is up 1.75 percent since the dollar started to crater; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2.8 percent.<p>The last time the dollar dropped and the stock market inexplicably stayed high was in the spring of 1987, a few months before the market crash. On October 18, the stock market and the dollar suddenly got back in sync. Investors, though, were dazed.<p>Now foreigners holding U.S. securities are dazed. If a Japanese investor, say, bought some Treasurys in mid-January before the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates, he'd now be facing a loss of 24.3 percent; principal losses would have been 15 percent and currency losses 9.3 percent. And folks wonder why foreign investors are fleeing?<p>This flight is an enormous problem for President Clinton and for all of us. From 1985 through 1990, foreign investors bought almost $200 billion worth of Treasury bonds and notes. Now that the administration is letting the dollar slide, our government debt looks uglier and uglier to both foreign and domestic investors.<p>So who's going to buy our huge issuance of bonds? Because investors are scarce, rates will have to go higher for our securities to appeal to anyone. And unless Clinton gets religion on cutting government spending, changes the tax rules to encourage Americans to save money, and defends the dollar by behaving like a leader rather than a pleaser, interest rates may go very high indeed.<p>So far, Clinton has been lucky with interest rates, markets, and the economy. His bumbling on the dollar will end that.<p>It's instructive to consider the public approval ratings of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton on their handling of the economy. Both began their terms with similar ratings -- around 60 percent -- which dropped fairly quickly. In their respective second years in office, Carter's ratings began an irreversible plunge while Clinton's have stayed in a more respectable range. Not great, though: The most recent figures available show that Clinton's handling of the economy received a 44 percent approval and 45 percent disapproval rating. <p>From here on, Clinton's ratings are probably going to look a lot more like Carter's. Americans soured on Carter when the oil shock hit and interest rates rose. Clinton's numbers will almost certainly worsen as interest rates increase, foreign investors flee our markets, and the economy slows.<p>To see what distressed currencies can do to a country's economic health, look at the recent foreign-exchange crises in Latin America. The latest panic began in the early 1980s, when capital inflows dried up following the revelation that Mexican debt held by foreign investors could not be paid off. Ensuing currency devaluations in Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay -- between 100 percent and 200 percent in three months -- increased annual inflation rates from 10 percent to 20 percent to as much as 60 percent overnight. Hyperinflation continued through the 1980s in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru, according to Claudio Sapelli, a Chilean economist at the World Bank, largely because of big government deficits and lax monetary policy.<p>Only recently did the situation in Latin America settle down. Now, for example, Argentina's inflation rates are as low as the United States', thanks to big cuts in government spending and successful privatization of ossified state-owned enterprises, the opposite of what is happening in this country. The U.S. is facing the kinds of challenges Latin America has faced. As long as its fiscal-policy stance is weaker than the stances of its trading partners, the dollar will devalue.<p>But perhaps the trickiest reason why the dollar will continue to be dangerously weak is the paucity of leadership coming out of the White House on the economy and on world affairs. The credibility of the financial markets is tough to earn; once lost, it is virtually impossible to win back. Despite his driving need to please, Clinton has lost the respect of investors everywhere. At home and abroad he is perceived as dithering, weak, and an entitlement giver.<p>David Fand is a former economic advisor to the comptroller of the currency and a research associate at George Mason University. He conducted a study, going back to 1967, that shows a strong correlation between the trade-weighted value of the dollar and defense spending as a percent of gross domestic product. When defense spending falls or rises, the dollar follows suit.<p>From 1968 to 1973, for instance, military spending declined from 9.7 percent of GDP to 6 percent. The dollar dropped 19 percent during the period. When defense spending picked up, from 1981 to 1986, the dollar rose 8.5 percent. This doesn't mean that we should start a war somewhere, but simply that defending the nation is a good way to defend the dollar.<p>There are other ways. Clinton must slash entitlement spending and alter income-tax structures to encourage Americans to save. Our savings rate is abysmally low; as a percentage of disposable income, it has declined from 8 percent in 1980 to 4.7 percent. The household savings rate in Japan is about 20 percent.<p>Americans are also borrowing more. In 1980, consumers' indebtedness was 23.5 percent of total household assets. Now it's 26.5 percent. Uncle Sam can't expect us to fund his debt if we're already heavily leveraged.<p>One reason Americans don't save is triple taxation. An investor's gross income is taxed, interest on savings is taxed, and when he dies, his estate is taxed. Says Fand: "The message is, you're an idiot if you save."<p>Of course, every cloud has a silver lining. Clinton's current indifference to the dollar places the country in grave danger. It puts his presidency in the same spot.

Cott Corp. is positioned to capitalize on a consumer trend: The perfect story stock, in Wall Street parlance. As usual, there's a story behind the story.<p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p><a name="NASD:COTTF"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42846"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cott Corp.</b></a>, a Toronto-based maker of private-label soft drinks and beer, is the quintessential '90s highflier. Its stock, which trades on Nasdaq (COTTF), has rocketed from a split-adjusted low of around 30 cents a share in 1991 to a recent $23.75 (both U.S.). Last fall, it traded here as high as $38. The shares also trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange.<p>One reason Cott is such a winner: In Wall Street parlance, it's the perfect "story" stock. Here's the short version: As a low-cost producer of beverages and foods, Cott is well positioned to capitalize on the consumer trend toward high-quality, private-label goods. Supermarket and drug chains like its products because they carry fatter margins than major brands like <a name="NYSE:PEP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11166"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pepsi</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coke</b></a>. Consumers go for Cott because they pay lower prices, too. <p>Does this story have a happy ending? Investors apparently think so: They've bid up Cott shares to 54 times last year's reported earnings of 60 cents per share. (All numbers are Canadian unless noted.) As a comparison, Coca-Cola's price-to-earnings ratio is 23. Cott's present market capitalization is $2 billion, equal to 3.1 times the company's $665 million in sales. Most bottling companies trade at a fraction of sales.<p>Cott shares are favored by growth- stock-fund managers and touted at brokerages <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley</b></a> and Oppenheimer. In the U.S., Cott supplies goods to <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a> as Sam's American Choice. Canadian clients include Loblaw and Oshawa Foods.<p>Cott's operations are run by Gerald Pencer, 49, son of the late Harry Pencer, who founded the company in 1952. Says Pencer of his business: "Retailers are ringing our phones off the hook. Not only is our product helping retailers differentiate themselves, but it enables them to make more money." <p>Such is the story behind the stock. Now, the story behind the story.<p>This one isn't pretty. Upon closer inspection, disturbing facts about Cott's business, finances, executives, and stock come into focus. Cott's quarter-to-quarter sales are declining, but its earnings and assets would be far lower if the company did not use the aggressive accounting practices that it does. Top managers have been dumping shares, snagging sweetheart deals and big bonuses. <p>Cott's go-go accounting looks curiously familiar to people who knew Pencer before he got into the soft-drink business. Sad indeed is the history of Financial Trustco Capital, a financial-services conglomerate Pencer ran in the 1980s. In 1988, after years of impressive earnings and asset growth, Pencer gave up his management duties. His was a graceful and, as it happened, timely exit; just a few months later, Financial Trustco imploded. Shareholders' equity, which was $144 million, was written down to a negative $76 million. The stock plunged to around 2 cents a share after trading as high as $19 in the mid-1980s. <p>What went wrong? The 1987 stock market crash, according to Pencer. Others take the slightly different view that Financial Trustco's aggressive accounting practices finally caught up with it. "The company was overstating income and assets, and their auditor was accepting it," says Chris Robinson, an associate professor of finance at Toronto's York University who examined Financial Trustco's books and ultimately wrote a case study of the debacle. The particulars included overstatement of the market value of securities held by the company and failure to record a massive loss on the effective disposal of a subsidiary.<p>Six years later, though, Pencer is back and bigger than ever. He's running a different company, but his financial style doesn't appear to have changed. The accounting firm he's using to audit Cott's books is the one Financial Trustco employed: Coopers & Lybrand. There's a key difference between then and now: U.S. investors are big owners of Cott. They weren't of Financial Trustco.<p>These shareholders seem willing to overlook a lot about Cott. Fans call it a growth stock, but sales actually fell 12 percent and 6 percent in each of the past two quarters, ending October and January. Of the drop, Pencer says, "This is a seasonal business. "He insists that the numbers for the first quarter, which finishes in late April, will come roaring back. They had better; Wall Street isn't forgiving of "growth" stocks that show declining sales. <p>The rate at which insiders are selling the stock is also a concern. Last year, Pencer sold more than 1.5 million shares of Cott stock -- roughly one quarter of his holding -- at prices between $11 and $35 (U.S.). Ten other executives or directors dumped another 1.4 million shares in 1993. Note this: Cott president Heather Reisman unloaded 69,000 shares less than a month before Cott issued 3 million shares to the public at $31 (U.S.) per in a secondary offering. Had investors known that Reisman was selling, they might have been more hesitant to snap up Cott shares in August. But news of Reisman's sales didn't reach the Ontario Securities Commission until November, well after the offering. <p>Heavy insider selling, however, is nothing compared to the ingenious methods Cott uses to account for itself. Unfortunately, many U.S. shareholders may not know that Canada's generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are more liberal than U.S. practices. For example, the standards are sufficiently flexible to allow Cott to count as assets what in the U.S. would be considered expenses. This reduces the costs Cott runs through its income statement and bolsters the assets on its balance sheet. Net result: Magically higher earnings. <p>During the year ended January 29, for instance, the company's balance sheet shows $30 million in "other assets." Included here are prepaid contract costs -- essentially what Cott pays to buy shelf space for its products from retailers. At a stretch, a U.S. company could consider contract costs an asset, but even Coca-Cola Beverages in Canada doesn't. Also listed as assets: "Deferred development costs," incurred designing packages for private-label clients. This would be regarded as an expense in the U.S., not an asset. <p>Another interesting technique found on Cott's balance sheet involves $37.6 million of goodwill. At best an intangible and illiquid asset, goodwill usually includes a company's brand name or good customer relations. Cott's goodwill is "principally the excess of the costs of acquisitions over the fair values of the net tangible asset acquired," as stated in SEC filings.<p>One such acquisition was the purchase of a minority interest in Cott Beverages USA for $16 million in Cott shares in fiscal 1993. Curiously, Cott bought this interest from several of its own employees, paying $7.1 million to chief operating officer Fraser Latta and $700,000 to vice president of finance Paul Henderson. Latta had gotten his minority interest, gratis, less than a year earlier, as part of an "amended" employment agreement that took effect a few months after he joined Cott.<p>What does this maneuver achieve? Pencer says the payments are just deserts for associates who increased Cott's business in the U.S. "The best way to motivate [people] is to allow them to participate in the growth of the company," he says. "It's the culture of our company." <p>Here's another way of looking at it: The deal takes what appears to be executive compensation, normally another of a company's costs, and whisks it off the income statement and onto the asset side of the balance sheet. A clever move, particularly in light of how a $7.1 million compensation cost would have cut into Cott's 1993 reported earnings of $12 million.<p>What else is going on in Cott's books? How is the company really doing financially?<p>Those questions are exactly what Lawrence Rosen, Canada's foremost accounting authority and head of the forensic accounting firm of Rosen & Vettese in Toronto, wanted to answer. Rosen took Cott's financials and applied a more conservative accounting method called cash-flow analysis. "Pencer's management style is to enhance the bottom line, and you can do it under [Canadian] GAAP," says Rosen. "It is all an illusion. A cash analysis shows that this company is in deep trouble."<p>Rosen's calculations showed Cott's net earnings at $19 million in fiscal 1994 -- roughly half the $35 million Cott said it earned. This would mean the company earned 30 cents a share, not 60 cents as it reported for the year. <p>Based on Rosen's figures, Cott's stock trades at 108 times earnings, not 54 as reported earnings indicate. "GAAP is always showing you this nice rosy picture," he says. "In truth, you're looking down an elevator shaft." <p>Rosen also believes that Cott will run out of cash soon unless the company alters its management style. This is because Cott is paying big bucks to retailers to stock its merchandise and because it is carrying unusually high amounts of customer inventories on its books. <p>Here's what Cott spent on assets during fiscal 1994, in millions of dollars: $21 went to receivables -- money owed to Cott by suppliers or clients; $38 to inventories; $6 in payables; $2 each in bank loans and income taxes; $16 to "other assets"; $11 in goodwill. Subtract $1 million in prepaid expenses, and you have a $95 million cash outflow. <p>Yet Cott generated only $43 million in cash during the year, Rosen reckons, producing a shortfall of $52 million. This may be one reason the company visited the capital markets twice last year, raising $171 million.<p>Cott's shortfall would be of less concern if its investments were in tangibles like plant and equipment. But they were in inventories -- soft drinks and other products -- that may not get sold, receivables that may not be collected from customers, and goodwill that isn't sellable.<p>Joshua Livnat, chairman of the accounting department at New York University's Stern School of Business, echoes Rosen's views on Cott's cash flows. "You cannot really fudge the numbers when it comes to cash flows," he says. "They are investing substantially more than they are generating."<p>Cott's accounting may seem odd to outsiders, but to insiders it means a bigger paycheck. In March '92, Cott adopted a profit- participation plan under which certain executives receive a cash bonus equal to 10 percent of the company's pretax net income. The executives earn their bonuses if Cott earns at least 15 percent return on shareholders' equity during the year.<p>Not a bad incentive to push the company's pretax earnings and bolster assets in shareholders' equity. Indeed, in fiscal 1993, five honchos earned a total of $1.4 million under the profit plan. That's in addition to salaries totaling $1.2 million given to those five folks.<p>Between profit plans, salaries, and big insider stock sales, Pencer has gotten mighty rich off Cott's success. So have many shareholders who have ridden this rocket. But as accounting expert Rosen points out," Every day that Cott operates, it consumes much more cash than it generates from sales." Eventually, Rosen says, companies with such problems go under. <p>Pencer vigorously denies his accounting is aggressive. "We've gotten all the advice we need, including our auditor's," he says. "We just want to make sure we're doing things right." If Cott expensed costs and took an earnings hit, he says, average investors wouldn't understand. <p>Indeed, plenty of investors love Cott's stock. Major holders at year end were Florida's Sunbank Capital Management, mutual fund giant Twentieth Century in Kansas City, and Jundt Associates, a Minneapolis growth-stock firm. <p>Some investors may be relying on Wall Street analysts to alert them to problems at Cott. One analyst, Jennifer Solomon at Mabon Securities, recently put a sell recommendation on the stock largely because she's worried about increased competition for Cott. But Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer continue to recommend Cott shares aggressively. The two underwrote $171 million in Cott shares last year, earning big fees for their work.<p>Investors can't be expected to know how to plumb Cott's books; they're confusing at best. Remember: Accounting standards vary among countries and firms. Don't assume that all are equally clear and fair for shareholders.

						Barneys, America's merchant of cool, is boorishly behind on its bills. Is this just part of the attitude, or is the store in trouble? <p>By Alan G. Millstein<p>When all of new York City's glitterati turned out to view Barneys' bold new uptown fashion emporium last September 7, nobody had any idea of the financial fissures just below the store's glamorous surface. As tuxedoed waiters passed champagne and caviar, attendees oohed and aahed over the understatedly elegant store, designed in blond wood and sleek glass by star architect Peter Marino. <p>There wasn't a hotter ticket in town. Invitations to Barneys' Madison Avenue gala were harder to get than opening-night seats at the Metropolitan Opera. It looked like the Pressman clan--owner of the 17-store Barneys New York chain and the last of America's great retailing families--had a hit on its hands. All eight Pressmans involved in running the store basked in the limelight.<p>Little more than three months later, the Pressmans found themselves under the glare of a much harsher spotlight. The New York Times, one of the newspapers that had fawningly recounted the details of Barneys' opening-night triumph, reported that the store wasn't paying its bills to vendors and suppliers. In an article in the paper's style pages, Amy Spindler, a columnist and fashion reporter, revealed that several design firms had not been paid by Barneys for merchandise shipped in August for the new store's opening. The Times reported that some of the unpaid invoices were as much as three months past due. <p>Stung by its first taste of bad publicity, Barneys went on the attack. Behind the scenes, Charles W. Bunstine II, the company's chief operating officer, telephoned Spindler and threatened to get her fired. Bunstine doesn't deny threatening the reporter. He says he filed a complaint with an assistant managing editor at the paper, Warren Hoge, charging Spindler with errors owing to her "financial illiteracy." The Times printed an editor's note clarifying some details in the story. Spindler's reporting on the late payments, however, has since proved correct.<p>Publicly, the company showed a more benign face. Barneys released a public apology to its suppliers on December 16, blaming the payment problems on poor communications. Management claimed that distractions associated with the Madison Avenue opening created the slowdown in payments. "We are diligently working to remedy this communications issue," the company said, adding that its business was "incredibly healthy." The story died down.<p>But the damage to Barneys' well-sculpted facade had been done. While store management was claiming the check was in the mail, New York's fashion industry was beginning to wonder just how healthy Barneys was. <p>And the question still stands. As of February, lawsuits for nonpayment or late payment of bills continued to come in. Even more worrisome, a number of powerful credit agencies began advising clients to do business with Barneys on a cash-only basis, if at all. It was beginning to look like the store was in trouble.<p>As it happens, chiseling suppliers, manufacturers, and contractors has become a modus operandi for Eugene Pressman, 42, Barneys copresident and prime mover. (He shares his title with brother Robert, three years younger.) At work and at home, Pressman has become a particularly troubling kind of customer: very wealthy, very prestigious, and very tough to collect from.<p>Listen to Michael Ratner, president of Richter & Ratner, an 82-year-old construction firm that has done specialty cabinetry work for a number of Barneys stores. "The Pressman brothers [Eugene and Robert] make you feel that it is a privilege to do work for them," says Ratner, recalling several jobs his firm did as far back as 1991 in Chicago and Troy, Michigan. "I saw Gene by chance and told him I couldn't get his chief financial officer to return my calls about an open invoice for about $105,000. Gene just walked away without acknowledging that I existed."<p>Ratner's troubles with Barneys began last August, when he was owed almost $900,000 for cabinet work and construction-management services done on the Chicago store. In February, Ratner's company sued Barneys for $146,000 still owed for the work. "We worked for the Pressmans for more than eight years, and this was a very painful decision to sue them," says Ratner. "But they just failed to return over 90 phone calls about our unpaid invoices."<p>The tale of Barneys' troubles is worth telling for several reasons. The Pressmans are the last in a venerable American tradition--the close-knit but very big-league retailing family. Although the founder of the store, Eugene and Robert's grandfather Barney Pressman, was an immigrant discount-clothing merchant, the store that bears his name is now an upscale and innovative giant. If it is humbled, an era in merchandising will come to an end. Furthermore, Barneys is the gold standard in selling fashions to the affluent and successful set. Yet the manner in which the store conducts its business is anything but a textbook for success. <p>On a larger scale, the Barneys story appears to be a familiar one of overreaching by a third-generation son who had every privilege in his youth. Gene Pressman's days of getting whatever he wants, for himself or his business, may be over.<p>With the exception of Gene, who for years has maintained a high profile in New York business and society, the Pressman family is quite private. Because Barneys is a nonpublic operation, its accounting practices have been kept off the record for most of the seven decades the company has been in business. Almost all of the store's top management are Pressmans: Fred, the patriarch at age 71, is the chairman, though he's not active in the store. Copresidents Gene and Bob are his sons. Fred's wife, Phyllis, buys for the gift salons. Additional store responsibilities are assigned to Bob's wife, Holly; Gene's wife, Bonnie; and Fred's married daughters, Nancy Pressman Dressler and Liz Pressman Neubardt.<p>Gene Pressman would not make himself available for interviews for this story despite repeated requests. But interviews with more than two dozen people close to the Pressmans both personally and professionally show a pattern of hubris on his part that is remarkable even by the fashion industry's egomaniacal standards. <p>The brothers who control Barneys are not cut from the same cloth. Gene, boyishly handsome, trim and physically fit (he is said to run seven miles a day), was a man about town before he married Bonnie, a former runway model. Early on, he thought of going to Hollywood to become a film director. He is Barneys' tastemaker and style arbiter and is found front row and center at major fashion shows. His home is a waterfront estate in Westchester County, north of New York City.<p>Robert, bespectacled and heavier set, is the quieter of the two. He earned an M.B.A. from Pace University in New York City. He and his wife maintain an apartment in New York City and a house in Connecticut. He is Barneys' moneyman.<p>In 1990, Gene and Robert announced an expansion plan that called for 25 to 30 Barneys branch stores to be up and running across the nation by the end of 1994. Thus far, 12 branches have been opened in cities such as Seattle, Dallas, Houston, and Chicago. These stores range from 6,500 to 125,000 square feet and sell women's sportswear, accessories, and private-label and European designer menswear.<p>Now, Barneys' expansion plans have been drastically scaled back. The company is concentrating instead on enlarging existing stores and finding a number of downmarket outlet-mall locations. <p>Notwithstanding the store's Christmastime promises to make good on its bills, suppliers continued to file lawsuits against Barneys in early February. Three clothing manufacturers went to the courts seeking payments that totaled more than $100,000. A few weeks later, Charles Bunstine was still blaming the ongoing problems on computers, paperwork glitches, and even on himself.<p>Such talk is small consolation for the folks waiting to be paid. And those who know about the personal financial history of Barneys New York's leader might feel less consolation still. In the late 1980s, Gene was dogged by complaints from contractors and craftspeople hired to restore his sprawling Westchester home. Though he's certainly wealthy, Pressman was sued and threatened with suit a number of times for not paying his personal bills.<p>Pressman's home is a 100-year-old Tudor-style estate in Mamaroneck, on Long Island Sound. In the 1930s and 1940s, the home belonged to gangster Bugsy Siegel. <p>"When Gene took possession of the house and its grounds, it was in terrible shape," says Peter Marino, the architect responsible for the designs of most Barneys retail properties and several of the Pressman family's homes. "The Mamaroneck house was built in 1895, and it included a secret passageway from the waterfront docks to the basement. It was probably the way they moved the bootleg whiskey from ships waiting off Long Island Sound to Bugsy's house."<p>Marino prepared the architectural plans for the total renovation of the Mamaroneck estate. For him, the work was another Pressman success. <p>For the contractors who did the work, however, the renovation ended badly. On September 26, 1989, a mechanic's lien in the amount of $25,871.13 was placed on the Mamaroneck home by Walter Concrete Construction Corp. of Elmsford, New York. "This was the first time in 17 years in business that I had to sue someone to collect a bill," says Walter Lenz, president of the firm. "We were hired by the general contractor, Anmat of Rye, New York, to do extensive work on the pool area and surrounding foundations. What I remember most was the incredible arrogance of Gene Pressman, who was constantly making changes in the architect's site plans."<p>The original contract with Walter Concrete was for $88,215, and there was more than $17,000 in change orders. "When I tried to collect the balance due for our work, Pressman tried to chisel me down on the price, and that's when I decided to sue him," Lenz says. Suing didn't do much good. After three years, Lenz settled with Pressman for 40 cents on the dollar.<p>Another subcontractor on the Pressman job was Fairfield Dock, a 50-year-old Connecticut marine contractor engaged by Anmat to rebuild the property's dock area. "There were a number of change orders in the architect's plans, and when we billed the general contractor, we had to resort to threatening to sue Anmat to collect," says James Bradley, president of Fairfield Dock. <p>The saddest story of all about the renovations at the Pressman home involves Anmat, the general contractor. According to Fred Sciliano, former president of the company, Anmat worked inside and out on the home to the tune of nearly $800,000. "I spent one year of my life working on Gene Pressman's home, and the resulting problems and financial disputes over constant changes in the architect's plan left me with little or no profit at the end of the job," he says. <p>The troubles on the Pressman project, combined with the downturn in the economy in the late 1980s, ultimately caused Sciliano financial distress. "Working for them was a learning experience, that's for sure," says Sciliano. "So I decided to close my contracting business shortly after finishing the Pressman estate." Sciliano now works for a New York City construction company.<p>Sciliano's tale may have a familiar ring to Barneys' contractors and vendors back in Manhattan. David R. Corbin, president of New York--based Corbin Ltd., one of the nation's leading family-owned manufacturers of dress trousers, is one of the suppliers who filed suit against Barneys in February, for $68,614. "We had filed suit for payment from Barneys after waiting for more than five months for payment for our fall 1993 shipments," he says. Like Gene and Bob Pressman, Corbin is from his family's third generation in the business. "I have canceled spring shipments to the store, and I will not do business with them in the future even though my unpaid invoices were finally cleaned up in early February," he says.<p>Corbin is a small fish; he's not going to do any harm to Barneys, and he knows it. But if the cancellation of shipments should mushroom, if other manufacturers should follow Corbin's lead, the effect could be serious. Typically, when suppliers, manufacturers, or credit agencies (known in the business as "factors") get wind of a store's payment problems, shipments of merchandise slow or stop altogether. The store's offerings begin to look meager. Shoppers go elsewhere.<p>In the late 1980s, gene pressman hatched a grandiose retailing plan; but he needed someone to fund it. Isetan, a fourth-generation family-run retailer out of Japan, has taken on much of this burden. In 1990, according to an Isetan spokesman, the company put up between $125 million and $200 million in exchange for 75 percent of Barneys' stores in Japan, 25 percent of Barneys' U.S. stores, and 50 percent of the real estate under Barneys on East Oak Street in Chicago, on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, and on Madison Avenue in New York City. The agreement runs for 499 years.<p>Also shouldering part of the burden of Pressman's grand plan: Manufacturers, craftspeople, and suppliers who ship goods to Barneys, then bite their nails until they get paid. Some seem to feel they have no choice. The president of one outerwear manufacturer says he shipped to Barneys despite the recommendation of his factor not to do so. "I had not been paid for my fall outerwear shipments, but I desperately needed the exposure Barneys Madison Avenue offered to me in September," he says. <p>In February, Barneys finally paid the manufacturer $10,000 for merchandise shipped the previous August. The factor reversed its position, and the manufacturer planned to ship another $25,000 in goods for spring 1994.<p>The Pressman operation has long been known for playing tough with suppliers, according to Martin Greenfield, president of an eponymous men's tailored-clothing manufacturer that counts President Clinton among its customers. Greenfield worked with Barney and Fred Pressman during the 1950s and '60s. "If I needed a cutting ticket to keep my factory in Brooklyn going during the off-season," Greenfield says, "I would call Fred and make a deal for a couple thousand suits." Greenfield says Fred was notorious for squeezing suppliers for inside prices. "He left me with little or no profit, but he saved my business when I needed the work," says Greenfield. <p>Barney Pressman, according to Greenfield, lived and breathed retailing. "I knew Barney for more than 40 years," he says, "and all he liked to do was talk business--even when we vacationed in Florida." This dedication to hard work helped the store defy, for six full decades, the age-old retailing maxim that success depends on location, location, location. On 17th Street and Seventh Avenue in a nondescript downtown neighborhood known as Chelsea, Barneys made its name as New York's leading retailer of high-quality men's clothing; it had no competition when it came to breadth of selection for men of all sizes and shapes. Radio ads built the store's traffic in the 1930s, saying, "Calling all men to Barneys from 34 extra short to 56 extra tall, we fit them all."<p>In the 1970s, young Gene Pressman was beginning to fancy himself the Leonardo da Vinci of retailing. And make no mistake about it: He has brought dramatic changes in the family business. First he went upmarket, aggressively pursuing Italian menswear designers like Giorgio Armani and Brioni in the '70s. He also developed a thriving women's business from scratch. Later, he conceived of his audacious design for the new flagship on Madison Avenue and shops across the U.S.<p>Barneys' foray into women's wear came as a direct result of threats made by Gene to his father and grandfather that he would leave the needles and pins of Seventh Avenue for Hollywood if they didn't go along with his plans. Barney himself persuaded the rest of the family to gamble on Gene's dream.<p>The women's store downtown grew from 6,000 square feet in 1981 to 70,000 square feet in 1986. But Gene may have been frustrated. It was becoming clear that his effort to lure the beautiful people to shop on lower Seventh Avenue was more difficult than he had thought. The ladies who lunch and then shop till they drop remained uptown, habitues of Bergdorf's, Saks, and Bloomingdale's. Gene decided in the 1980s that if the chic and sleek female shoppers wouldn't travel downtown, then Barneys would go uptown.<p>It was a plan audacious enough to fit Gene Pressman's grandiose vision of retailing in the '90s. He would bring a venerable downtown institution uptown--to the toniest shopping corridor in New York City. The move was about nothing if not competition: The site was within walking distance of the three B's of retail fashion: Bloomingdale's, Bergdorf's and Bendel's.<p>In November of 1990, the Pressmans and Isetan purchased the ground floor and eight additional stories of retail condominium space from Metropolitan Life at Madison Avenue and 61st Street. Then, in another bold move to capitalize on the weak real estate market, the store announced in December 1992 that it was purchasing floors 10 through 24 in an all-cash deal. Three of the additional floors would be used by Barneys as executive offices, and the rest of the space would be leased to outside tenants.<p>And so it was that Gene Pressman's uptown obsession took its final shape. The 230,000-square-foot store would be the first new department store built in midtown Manhattan since the early 1920s, when Edwin Goodman moved his family's fur salon and custom tailor shop, Bergdorf Goodman, to Fifth Avenue at 57th Street. <p>But all was not well for Isetan back in Japan. It had opened Barneys stores in Tokyo and Yokohama, but for several years the company had experienced profit declines. The country's grinding recession had created a drop in consumer spending on luxury goods. Shuwa Corp., a real estate conglomerate that was the Tokyo-based retailer's largest shareholder, bailed out of almost all its 29 percent stake in Isetan. In May 1993, Isetan's president, Kuniyasu Kosuge, a member of the store's founding family, abruptly resigned.<p>Fast on the heels of Isetan's troubles came the first talk of cost overruns at Madison Avenue. The store, budgeted at $80 to $90 million, came in at a final cost of $140 million, 65 percent over plan."You could work with Fred, but it's Gene that calls the shots on the retail stores and their design," says Michael Ratner of Richter & Ratner. "I was told Gene's constant changes in design plans and the overtime costs were running over $1 million a week during the months prior to the store's opening. It's hard to believe, but Gene just doesn't care what things cost." <p>Owen Steel Co. of Columbia, South Carolina, which supplied the new store with structural steel, was among the first to file liens on the store. It put a mechanic's lien on the company last August for $106,372 in unpaid invoices. Several designers of accessories and apparel went on the record with stories of slow payments. WWD, the newspaper to the fashion trade, reported that Abba Accessories filed suit to recover almost $30,000 in unpaid invoices. John Bartlett, winner of the 1993 Council of Fashion Designers' Perry Ellis Award as outstanding young menswear designer, says that payment of his invoices was between 90 days and five months late. "For the small designer, it's difficult," he says, "because to be in Barneys is a huge privilege."<p>At the height of the Christmas selling season, a month after stories started trickling out about Barneys' slow payments, WWD ran a page-one article on the subject. The paper's top financial reporter, Sidney Rutberg, tried to sort out the company's financial condition and identified a group of manufacturers who said that the company's failure to pay its bills in a timely fashion was made more aggravating by its habit of not returning phone calls to vendors who complained.<p>Adding insult to injury for the small vendors, the WWD story said that some high-profile firms who sold to Barneys were "getting paid without undue delay." A spokeswoman for high-profile designer Donna Karan says, "We have no problem with Barneys." Architect Marino says he receives a check every Friday from the store for the work he has billed. <p>The WWD story reported numbers for the quarter ending October 1, 1993, which included the preopening expenses of the Madison Avenue store. The store group had net sales of $79.3 million versus $43.7 million in the same quarter of the previous year. Cash on hand was $22 million, with accounts payable of $42 million and inventory of $68 million. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization--an important measure of financial health--were $6.7 million, up from $3.8 million for the 1992 quarter. Same-store sales were up 14 percent. <p>Chief operating officer Bunstine confirms these numbers. He further estimates that 1993--1994 storewide sales will meet the company's projections of $400 million. He says that all of Barneys' stores, in New York and out, are profitable: "The Madison Avenue store will do about $150 million in sales during its first year in operation, and 17th Street will be in excess of $50 million." Interestingly, this last figure is down considerably from Bunstine's earlier projections of "slightly under $100 million" in sales downtown; the uptown store may be cannibalizing 17th Street's business. <p>Christmas was just fair for Barneys nationwide because, as Bunstine puts it, "We have never been a destination store for holiday gift items." Nonetheless, for the second quarter, ending January 31, 1994, the flagship store was ahead of plan, Bunstine says. <p>The fact that Gene Pressman lives in Bugsy Siegel's old home is an irony, given Barneys' recent bill-paying imbroglio. Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel, bootlegger and bookmaker, is often credited with the idea of turning a dusty desert gulch into a glitzy gold mine called Las Vegas. Siegel used charm, good looks, and guile to develop the Flamingo Hotel, Las Vegas' first world-class hotel and casino.<p>Siegel was obsessed with the minutiae of architectural design and interior decoration, and his desert resort came to fruition at twice its estimated construction costs. The overruns eventually led to Siegel's financial ruin and ultimately cost him his life. The modern-day Moses of slots and craps brought about one of the great business ideas of the century, the legalized temple of chance. But he never saw the promised land.<p>Will gene pressman's obsession with upscale, uptown retailing, New York style, be his Achilles' heel as Las Vegas glitz was Bugsy Siegel's? It's too soon to call. The jury is still out on the unusual layout and design of the Madison Avenue store, in which the men's and women's departments are essentially different stores. Some say the success of Gap stores demonstrates that couples like to shop together, not apart, on weekends; others marvel at the atmosphere Gene has created. (See "How Does the Madison Avenue Store Measure Up?")<p>The jury also remains out on Barneys' financial future. Is the Madison Avenue store a financial success? If cost overruns on the store haven't placed Barneys on shakier financial footing, why have payments to vendors been so slow--is it a matter of attitude or of ability to pay? Will the store get future shipments in a timely fashion? <p>Unlike retailers that have gotten into financial trouble because of heavy debt loads--Macy's and Federated are recent examples--Barneys has traditionally avoided leverage. That may be changing. In mid-February the company was said to be securing a loan for an undisclosed amount from a consortium of insurance companies and Chemical Bank.<p>Even with this capital, Barneys may not be out of the woods. The store is still behind on its payments to some smaller fashion resources--the very folks that make Barneys unique. If they were to stop shipping, the store would lose much of its high-fashion edge.<p>In fact, that kind of behavior might prompt the credit agencies to continue to advise against shipping to Barneys. Three of the largest credit-checking advisory agencies in New York--Bernard Sands, Credit Exchange, and Solo--have expressed strong negative opinions about the store's past and present credit history.<p>"Barneys is a sick chicken with fundamental cash-flow problems, and we recommend that our clients ship to them on a cash-only basis," says Richard Posner of Credit Exchange. But Posner, who has worked in the credit-checking business for 47 years, believes manufacturers will ship Barneys the goods they need for spring 1994. "When Saks went through its problems with the financial factors several years ago, every manufacturer shipped them out the back door," he says. Posner speculates that part of Barneys' current problems came about as a result of cost overruns associated with the Madison Avenue store. <p>A spokesman for Bernard Sands Credit Agency also confirms that his company is suggesting that its clients not ship orders to Barneys for the time being. "We would like to see the year-end statement before making a definitive recommendation on future credit for the store," says one of Sands' top executives.<p>Unlike in the old days, Barneys' greatest asset today is its location. The decision by Gene Pressman to develop a significant women's fashion business and to take on the heavyweights of midtown retailing is fraught with risk. But in pushing through his big idea, Gene Pressman is following in the footsteps of other retail giants of this century who had a commitment to their dreams. These include Stanley Marcus of Neiman-Marcus, Adam Gimbel of Saks, Bendel's Geraldine Stutz, Bergdorf's Ira Neimark, and designer-retailer Ralph Lauren. <p>Gene Pressman is New York's last great retail showman, and like his grandfather before him, he's a man who loves the rag game. But the difference between downtown retailing and the uptown carriage trade is that the great uptown showmen always wore velvet gloves. Unlike Pressman, they never had to, or thought to, bare their knuckles.<p><p>Sidebar: How Does the Madison Avenue Store Measure Up?<p>We asked three of New York's most incisive and intuitive fashion and retailing authorities for their opinions of Barneys' uptown emporium. One hit, one miss, one mixed review.<p>Ruth Ann Britten, a New York--based retail consultant and former owner of a major fashion buying office: "Barneys' point of view is too narrow in women's wear. There are not enough clothes for women over 50 years old who can afford Barneys prices. The Chelsea Passage  [the in-store gift shop] looks like an updated Pottery Barn. Their buyers seem to reach for the most esoteric items in major designer lines--the Armani collection looked like a sea of maid's uniforms. The store didn't take markdowns fast enough to compete with Bergdorf's or Bloomingdale's on winter clothes. The footwear department had too many combat boots. Most of the handbags were bizarre, and the jewelry looked like it belonged in a craft show in Greenwich Village. Why so many black dresses?"<p>Vicki Ross, owner of Vicki Ross Associates, a major New York--based buying office for fine women's apparel and accessories: "Why are men's and women's apparel floors separated? Only savvy shoppers know that you get from the men's store to the women's store on even-numbered floors using a back door. Downtown's Chelsea Passage is much more inventive than uptown's. The clothes have an antiestablishment look to them and the absence of color was a real mistake. The sales help are very knowledgeable; the doormen are adorable and will park your car for you if you give them a tip."<p>Marjorie Deane, publisher of The Tobe Report, a weekly merchandising magazine for retailers: "Barneys has a particular customer in mind, and they are providing a wonderful shopping experience by the exquisite use of neutral-colored wood and glass to create a calm and comfortable retail environment. It's nice to see so many couples with baby strollers in the store on weekends. There's an abundance of black clothes, but that's what's selling at retail. The gift department is wonderful. I've been shopping for myself after office hours because they're open until eight in the evening. The Mad61 restaurant is a great place to people watch; it seems that every woman who eats there owns a fur coat."
