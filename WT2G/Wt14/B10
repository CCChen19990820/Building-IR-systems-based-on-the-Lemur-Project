Worth magazine/Feature<p>THE STATE OF STATE TAXES
Wyoming gives citizens the best services for their tax dollars. Guess which state gives its citizens the worst? A report on the local conditions and the national mood.<p>By Jeff Blyskal<p>As election day approaches, antitax fever continues to roil an exceptionally cranky electorate, leaving state officials decidedly spooked. To assuage this anger, 21 states have cut a combined $2.7 billion in taxes already, and candidates are promising billions more, according to the Center of the Study of the States in Albany, New York. "We are seeing a huge, populist antitax rebellion," says 
Stephen Moore, director of fiscal-policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington, D.C. "It is real, it is incredibly intense, and it will lead to dramatic changes in the way states do business." <p>For example, Oregon voters are now getting set to vote on the Taxpayer Protection Initiative, a measure requiring majority voter approval of any new or increased taxes or fees. Last year, angry New Jersey voters booted incumbent governor Jim Florio out of office after he broke his 1989 campaign promise not to increase taxes and instead let fly with a $2.8 billion tax hike. That loss didn't go unnoticed by New York governor Mario Cuomo, who suddenly promised a $1.5 billion tax cut last August -- if reelected. His new colleague to the south, New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman, who slashed taxes dramatically once she took her seat in Trenton, says, "Taxpayers know that if you cut the supply of money, the government has to go on a diet." And if it doesn't, the fear in statehouses is that residents will flee. <p>However, as voters get set to knock state tax hikes back into their elected officials' calculators, some may be going about their civic duty in a purblind manner. Oregon provides decent state services for the tax dollar, which would seem to argue against passage of a highly restrictive bill. And angry New Jersey voters may have overlooked the fact that their state and local tax bite as a percentage of per capita income is only slightly higher than the national average, while government services are better than in most other states. <p>Meanwhile, New Yorkers annually get smacked by the heaviest state and local tax sledgehammer in the land, and in return they receive dismal state and local services.<p>Curiously, New York residents continue to obey their legislators like sheep before the tax prod. We left several telephone messages at the New York Taxpayers Alliance, which sources told us is the most effective antitax lobby in the state, to see if any New York tea party was brewing. The Alliance never called back.<p>No smart buyer determines the value of any deal by looking at just the price. The question is: What are voters really getting in return for their tax dollars? <p>That's tough to answer. Standardized measures of service quality are virtually nonexistent in the government sector, where "don't ask, don't tell" has long been the policy. "There are amazingly few good quality indicators to compare state-by-state performance," says Iris Lav, director of state and local programs at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington think tank that studies government spending. <p>To fill this information vacuum, Worth, in consultation with the Center for the Study of the States; the Corporation for Enterprise Development (CFED) in Washington, D.C.; and State Budget & Tax News in Columbus, Ohio, conducted a statistical analysis to find out which state delivered the best service for the lowest tax cost. We calculated each state and local government's levies as a percentage of per capita income. We then correlated those numbers with government-service ratings in five major categories over which state and local governments exert great influence -- education, welfare, health and hospitals, highways, and law enforcement. <p>(The rankings from our analysis can be found in "The State Of State Taxes - TABLE" further down in this file.)<p>We started this project with the harsh but realistic view that every state must work with the demographic and economic hand it has been dealt. That means we had little sympathy for poverty and illiteracy in the South or the urban and infrastructure decay of the Northeast. By the same token, we didn't make adjustments for the blessings -- including federal subsidies -- that some states enjoy more than others. State and local governments, ideally with their residents' input, set the agenda for government action. If education is a true priority, the state will produce better education. Furthermore, these states have had decades to develop service strategies -- it's their responsibility to make the most of what they have.<p>We also looked beyond conventional measures to gauge performance. Take welfare. We did not rely on the amount of money doled out by bureaucrats as a standard of quality, since the $5.3 trillion in taxpayer money spent on poverty programs over the last 30 years or so has not wiped out this problem. According to a 1992 Census Bureau report, the most effective way for the government to beat poverty is to educate its people and support economic development. So we measured how a state fosters job growth. <p>The overall winner: Wyoming. Runner-up: Alaska. At the bottom of the pile: New York. Wyoming beat the pack largely because of its high-quality education and health programs. Wyoming's students-per-teacher ratio of 14 is 30 percent lower than the national average of 20 students per teacher, and 89 percent of the population has a high school diploma or better -- the third highest in the nation. Since poverty tends to be associated with low educational attainment, it should be no surprise that Wyoming has the ninth-lowest poverty level. Wyoming also has the greatest number of public hospital beds per 100,000 population, and a very low infant-mortality rate of 6.8 per 1,000 live births, compared with 8.5 nationwide.<p>In Alaska, the student-teacher ratio is a better-than-average 17, SAT scores are 911 versus the national average of 902, and 94 percent of students are enrolled in public universities, where tuition is 75 percent lower than at private schools. The number of residents achieving high school graduation or better is high (89 percent), and poverty is low (10 percent). <p>Wyoming and Alaska residents also enjoy low out-of-pocket tax costs. That's partly because each state is annually subsidized with severance taxes paid by oil, gas, and coal companies that extract natural resources there. The Wyoming state government gets $254 million, Alaska almost $1.5 billion (our calculations took these figures into account). A state's population, however, determines the average amount of each resident's subsidy. Populous Texas, for example, sucks in $1.4 billion in severance taxes, but the per capita subsidy amounts to only $78. In Wyoming, the per capita subsidy is $550; in Alaska it's $2,600. Despite such subsidies, both Wyoming and Alaska rank high because each turned in a stellar service performance, not just because of their low tax bite. Nothing lasts forever, by the way: Alaska, after several years of slumping oil royalties, is considering enacting its first income or sales tax. <p>How bad can bad value for the tax dollar get? New York and Hawaii are the pits by a wide margin. Empire State residents suffer a barracuda-like 14.1 percent effective tax bite, and in return they receive government services that are shoddy in key areas. Student-teacher ratios are mediocre, and SAT scores on average are 14 points lower than the national average. And just 57 percent of students are enrolled in public colleges and universities. Sure, New York is home to many private schools. But given a choice between a New York state school and a private one costing four times more in annual tuition and fees -- $35,000 more over four years -- many students are choosing private schools. Consumers are clearly voting on perceived quality with their dollars and their feet.<p>Despite the fact that 81 percent of New Yorkers have a high school diploma or better, 15.3 percent of its residents live below the $14,764 poverty line established by the federal government for a family of four, versus a national average of 14.3 percent. And Democratic senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York believes that the state's poverty rate is actually understated because of the high cost of living there. The state also has a high crime rate, and the arrest rate for violent crimes is a lackluster 32 percent. Sixty-six percent of New York's bridges are functionally obsolete, the worst record in the nation. Overall, the state's highways are great, with 58 percent rated first-class. New York also posts an infant mortality rate of 8.5 per 1,000 live births, which is about average. <p>If you dream of beautiful beaches and universal health care coverage in Hawaii, a whopping 13.1 percent effective tax rate comes with the move. Hawaii offers only 100 public hospital beds per 100,000 people. Just 34 percent of the highways are first class, and 53 percent of the bridges are functionally obsolete. Also, crime rates in paradise are high, though the police do make arrests in an admirable 45 percent of violent crimes. The student-teacher ratio of 24 is substandard, but the poverty rate is low at 11 percent, and Hawaii's infant mortality rate is one of the best in the country.<p><p>Lately, delivering value for the tax dollar has been harder for state governments, as many have been forced to enact austerity measures that have pinched efforts to improve their residents' quality of life. As the service sector grows, sales taxes -- which typically dun product sales but not services -- bring in less money. States are undergoing a "low-grade fiscal crisis," says Ron Snell, fiscal program director of the National Conference of State Legislatures.<p>This dismal climate, though, hasn't precluded some states from slashing their taxes and working on their efficiency and productivity. For example, Texas comptroller John Sharp got the state legislature to approve an estimated $6.2 billion in savings since 1991. State officials intend, at least, to avoid cutting vital services. <p>The jury is still out on whether that can be done. For example, in 39th-ranked California, the effects of Proposition 13 are decidedly mixed. Proposition 13, which was approved by voters on June 6, 1978, held property taxes to 1 percent of assessed levels in 1975 and limited future increases to the annual rate of inflation or to 2 percent, whichever was lower. (When a property is sold, it is then reassessed at current fair-market value.) The measure knocked California from the fourth-highest-taxed state in the land to the 26th by 1988. Since the measure passed, state residents have enjoyed millions in property-tax reductions -- some estimates place it as high as $200 billion. <p>However, government unions and politicians have worked the media to blame these tax cuts for every ill wind blowing through the state, from the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway in the 1989 San Francisco earthquake to last year's murder of Polly Klaas. Quality in some services has eroded, while in others -- most notably law enforcement and health -- it has actually improved. "Anyone who says Proposition 13 has wrecked California is exaggerating," says Hal Hovey, publisher of State Budget & Tax News.<p>Debates about Proposition 13 are still heard in California, but many of them ignore this fact: The government has found ways around the property-tax restrictions. Lost property-tax revenues have been replaced with increased state and local user fees and levies, according to the California Taxpayers Association. And property-tax revenues to date have recovered 25 percent. <p>According to Stephen Kroes, research director for the California Taxpayers Association, California's taxes, fees, and other hidden costs today eat up the same 16 percent of personal income they did before Proposition 13. California now has a higher tax burden than 35 other states. Meanwhile, state spending is rising in some key areas. Between 1976 and 1990, inflation-adjusted per capita state and local spending in California, while up only 1 percent on education, rose 7 percent on welfare, 17 percent on fire protection, and 22 percent on police. <p>Furthermore, the circumstances that created billion-dollar budget deficits in the early '90s predate Proposition 13, according to a study that was released last April by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, D.C. The report says that these fiscal woes stem from structural problems in the tax system, including declining sales-tax yields and misguided policy priorities that have been in place since the mid-1970s. Recent defense layoffs, natural disasters, and immigration troubles exacerbated these problems.<p>Amid this fiscal tumult, how has California performed? By many measures, it has improved. Since 1977, the number of students per teacher in grades K-12 has declined 15 percent, from 33 to 28, according to Market Data Retrieval, an education-research firm in Shelton, Connecticut. Today, 80 percent of Californians age 25 or older have a high school diploma or better, versus 74 percent in 1980. Furthermore, the crime rate in California is down 5 percent since 1977 versus a 12 percent increase nationwide. And the percentage of first-class pavement on California interstates, freeways, and rural arterial roads rose from 51 percent in 1980 to 61 percent in 1992, according to Federal Highway Administration statistics.<p>These numbers shine an even harsher light on the lower-ranked states. Compare California's position in our rankings with New York's, and remember: New York never had a measure like Proposition 13. Small wonder 37 percent of Californians believe it was a net positive versus 25 percent who judge it a net negative, according to a 1992 Los Angeles Times poll. <p>As voters now mull over their ballot choices, they should consider this question: Can government cutbacks be accomplished without sacrificing service? We think yes. But as voters cut through the hype this fall and beyond, they should watch out for tax cuts blending into tax-shifting schemes and monitor real measures of quality in their state, not just the amount of dollars spent on local programs.

---------------
The rankings listed below are derived from a basket of 14 
service-quality indicators provided by 11 government and private
sources. All data is from 1992 or later.<p>We started with total state and local taxes as a percentage of
of per capita income. By calculating state and local taxes in 
this manner, we eliminated distortions caused by differing income
levels between the states. The result is seen under the heading
"Tax Bite." Each state's tax bite was converted into a tax-cost
score ranging from 1 to 11.<p>We then produced a "State-Benefit Score" by assessing each state's
performance in five major areas -- education, welfare, health 
and hospitals, highways, and law enforcement.<p>To arrive at the "State-Benefit Score, we weighted the five 
benefit categories based on the national averages for government
expenditures compiled by the Advisory Commission on Inter-
governmental Relations: education, 49 percent; welfare, 21
percent; health and hospitals, 13 percent; highways, 11 percent;
and law enforcement, 6 percent. Thus high marks in education 
carried the most weight. Other expenditures, such as each state's
costs for debt service and administration, were not included.
The weighted scores for each category were converted into the
"State-Benefit Score," ranging from 1 to 11, with 11 being 
the best.<p>The "Tax-Cost" and "State-Benefit" scores were added together
to arrive at the total "TAX-VALUE SCORE." (In the event of a tie,
states are listed alphabetically.) The higher the "TAX-VALUE
SCORE," the better.<p>-- by Jeff Blyskal<p>(NOTE: IF YOU DISPLAY THE TABLE BELOW IN A MONOSPACED FONT, SUCH AS COURIER, THE COLUMNS WILL LINE UP CORRECTLY.)<p>THE TAX-VALUE RANKINGS

Worth magazine/Advisors<p>A BETTER MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUT
Why the marriage penalty should be eliminated.<p>By Elizabeth MacDonald<p>For the last two years, President Clinton has teased taxpayers with the possibility of a middle-class tax cut. Candidate Clinton promised he would pay for this tax break -- a $300 tax credit for all families -- largely through a rate increase from 31 percent to 36 percent for the wealthiest taxpayers. President Clinton did the second part, but quickly abandoned the other half of his campaign pledge upon taking office. Now the White House is refloating the tax-cut balloon, even though the president's economic advisors warn it would burst a $60 billion hole after four years in the 1993 deficit-reduction act. <p>There's a better way to give middle-class taxpayers a break without blowing the deficit out of the water. Obliterate the onerous marriage penalty, a tax-law glitch that has stung two-earner married couples for the last 35 years. Thanks to this penalty, these couples pay far more in taxes than they would have if they hadn't tied the knot. <p>According to a 1994 study by Princeton University's Center for Economic Policy Research, which looked at 96,589 tax returns filed in 1989, an estimated 52 percent of all joint filers will pay an extra $1,244 more this year on average than they would if they divorced. The total sting for married couples: $33 billion nationwide. <p>Meanwhile, the tax structure benefits households in which one spouse remains at home while the other goes off to work. According to the Princeton study, roughly 38 percent of all joint filers are subsidized by the tax law to the tune of $27 billion. That amounts to an annual $6 billion net marriage tax paid by American couples, which is equal to 40 percent of the cost of the middle-class tax cut Clinton promised. Ironically, Clinton's tax-law changes actually made the marriage penalty much worse since two new high rates were introduced. <p>The marriage penalty takes its first swipe through the progressive tax-rate structure. While the break points at which brackets change are higher for joint filers than for individuals, they are not twice as high. As a result, joint filers become subject to higher income-tax rates at lower levels of combined taxable income than if they filed as single individuals. For example, a single person who earned $75,000 in taxable income in 1994 will be taxed at 28 percent on the first $55,100 and at 31 percent for the rest. If that person married someone earning $75,000, they would owe 31 percent on income above $91,850 up to $140,000. <p>Households that have reached the golden age of income parity between the sexes get smacked the hardest. Kevin Roach, a tax partner at Price Waterhouse in New York, says that if those two $75,000 taxpayers filed individually, they would each pay a tax of $18,640 (not accounting for exemptions or deductions), or $37,280 total. If they made that trip to the altar, they would owe an additional $2,025 marriage tax. <p>The marriage penalty also occurs because the total standard deduction on a joint return is less than the sum of the deductions on two individual returns. Last year unmarried partners got a total $7,400 ($3,700 each) standard deduction, versus $6,200 for joint filers. Furthermore, in 1993 both joint and single itemizers had to reduce certain deductions by an amount equal to 3 percent of their adjusted gross income in excess of $108,450. Joint filers also get stung by the phaseout of their personal exemptions, which occurs at $162,700, versus $108,450 for individuals. <p>The story of the marriage tax begins in 1913, when the individual income tax was enacted. Back then, married couples were required to file separately if they each had income. Couples in community-property states were allowed to split their income 50-50 and therefore lessen their federal tax bite. Couples in common-law states, however, were required to pay tax according to which spouse actually earned the income.<p>Congress tried to fix this inequity in its Revenue Act of 1948, which let all married couples pay their taxes as if each spouse earned exactly half of their total income, regardless of what each actually earned. After much squawking by single filers, in 1969 lawmakers effectively eliminated income splitting and reduced the tax-rate schedule of single returns relative to that of joint returns. In so doing, the marriage penalty was born.<p>In 1981, Congress tried to fix this problem by letting two-earner married couples reduce their taxable income by 10 percent of the lower-earning spouse's wages, with a $2,000 maximum. In 1986, Congress repealed this deduction but slightly softened the marriage-tax blow by reducing marginal tax rates and increasing the standard deduction for joint returns. Clinton's creation of two more tax brackets kicked it right back into married couples' laps.<p>Throughout this tax-bill merry-go-round, Congress seems to have missed an obvious change in the American family. More two-earner households exist than ever before. According to the Census Bureau, between 1982 and 1992, the number of two-earner households rose 22.3 percent, to 33.6 million. Says Harvey Rosen, professor of economics at Princeton University and co-author of the study, "The code was written for the Beaver Cleaver family, but it's the '90s." <p>Fixing this problem won't be easy. A flat tax may do it, but "it would have to be as high as 21 percent in order to bring in the same amount of federal revenues," says New York tax attorney Lee Sheppard. "That rate, though, will slam poorer people." Tax experts agree that the current law is highly divisive. "Why is Congress increasing taxes based on marital status?" asks Sheppard. "Why should men with high incomes whose wives do not need to work be allowed to pay lower taxes?" <p>Instead, Sheppard thinks the U.S. tax law should allow all taxpayers, even married couples, to file as singles using the individual tax-rate schedule, as they do in Britain. Deductions would be taken according to who earned the income related to the writeoffs, and parents could split a child's personal exemptions. However, a British husband must report capital income in its entirety on his return, regardless of which spouse earned it. That's one tax change Americans would most likely balk at. <p>To fix that problem, splitting such income between spouses won't work. Changing the law to let taxpayers do just that would provide a fertile ground for more inequity in the tax system, as married couples could try to effectively lower their tax bills if they are in different tax brackets. One solution: Everyone should pay his or tax on that income according to who earned it.<p>It seems that Washington is finally listening. Two Democratic congressmen, Ernest Istook of Oklahoma and James Moran of Virginia, have introduced separate bills to get rid of the marriage penalty by letting married couples file as individuals. Republicans in Congress now want a bigger standard deduction and higher income thresholds at which top rates apply for married filers. They're also pushing for a $500 tax credit per child; Clinton is hinting at a $1,000 credit. Both Rosen and Sheppard, though, say a credit and a larger standard deduction do nothing to solve the marriage-tax problem -- income splitting and the differences in the tax brackets between joint and single filers are at the root of this mess.<p>Whatever the outcome, the federal government can't count on a steady cash flow from the marriage penalty making its way into federal coffers much longer. According to the Census Bureau, the number of married adults is roughly 60 percent, down from 72 percent in 1970. And more middle-aged and senior citizens are choosing to live together rather than get married. A 1994 study by the American Association of Retired Persons in Washington, D.C., says 1.6 million midlife and older people now share households as unmarried partners or roommates; 46 percent are aged 55 or older. "Taxes could be one factor causing this trend," says Deborah Chalfie, a senior program specialist at AARP. <p>For now, married partners usually won't get a benefit from filing separately because the break points for doing so are exactly half those for joint filers. One small piece of advice: High-income taxpayers who are planning to get married before the year is out may want to wait until the new year -- their tax savings could be enough to pay for both the reception and the honeymoon.<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>HOW THE IRS DOES ITS AUDIT SNOOPING
The IRS is targeting its audits to cut the tax gap.<p>By George Guttman<p>Since 1988, Congress has been leaning on the IRS to cut the tax gap -- the amount that taxpayers owe but the feds don't get each year. The General Accounting Office says that amount ballooned from $87 billion in 1988 to $127 billion in 1992. One reason for this rise is a precipitous drop in the audit rate, down from roughly 5 percent in 1965 to just 0.7 percent today.<p>To fix this decline, the IRS plans to increase the $5.8 billion in extra taxes, penalties, and interest it demands from audited taxpayers by doing more audits. Last year the IRS unveiled a spanking new audit approach dubbed the market-segment-specialization program. Through this program, the IRS is lumping taxpayers with similar occupations, businesses, or tax issues into one of more than 100 market segments. Each segment has its very own IRS audit guide instructing agents to follow certain audit benchmarks and guidelines. <p>So far, guides have been publicly released for these nine groups: air-charters, attorneys, bed and breakfast owners, gasoline retailers, mortuaries, the entertainment industry, taxpayers claiming losses from passive investments, taxicab owners, and truckers. Regular wage earners who have their income tax withheld will be stuck in one of three segments, depending on their income. <p>IRS officials, long outgunned by sophisticated CPAs and tax lawyers, now say that grouping taxpayers and training auditors to become specialists in a given market segment will translate into bigger audit bucks. That means tougher times for anyone falling into a group covered by one of the guides. "The IRS is auditing us left and right in Missouri because of the guide," says a funeral director in Excelsior Springs, Missouri. And experts say businesses not yet covered by a guide aren't being touched. What's more, an IRS examination official says, "The audit chances for individuals whose income is subject to withholding will probably decrease because half of our 16,000 auditors will be assigned to business market segments full-time." <p>To get the inside dope on how to prepare for an audit shootout, we looked at three IRS audit guides. We were especially interested in the guide for lawyers because it hints at the tactics the IRS intends to use for all professional categories. So doctors and dentists need to pay attention to this one, too.<p>Among other things, we learned that the IRS plans to hunt for nonfiling lawyers by matching names it picks up from professional directories or yellow-pages advertising with its computer records. It will then compile a dossier on an attorney's educational and legal background by clipping newspaper articles. The IRS will then check for underreporting by comparing the taxpayer's income to where that person went to law school, presuming that a prestigious one indicates future affluence.<p>Besides poring through ledgers and expense reports, the IRS also plans to devote particular scrutiny to small firms -- the agency thinks the smaller the outfit, the easier it is to pocket cash payments or not report a contingent fee. Criminal and immigration attorneys are often assumed to be paid in cash. The IRS will also check whether a real estate attorney was paid with an ownership interest or a second trust deed in a real estate deal, taxable income that's hard to find. <p>Next, IRS agents will look for unreported income spirited away in fancy cars registered with state motor-vehicle departments, boats listed with the Coast Guard, and airplanes filed with the FAA. Finally, the IRS will fight tooth and nail any deductions taken for, say, lavish trips to visit clients in Aspen in January -- such trips smack of a vacation.<p>According to the bed-and-breakfast guide, the IRS apparently intends to take a shotgun approach with small businesses by haranguing the owners over everything in sight. The guide says to look for unreported income in the form of room-cancellation charges, fees for pets and kids, and referral fees. The IRS will also question owners on whether they personally used the business's food, housing, and utilities. If so, certain business writeoffs may be disallowed as personal expenses. <p>If, like many small businesses, the B&B has reported a loss for three years out of the past five years, the IRS may check to see if the inn took out any newspaper or magazine ads during that time. If there were none, then the IRS will be more inclined to reject the B&B's professed intent to make a profit and deem the operation a hobby that cannot deduct losses in excess of income. <p>High-income taxpayers with sophisticated investments may want to check the passive-activity loss guide to bulletproof their investments. This guide shows that the IRS loves it when taxpayers forget to attach forms. If a taxpayer reports a passive loss but does not include form 8582 (Passive Activity Loss Limitation), the IRS will probably audit schedule E for investment losses or schedule C for equipment or vehicle rentals. Auditors are also told to be highly suspicious of schedule C's entitled Real Estate Management and schedule A's with large investment-interest deductions. <p>By reading their market-segment guide, taxpayers and small businesses can keep better records and modify certain practices to ease a protracted audit. Tax Analysts (800-955-2444), a D.C. publishing group, is the cheapest source for the guides; it charges $25 apiece. <p><p><p>

						How to be cautious when you're feeling generous.<p>By Troy Segal<p>Every year, it seems, some fresh charity scandal hits the headlines. The occasional news of high-living nonprofit honchos or of outright fraudulent practices among charity organizations is enough to cast doubt on the entire industry. Last January, for instance, Pennsylvania officials received a $300,000 settlement from the American Association of State Troopers for "unfair, deceptive, misleading" practices during a telemarketing campaign. The association claimed to raise funds for local police barracks, when in fact just roughly 7 percent of the $1.4 million collected went to the charity's cause -- which was in Florida.<p>Elected officials have been kept busy blasting scurrilous nonprofits over the last year, thanks to a two-year investigation by the Congressional Subcommittee on Oversight into 200 public charities. "Insiders have turned their charity into their own personal cash cow," says subcommittee chairman J.J. Pickle. "Some charities are abusing the public trust."<p>Donors are catching on. According to a 1993 Gallup poll commissioned by the Council of Better Business Bureaus, half the 1,000 people surveyed felt charities were less trustworthy than they were ten years ago. A whopping 81 percent were very or somewhat concerned that the amount a charity spends is not directly related to its stated mission. <p>Yet Americans continue to be very generous. According to the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel's (AAFRC) Trust for Philanthropy, individuals gave roughly $102.6 billion to charities last year, 28 percent more than they gave five years earlier, thanks in part to the 1993 tax increases. <p>Smart donors ought to look more closely at exactly where their charitable donations are going. Some charities spend around 70 percent of their cash donations on expenses such as fund-raising, executive salaries, travel, and entertainment, rather than the cause itself, according to the Philanthropic Advisory Service in Arlington, Virginia, an arm of the Better Business Bureaus that evaluates charities. Furthermore, a recent study by the New York State Office of Charities Registration found that 95 percent of state and federal tax forms filed by 215 charities failed to report their expenses correctly. Chances are, charity scofflaws are flying under the watchdog's radar. While the number of IRS-approved charitable organizations has exploded over the last decade, the IRS audit army hasn't. The number of audited nonprofits has dropped from 5 percent to 2.2 percent since then. <p>To make sure your donations aren't dropping into a black hole, we compiled a ranking of the ten most efficient charities in the country -- and the ten least -- out of over 300 nonprofits. The American Institute of Philanthropy (AIP), a St. Louis-based nonprofit group that analyzes charities, helped us come up with the list. To make our grade, a charity must have more than $1 million in annual income, be able to accept tax-deductible contributions, and receive less than half its funding from the federal government, since groups that receive federal grants don't have to compete for that money in the private sector and therefore will have lower overhead costs. Since many Americans give money rather than goods, we conducted an income-only analysis. That's why AmeriCares, a nonprofit that provides emergency aid to disaster victims, didn't make our top ten. After donated medical and food supplies are subtracted, the amount of revenues AmeriCares actually plows back into its cause drops to 78 percent for 1993.<p>The winner: The National Hispanic Scholarship Fund of Novato, California. It ranks first on our list because 95 percent of the money it spends goes toward its cause -- sending impoverished Hispanic students to college. It also spends a relatively small 2 percent on fund-raising. Number two: The Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children. About 94 percent of its expenses goes toward assisting disabled kids.<p>The least efficient nonprofit was the Walker Cancer Research Institute of Aberdeen, Maryland. It landed in last place because a staggering 95 percent of the $6.1 million it raises goes toward overhead and fundraising, while a measly 3 percent is sunk into drug research and education programs. "It's very competitive out there," says Steven Blumenthal, the institute's vice president. "Direct mail is a difficult way to raise money. So we only have very little left over after we pay our bills to spend on research and other program services." The eight-year-old "Just Say No" International in Oakland, California, which lists former first lady Nancy Reagan as honorary chairperson, also ranks in the bottom ten since fund-raising and other overhead costs chew up 78 percent of its budget. "We're still new and young," says spokesman Steven Delphin. "We meet all of the standards of the Better Business Bureaus."<p>Of course, many charities justifiably incur high administrative costs. For example, spending large sums on solicitations is typical when a charity is new or devoted to a controversial cause, as AIDS was in the early 1980s. And overhead costs can zoom when a nonprofit oversees complex, labor-intensive programs in far-flung corners of the world. Lee M. Cassidy, executive director of the National Federation of Nonprofits, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group, says, "If charities are alleviating pain and suffering, they work." <p>However, even AAFRC literature tells donors that they have a right to know how their dollars are being spent. "It's okay to question a charity now. It used to be wrong, like questioning God," says AIP president Daniel Borochoff, a former researcher at the National Charities Information Bureau. <p>Not anymore. When a charity's behavior is technically aboveboard, in some instances "little money ends up where donors think it's going to go," says James T. Bennett, co-author of Unhealthy Charities (Basic Books, $25). Economists Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo analyzed the financial statements of three of the nation's largest health charities and found that much of their money either sits in a huge cash hoard or is used to build up an endowment. The authors say that even though it relentlessly fund-raises, the American Cancer Society has $361 million in cash and securities and more than $100 million in real estate and equipment. As of 1990, the Texas chapter of the ACS owned land and real estate valued at $11.2 million; its employees also got to use its 56 cars and trucks, which are worth over $800,000. <p>However, many charities are true to their cause and not their pockets. Here's how to give with confidence:<p>-> Do some homework. Never donate blindly to a telephone or mail appeal. Experts say such solicitations are rife with scams. Instead, to get a good look at a charity's operations, volunteer for a local organization or chat with its officials. Then ask for its Form 990 federal tax return, or call your state attorney general's office to get a charity's documents -- 43 states require nonprofits to submit these documents each year. <p>But be warned: Form 990s are about as easy to decipher as a quantum-physics textbook. Zero in on lines 22-25 and part 3, where the organizations break down their expenses. Compare these numbers to the following averages posted by the AAFRC: At least 80 percent of a charity's revenue should go toward its cause and no more than 20 percent toward general management costs. For a letter grading of over 300 charities, send $3 and a self-addressed envelope to the American Institute of Philanthropy, 4579 Laclede Avenue, Suite 136W, St. Louis, MO 63108.<p>-> Make sure your charitable contribution is a bulletproof tax deduction by donating only to those groups with IRS-approved tax-exempt status. Just 575,690 of the 1.1 million tax-exempt groups are IRS-approved charities. For a list of these groups, visit your local IRS office and ask to see publication No. 78, Cumulative List of Organizations. <p>-> Keep up with tax changes. New tax laws require receipts for cash donations of $250 or more made in 1994; a canceled check or credit card statement no longer counts as proof. If donations of used items -- clothes or furniture -- exceed $500, taxpayers should attach an itemized list noting dollar values and the charity's name and address. Typically, items should be valued at 15 percent to 20 percent of the original retail cost, says Claudia Hill, president of Tax Mam, a tax-consulting group in Cupertino, California.<p>-> Give appreciated property. Donors can reap two tax benefits by donating stock, bonds, art, or real estate that has appreciated in value. You avoid capital-gains tax on a sale of the appreciated items and you receive a charitable writeoff. Such deductions got a big boost from the 1993 Tax Act: Donors subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax can now claim the full, appreciated value of property donated after 1992. Previously, they could write off only the original purchase price. <p>Giving appreciated property works well in a charitable remainder trust, where tax-deductible donations of capital can throw off income for life. "You'll have more money working to provide income for you," says Warren M. Bergstein, a New York City CPA specializing in individual tax planning. Such trusts are expensive to establish and maintain, though, and may be practical only for six-figure donations. For smaller amounts, try charitable annuities or a pooled-income fund, which is basically an income-oriented mutual fund.<p>-> Be skeptical of charities that pitch their financial acumen as a way to increase investment returns. "Investing with a charity could give you a greater return on your money than investing yourself," says an ad from the United Jewish Appeal Federation of New York. Not quite. Outright gifts generate bigger writeoffs since the deductions for planned gifts are reduced by the interest income you receive. Furthermore, a charity's annuity or fund rates generally lag their counterparts by two percentage points. And once the investment is set up, it can't be cashed out.<p>

Worth magazine/Feature<p>THE BILLION DOLLAR TAX BREAK
The wealthy can count on two things: Death and really good lawyers. The  inside story on how the Newhouse  family beat the IRS.<p>By Thomas Maier<p>"Please state your name for the record."<p>"Samuel I. Newhouse Jr."<p>"Sir, would you tell the court whether you are now employed?"<p>"I am."<p>"What is your present employment?"<p>"I'm chairman of Advance Publications, chairman of Conde Nast Publications, and I may have a number of other titles."<p>On a dreary January day in 1989, Si Newhouse, a slight and almost unassuming man, sat in a witness chair, raised his hand in U.S. Tax Court in Washington, D.C., and swore to tell the truth about the inner workings and financial structure of the largest privately held fortune in America. It was a rare public appearance for America's most powerful and secretive media baron. At issue was a nearly $1 billion unpaid tax bill levied on the estate of Newhouse's late father's estate in 1983. It was the largest case of its kind ever brought before the court, and the stakes for the Newhouses were enormous. Were Judge John J. Williams to rule against the family, there was some doubt whether the multibillion-dollar Newhouse empire -- the largest family-held fortune in the United States -- could remain intact.<p>Together with his brother Donald, Si Newhouse controlled more than $10 billion worth of media properties. Much of the empire had been inherited from their father, Sam, who died in 1979 and left his two sons with a diversified and immensely profitable company. Advance Publications then encompassed some 30 daily newspapers (including the only papers in New Orleans, Cleveland, and Portland, Oregon), as well as Parade, the national Sunday-paper supplement; television stations and cable systems across the nation; and the Conde Nast stable of glossy magazines.<p>Once in charge of the empire, the brothers spent the '80s relentlessly adding to it. Si bought Random House, the publishing conglomerate, for $70 million in 1980; in 1985, he paid nearly $200 million for The New Yorker; and in the course of the '80s he spent an estimated $75 million reviving Vanity Fair magazine. All this spending would have been difficult, if not impossible, were it not for Sam Newhouse's final achievement -- a brilliant estate-planning maneuver that confused the issues of ownership and control of the company. It was an elaborate plan, a perfectly executed gamble. If it worked, the Newhouse family fortune would be saved and solidified for generations to come. <p>As co-executors of their father's estate, the Newhouse brothers had arrived in court to defend their father's financial legacy a decade after his death. The case hinged on a dispute over the worth of Sam Newhouse's stock in Advance Publications. The valuation of stock in closely held private corporations is, of course, a timeless bone of contention between taxpayers and the IRS, because no market mechanisms exist to easily value such holdings. In this case, the IRS claimed that Sam Newhouse's stake in the family company was worth $1.2 billion when he died. The family, on the other hand, put Sam's worth at $178 million and in 1980 filed a return listing a net tax bill just shy of $48 million. The IRS claimed that the estate owned an additional $609 million in taxes and slapped the family with a $304 million penalty. As the case developed, signs emerged that perhaps the government had even underestimated the worth of Advance. Shortly before the trial began, magazine analyst James Kobak completed a report valuing Sam Newhouse's share of the company at more than $2 billion when he died in 1979.<p><p>The seeds of the Newhouse tax strategy were planted decades before Sam Newhouse's death. Worried that his heirs would have to sell off family assets in order to pay estate taxes, Newhouse had constantly revised Advance's company charter, creating an ownership structure that made it not only difficult to discern who controlled the company but also highly unattractive for family members to cash out of the company. He owned the company's common stock, and he granted his immediate family -- his two brothers, his wife, and Si and Donald -- preferred stock. A set of changes written into the charter in 1956 granted the company's preferred shareholders the right to voluntarily liquidate their holdings at any point. In reality, it was doubtful any of them would choose that option, because in 1949 the preferred stock had been fixed at a low price -- so low, in fact, that the family members were virtually locked in as long as Sam Newhouse controlled the company. Sam had learned from the bitter struggles over money that had torn apart the families of other newspaper tycoons; he was determined that his family not fall prey to internecine struggles.<p>The plan was also designed to keep the fortune intact after Sam died. Whoever laid claim to the common stock and its voting rights would still need the approval of the preferred stockholders to gain full control of Advance -- this made it conveniently possible to undervalue the common stock. After all, what was Sam's stock worth to a potential buyer if the other Newhouses, who could block a sale, didn't want to sell theirs? <p>The IRS viewed the charter changes as a ruse designed to make it appear -- at least for tax-estate purposes -- that the preferred shareholders were equal owners of the company, on the same plane as the common stockholder, Sam Newhouse. Thus, the IRS argument went, Si Newhouse and his brother could claim the value of Sam's estate holdings was much less than the total value of the company. <p>The Newhouse defense, on the other hand, hinged on proving that possession of the common stock did not grant Sam Newhouse exclusive control of the company he built from scratch. Under the gentle questioning of his defense lawyers, Si Newhouse was able to draw a picture of the family enterprise as a business run not by the father but by a group of equals. To many familiar with the inner workings of the company, this was like saying that Henry Ford didn't run the Ford Motor Co. <p>"Was there ever a time, Mr. Newhouse, when your father, S.I., dictated a decision to the rest of the group?" asked Albert Turkus, head of the Newhouse defense team.<p>"No, there was -- I never remember him dictating a business decision," Si Newhouse replied. "It was totally outside of his nature.... It never would have occurred to him to dictate a decision."<p>Anyone who was familiar with the family and its business may have also been taken aback by Newhouse's next contention. "Did there ever come a time, Mr. Newhouse, when you became aware of the fact that there were any differences in the nature of the different shareholders' interest?" Turkus asked.<p>"Yes."<p>"Would you describe that for the court, please?"<p>"Well, I can't pin it down to a period, but after a while, there started to be stories in Time and some of the other magazines, and we started to get written up. People began to notice us, and there were references in these articles to classes of stock, and that's when I first became aware of -- that it was -- that there were differences in the stock."<p>Newhouse explained that he began receiving checks in the 1950s and only after that became aware of the stock differences in the company. By this time, he was nearly 30 years old, was married with children, and had attended countless meetings where all aspects of the family business were presumably discussed. Yet, he testified, he had to learn who owned what in the family's multibillion-dollar business by reading it in a magazine.<p>The testimony went on with Newhouse continuing to give disarmingly opaque answers to Turkus's questions. He maintained that he'd spent his career up to this point working hard for the family business and giving very little thought to the ownership structure of Advance. "We didn't think about stock," Newhouse replied to one inquiry. "We never thought about the corporate legalities, the corporate aspects of it. We were involved together -- the family business -- so I can't tell you when I really thought about it all being equal. I've always felt we were equal. There was never any thought that there was an inequality about any of us in the family." <p>In their cross-examination, the government attorneys -- Robert Shilliday and co-counsel Howard Levine -- tried in vain to poke holes in Newhouse's testimony. Near the end of their cross-examination, the government attorneys grilled Newhouse about Advance's 1976 takeover of Booth Newspapers. Advance had paid $150 million for the company, which owned a string of Michigan dailies as well as Parade magazine. The prosecution was hoping to show that Sam Newhouse himself had controlled the deal. "You were involved in that acquisition?" asked Levine.<p>"I certainly was," Newhouse replied.<p>"All right," Levine said. He then asked Newhouse to describe the deal in detail. <p>"Well," Newhouse said wearily, "it's a little bit like trying to describe love ..."<p><p>Though the two sides did not meet in court until 1989, the IRS had been building its case for much of the decade. The driving force was Joseph Baniewicz, the IRS's media expert. In 1983, Baniewicz recommended that the IRS reject the tax forms filed in 1980 by Si Newhouse and his brother on their father's estate. After launching a massive audit of the Newhouse empire, Baniewicz had become convinced that Sam Newhouse's 1,000 shares of Advance common stock controlled the company. His valuation was based on a premise known as subtraction theory. Quite simply, he estimated Advance's total worth and subtracted from that sum the cost of all the stock not owned by Sam Newhouse at the time of his death. <p>As a result of this approach, Baniewicz figured that at the time of Sam Newhouse's death, the family-held preferred stock was worth about $267 million, and that the 1,000 shares of Class A common stock with voting rights left by Sam Newhouse were worth no less than $1.2 billion. Baniewicz was also convinced that the Newhouses deliberately set out to mislead the IRS by seriously undervaluing the worth of Sam Newhouse's shares in the company. In the halls of the IRS, Baniewicz's indignation prevailed, and on May 18, 1983, the service issued a notice of tax deficiency along with a $304 million fraud penalty. <p>But Baniewicz's theory had one fundamental miscalculation: It was impossible to believe that any buyer would pay the IRS's idea of fair market value for Advance common stock, given that the stock was all but worthless without the assent of the preferred stockholders. In other words, the IRS's subtraction theory subtracted one crucial variable -- the power of the preferred stockholders. <p>It fell to Robert Shilliday, an Atlanta-based tax specialist for the IRS, to handle these proceedings. Shilliday, who had full authority in the case, had originally hoped to avoid a trial. In 1986, as a sign of good faith, he even agreed to drop the $304 million penalty Baniewicz recommended. Aside from that, his case closely followed the arguments of the IRS analyst. In his opening statement to Judge Williams, Shilliday alluded to the Newhouses' alleged "trick" with their taxes and their financial "sleight of hand."<p>Whether or not his argument held any merit, Shilliday was outgunned and outmaneuvered by Newhouse's legal team at every turn. When Baniewicz took the stand, for instance, Turkus was quickly able to persuade Judge Williams that the IRS analyst was not qualified to assess the value of the Newhouse empire. "Mr. Baniewicz never sought advice from real-world buyers on how they would approach valuing the stock like this," Turkus argued. "I'm not suggesting to this court on behalf of [the Newhouses] that there's anything wrong with Mr. Baniewicz having an opinion.... [But] the fact that he engages in that exercise does not make him. . . an expert in the things which the government is asking him to testify about here today."<p>Judge Williams agreed to let Baniewicz's testimony stand only if Shilliday could promise that later witnesses would back up the IRS analyst's theories about the value of the common stock. Shilliday nodded, and said he would provide, with some caveats, such testimony from media consultants John Morton and James Kobak. <p>Costly errors plagued Shilliday's case. For instance, one witness Shilliday hoped to call, Richard Meeker, the author of a critical biography about Sam Newhouse, was identified in a pretrial memorandum as a former associate of Sam Newhouse's. This was important because Meeker was supposed to testify to Sam Newhouse's iron grip on the business. But the defense pointed out that Meeker was 50 years younger than Sam Newhouse and was hardly in a position to provide an eyewitness view. The government soon dropped Meeker as a witness, and Williams threatened to hold Shilliday in contempt. Shilliday didn't fare much better with John Morton, whose testimony was thrown out after Shilliday improperly asked him to make a legal judgment about the Newhouse tax case. The judge excoriated Shilliday. "Your lack of understanding in this case is exceeded only by your lack of preparation," he said, terming Shilliday's work the "worst performance I have seen on the bench."<p>Shilliday's courtroom misfortune was far from over. Another witness, William Worthington Jr., a former Chemical Bank official, had what Shilliday thought might be a smoking gun. In 1977 Worthington had drafted a memo that questioned the prevailing view within the bank that all classes of the Newhouse stock were identical. He pointed out that after the old man died, the estate could face a serious IRS challenge. To Shilliday, this memo indicated that there was doubt about the legality of the Newhouses' tax plan among their own bankers. But Worthington testified that he didn't believe that the Newhouses were trying to deceive the IRS. More important, his memo failed to take into account the company's 1956 charter amendments, which gave the other Newhouses who owned preferred shares the option of blocking a potential sale. When Shilliday tried to admit Worthington's memo into evidence, Turkus argued that it reflected only Worthington's individual view, not the opinion of the bank. Judge Williams agreed and excused Worthington as a witness. <p>By the time James Kobak took the stand, the case had come to seem like a grisly mismatch. Kobak was the analyst who had prepared a report saying that Advance Publications' common stock was worth more than $2 billion, but that report had been dismissed before Kobak took the stand. The problem was that Kobak had taken so long to complete his valuation that the government could not unveil his numbers until a scant two months before the trial was scheduled to begin. Turkus had successfully argued that the Kobak estimates came "on the eve of the trial," too late to affect the proceedings. <p>Even so, for a time it looked like Kobak would be the government's most effective witnesses. Until the defense was able to deflate his testimony under cross-examination, that is. Under Turkus's questioning, Kobak admitted that he had made a $39 million mistake in his valuation of Vogue, Conde Nast's prized fashion magazine, and the related Vogue Guides. When asked about another discrepancy, Kobak offered a less than satisfying response: "My ladies may have picked that up from a clipping. . . and wrote it wrong," he said abashedly.<p>While the prosecution could not even get testimony to stick from witnesses sympathetic to its arguments, the defense team was able to get solid testimony from some of Advance's toughest competition. Both Rupert Murdoch, who owned at that time both the HarperCollins publishing house and Mirabella, a key competitor of Vogue, and Douglas McCorkindale, the executive in charge of acquisitions for Gannett, America's largest newspaper chain, testified that the structure of Advance's ownership would made the company an unattractive takeover target. "Just looking at it overall, we are not interested in getting into situations that get messy and get involved in litigation," said McCorkindale. Murdoch testified that he wouldn't pay a nickel for the Newhouse common shares without some other agreement with other family members. <p><p>On February 28, 1990, nearly a year after the trial ended, Judge Williams issued a 100-page ruling that was nothing short of total victory for Si and Donald Newhouse and the generation of younger Newhouses who, in the form of complicated family trusts, stood as heirs to their grandfather's fortune. In short, Williams agreed with the Newhouse lawyers. He ruled that Advance Publications, the family's newspaper and magazine conglomerate, was worth about $1.5 billion at the time of Sam Newhouse's death, but that his 1,000 shares of common stock were worth only $176 million. As a result, the family owed $48 million in taxes, almost exactly the figure that the Newhouses had claimed a decade earlier. <p>Many observers viewed the decision as a virtual giveaway to the Newhouse family. As the economist Paul Samuelson later observed: "The [plan's] beauty, of course, is that the Newhouses can apparently have it both ways. For estate purposes the value of the company is artificially lowered. But should the family ever want to sell, it can easily recover the company's full market value by offering all the firm's securities as a package."<p>John J. Coffee, a Columbia University law professor and one of the government's expert witnesses, concluded that Sam Newhouse knew exactly what he was doing when he had his company's charter rewritten. "They were consciously thinking about this [strategy] all along," says Coffee. "There were about 11 changes in a 20-year period, with all these arcane changes and wordings. There's no ordinary company that goes through these type of changes in their structure."<p>In the end, the Newhouse tax case probably had a greater effect on journalism and publishing -- the tax savings helped Newhouse finance the acquisition of Random House and The New Yorker and the revival of Vanity Fair -- than it did on the annals of estate taxation. Though unusually large sums were involved, tax experts say that Judge Williams's ruling was not precedential; the case was simply too singular. "Most enterprises that big are not in family hands," says New York-based tax attorney Lee Sheppard. "You could almost say this case was sui generis." The moral of the story, Sheppard says, is that "when the IRS goes after people with unlimited resources, the IRS almost always gets outgunned."

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>MEET THE IRS'S NEW COMPUTER
Here's what's ahead for tardy taxpayers.<p>By Elizabeth MacDonald<p>If you're among the 13 million individuals who file or pay taxes late each year, a new IRS computer system is going to make things a little tougher for you. The IRS is placing high hopes on its penalty-abatement system, due out next year, which it believes will crack down on delinquent taxpayers who undeservingly get their failure-to-file or failure-to-pay penalties abated. <p>If you owe the IRS and you don't file your return or pay up by April 15, the IRS will slap you with both a late-filing and a failure-to-pay penalty, equal to a combined 5 percent of the unpaid tax, up to a 25 percent maximum, (if you get a four-month extension, you'll still owe a failure to pay penalty if you don't send in at least 90 percent of what you owe). Tardy taxpayers can then try to use a "reasonable cause" -- such as saying that they lost their records -- to get their penalty abated. <p>For the past three years, the General Accounting Office has been after the IRS to reduce the amount of money it loses in penalty abatements as well as to make the system fairer. Since 1991, the agency has forgiven roughly $9.3 billion in penalties and fines after taxpayers wrote back with their reasonable causes. Over that period, taxpayers who filed or paid late were responsible for about $1 billion of that amount. The GAO has told the agency "that we're inconsistent, that we were too subjective" in excusing the fines, according to IRS spokeswoman Johnelle Hunter. <p>To fix this problem, the IRS has been testing this new system since 1991 on taxpayers in Dallas and Los Angeles. Early tests show that the system rejects many more abatement requests. In a recent test at the IRS service center in Fresno, California, the agency assessed 21,398 failure-to-file and/or failure-to-pay penalties, amounting to $880,114, against Los Angeles taxpayers. Along with these penalty notices, the agency also sent a new IRS form, number 9264, "Request for Removal of Tax Penalty -- 1040 Filers." Recipients were asked to check off on this form one or more boxes next to 11 categories of reasonable causes for their delinquency. These include, for example, a death in the family or a fire. The IRS computer then assigned weights to each checked excuse, scored the request form, and directed the IRS examiner to either abate the penalty or let it stand. Some reasonable causes carry more credibility with the agency than others. Says IRS spokesman Henry Holmes, "Illness or death may swing more weight than one of these other reasons, like absence [being out of town and unable to file]."<p>Results show that the IRS abated 2 percent of these taxpayers' penalties and wiped clean $243,009, or 28 percent of the total fines. Since 1991, by contrast, the agency on average abated 8 percent of the failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties it assessed and excused 16.5 percent of the amount taxpayers owed.<p>Tax experts say that any laxity in the new system won't last. "The IRS can easily change and most likely will change its scoring system to make it tougher on taxpayers," says Leon Berk, tax partner with N&L Partnership in Royal Palm Beach, Florida. <p>What should you do if the computer takes an interest in you? First, don't automatically pay up. "When someone gets a notice, they just pay without thinking," says Nancy Gallagher, a New York public accountant. "It's a great way for the government to raise money." Second, since the IRS provides for other ways to get a penalty abated, avoid form 9264. Here's how to make your strongest case to the IRS:<p>Let's say you filed and paid your taxes late because your home was burned in a fire and your records were destroyed.You get an IRS notice saying you owe penalties. File form 843, "Claim for Refund and Request for Abatement." On the top of the form type "Demand for Abatement of Penalties." Go to line 11, write in "See attached," and on a separate piece of paper, give your explanation. In this case, you'd have to enclose fire-department and insurance reports showing the extent of the damage. You'd explain that the delay was caused by the difficulty in getting copies of W-2s and other tax documents necessary for accurate preparation of your return. As the Internal Revenue Manual states, damage to tax records is a reasonable cause. Therefore, you can request that your penalty plus interest should be abated.<p>Next, send your abatement request to the IRS employee named on your notice, attaching a copy of your IRS bill plus any documents substantiating your claim. Also, type your IRS 14-digit document-locator number, found on your notice, on the top of this form. This points the IRS directly to your file, thereby avoiding additional interest costs caused by IRS delays. <p>If you can't file on time next April 15, get a four-month extension by mailing form 4868 to the IRS. If you owe money, you'll avoid a failure-to-pay penalty by estimating your tax and sending a check for at least 90 percent of the amount owed along with that form. If you can't pay that amount, send in form 9465 to get an installment plan -- you'll still owe a failure-to-pay penalty and 8 percent interest. When you finally do file and pay up, attach 4571, "Explanation for Filing Return Late or Paying Tax Late," to the top of your return, and cite your reasonable causes to get your penalties excused. <p><p>

Strategies for the philanthropist in you.<p>By Troy Segal<p>Charities, foundations, and colleges, caught up in the hard sell that philanthropy has become, are pitching a new breed of trust and annuity. In effect, these devices allow benefactors to designate donations they plan to make in the future. In return, the benefactor gets an upfront tax deduction as well as ongoing income from the assets they pledge.<p>Are these trusts and annuities mere gimmickry, or are they really a good deal? Think hard before you answer. If charity is your principal motivation, you might do better giving cash or appreciated securities that will immediately benefit the recipient. If tax avoidance is your principal motivation, gifts made in the here and now also usually provide the biggest and most immediate benefits.<p>Still, many would-be philanthropists prefer the new tools, not least because of the higher tax rates that arrived with the Clinton administration. Furthermore, some people like the idea of demonstrating their commitment to a favored institution but still need the investment income that an immediate gift of assets would deny them.<p>Enter the charitable remainder trust. These irrevocable trusts, used primarily for large donations, earmark funds for an institution but continue to pay the donor and his or her spouse a yearly income for life. When the donors die, the funds in the trust are transferred to the institutional beneficiary.<p>There are two basic types of charitable remainder trust: the annuity trust, which distributes a fixed dollar amount to the donor each year, and the unitrust, which distributes a fixed percentage of the trust's assets. The payouts to the donor are generally taxable for both types of trust.<p>The tax break for both types comes from the deduction that is created when the trust is established. The amount of this deduction is calculated by using Internal Revenue Service tables to figure what the gift will be worth when it is actually transferred to the institutional recipient.<p>Of the two types of trust, the annuity version provides the larger upfront deduction. This is because fixed dollar payouts shrink the trust principal less over time than the unitrust's percentage-of-assets payouts. For instance, suppose a 60-year-old donor wants to establish a $100,000 charitable remainder trust. According to PhilanthroTec, a Matthews, North Carolina, software publisher, a donor who sets this trust up as an annuity paying a fixed $6,000 a year would be entitled to value his gift, for purposes of the tax deduction, at $40,314. If the donor chooses a unitrust paying 6 percent of total assets each year, his gift would be valued at only $36,163. <p>One caveat: The annuity-trust beneficiary cited above must understand that he will never receive more than $6,000 a year from his trust. The unitrust beneficiary, on the other hand, receives 6 percent of the trust's assets each year no matter how much they increase. Thus, of the two, the unitrust offers the best protection against inflation.<p>The costs of creating and administering charitable remainder trusts usually make them impractical for smaller contributions. As an alternative, donors might consider a charitable-gift annuity. For these, the donor grants immediate possession of the gift to the institutional beneficiary, rather than placing it in a trust. New York's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, for instance, offers an annuity with guaranteed annual payments for life starting at age 55 for donations of $10,000 or more.<p>In setting annuity payments for these types of gifts, most charities, including Lincoln Center, use a schedule adopted by the American Council on Gift Annuities, which represents 1,400 organizations. The schedule is calculated to help the organization ultimately keep at least half of the original annuity investment. Thus the payout rates aren't the most generous, ranging from 4.7 percent to 11 percent a year, depending on the donor's age. "I won't pretend this is a great investment," says David Clough, director of planned giving at Lincoln Center. <p>Often, a portion of an annuity payout is tax free as return of principal. The donor also gets an upfront tax deduction for his gift; how much depends on his age and the number of years for which payment is deferred. Younger donors -- in their 30s and 40s -- beware. "You shouldn't tie yourself up in that sort of fixed-income investment," says William H. Mears, senior vice president at Brown Brothers Harriman Trust in New York City.<p>Inflation hedgers may prefer a charity's pooled-income fund to a charitable annuity. A $5,000 investment -- most institutions won't take less -- goes into a sort of mutual fund that distributes interest earned until the donor's death. Pooled-income funds generally invest in Treasurys or high-grade corporate debt; some are venturing into equities. Payouts from pooled-income funds are fully taxable. The charitable tax deduction available to the contributors depends on their age and the fund's highest yield over the prior three years.<p><p>

How family limited partnerships can minimize estate taxes.<p>By Donald Jay Korn<p>Estate-tax avoidance usually involves giving assets away. What you don't own can't be included in your taxable estate. However, handing over your holdings has a hitch: Your securities, bank accounts, and properties belong to someone else. <p>Enter the family limited partnership. As a general partner in such a partnership, you can give away assets for tax purposes yet keep control of them. "Family limited partnerships are powerful vehicles for diffusing asset ownership," says Alan C. Klein, a partner in the accounting firm Arthur Andersen. <p>Klein says FLPs can work for business owners, professionals, real estate investors, and other people with substantial, diverse wealth. Besides estate-tax relief, they offer income-shifting to lower brackets and asset protection (increasingly valuable in this land of happy litigators).<p>When you and your spouse establish your partnership, you'll name yourselves as general partners, perhaps with a 1 percent interest in the FLP. You'll also be the sole limited partners, owning the other 99 percent. <p>Then, transfer virtually any asset, except pension plans or shares in S corporations, to the FLP. "I wouldn't transfer a principal residence, either," says Alan Jahde, a director in the Denver law firm Boris, Nemkov & Jahde, "because you'll lose tax advantages." The transfer is not a taxable event, because you're just shifting wealth.<p>Next, give away limited-partnership interests to family members, usually children but perhaps grandchildren, parents, or others. This can be done all at once or over a period of years. As long as you're the general partner, you make all the decisions regarding the assets in the FLP. You even can pay yourself a salary for managing the FLP. "If the assets in the partnership generate taxable income, that income is passed through to the partners," says Jahde. So most of the income could be diverted to your children, who might be in a 15 percent federal tax bracket while you might be in a 39.6 percent bracket. <p>As is typical with limited partnerships, general partners in an FLP make all management decisions and bear all the liability. Limited partners, however, have limited liability. <p>Once you shift assets into an FLP, they're out of easy reach of creditors or litigators. In case of a judgment against you, your assets will be stowed in the FLP, largely owned by your relatives, who may not be parties to the action. <p>FLPs do cost money. "Expect to pay around $3,000 for the upfront legal drafting plus up to $1,000 per year for administration, including tax-return preparation," says Klein. The cost is worth it if you're saving hundreds of thousands in taxes and protecting sizable assets but impractical if your assets are modest. <p>Then there are taxes. When partnership interests are transferred to other family members, taxes are incurred. You will pay no tax, however, if you give away up to $10,000 worth of assets each year - $20,000 if you're a married couple - to any number of recipients. Thus, if you have four children, you and your spouse could give them a total of $80,000 worth of limited partnership interests per year and owe no gift taxes.<p>You should also consider giving away up to $600,000 apiece during your lifetime, essentially using up your estate-tax exemption while you're still alive. A 1993 IRS ruling also makes it easier to transfer more than $10,000 per person to an FLP in any given year. That's because an asset held by a limited partner is worth less than its face value since it is controlled by another person - the general partner. Suppose, for example, you and your spouse place a $1 million property into an FLP. You might think that you could transfer only 2 percent a year, or $20,000, to each child, tax-free. However, the children who receive the limited-partnership interests won't control the property, and they can't sell their interest without the general partner's consent, so a 2 percent share isn't really worth $20,000. <p>Instead, you might give each child a 3 percent share each year and claim a 33 percent discount, bringing the value of your gift from $30,000 down to $20,000. Using the same reasoning, you might give away $900,000 worth of assets and use a minority discount to value that gift at the $600,000 exemption level. Get an outside valuation to establish the size of the discount.<p><p>

Giving kids money now may boost tuition bills later.<p>By Donald Jay Korn<p>Shifting assets and income to children in the form of gifts has long been a trusted method of reducing income taxes. But an ominous cloud is forming around this tax tactic: Giving money to your children - even just $1,000 a year - can diminish your chances of getting financial aid to help defray onerous college bills. <p>Welcome to the world of EFC, which stands for expected family contribution, a key part of the financial-aid process that college applicants must go through. This game has become highly formalized; all standard financial-aid forms, once they are filled out by a parent, result in an EFC. <p>Colleges use the EFC to calculate the split between what a parent must contribute to a child's college education and how much aid the college will kick in. For instance, parents earning the minimum income - roughly $20,000 - will be expected to put 5.6 percent of their assets toward their child's education. But here's the bad news: If a child has assets of his or her own, he or she will be expected to kick in 35 percent of them for college bills. <p>That means parents with an income of $20,000, holding a $20,000 CD, would be expected to contribute about $1,120 for college. If their college-bound daughter owns the CD, the expected family contribution rises to $7,000. That's a big difference.<p>"Some parents are caught between a rock and a hard place," says F. Bill Billimoria, an accountant and financial planner at Billimoria Financial in Arlington Heights, Illinois. "The more they try to reduce income taxes by shifting assets, the lower the amount of financial aid they'll receive." <p>The rules are harshest on families with annual incomes between $50,000 and 150,000. Families with incomes of $200,000 or more, on the other hand, are too affluent to expect any financial aid for their child. For them, gifting assets to children remains a smart tax tactic. With children 14 years of age or older, shifting can mean big income-tax savings. For example, in 1994, investment income produced in a child's account is taxed at the child's lower rate: no more than 15 percent on taxable income up to $22,750. For children under 14, shifting assets produces no income-tax savings; their investment income will be taxed at their parents' marginal (or top) rate after the first $1,200. In both cases, however, shifting assets can be a good way to reduce a family's estate taxes. <p>How can you figure what your family's contribution to college is likely to be? Here's a rough rule of thumb: With income of $100,000 and a net worth of $100,000 (including retirement and 401(k) plan contributions), your expected financial contribution will be $25,000. Above that level, your assets are assessed at 5.6 percent and your income at 4.7 percent. At that level or above, with only one child attending college, you won't qualify for help at even the most expensive schools.<p>With two children in college, however, your prospects for aid brighten. Your parental share on behalf of each child is only half the total EFC; with three children, one third; and proportionately for four or more. So with several children in college at the same time, even families with income and net assets above $150,000 could qualify for substantial aid.<p>If you qualify, the lower your EFC, the greater the amount of aid that you or your children are likely to get in the form of grants, loans, or student work payments. Keep assets in your name, and if minimizing taxes is your goal, invest in municipal bonds, low-yielding growth stocks, or shares in mutual funds that rarely make taxable distributions.<p>Within the limits of prudence and honesty, you can make some of your assessable assets disappear. The standard form for federal aid that many colleges require excludes such assets as home equity. Prepaying your mortgage thus turns cash into a non-assessable asset. Another way you can reduce the EFC's bite is to pay attention to timing. The tax year during which your high schooler's junior year ends produces the income that appears on your first aid application. So take legitimate steps to reduce your income that year, such as deferring capital gains or compensation, for example. <p><p><p>

One last chance to save yourself money and trouble<p>By Stuart Weiss<p>You still haven't done your taxes? Understandable. Time and again you've been told that the Clinton tax package is going to whack you, and maybe it will. But you certainly can't put it off any longer. Here's one simple bit of advice: If you don't know your tax liability at April 15th and have to extend the return, pay 110 percent of your 1992 tax liability to avoid penalties. <p>Now, can you, in fact, expect a bigger tax bill? If your taxable income is over $115,000 for singles or $140,000 for married couples filing jointly, you can. At those figures the 36 percent marginal rate takes effect. There's a good probability you'll take that hit with gross income above $155,000 if single and $180,000 if married. (Typical taxpayers with those incomes will take deductions and exemptions totaling $40,000.) The top marginal rate, 39.6 percent, applies to taxable income over $250,000, single or married. Typically, gross income over $300,000 will leave you in the $250,000-plus taxable bracket after deductions and exemptions.<p>If you're single and in the higher brackets, your accountant can't do much for you legally, except perhaps to congratulate you for earning so much money and bill you accordingly. Some married people, however, may pay less tax by filing separate returns than a joint return. This can happen if one spouse has substantially more itemized deductions, such as medical expenses, than the other spouse. In fact, more couples this year than in the past are expected to benefit from that option. <p>Here are some other noteworthy wrinkles and quirks for taxpayers to consider:<p>-- Meals and entertainment. For 1993, 80 percent of these expenses are deductible. Starting in 1994, the deduction is 50 percent. <p>-- Club dues. These are no longer deductible in 1994. But taxpayers who prepaid this year's dues in 1993, hoping to take a 1993 deduction, may be inviting an audit. "To claim any type of deduction for a club, you have to know what your business usage is," says James Vonachen, a tax partner at Clifton, Gunderson & Co. accountants in Denver. "If you prepay it, how do you know what your business usage in going to be in 1994?"<p>-- Disaster. Although the Southern California earthquake occurred in 1994, the casualty losses it caused can be deducted on 1993 or 1994 tax returns. This rule only applies to designated federal disaster areas.<p>-- SEP, Keogh, and 401(k) plans. Make the maximum contribution and make it as early as possible to get the maximum benefit from tax deferral. Remember, if you haven't filed yet, you can still contribute to a plan before April 15. Most taxpayers are no longer eligible for deductible IRA contributions, but they still benefit from tax deferral on the investment earnings of their contributions.<p>-- Erroneous W-2 forms. Double-check your W-2s, and make sure your employer didn't mistakenly lump your 401(k) contribution or employee reimbursements into your gross income. Tell your employer to file a corrected W-2C with the IRS.<p>-- Social Security numbers. Double-check all your accounts. If your number appears on your children's securities or bank accounts, the IRS will wonder why you didn't report the income from those accounts. The children should have Social Security numbers even if you pay their taxes.<p>-- Mortgage payments. You may have paid more interest than your lender reports on your Form 1098 information return. That can happen when a late-in-the-year payment doesn't reach the bank in time. In calculating your deduction, use your figures, if they're accurate, and not the lender's. Note the discrepancy on your return.<p>-- Business. Bunch expenses toward businesses or investments and away from itemized deductions, which are limited. For example, if you have rental property, allocate most of your tax-preparation fee to offset rental income. Same thing if you have a consulting business on the side: Subscriptions to the Wall Street Journal, professional dues, and so on should be listed on your Schedule C for self-employed business.<p>-- Audit flags. The test to get the home-office deduction got tougher in 1993. You used to have to prove that the space in your home is used exclusively for business. Now you have to also show that you spend most of your time there. That wipes out many side businesses and most consultants who visit clients all day.<p><p>

Real estate partnerships can still relieve tax pain<p>By Margaret Opsata<p>Where can an investor get an after-tax return of 8 percent every year for ten years, even if the investment never earns a dime? How about low-income housing partnerships?<p>Yes, partnershipsare back. And yes, it does sound too good to be true. But with income-tax rates exploding again, high-bracket tax-payers at least owe themselves a look at what may be the last, best tax shelter.<p>In 1986, Congress ripped the roof off most tax shelters. Gone are the windmill farms, the repositories for frozen bull semen, the dry holes masquerading as oil wells, the real estate deals cobbled together from pie-in-the-sky assumptions and kindergarten economics. But few people realized at the time that Congress also created new tax credits for investing in low-income housing, offering investors one of the best tax shelters ever Cliff Carper, senior vice president of Kemper Securities, calls the credits "one of the few giftsever given to taxpayers by the federal government." <p>To encourage the construction of apartments for the working poor, Congress offered real estate developers both a write-off and a tax credit based on the cost of constructing, renovating, or even purchasing such buildings. Unlike shelters of old, which merely reduced taxable income, a tax credit directly offsets taxes owed. The difference is dramatic. For example, an ordinary $10,000 deduction at the 36 percent rate would save $3,600 in taxes. But a $10,000 credit is simply subtracted from the taxes owed, saving the entire $10,000. For someone in the 36 percent bracket, that $10,000 credit is equal to a deduction of $27,800. <p>At first, few investors took advantage of the tax credits, either because they didn't know about them or they are well-maintained, suburban, garden-style complexes. But even Congress seemed uncertain about whether to keep the credits or not. The program nearly lost its funding twice and finally did lose its support for 14 months in 1992 and 1993<p>Under the law, the federal tax credits each state receives are awarded to local developers who team up with investors, usually organized in limited partnerships. The partnerships buy apartments, and the investors can use the credits against their taxes after the units are rented to low-income people.<p>Individual taxpayers are allowed to buy enough credits to shelter up to $25,000 of income each yearwhich works out to be $7,000 in credits for those in the 28 percent bracket, $7,750 at the 31 percent rate, $9,000 for 36 percent, and $9,900 for 39.6 percent. Although the tax credits won't raise or trigger the alternative minimum tax, they cannot be used to reduce a taxpayer's AMT if he or she is subject to it. Corporations or trusts can also use the credits, often in larger amounts.<p>Low-income-housing deals are typically structured to give investors a tax credit of about 15 percent of their total investment (including commissions, fees, etc.) each year for ten years. This makes for a total tax credit of 150 percent. That means a $66,000 investment would save $9,900 in taxes each year, saving a total of $99,000 over a decade.<p>Some smaller partnerships, known as private placements because they are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, deliver up to 180 percent in credits over ten years thanks to lower underwriting and sales expenses. Conversely, some large public programs with high expenses deliver as little as 120 percent in credits. <p>It's a good thing the credits are high, because in a low-income housing partnership, there is little or no cash flow and and in most cases little chance for real estate appreciation. Apartment buildings typically appreciate in value as rents rise, but in low-income properties rents climb slowly, if at all. Says Brad Davidson of Partnership Valuations, an appraisal firm in Annapolis, Maryland, "Some places may have no residual value at all."<p>Are tax credits alone enough to justify the investment in such a partnership? Only in the good programs. Although the low-income-housing industry is much better regulated today than it was back in '86, there is still a wide range in quality of the deals. If the apartments are completely worthless at the end of 15 years--the first year they can be sold by law--the rate of return on a 120 percent credit is a paltry 3.5 percent. Although that's an after-tax return, it's not as good as a tax-free bond. But a partnership promising 150 percent worth of tax credits returns 8 percent after tax. And one of the 180 percent private placements would return 12.4 percent. <p>Of course, experienced investors know these kinds of returns don't come without risks. If the proper mix of residents isn't maintained (at least 20 percent low income), the IRS will require anyone who took tax credits from that investment to pay back a prorated portion of the money they saved. <p>With increased state and local supervision, such givebacks aren't as big a danger as in the past. Still, investors should select tax-credit programs on the basis of the sponsor's track record in complying with government regulations. Richard DeAgazio, executive vice president of Boston Capital Partners, a sponsor of tax-credit programs, advises investors to "avoid anyone who has not been in the affordable housing business for at least five years with no foreclosures." Easier said than done, says Thomas Gau, a financial planner in Torrance, California. "Since the tax credits were made permanent, at least 30 limited partnerships have come to market from people with no experience in low-income housing," he says.<p>A track record of delivering what's been promised is important because a diversified program may contain 20 or more apartment complexes. To build or renovate them all can take time: About three years is typical on large projects. During that time, investors will get few or no tax credits, so watch for sponsors who have a history of taking too long to build.<p>Perhaps most important, with competition for credits heating up, the percentage of each investment dollar coming back to investors as tax credits is likely to drop. "The private placements that are now at 180 percent will likely fall to 160 percent, and some public programs could go down to as low as 100 percent," predicts John MacLachlan, president of Community Housing Funds, a private placement sponsor in Marble Falls, Texas. To avoid unpleasant surprises, investors should restrict themselves to partnerships that specify at least the majority of the properties they will buy so the amount of credit is known in advance.
As always, investors need to be wary of programs that promise too much: A partnership that assumes some value in the properties at the end of 15 years can project rates of return of 15 percent a year or more. Those projections may be right. But ask to see the investment return from the tax credits alone, just in case.<p>Margaret Opsata has been covering real estate issues for 20 years.

						In His Newest Field<p>
By Monica Corcoran<p>
Ted Turner's got an insatiable appetite. Between bites of a lunch of cold poached salmon, which he spears aggressively with his fork, he talks about something else he has a taste for: Land. His land. All 1.3 million acres of it -- enough, in other words, to make him America's largest individual landowner.<p>
Although Turner never inherited much land, he came by a sizable advertising company when his father died in 1963. Hardly sated, he trailblazed a career in the cable industry and built Turner Broadcasting Systems, a media conglomerate he recently sold to Time Warner for $7.5 billion. His wealth enables him to pull up any for sale signs in his path.<p>
Turner began chewing up the scenery in 1978. That year, at 39 years of age, he paid $2 million for the 5,000-acre Hope Plantation in South Carolina. Since then, he's spent $150 million -- a mere 7.5 percent of his net worth -- on land, land, and more land. He now owns eight ranches, three plantations, and an island. (He doesn't count his New York "property" -- his stake in Time Warner -- but he can't help mentioning it as a semi-holding.)<p>
Not surprisingly, Turner had a lot to say about land when we met up with him in Los Angeles before a cable-industry awards ceremony. Long after finishing his lunch, Turner was still talking.<p>
ON LAND AS THE SPICE OF LIFE: "Back when I was single, I had a lot of different girlfriends, and I went to the same place every weekend. But now that I'm happily married, I take the same wife to different places every weekend. So there's a li'l variety."<p>
ON WHAT HE PAYS FOR LAND: "The least expensive land I bought was desert for $30 an acre. The most I ever paid for anything was about $1,000 an acre."<p>
ON LAND AS AN INVESTMENT: "I could make a fortune developing my land, but I've chosen not to. Land only gives you a good return when you start subdividing it or building on it and charging rent. Or if you sell it. I won't do any of that. I didn't buy the land as an investment. I bought it because I liked it."<p>
ON HOW TO PROFIT FROM LAND: "Go west. You can get a lot of acres for cheap. Stay out of New England because there's already too many people there."<p>
ON LAND AS A FAMILY LEGACY: "My father, even as a little boy, never forgot that his father lost his farm during the depression, and he bought a couple thousand acres in South Carolina."<p>
"I'm going to leave my land to my children in a trust. When the last one passes away, it's going to revert to my foundation. There will be money left to take care of the land and to protect it."<p>
ON LAND AS PERMANENCE: "When I was a kid, Gone With the Wind was my favorite movie. I always remembered that Scarlett's father said, 'The land is the only thing that lasts.' I figured if I had a place like Tara, it would be the only thing that lasted."<p>
ON LAND AS IMPERMANENCE: "The Indians thought that they owned the land. We think that we own the land....The land will be up for grabs again."<p>
ON LAND AS FOOTWEAR: "Years ago, I was really worried about a world war. I figured if everyone was starving and going around barefoot I could kill an alligator or two and have alligator shoes. I've got all my needs met on my land."<p>
ON GETTING (MORE) LAND: "Everybody I know is a land scout. Hardly a week goes by that I don't get mail from real-estate people. I once bought land just from looking at a picture. But I don't do that anymore. I have people who go and look at it. I'm too busy for that."<p>
ON BUYING LAND: "Well, I'm trying to fill in. You ever make puzzles when you were a kid? First, you put the corners in. Then you try to get the border done. And then you try to fill it in. So I've got property on both coasts and in Montana, which is a Canadian border, and in New Mexico, which is a Mexican border. Now I'm trying to fill in."<p>

						By John Koten<p>
It's hard for me to look at that photograph on the cover and not want to dump everything I own in Manhattan and move. Every time I fly from the East Coast to the West (which I do a lot), I look down on the vastness of the American landscape and fantasize about owning a piece of it -- not just a suburban acre or a city lot, but something with a vista. <p>
Although I haven't progressed beyond dreaming about land, a lot of other people are way ahead of me. They're out there buying a mountain meadow in Montana or a bit of woods in upstate New York. It's easy to question the wisdom of this; with the stock market roaring ever upward, buying land certainly seems a contrarian move. Then again, contrarians are often the ones who get in early on the next big thing.<p>
We decided it was time to look at land from a number of different perspectives. First, we asked contributing editor Clint Willis to look for raw land selling for $150,000 or less. He came up with a bunch of investment schemes to make money -- with properties from Maine to Oregon.<p>
William P. Barrett took on the task of finding the largest private landowners. We considered any form of ownership -- individual, corporate, partnership, or trust -- as long as the beneficial interest of the stake rested ultimately with an individual or a family. To find these people, many of whom shun publicity, Bill picked through records and culled tips from appraisers, assessors, and other land experts. Then he called the landowners. His list of 100 is, we think, the only one of its kind.<p>
Finally, Richard Todd -- the writer we so often turn to when we want to give our readers something special -- reflects on his 150 acres in rural Massachusetts.<p>
This month, we also welcome Scott Burns as a regular columnist in our "Investing" section. Scott, who has long written about money issues for the Dallas Morning News, has always impressed us with the quality of his insights and the clarity of his prose.<p>

						Holiday Gifts<p>
By Ted C. Fishman<p>
Information technologies have transformed industries, revolutionized the workplace -- and reduced the agony of gift giving. With new products proliferating as fast as ideas, there's a good chance the person who has everything doesn't yet have the latest gizmo that just appeared yesterday. So we took stock of this moment in the digital age and came up with some gifts that are both fun and productive -- they boost brain power, help their recipients connect with others, or enable folks to enjoy their time alone.<p>
Perfect for the person on your gift list who makes lists, the Timex Data Link 150 Watch ($120) stores up to 150 names, addresses, dates, and other pieces of information. Load your facts into a computer using the software that comes with the watch, hold the watch up to the computer screen, and let a few flashing lights transfer the data. Among other uses, this storage capability makes the Data Link 150 a great navigator: Enter directions, then check them later en route. <p>
The Swatch Access ($50) also helps its wearers get from one point to another with greater ease -- in this case, onto the ski lift. The watch features a computer chip that can be read -- through clothing -- by lift-ticket scanners. The Access isn't accepted everywhere yet, but it works at several ski resorts in Europe and the western United States. Swatch has another watch, The Beep ($99), that incorporates a numeric beeper into four standard-sized nondigital styles. The watch stores up to 20 messages.<p>
If you want to give the gift of keeping in touch, the world's smallest cellular phone, Motorola's StarTAC ($1,000 and up), can make you forget about pagers. A mere 3.1 ounces, it fits nicely in a shirt pocket or small purse, yet it has most of the features cell-phone users crave, including a silent mode in which the phone vibrates instead of rings, long battery life, and a "smart button" that makes it easy to operate with one hand. For those who prefer no hands, the StarTAC also has a jack for a headset, a good way to talk while driving.<p>
While it may not look that exciting once the gift wrap is off, the SupraExpress 336 Sp with ASVD modem ($129) is another great-sounding way to maintain contact. It sports a speakerphone with caller identification and such functions as an answering machine. New technology allows the modem to split a single telephone line into two, so you can talk to the person your PC is linked to -- a handy way for two people far apart to work on a single document simultaneously (or to battle each other in multiplayer games like Doom and Quake).<p>
Modems aren't the only way to get the good stuff into a computer, of course. The CD-ROM version of the Encyclopaedia Britannica ($299), the world's most comprehensive reference work, is easy to navigate and fun to explore. The "natural language" search engine makes finding information a snap. And what the Britannica doesn't explain is likely to be found in Softkey's Multipedia ($59.95). This indispensable collection of 16 reference titles includes four bilingual dictionaries for English speakers, a home medical reference, the Oxford dictionaries of art and music, and -- this is our favorite -- Barron's Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms.<p>
For mutual-fund information, consider Morningstar's Ascent 2.0 ($45), the new version of Morningstar's  fund-analysis software. It's easy to use, yet exhaustive, with a database of 7,600 mutual funds and 70 fields of data on each; of course, it also includes Morningstar's star ratings for each fund. <p>
Frothier ratings can be sampled in Michael Jackson's World Beer Hunter ($35) from Discovery Multimedia, created by the world's leading authority on all things beery. This is essentially an international pub crawl: You just select a country, and Jackson suggests where to find the best stool and pint. He can settle such questions as the difference between German pilsner and India pale ale, too.<p>
If that special someone has special handwriting, give WriteType ($299.95), software that enables users to print documents in their own handwriting. After the writer fills out and returns a form, Signature Software sends a font that looks like his or her handwriting -- so much so that even the shapes of letters change according to where they fall in a word.<p>
A fun gift for someone who wants to stay out of touch is the CyberFlix CD-ROM game Titanic: Adventure out of Time ($49.95). Titanic re-enacts the 1912 maiden voyage of the doomed ship, with players in the roles of several passengers caught in an espionage caper. The ship has been re-created with stunning authenticity; first-class air travel will seem downright shabby next to the luxuries once available to well-heeled ocean-goers.<p>
If you can get your pictures into a computer -- via a scanner or a digital camera, or by having a film lab "develop" the snapshots onto a disk -- Family Album Creator ($49.95) from Creative Wonders will ensure that they do not turn that computer into a digital shoe box. The program also organizes pictures into various album-like formats and allows users to attach notes, sound clips, and short video segments to the album pages. These arrangements can then be easily shared among family and friends by merely trading disks.<p>
The best television may, in fact, be a computer -- if you give someone the newest generation of video boards. Used together, the 3-D Pro Turbo PC2TV ($299) and the ATI-TV ($129), both from ATI Technologies, put television shows on a PC monitor -- over the full screen, in a small box in the corner, or in the background as "wallpaper" while another application runs in front. Images or segments can be captured on the computer, as can the closed captions that accompany most television shows; instead of watching Wall Street Week, let the computer transcribe the program, then scan the text for the good parts.<p>
The Key Tronic Lifetime Wireless Trackball with keyboard ($130) and the Acecat III ($129) also make fine gifts for a techie. The keyboard works up to 50 feet away from the computer -- browse the World Wide Web from a lounge chair -- while the Acecat replaces the mouse with a stylus that mimics the inking qualities of drawing pens. This makes the Acecat an ideal tool for retouching scanned-in photographs or, when packaged with the easy but powerful painting program Dabbler, a tutor for learning how to draw.<p>
Books may be an old-fashioned medium, but at least reading them doesn't require an electronic rodent. Publisher John Wiley & Sons has been reissuing classic investor books, picking those with proven, enduring insights. It's nice to know that even if you end up giving someone all the available books new ones are in the pipeline for future gift-giving occasions. This season's addition to the Wiley Investment Classics (all books around $20) is Charles P. Kindleberger's Manias, Panics, and Crashes, and next spring Wiley will put out Benjamin Graham's The Interpretation of Financial Statements and Philip L. Carret's The Art of Speculation. So far, the series consists of Gerald M. Loeb's cautionary book, The Battle for Investment Survival, published in 1935, when caution was surely in order; Charles McKay's Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, the still-entertaining 1841 treatment of mass psychology in the market; Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, the fictional memoir published in 1923 by Edwin Lefvre and said to parallel the life of the legendary speculator Jesse Livermore; Phillip A. Fisher's Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits; and Fred Schwed Jr.'s Where Are the Customers' Yachts?<p>
A valuable and more recent investment book comes from our own senior financial editor, Jim Jubak. The Worth Guide to Electronic Investing (HarperBusiness, $17.50) helps individual investors with computers harness that computational power -- probably greater than what the entire firm of Merrill Lynch had 25 years ago -- by identifying the best programs for selecting, analyzing, and tracking investments. Plenty of guides address different investment packages, but Jubak's provides strategies for integrating computers into a lifelong investment strategy.<p>
Two books that help make sense of the investment -- and almost every other -- environment are Gary and Guity Becker's The Economics of Life (McGraw-Hill, $25) and Peter L. Bernstein's Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk (Wiley, $27.95). The first collects the best of Gary Becker's writings over the past 11 years for BusinessWeek and other places. Becker, a Nobel Prize winner and adviser to Bob Dole's presidential campaign, never met a free market he didn't like and, in true University of Chicago fashion, has plenty to say on how freer markets would right the world. Yet Becker is far from the expected right-winger, and his arguments in favor of legalizing drugs and selectively expanding immigration, among others, challenge liberals and conservatives alike. Against the Gods is another challenging book, one that may change forever the way people think about the world. A master at taking important but arcane and statistic-heavy material and putting it in plain, engaging English, Bernstein turns his attention to risk and its measures. The book surveys the concept of risk from ancient times through the Enlightenment and into the present to argue that progressive attempts to measure and insure against risk are as important to the economic development of the world as any of the usual suspects -- namely, science, capitalism, and democracy. Readers will never think about insurance agents the same way again.<p>
For armchair CEOs, consider a corporate page-turner from veteran Wall Street Journal reporter Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg, The Rain on Macy's Parade: How Greed, Ambition, and Folly Ruined America's Greatest Store (Times Books, $27.50). Or try Peter Canning's American Dreamers: The Wallaces and Reader's Digest: An Insider's Story (Simon & Schuster, $27.50). Lila and DeWitt Wallace began Reader's Digest in a Greenwich Village storeroom in 1922 and over the next 50 years turned it into a $6 billion publishing empire. Theirs is both an inspiring story of an institution built on the principles of decency and a chilling tale of how, late in life, the Wallaces, despite tremendous wealth and influence, could neither protect their dream from the corporate wolves nor end their days with the dignity they deserved.<p>
Ken Dornstein's Accidentally, On Purpose (St. Martin's, $26.95) is a fascinating book that delves into the underground economy of personal-injury insurance claims and litigation, tracing the scams back a century when "slip and fall artists" perfected the art of turning banana peels into gold. Dornstein, a former private investigator, is particularly gripping in describing how billions of dollars are reamed from the economy by a ruthless underworld.<p>
Truly frugal people often don't approve of gifts at all -- unless, that is, receiving a gift helps them save money. For them, Paint Your House With Powdered Milk (Hyperion, $7.95) may save Christmas, too. Author Joey Green (who also penned Polish Your Furniture With Panty Hose) suggests unexpected uses for hundreds of brand-name products. Some are actually plausible. Green is especially good at conjuring death for bugs: Maxwell House Coffee, Scotch Transparent Tape, and Kingford's Cornstarch all do the trick.<p>
Finally, for the person with no time to read (or kill bugs) but plenty of time to listen -- on the daily drive to work, maybe -- there's Dogbert's Top Secret Management Handbook, by Scott Adams (HarperAudio, $12). Dilbert books should be (and often are) read aloud while important office work is being put off, and, luckily, the best reader of all, Adams himself, has put his interpretive skills on tape. He delivers his latest book in a deadpan style frighteningly close to that of other business books on tape. But the advice is better and funnier. Here's Dogbert to managers on calculating how late to arrive for a meeting: Multiply the number of people attending by three, then show up whenever you want.<p>

						Stephen King is the richest man in town, but he doesn't lord it over his neighbors. Instead, they get richer off one another.<p>
By James Conaway<p>
Tarry on West Broadway Street in Bangor, Maine, and you are bound to see them. They arrive in Winnebagos and 4x4s, rented sedans and minivans piled with bicycles and collapsible pools; they emerge in Bermudas and armed with cameras and warily approach the wrought-iron fence embellished with winged bats and spiderwebs. Beyond sits a cranberry-and-white Victorian mansion in the Italianate-villa style, with turrets, a broad front porch, and a tower. "Electronic surveillance and alarm equipment is in use," reads the sign. "Please do not enter the grounds."<p>
The tourists' manner suggests that the warning isn't necessary, that something lurking on the other side of the fence just might turn them to jelly. This would be Stephen King, the house's owner, who has written innumerable books in the horror genre and is considered the most successful writer on earth, reportedly earning as much as $43 million in a single year. In September, he had six titles on The New York Times's paperback best-seller list simultaneously, all constituting a single serial novel, The Green Mile. The same month, two new hardbound novels appeared, Desperation and The Regulators (written under King's well-known pseudonym, Richard Bachman). His miniseries of The Shining is expected to be broadcast on ABC early in 1997.<p>
I came to this city of 33,000 looking for the prolific author and his effect on the place, curious about the role played in millennial America by the richest man in town. I was having more trouble locating him than finding the manifestations of his bounty, but then elusiveness is a prerogative of the wealthy. King's is made more intriguing because he has chosen to live where he is so much richer than everybody else. <p>
He lives in Bangor's best neighborhood, in one of Bangor's best houses, which he bought in 1980 for $135,000. Directly behind it lies a three-acre bluegrass expanse that cost King $1.2 million. It is a certifiable field of dreams, built on a city park by the writer in 1992 and given to the town for a category of baseball novitiates accustomed to more rudimentary conditions -- Little Leaguers. The Shawn T. Mansfield Baseball Stadium seats 1,500 and has concession stands, bull pens, and umpires' quarters. King paid another $125,000 for equipment for its upkeep: a turf aerator of the sort used almost exclusively on golf courses, a "top dresser" to spread sand, a mower, a dumper, and a bunker rake to smooth the infield's Beam Clay, which was trucked all the way up from New Jersey, the same kind that is used in Yankee Stadium.<p>
Every year King makes an additional contribution. "Stephen came by last spring," said Ronald St. Pierre when I found him smoking a cigar and supervising the laying of brick at the stadium's entrance. "He asked me what I needed for upkeep this year. He said, 'Just bring the bills by the office.'"<p>
St. Pierre, treasurer of an engineering firm, is the pro bono maintenance boss. He belongs to a supervisory committee that includes King, the president of an insurance company, a lawyer, and a businessman named Dave Mansfield, who acts as a Little League coach and manager. Mansfield was surprised when King offered to name the new park after Shawn, Mansfield's son who died at 14 from cerebral palsy. "I thought he would name it for the King family. It's not only for my son but for all the others who didn't have a chance to play. The handicapped have easy access. It's a very friendly environment."<p>
King, an ardent baseball fan, coached Little League between 1990 and 1995. He wrote an article for The New Yorker about his son Owen's team and its 1989 championship season. St. Pierre said King gave him a signed copy of the magazine. "People are always asking him for his autograph, which he doesn't do, and here I have something like that and I don't even know where I put it. I don't read his books," he added sheepishly. "He teases me a little bit about that....I miss him, miss his wit. He once said, 'You may think I'm weird, but weird paid for this ballpark.'"<p>
Once, the richest man in town sat in the first pew of his chosen church, his fortune lay in the local bank, and his industry occupied the riverbank or the railroad siding. Raw materials came from the town's surrounds, and he embodied the direct link between his product and the town's economic health. <p>
The wealth of what's left of Bangor's old-money families came mostly from timber. But though a rough-hewn statue of Paul Bunyan, a reminder of glory days, holds up the broad Maine sky in the town's grassy park, the forest that produced the legend of the Blue Ox and made Bangor the lumber capital of the world is gone -- and the shipbuilding and related fortunes with it. The dwindling of the big trees and the demise of the commercial sailing vessel left Bangor stranded between the Penobscot River and the ocean, an hour to the east. Shoe and boot manufacturing provided some jobs, but this business is now just about gone.<p>
"There's been no recent influx of business," said the president of Bangor's Chamber of Commerce, Peter Daigle. "We didn't enjoy the boom of the late '80s, but then we didn't have as far to fall." The average household income in Bangor is $29,619, and the average individual's annual take is $13,531. <p>
As I drove through Bangor's downtown, I listened to a King novel, The Stand, on cassette. It's about an unstoppable mutant virus and a malevolent federal government, with a cast of mostly bottom feeders ("his breath rattled in and out like a sound of October wind in dead corn husks"). I passed empty storefronts, their stair-step Victorian facades like the weathered faces of the men from the Greater Bangor Area Shelter who sat on benches nearby. Skateboarders -- baggy pants, shaved heads, rattails -- stood on a corner. Most businesses have moved to the mall, on the outskirts of town. It's now Bangor's second-largest employer.<p>
Betts Bookstore is downtown, though in a refurbished commercial district called West Market Square. Its proprietor, Stuart Tinker, a chubby fellow in a sports shirt, was talking by telephone to a collector on the West Coast about a King first edition when I entered. "It's a fair price," he said.<p>
Bangor has a number of bookstores (the University of Maine, just up the river at Orono, contributes to the intellectual climate), but Betts is the one that caters to fans of Stephen Edwin King. In 1990, Tinker and his wife decided to stock King's oeuvre, which now accounts for about 20 percent of sales. There are 45 titles listed on the Betts Bookstore Stephen King coffee mug. First and rare editions pull in a surprising amount of money. For instance, the oversize edition of the short story "My Pretty Pony," with a digital clock on the stainless-steel cover, published by the Whitney Museum of American Art as a fund-raiser, was available for $2,500. Tinker had already sold his limited edition of Firestarter, the one with the asbestos cover, for $9,000.<p>
Through a page on the World Wide Web, Tinker said, he receives inquiries from as far away as China and Russia. Out-of-town visitors often buy the latest paperback and maybe something special, like the signed edition of The Stand with a Bible-like black leather cover and gilt-edged pages nestled in red velvet inside a miniature wooden coffin (available for $995). "Yesterday this guy from New Zealand came in with his daughters. They were spending a week in California and flew to Boston and up here just for the day. They wanted to see where Stephen King lived. Now, that's not cheap."<p>
King's notoriety attracts enough visitors to affect the tourist trade, small though it is. (Bangor may be the one place in Maine that likes tourists.) "Bangor's become a destination. I've seen it in my E-mail," Tinker said. "Few people here realize the effect Stephen King has had on the city...on restaurants, motels, stores. People plan their honeymoons around King. They want to see the place he writes about."<p>
The biggest generic employer in the area is still "the forest" -- remnant white pine fed into the mills to the north that pump the sweetish smell of paper pulp into the air. But in Bangor, the biggest employer is the Eastern Maine Medical Center. It was built to serve those working in what is left of the outlying wood-fiber industry, but the largest single donation for the new children's wing ($750,000) came from King and his wife, Tabitha.<p>
Likewise the renovation of the Bangor Public Library (a classical edifice on Harlow Street built in 1911), which came about because of $2.5 million from the Kings. "Tabitha drove by one day," said library director Barbara McDade, "and saw that the front steps had been closed down -- they were unsafe -- and she called and said, 'What can we do to help?'"<p>
That was the beginning of an $8.5 million capital drive to build a new wing and to open the stacks to the public. "We decided accessibility would be the whole thrust," said McDade, referring to an ongoing concern of the Kings'. Tabitha King, who grew up outside Bangor and attended the local John Bapst High School, "considered this her library," McDade added. She paid for the engineering study and sat on the building and fund-raising committees. "She was a strong force," McDade said -- it sounded like an understatement to me -- and her husband gave a rare public reading.<p>
The library contains more than half a million volumes, has a phenomenal reference desk, and is highly regarded by Bangorians. It receives 2,000 visitors a day; no less than 67 percent of the populace have library cards. "Some outsiders say that's because there's nothing else to do in Bangor," said McDade, "but that's not true."<p>
For whatever reason, the library circulated about 1,200 books a day in 1995, more than 10 books per capita per annum. About a third of the operating budget comes from an endowment, but that is not enough for major repairs and certainly not enough for the new projects that had everyone so excited when I was there. The capital campaign had been a success, and I asked McDade what things would be like at the library if the Kings did not live in Bangor.
"We'd still be trying to get $100,000 from the city council," she said, "to fix the front steps." <p>
King, 49, is rooted in Maine. He lived with his mother and foster brother in the little town of Durham, south of Bangor, after King's father, a seaman, went out for cigarettes in 1949 and never came back. King's mother took subsistence jobs to support the family, and Stephen grew up reading secondhand paperbacks. <p>
He attended the University of Maine in Orono, where he met Tabitha Spruce, from nearby Old Town; her father owned a convenience store. King wanted to be a writer, and according to Edward Holmes, the English professor who taught him creative writing, "he found people here who took the idea of fiction seriously."<p>
King married Tabitha around the time of graduation and started teaching high-school English. He wrote novels and short stories and lived for a time in a trailer; he couldn't get the novels published. Then, in 1973, he started a novel about a teenage girl with supernatural powers, became discouraged, and tried to toss it. Tabitha reportedly picked the manuscript out of the proverbial trash can. It became the 1974 best-seller Carrie. When it was accepted for publication, King was working in a laundry. He telephoned his old professor that night with the news. "I wasn't too surprised," Holmes told me, "but I was astonished at the degree of his success."<p>
The Kings tried living elsewhere for a short while, but they came back to Maine and bought the big house on West Broadway that Tabitha had fallen in love with as a teenager, a house built in 1870 by a prosperous livery-stable owner. Here King settled into his astounding professional fecundity. <p>
For the next ten years or so, the best-selling novelist was generally available to other Mainers. A Bangor writer named Ardeana Hamlin asked King to address a "gifted and talented" class of teenagers she was teaching in nearby Dexter, in 1987, and King arrived in a green Mercedes, wearing cowboy boots and a leather jacket and carrying the crumpled manuscript of The Tommyknockers with coffee stains on it.<p>
He asked one of the students to take off his sneaker and put it on the table, Hamlin recalled. He gave them the assignment of describing the sneaker and how to tie it.<p>
King was candid with the class. When one student asked him if he had ever considered seeing a psychiatrist, King said, "No. If I did that, the darkness might all go away."<p>
 The classified section of the Bangor Daily News carries Happy Ads ("The McPherson Family would like to thank their children...for all their help last weekend in making the Anderson Family Reunion a success," "This bitter sweet 'Pickle' turns '50' which is older than dirt"), as well as those seeking blueberry rakers and bricklayers.<p>
The newspaper has been in the same family for more than a century. Its scion, Richard "Rick" Warren, a lean man in aviator glasses, is the publisher. Six bamboo fly rods hang on his office wall, and he owns several miles of prime salmon beat in New Brunswick. When I asked him about the effect of Bangor's famous novelist on the city, he said, not disapprovingly, "King generates a lot of traffic. His house must be the most visited in the country -- seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. I can attest to that because I live across the street."<p>
He put the Kings at the top of the donors in Bangor, adding, "It would be a mistake to think that they're the only significant givers." He referred me to the plaques in the Medical Center rather than divulge names from the dwindling ranks of timber heirs, "who might not appreciate it." <p>
The Kings' names are there. Other names belong to descendants of Bangorians whose money no doubt found its way into good works, as well as directly affected the city's economy. But some of these heirs tend to live off large land trusts, according to one student of the city.<p>
Listening to my Stephen King novel on tape, I had the impression the author knows as much about institutional neglect as corporal disaster ("a jagged splinter of plastic was lodged in one oozing eye"). Topical detail and brand names are deftly intertwined with physical appetites in a youthful argot heavy on put-down and obscenities. Surely that accounts in part for the appeal of King's stories to teenagers, who read them by the millions (King will sell about 25 million books in 1996). The story of The Stand involves the supernatural but is really about the failure of what was called, when King was young, "the system."<p>
One of the Kings' controversial involvements is with Shaw House, a home for runaway teenagers downtown. The Kings' role hasn't been publicized, but the Maine Grants Information Center at the University of Southern Maine lists them as giving $30,000 in 1993, support that has continued.<p>
I went there and found half a dozen young people sitting on the grass in front of the rudimentary building, quietly talking, and a basement piled with donated clothing. There were 16 beds in what one of the supervisors, Jayne Rogers, called a "low barrier" facility, meaning that referrals aren't necessary for the children to be accepted. "Some of them come for a couple of nights, when they need a respite from home, and then we have the chronic ones on the street all the time. We refer some out for counseling."<p>
Most of the funding comes from the local community, and so does the criticism. "Wherever kids hang out, people say they're ours," says Rogers. These include the saturnalian midnight gatherings of young people in West Market Square, redolent of cannabis, that are complained about by many of the remaining store owners. "Bedtime is 11 o'clock, but this is a homeless shelter. If kids show up at 3 a.m., we let them in."<p>
The Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation had assets in 1993 of $4 million and made gifts of more than $2 million to causes as various as Hope House, for recovering alcoholics ($40,000), the YMCA ($40,000), the United Way of Penobscot Valley ($30,000), the Pine Tree Chapter of the American Red Cross ($29,000), the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ($10,000), the United Negro College Fund ($5,000), and the National Poetry Foundation ($40,000).<p>
But most of their aid seems directed toward Bangor's children -- Shaw House, the Medical Center, the baseball field, other undisclosed projects. A prominent Bangorian, insisting on anonymity, told me of a blank check Tabitha King had given to a fund-raiser for a children's playground.<p>
And a friend of the Kings' said, "It's a shame, in a way. Everybody's got their hand out."<p>
The Kings are products of a so-called moralistic culture, according to Mark Woodward, the editorial-page editor for the Bangor Daily News. "The moralistic culture stresses community participation and the commonwealth over individual rights and elitism," Woodward said. It explains the cooperative nature of New England frontier life, particularly that of Maine. Caught between a wilderness and a cold ocean, suffering the privations of long winters, logging, fishing, and subsistence farming, Maine's people grew more interdependent than they might have been in more comfortable climes. The better off reach down to those below, the theory goes.<p>
I took this notion to Christopher Spruce, Tabitha King's brother and the general manager of the two radio stations in Bangor owned by the Kings. (One of them, WZON, is named after King's novel The Dead Zone.) "I grew up with Tabby and knew Steve early in their relationship," said Spruce in a comfortably cluttered office in an old building downtown. "It's in their natures to do this. When the need is there, people can ask them for help -- and get it."<p>
He agreed that charity has its disappointments. "I try to imagine what it's like for them. I don't know if I could take it. Whatever you do, it's never enough....If tomorrow they said, 'We're not doing this anymore,' nobody should raise an eyebrow."<p>
The radio station was bought in 1983 after King heard it was for sale. "He bought it to preserve rock and roll on AM," Spruce said. Later, King changed it to a sports station. "We have some of the most intensive local coverage anywhere," Spruce said. Games involving King's beloved Boston Red Sox are broadcast regularly, "but mostly we have live local sports."<p>
I asked Spruce what Bangor would be like if the Kings had decided to live in, say, Laguna Beach. "There would be no ball field, different radio stations. The hospital wing would have been built, but it wouldn't be so nice. The library would be a different configuration. It's more than monetary, it's emotional and intellectual: They're woven into the fabric of the community. Imagine unraveling a sweater, trying to tell which strands were theirs. You could put the sweater back together again, but there would be holes."<p>
It's a question of your attitude toward the future," Stephen King told me. "I've written all these books and the money rolls in, and what do I do with it all? I mean, how many suits can I buy? I have a Levi's body anyway. I put on an expensive suit and after an hour it looks like it came from f------ Robert Hall."<p>
His old running shoes were propped on the coffee table in the office where King's money is disseminated and his fan mail and scheduling handled. It's discreetly situated near the airport and has no listing in the telephone directory and no writing on the door. Journalists and fans who manage to find their way to the office are not encouraged to stay. I gave up hope of talking to the richest man in Bangor, but after several days in town I received an unexpected invitation to meet him at the office.<p>
He wore jeans and a T-shirt bearing the silk-screened likeness of a Venus flytrap and a fly about to enter it. "I don't have any interest in empire building, sequestering wealth, living off the sweat from the glass, and letting the principal go to subsequent generations." The sweat from the glass is interest, its contents a potential obsessive nightmare. "I don't want to end up like Howard Hughes, sitting in a hotel room watching Ice Station Zebra over and over again."<p>
He looks like the photographs: buck teeth, squinty eyes behind thick, steel-rimmed glasses, a slightly manic expression. The beard is gone, and the hair is beginning to gray. "Giving away money is like drugs -- you say you're only going to do it once." And, "Giving's for the giver, too. The more you talk about it, the more it dissipates." He meant charity's satisfactions, based in large part upon anonymity. King referred to the Bible quotation "When thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth."<p>
But he does, helter-skelter, calling supplicants "blowflies" and "piranhas" and evincing a brand of humor that goes back to the 1960s. "People come up to us and I'm reminded of that cartoon, the one about the coyote who looks at the roadrunner and sees a chicken dinner."<p>
"You get on the mailing lists," explained Tabitha King.<p>
She wore a T-shirt, too, baggy shorts, and granny glasses. Her chestnut hair is bobbed. Like her husband, she is a novelist but also the chief dispenser of King largesse. "If people know you're willing," she continued, the measured yang to her husband's hyperbolic yin, "they're more inclined to ask. Increasingly, you have to deal. In the beginning it was simple, a little money for the American Cancer Society, and then the organizations started coming forward. Then there were the local requests -- a library, a recreational facility," some other things. "We looked at each other, and said, 'We could do something about this.'"<p>
The effects of this admission now occupy roughly half her time: "I do more of the board service, more than I anticipated, but there's an infinite amount to be done and too few hands."<p>
About 10 percent of the King income is given away, a practice that goes back to his childhood. "My father 'did a bunk' when I was two," said Stephen King. "There was no such thing as latchkey kids then. My mother worked at different jobs and raised us, too. She still responded to the begging letters," not necessarily those from the Methodist church they attended but those from any benighted soul. "Our most serious problem today is that we spend billions on a military machine for Republican fat cats scratching each other's backs."<p>
His mother's 10 percent amounted to about $500 a year, which she could well have used. "I see Nancy Reagan and guys who look like they never missed a meal get up at the Republican convention and talk about how great Reagan was. Well, the Gipper never gave." 
As if to emphasize this allegation, he clamps down on a toothpick and makes a feint toward their Welsh corgi. "Nothing makes me sicker at my stomach than to hear these guys talk about making it on their own," he said. "Talent comes hardwired, it's in the system. You don't go out and say, 'Let me work 40 hours a week so I can become a successful writer.'"<p>
An employee brought him a stack of books, and he began to autograph them. I asked why they chose to live in Bangor. "The area's full of my relatives," Tabitha King said. "We both went to Orono, and we needed a town with a decent airport and schools where our children didn't have to ride a bus. We were both comfortable with a small town." <p>
"One of the great things about Bangor is that it's small enough to see the results," said Stephen King. "You have a vision for Bangor," he told his wife. "There are things you want for it, things I want. Like the library. Where else are you going to find 18 copies of Peyton Place? It's an immense satisfaction."<p>
Of Shaw House, Tabitha King said, "It's controversial, but people don't realize that the only choice for those kids is prostitution or dying in the snow. Their existence is a blunt fact. The social safety net is a joke. The only alternative is some kind of private charitable response." She is capable of some hyperbole of her own, also rooted in the 1960s.<p>
But she's in the habit of carefully reading the annual reports of the organizations appealing for money, to see how it is spent: "You keep an eye on how flashy the brochure is."<p>
King nodded toward his wife. "She's more hardheaded than I am. 'Give, but don't be a chump.'"<p>
There is a suggestion that the advantages of wealth are not worth the growing responsibility, and yet the books keep coming. The Kings want to protect their three children from the burdens of wealth, and yet they are already grown, the eldest son an aspiring novelist, their daughter a restaurateur in Portland, Maine, and their youngest son -- the former Little Leaguer -- a sophomore at Vasser. "We'll make sure the kids don't inherit too much," he said. "They know what it's like, they can't go out of the house without getting their picture taken. They don't want it."<p>
The Kings have modest appetites, considering. "There's no Bahamanian retreat," he said, "no yacht, no plane." They watch a lot of movies and baseball, basketball, and hockey games; he smokes five Merits a day and also prays, although he hasn't been to church since childhood. "I don't own my money, I'm a custodian. How do I do the best with it?" He shrugged. "If I die, it goes to her. She can do with it whatever she wants. That's cool."<p>
Lately they have begun assigning royalties from various novels to specific causes. "I don't know how much will be around when we croak," she added. <p>
At the end of the 20th century, the significant money in this town still pumps at an industrial-revolution rate. This rich man could qualify as a Manchester capitalist on one level, but his politics are egalitarian and his gifts wear the individual, somewhat demonic human face once obscured by tact and convention.<p>
This rich man not only does not sit in the first pew, but he stays home Sundays (or goes to ball games). His money, managed in far-flung Gotham, finds its most meaningful way into the local economy through taxes and good works. The remote industry that fuels it is an adjunct of media, and his radio stations -- a dalliance -- influence the citizenry more subtly but no less persistently than once did the deacons. <p>
The night before I left Bangor I returned to West Broadway, still listening to The Stand (it's a long book, reader). A single lamp burned on the second floor of the King residence; the tourists were gone, and banks of spotlights shone on the baseball field. The frontiers of Bangor's most exclusive neighborhood, I noticed this time, were quite rudimentary: a video store, a Citgo station, a Best Buy used-car lot, a House of Pizza. Two women sat smoking on a concrete stoop across Hammond Street while their children gamboled in the dust and a one-armed man in a T-shirt strolled past.<p>
Bangor has little violent crime, but the side of the American dream reflected here seems only distantly related to mansions or turf-dressing equipment. Likewise, fictional King country is the seedy strip between security and despair, light and darkness. His novels, the source of fabulous income and extensive giving, are populated not just by diseases and fiends but also by unemployed adults, abused kids, neglected spouses, forgotten oldies, drifters, users, and all manner of the physically, mentally, and emotionally challenged: people, in short, every one of them in need of a break.<p>

						Top-quality unusual gifts in the mail, not the mall<p>
By Anne Field<p>
So hopelessly behind in your holiday shopping you'll pay anything to get it done? Or perhaps you're the organized, picky type who'll spend a little more if it means finding the right thing. In either case, there's a world of top-of-the-line mail-order catalogs that you can turn to, offering everything from a deluxe car-seat cover to the ultimate crystal bowl -- with no lines to wait in. Of course, with over 10,000 catalogs to choose from, you'll also find a lot of schlock. For those interested more in quality or unusual fare than in rock-bottom prices, these catalogs may provide the gifts you need.<p>
Calyx & Corolla (800-800-7788). Unless she's an allergy sufferer, even the hardest-to-please mother-in-law has to like flowers, right? For the non-afflicted, Calyx & Corolla features fresh cut flowers that are shipped directly from the grower. Or try a year's worth: For $375, your recipient gets a bouquet once a month. <p>
The Celebration Fantastic (800-235-3272). An idiosyncratic assortment of high-end novelty items, from a $199 cardigan with multicolored pictures of cappuccino cups to a $35 Cat in the Hat silk tie. For $99, the Holiday Club will send someone special an eight-ounce shipment of chocolate-covered Oreos that have the appropriate decorative toppings on each of five holidays -- Christmas, Valentine's Day, Saint Patrick's Day, Easter, and Halloween.<p>
Chambers (800-334-9790). High-quality linens, towels, and other items for bed and bath. You'll find such luxury goods as leather-trimmed, chrome-plated brass bathroom furnishings, including a $129 tissue-roll holder and a $149 toilet brush. Too pedestrian? Then turn to the chrome-plated or brass "tub valet," which costs $330; it extends across the width of a bathtub, with compartments for soap, washcloths, bath salts, and two candleholders. <p>
French Creek Sheep & wool (800-977-4337). Shearling coats, jackets, vests, and such, designed and manufactured mostly on a 40-acre family-owned sheep farm in Pennsylvania Dutch country. And you'll also find shearling car-seat covers ($145 a pair), lined boots (beginning at $115 a pair), baby buntings ($225), and other sheep-related items, including a watercolor print of several woolly critters for $45 and a copper ram wind chime for $42. <p>
Levenger (800-544-0880). Billed as a reader's catalog, Levenger offers some of the world's most glamorous office supplies. Try a $199 replica of the famous Skyline fountain pen from the 1930s, with its teardrop shape and 14-karat-gold engraved nib. The more newfangled stuff includes a $24.95 leather mouse pad and a $799 ergonomically correct chair based on a design by Herman Miller.<p>
Steuben (800-424-4240). As you would expect, this catalog is visually exquisite, with an array of glistening sculptures, vases, bowls, and the like. It's also big -- 144 pages with almost 250 products. Prices range from high to higher: from $85 for a crystal four-leaf clover to $35,000 for a decorative bowl with swan carvings.<p>
Scientifics (609-547-8880). For everyone from serious science buffs to precocious preschoolers and even space travelers: Vacuum-sealed astronaut-style servings of french fries and pizza are $5.50. There are three full pages of telescopes (a model for neophytes sells for $249) and various astronomy-related stuff. <p>
Sylvia Woods Harp Center (800-272-HARP). Harps, harp accessories, harp recordings, harp jewelry, harp books, harp-shaped rubber stamps -- they're all here in this simple black-and-white catalog. Special bonus: Assorted harp-related historical tidbits are sprinkled throughout the catalog. Top-of-the-line harps top out around $30,000. <p>
Then there's Hammacher Schlemmer (800-543-3366), the oldest continually published catalog in the country, which always boasts the most gloriously impractical gift of the year. This year's annual Hammacher Schlemmer tribute to overkill: the $139,000 Variable Attitude Submersible Hydrofoil, which gives any James Bond manqu the ability to cruise not only on top of and under the water but through the air at speeds nearing 85 miles per hour. Piloting lessons included.

						Hey, big tipper -- been seeing the AmEx centurion a lot lately?<p>
By Tom Nawrocki<p>
The tournedos of beef were to die for, the wine was playful yet sophisticated, and the service was not too shabby. But is that the real reason you're tipping 20 percent? Or is it because there's a credit-card logo on the tray holding the bill?<p>
It may be the tip tray. According to a report in the October issue of the Journal of Applied Psychology, diners at two restaurants in upstate New York left tips that were an average of 4.29 percent higher if they saw a credit-card insignia -- even if they paid cash. <p>
One of the researchers, Heather Belmont, had an ulterior motive: A student at Ithaca College, she was also working as a waitress at the time. As a biased participant who was aware of the study's desired result, she had to keep her figures out of the final data. But she kept the tips.  <p>

						By Tom Nawrocki<p>
When hockey's florida Panthers made it to the finals of the Stanley Cup Championship last spring, where did team owner H. Wayne Huizenga go? Not to Disney World but to Wall Street. The Blockbuster magnate announced that he would take his Panthers public, in an IPO due this fall.<p>
But don't upgrade that team pennant to stock yet. The Panthers, just in their fourth NHL season, are no blue-puck investment. "If you're good for most of a five- to seven-year cycle, the value of a franchise is enhanced," says Peter Russ, who follows the Boston Celtics Limited Partnership -- the only publicly traded pro team in any sport -- for money-management firm Shelby Cullom Davis & Company. "But short-term success can hurt a team's bottom line." Especially when players' salary demands accelerate faster than media revenues.<p>
Even the Celtics, with 16 NBA championships, have returned just 8 percent annually to their shareholders. The team hasn't won a play-off series in the past three years. "The Celtics can afford one or two more years of mediocrity before it affects the value of the franchise," says Russ. The Green Bay Packers probably considered such pressure back in 1950, when they offered shares priced at $25 to loyal fans. Packers stockholders bought into a nonprofit organization, so they get no dividends or ticket privileges. Plus, the shares can't be bought, only inherited. "You can't make any money off of being a shareholder," says a Green Bay Packers corporation spokesman.<p>
But will Panthers investors ever see green? Hard to say, but note that Huizenga has no plans to go public with his Miami Dolphins or Florida Marlins. "He'll take all the goodies from his two best teams," scoffs Russ, "and let the public share his lesser franchise."<p>

						Reported by Jennifer Barton<p>
Not long ago, Ted Turner railed against his fellow billionaires, calling them "ol' skinflints," unable to open their charitable purse strings for fear of falling off the Forbes rich list. "Why don't they sign a joint pact to each give away a billion and then move down the Forbes list equally?" he suggested to The New York Times.<p>
Among multibillionaires, there are some spectacularly generous philanthropists -- Walter Annenberg, for one. But what about the others? How much do they donate to charity? What nonprofit organizations get their money? And, finally, are any of them "anonymous"?
To find some answers, we checked news clips, biographies, and philanthropic associations. We called the billionaires and their foundations to get as complete a picture of their giving as possible. We limited our search to the past five years and to the rich list's top tier, those worth $2 billion and more, using the July 15 issue of Forbes as our guide. Because we were interested in how the new crop of billionaires spends its charitable dollars, we ignored inherited wealth.<p>
Reactions to our questions ranged from "no comment" to enthusiastic cooperation. One thing to bear in mind: Anonymous donations are few and far between -- 1 to 2 percent of all giving. Another thing: A gift of $1 million from a billionaire is comparable to a gift of $100 from someone with $100,000.<p>
William H. Gates
<a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>, 41 years old

Foundation gifts: Include $2 million to the Population Council to fund clinical trials of RU-486.
Private gifts: $680,000 to Girls Inc., raised through the Omaha Classic (annual golf, tennis, and dinner outing).
Comment: According to Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist, by Roger Lowenstein, Buffett has said he will leave his money to his foundation. "'When I am dead,' he observed, 'I assume there'll still be serious problems of a social nature as there are now.'... Buffet could have been peeling off tens of millions for society's 'serious problems' every year and still would not have diminished his pile of chips by even 1 percent."
Lowenstein also writes that an experience in the 1970s with Grinnell College soured Buffett on giving to universities. According to Allen Greenberg, Buffett's son-in-law, who manages the foundation, "'Warren would rather choke to death than write a check to a university.'"<p>
Paul G. Allen
Microsoft, 42 years old
$7.46 billion

Comment: When asked by The New York Times (10/29/95) what it's like to be a billionaire, Allen responded: "It's...a lot...of...money.... Hopefully, you find some way to put that in charitable hands, to do something good for society as a whole."<p>

Kirk Kerkorian
Investments, 79 years old
$4.36 billion

Says Thomas Maier, author of the biography Newhouse: "Considering the huge amount of money the Newhouses make, they give an extraordinarily small amount to charity" (according to data from fiscal year 1991).<p>

According to Gerald Posner, author of Citizen Perot, "Perot is very generous in his giving. The two aspects that make him different than many other donors is he does not need his name on the gift. That's the plus side. The downside is when you get Perot's money, you get him. He views a gift as an investment, and if you don't spend it as you agreed, he'll ask for it back."<p>

						Is there anyone big enough to match the great man's largesse?<p>
By Richard Todd<p>
Not long ago, on a trip up the Maine coast, I stopped at the Portland Museum of Art and soon found myself staring in admiration at a small painting by John Singer Sargent. It was one I'd never seen before, a portrait of Mrs. Henry St. John Smith. According to a plaque, the painting had been a gift to the museum from the subject's grandson. Mrs. St. John Smith had been a beautiful woman, with dark hair and a thin, elegant nose, and Sargent had painted her with his usual intimacy and constrained sensuality. It's a splendid painting.<p>
I had been thinking about philanthropy recently, and standing there I had a sudden apprehension of the philanthropic impulse -- it seemed a concretely noble thing. I realized simultaneously that I must lack it, because had I been the owner of such a beautiful object I could never have parted with it. <p>
Later I looked into the painting's history, and the story, of course, turned out to be more complicated than I had imagined: a family dispute over whether or not to sell, a compromise decision to make the gift to the museum, a donation assisted by the U.S. tax code, which allowed the donor to take a charitable deduction equal to the full appreciated value of the painting. <p>
Yet I still had the sense that the man who could give this thing away was not just a richer but a better man than I. And it struck me that in a society concerned about its stability feelings of this sort are usefully cultivated.<p>
We are famously a country of dualisms, and one we enjoy is this: Unless some tribe of loony getters and givers is discovered in the rain forest, America is at once the most acquisitive and the most philanthropic of cultures. It's a paradox remarked on by Tocqueville and cherished ever since. Often enough, philanthropy is the story we tell to help us forget the materialism of national life. But it's a true story, too. Robert Payton of the Indiana University Center on Philanthropy says, "The philanthropic tradition is America's most distinctive virtue." <p>
The health of that tradition, though, has many people worried, particularly as they contemplate the famous "$10 trillion transfer" of wealth that will occur in the next generation. Total philanthropic contributions continue to rise -- by nearly 11 percent in 1995 -- but what ethic will govern the disposition of the enormous wealth assembled since the Second World War? A study done three years ago revealed that eight of ten individuals with estates over $1 million left nothing to nonprofit institutions. "Put another way," says Peter Karoff of the Philanthropic Initiative, a consulting group, "10 percent of the wealthy give 80 percent of the gifts." <p>
Last year, Americans gave about $140 billion to charity -- that is, to one another. How large a sum this is depends on your perspective. On the one hand, it's about $20 billion more than the federal deficit, and it almost equals total revenues from corporate income taxes. On the other hand, $140 billion is considerably less than the total net worth of the 100 richest Americans.<p>
The country now has 149 billionaires (individuals and families), according to a July issue of Forbes magazine. One would not want these billionaires to strip themselves of assets, but suppose we approached only those with more than $2 billion and asked them to give away all but a basic billion. Together, this little group of 62 could create, for example, 27 universities as well endowed as Harvard. Yet despite some instances of spectacular generosity among the new plutocrats -- such as George Soros, Walter Annenberg, and the late David Packard and Walter Haas -- most of the fortunes remain unnicked by philanthropy. (Perhaps the situation will change soon: Ted Turner, whose net worth is about to increase thanks to Time Warner's acquisition of his network, has proposed a philanthropic competition among billionaires.) Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, and Sumner Redstone are just the best known of the billionaires who have to date declined to commit substantial portions of their fortunes to the public good. <p>
But $140 billion is also less than it may seem because neither the source nor the use of the money is subject to even the roughest hand of a market. It's a glory and sometimes a heartbreak of philanthropy that it often seems utterly random and chaotic. A celebrity falls victim to an obscure disease and suddenly it has a foundation and researchers devoted to a cure. Huge fortunes sit on the sidelines, while lesser ones participate. No one asks Mookie Wilson, the former New York Met, to endorse sneakers these days, but among athletes he is one of the most dedicated of philanthropists. The famous MacArthur Foundation hands out "genius" grants, but a renegade MacArthur heir, Rick MacArthur, runs his own foundation, which concentrates on the rights of death-row inmates: "It gives me a lot of satisfaction to help those despised by the rest of society," he says.<p>
Prudent philanthropic management argues for the preservation of capital into perpetuity, but some benefactors break this rule with spectacular results. Aaron Diamond, who made his money in Manhattan real estate, bequeathed about $150 million to his foundation; the intention was to give it all away within ten years of his death. Under the guidance of his wife, Irene, the foundation has now spent nearly all its capital; doing so enabled it to sponsor the work that led to the discovery of protease inhibitors for AIDS treatment. <p>
Although for most of us foundations present the most visible face of philanthropy -- awarding grants, commissioning studies -- the 42,000 foundations in the country account for only about $10 billion of philanthropic giving. Last year fully 40 percent of all money given came from individuals and went to their churches; schools received about 15 percent of all individual giving.<p>
Without this $140 billion river of charity, our culture would be an unimaginably more arid place: symphonies silenced; museums, libraries, schools, and hospitals closed, along with countless little centers of betterment, from homeless shelters to think tanks. As Robert Payton of the Center on Philanthropy puts it, most crucially philanthropy does the work that wouldn't get done otherwise, "the things in which the market is uninterested and at which the state is incompetent."<p>
As the parable of the widow's mite instructs, it isn't the size of the gift that matters in the eyes of God but the amount of the sacrifice. By this standard, many will tell you that the poor are the most generous people in America. Indeed, an oft cited study done a few years ago seemed to prove that the poor give a larger percentage of their income to charity than any other income group. The finding became one of those pleasing, symbolic pieces of information, appealing as it does to a sentimental cynicism about the classes.<p>
But it wasn't quite accurate. Among households that give anything, those in the lowest brackets give a higher percentage, but the percentage of contributing households rises as you go up the income ladder. Among families with incomes over $100,000, virtually all donate something to charity. <p>
But if the myth of the golden-hearted poor doesn't quite hold up, the facts are startling enough. The truth is that, by and large, contributions don't vary much at all according to class: The proportion of household income devoted to charity remains pretty constant, between 2 and 3 percent, rising modestly among the very rich.<p>
Tracy Gary learned when she was quite young that she would never have to work, though she was told by her mother that she must work out of social obligation. Growing up with houses in New York and Florida and a summer retreat on an island in Lake Superior, she had not escaped the knowledge that she was rich, but her inheritance, $2 million, wasn't revealed to her until she was a teenager. By then she had received lessons in philanthropy. Her first allowance was, in effect, attached (many of the giving rich tell this very anecdote about themselves): She was to give away a nickel of every quarter she received. In high school, she was given a checking account designated specifically for charity; she donated $1,000 or $2,000 a year, chiefly on the island where she summered.<p>
Some people go to a college like Sarah Lawrence and discover the existence of the upper class, but it was there (she graduated in 1973) that Gary realized many people were poorer than she had thought. She paid the tuition of one student who would otherwise have had to drop out. She says she made some mistakes -- loans that went unpaid -- and she is glad she did because they saved her from greater mistakes later on.<p>
What is a value or a good habit for some became the center of her life. In San Francisco, where she now lives, she is national director of Resourceful Women, a network of some 80 women with combined personal assets in excess of $2 billion. The group gives away about $30 million a year, most of it to "socially progressive" causes. She acts as intermediary between recipients and donors, counseling donors on the most effective ways to give. For some, this is a life-changing experience, a moment of coming to terms with the good fortune that has often provided them with an uneasy identity. <p>
"What I see again and again among the rich is that they feel anxious, worried that it's all going to go away and that it can't be replaced," says Gary. Creating a plan that involves giving away money in an orderly fashion paradoxically makes people feel safer. "Among women, especially, I see what I call Bag Lady Syndrome, women who won't spend a penny on themselves because they fear that, once they start spending, the money will vanish. I have literally known homeless people on the street who feel more self-confidence than many people who have $5 million in the bank....Giving helps people to integrate their sense of wealth and security."<p>
Of her original $2 million inheritance, she has given away about $1.7 million, and she lives on investments that were generated by the rest. The pleasure she now derives from money comes from raising large sums of it for causes she cares about: "It's a skill I have." When she started giving away assets, she says, "an enormous sense of abundance came over me. You would think you would feel depleted, but no, it's just the opposite."<p>
Those for whom wholesale divestiture is a way of life are rare; still, when you set out to learn something about philanthropy you are struck by the number of people who have walked away from substantial fortunes. <p>
I recently met a quiet Midwesterner named David Frey, who looks like the bank vice president he is, at NBD Bank in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He also serves on the board of the Frey Foundation, which is devoted to local environmental and welfare issues. Like the fortune that founded it, the foundation is not nationally known. <p>
Yet $120 million endows this organization, all wealth created by Mr. Frey's father, who started the Foremost Insurance Company. Frey says of himself and his siblings: "We didn't think it was in our best interests to have the money. Learning to live with wealth is a challenge, and the world is replete with examples of how not to do it. People who have been around wealth, particularly mature wealth, learn that it's not having a house on every continent that counts. You can take a more balanced view. You can have your toys and still be philanthropic."<p>
The name on Peggy Dulany's birth certificate is Margaret Dulany Rockefeller. She's the daughter of David Rockefeller and the late Margaret McGrath Rockefeller, but she ceased using her last name during the 1960s after she graduated from Radcliffe, an anti-war activist at odds with her father's politics. She has long since mended her fences with her family, but she still enjoys the buffer of anonymity you don't have if you're a Rockefeller.<p>
Of the current generation -- "the cousins" -- Dulany is the one who most prominently enacts the family's philanthropic tradition. She is the only Rockefeller who serves on the board of the Rockefeller Foundation, she is a frequent proselytizer for philanthropic activity, and she founded a nonprofit organization of her own, called Synergos Institute. <p>
Synergos (accent on the second syllable) addresses international poverty, concentrating on projects in six countries -- Ecuador, Brazil, Mexico, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and India. Its interests don't differ greatly from those of the internationally minded Rockefeller Brothers Fund, though it reflects its founder's liberal politics, with an emphasis on involving the beneficiaries in decisions meant to better their lives.<p>
Peggy Dulany speaks of her student years working in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro: "One thing I learned in Brazil I have never forgotten, and that is how hard people work to solve their problems. The myth of the lazy poor is just that -- a myth. But there is a terrible gap between the very poor and access to the information they need."<p>
Vacationing last summer at her house near Mount Desert Island, Maine, she reflected on how the Rockefeller tradition of philanthropy had been passed on to her, including the instruction that part of her childhood allowance was always for others. But she added, "I've been thinking about my mother, who died earlier this year, and in a way I think I got more of my values from her. She had an intense sense of fairness and justice. She would write us from trips about things she saw that troubled her. It means a lot when a parent does that. We would travel through Harlem and talk about how wrong it was for people to have to live like that." <p>
There is much one would like to know about the inner life of any Rockefeller, of the pictures in the mind (memories of a ride through Harlem imposed on the view out a seaside window), the mingled sense of power and helplessness. In Dulany's mind, the questions seem to have resolved themselves pragmatically: "I don't believe that altruism is one of the basic human emotions, not like sadness or anger. It's something you have to learn. When I talk to people about philanthropy, I talk about self-interest. What I say is that when there is despair at the bottom of society it will find its way to the top. The gaps are growing wider, and in the long run that's bad for the world and bad for everybody."<p>
Philanthropy is disarming. My skepticism fades in the presence of people giving away millions. Yet I suppose it is wise to remember that motives can be mixed.<p>
Some would say that the motives are worse than mixed. People who work in the field -- the fund-raisers, consultants, program officers -- can become jaded. One such woman says, "What motivates donors? The motivation is 100 percent taxes. That's what these people brag about to me -- how much they're saving in taxes. There is this ethos among the rich -- we don't pay taxes, taxes are for schnooks. Let the schnooks pay to run the government, we'll get the glory of being philanthropists."<p>
The tax code, it's true, provides some comfortable enhancements of the Schedule A deduction for contributions. Deferred giving, for instance, allows you to pledge assets to the old school, the assets to be transferred only after your death, while you enjoy both the onetime tax deduction and the income from the assets during your lifetime. Other options, available even to the moderately well off, may save actual dollars in return for painless gifts. You may be able to give development rights on your property to the local land trust. The trust will preserve the land, and you'll get a tax break.<p>
As is the case everywhere in the tax code, with more money to work with, more interesting deductions present themselves. One afternoon in his Manhattan office, James E. Hughes Jr., a lawyer specializing in the tax implications of charitable giving, took me through some of the possibilities. "There are two basic instruments," he said, "the charitable remainder trust and the charitable lead trust."<p>
He explained that the charitable remainder trust is essentially a glorified version of the deferred gift to Yale. "A lot of people who sell their businesses do this. You avoid paying the capital-gains tax on the stock sale, and you use the charitable deduction to offset income. Then ultimately the principal can pass to a family philanthropy."<p>
I asked Hughes if there is a way a family can establish a "family philanthropy" and end up with more money in their pockets than they would have had otherwise. "Actually there is a way," he said. "Let's say a client has an estate of $4 million to $5 million, and a million of that is in a tax-deferred retirement plan. That million will be taxed at the rate of 88 to 92 percent. If you use it to establish a family philanthropy, the rate drops to 15 percent. Now the law allows that family members may receive modest compensation for their work in a family foundation. In many cases the 'modest compensation' is larger than what they'd receive as inheritance after taxes."<p>
The charitable lead trust accomplishes something similar in the avoidance of estate taxes, and it can work on a far larger scale. In this case, the principal remains in the hands of the benefactor, or the heirs, while the income goes to charity for a specified length of time, ideally long enough to offset the taxes that would otherwise be due.<p>
For all of the industry and invention that goes into tax planning, Hughes maintains, the tax code is not the real motivator in charitable giving. "Intermediaries [lawyers, accountants] feel that they have to sell the tax benefits. But a tax benefit is not what people are really getting. People who give get an extraordinary sense of personal value from it, particularly when they do it as a family. The planning can be more important than the actual giving. It gives people a chance to discover at last the real passions of their family members."<p>
The coziness the tax code affords the charitable angers many -- and only in part, I think, for reasons of social policy; that is, outrage at the tax dollars lost for the government's programs of betterment. The real annoyance has to do with the motivation of the donors, whose impulse is felt to be impure if it includes self-benefit.<p>
But one can argue: So what? Isn't it the net effect that matters? And the net effect is the movement of resources toward, if not to, the bottom of society. As one foundation executive puts it, "Whoever wrote the provision in the tax law of 1913, whoever saw that it was wise to give special benefits for the transfer of assets, that man is an unsung American hero....This is the way to redistribute wealth in this country -- because it's voluntary."<p>
Claude Rosenberg, founder of RCM Capital Management in San Francisco, is one of those men whose every phrase seems to emanate from a bottomless reserve of financial prudence. He has written a book called Wealthy and Wise, in which he "confesses" to a moment when he made an unsettling discovery about his personal finances -- he didn't realize how much disposable income he had, and it was a great deal more than he would have guessed. "We had dramatically understated our potential," he writes. "Since we were basically happy with our standard of living...we concluded that we could have been sharing more of what we had. A lot more!"<p>
What Rosenberg discovered to be true of his family he found, on research, to be true of many -- in fact, he argues that a wholesale underestimation of its ability to be generous pervades the American upper class. "My research," he writes, "resulted in a startling conclusion: the charitable deductions of the IRS's top income group averaged less than 10 percent of what they could safely afford!" It is Rosenberg's contention that charitable giving, chiefly by the rich, could be increased by $100 billion annually without anyone's really feeling the pinch.<p>
This bonanza would come from a relative few: 90 percent of it from 3.4 million taxpayers, with 40 percent from just 51,000 of the very rich. Forty billion dollars from 51,000 people means an average contribution of about $800,000 a year. That it's eminently possible for 51,000 people to do this is another impressive illustration of the amount of wealth held by the very rich in this country.<p>
What is a reasonable amount for the well-off to contribute? Conventionally this question is answered in terms of income, in part because of the charitable deduction (limited to 50 percent). Rosenberg argues that the amount should be calculated instead on a basis of earning assets -- investments that produce income. Looked at in this way, the giving habits of America's rich seem embarrassingly stingy. Rosenberg's figures are from 1991; in that year taxpayers in the Internal Revenue Service's highest tier had an average annual income of $1.8 million (excluding capital gains) and took an average of $87,000 in charitable deductions, 4.8 percent of their income. Rosenberg calculates an average net worth, counting only earning assets, of $16 million for these people and points out that the average donation is just one-half of 1 percent of that figure. (The giving habits of the poor do begin to look more virtuous; one-fifth of the population, including many donors, has a negative net worth.) Rosenberg argues that even among the moderately wealthy charitable contributions of 2 to 3 percent of earning assets are not onerous.<p>
What would be the effect on the nation of such an upsurge in charity? The initial effect might be problematic -- a loss in tax revenues. But Rosenberg argues plausibly that the near- and long-term results would be a reduction of the federal deficit and a major enhancement of social programs. Professionals in the "third sector" always caution that private philanthropy can never be expected to supplant public programs, and of course they are right. Yet suppose a significant portion of the $100 billion were directed toward innovative programs for the poor. The welfare programs the nation argued over most strenuously last year -- Aid to Families With Dependent Children; Women, Infants, and Children; and food stamps -- represented a total expenditure of $52 billion. Even a quarter of the $100 billion could make an enormous practical difference. Perhaps most important, the ties between the upper and lower reaches of society, which now seem frayed to near nonexistence, might be strengthened. <p>
There is not a whiff of the revolutionary about Rosenberg, who is a friend of wealth. In conversation he has a kind of technocratic enthusiasm for problem solving and the confidence of someone whose money problems ended when he earned his first nickel. His vision is an ameliorative one; if anything, he means to preserve rather than upset the existing order. "Let's think about what will happen if we don't do this: If we were to have another recession in this country, we could see some very ugly things." Yet for all its essential conservatism, the Rosenberg model, were it enacted by America's rich, would indeed alter the social landscape. <p>
Not surprisingly, Rosenberg's ideas are much touted among foundation executives and others in the third sector. His book has enjoyed several small printings, and he gives much of his time now to advancing his cause and to practicing what he preaches, through a family foundation. But on the outside no one seems to know about his ideas. What they need, everyone seems to agree, is a highly visible spokesman.<p>
In liberal-doctrinaire history classes at certain schools, the figure of Andrew Carnegie struts only briefly upon the stage. He is characterized as a robber baron who ultimately did penance by a program of philanthropy that itself turned out to be an opportunity for self-glorification. The teacher will mention Carnegie's monumental libraries, pointing out that he failed to provide books.<p>
This had been my education, and it was a surprise to learn that among contemporary students of philanthropy Carnegie is an altogether different figure -- little less than a hero. At the Center on Philanthropy, he and Jane Addams are honored with a fellowship given in their names. His landmark essay, "The Gospel of Wealth," published in 1889, remains the most important credo on the subject of philanthropy ever written in America. <p>
According to Dwight Burlingame, a director at the center, "Carnegie still has lessons for us today. Get beyond the language and the gender issues. He had the guts to face the big questions about the objects of wealth." <p>
The "Gospel" began as two magazine pieces, published in North American Review, at a moment when Carnegie, though nowhere near as rich as he would become, started shifting the focus in his life from making money to giving it away. Only 15 years after he began to manufacture steel, his net worth stood at $30 million (by the end of his life he would give away $350 million). His good fortune suddenly seemed to him the emblematic and not untroubling story of the age in which he lived. The essay sets out its theme grandly: "The problem of our age is the proper administration of wealth, that the ties of brotherhood may still bind together the rich and poor in harmonious relationship."<p>
Class relations is a persistent theme. Carnegie laments the separation between the classes -- which, he acknowledges, increases in industrial society. But he quickly points out that this is a necessary price one pays for a civilization that has put hitherto unimaginable amenities within reach of the masses, even as it has disproportionately rewarded the few: "much better this irregularity than universal squalor."<p>
But the social machine needs to be prevented from self-destructing, and the governor is philanthropy. Carnegie had contempt for those who sought to provide vast estates for their heirs, arguing that inherited wealth is bad for the society and bad for the beneficiaries. This leads to the essay's most famous line: "The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced."<p>
To Carnegie, the burden on the philanthropist is the betterment of his fellows, the placing of "ladders on which the aspiring can rise." Carnegie lays out the rationale for his program of libraries and describes other suitable venues -- such as museums, universities, public halls, "swimming-baths," and parks -- of which he said that they may "reach to those who have the divine spark ever so feebly developed, that it may be strengthened and grow."<p>
One can imagine sitting in the cool, dark interior of Carnegie's Berkshire mansion of a summer afternoon and hearing the great man expatiate on the responsibility of the wealthy for the "improvement of the race," a phrase he loved. No doubt one would grow restless, even annoyed, at the vanity in his voice. <p>
Today's billionaires, schooled in a more democratic idiom, would doubtless not make this mistake. But then again, they don't seem to say much at all about the responsibilities of wealth. <p>
"Carnegie would be aghast at these people," says Dwight Burlingame of the Center on Philanthropy. His colleague Robert Payton remarks, "If you're going to be a philanthropist, you need a general sense of what a good society is. Carnegie may have been a sexist and an imperialist, but he had a philosophy. He believed in democratic capitalism, and he acted on it. He was a one-man GI Bill. He enabled people to learn."<p>
Burlingame, Payton, and others make the point that contemporary philanthropy urgently needs somebody to take on the mission that Carnegie assumed for his age: to enunciate a code of responsibility for the very rich.<p>
"We are lagging behind," Payton laments. "You look at the names of people who have the wealth today and you're looking at first-generation wealth. What is happening is just what happened a century ago, new industries producing a disproportionate number of wealthy people. Suddenly somebody has $80 million and they don't know what to do with it. I met such a person just recently. He wanted to do something for kids but hadn't thought beyond a big contribution to the Boy Scouts. I said to him: 'Why don't you make a 100-year commitment to children?' No one is leading the way. Warren Buffett is one of the most intelligent men in business, but he's been a disappointment. He should be writing a gospel of wealth. Perhaps the closest thing we have to a modern-day Carnegie is George Soros."<p>
Soros is best known for the $1 billion profit he made in the space of a few days of currency speculation in 1992, betting correctly on the collapse of the British pound. It was a crisis that, in the view of many, he helped precipitate. Since then he has been a highly visible international benefactor, perhaps in contrition, though, in fairness, he had begun a program of philanthropy a dozen years earlier, having reached the conclusion that he needed only about $25 million to meet his personal needs.<p>
Soros thinks in large terms. His concerns are international, particularly the re-emerging nations of Eastern Europe, where he has spent hundreds of millions of dollars. He has established separate foundations in 25 countries.<p>
Soros also has a certain taste for disorder. Aryeh Neier, president of the Soros foundations, claims that during his first year on the job not a day went by without someone's referring to a major foundation initiative he had never heard of before: "Only George knew everything." For his part, Soros likes to talk of his willingness to trust his associates and once commented that the foundation projects that produced the greatest satisfaction were "from activities I knew nothing about, that I ran across accidentally." So a certain creative chaos seems to rule. Neier remarks dryly, "We run the largest foundation in the country with a living donor. There are advantages and disadvantages." <p>
The most interesting part of Soros's rsum, to me, is not his dramatic moments in trading or giving but the gap -- the three years in the early 1960s during which he all but abandoned his career in finance to pursue his interest in philosophy, particularly the theories of Karl Popper. It is Popper's concept of the "open society" as an ultimate political good that now animates Soros's philanthropy.<p>
Reading Soros the philosopher is an experience complicated, I think, by one's knowledge of Soros the billionaire. During his youthful sabbatical, he acquired a great taste for theories of indeterminacy, which led to the central concept of his life, something he calls "the theory of reflexivity." The theory, he writes in Soros on Soros, "has to do with the role of the thinking participant, and the relationship between his thinking and the events in which he participates....The two roles interfere with each other." To my ear, his vision veers between the obvious ("We always act on the basis of imperfect understanding") and the inscrutable: "Recognizing the human condition does not quite qualify as knowledge -- it would be self-contradictory if it did -- but it provides a set of beliefs that is more appropriate to the human condition than any other." But, as I say, this would all seem more comprehensible from Jacques Derrida than from someone who has turned his wisdom into a billion dollars. <p>
Soros wins the heart of the philanthropic community not because of his vision but because of the sheer scope of his bountifulness and his personal engagement in the charitable enterprise. He has not become a spokesman for philanthropy and does not try to urge others to give. He claims to have considerable skepticism about the very concept of philanthropy, saying that it tends to corrupt both the benefactor and the recipient. But he is a powerful exemplar. <p>
It is hard to divine the inner effect of Soros's extraordinary giving, but based on his own testimony, his new life of good works doesn't seem to have brought him much surcease. Maybe it was not meant to. In his book, he reflects on one of his ventures in the then collapsing Soviet Union: "I have talked about my messianic fantasies; I am not ashamed of them; the world would be a grim place without such fantasies. But they are fantasies. And to be godlike is to be removed from humanity. The great benefit of the foundation to me personally was that it brought me in touch with humanity. But the explosive growth of the foundation and the sheer size of the operation brought with it the danger that I would become estranged from humanity once again. I became an awesome figure....<p>
"On one hand, I find it gratifying, but on the other, the sheer magnitude of my activities, both in business and in philanthropy, makes me uneasy. I must admit that I...probably could not feel all of a piece if I weren't larger than life."<p>
I met Cynthia Mc-Lachlan at the annual meeting of the Council on Foundations, in Atlanta, which is really more like a convention for philanthropists and their bureaucratic counterparts. The air was heavy with lingo, with "devolution" and "site visits" and "ends testing" and so on. <p>
McLachlan, a beautiful, high-spirited woman in her 50s, was at this convention but not quite of it. "I'm new at this," she said, "and I'm aglow."<p>
With the cooperation of her grown children, she had recently finished setting up Girl's Best Friend Foundation, devoted to the well-being of teenage girls in Illinois. The money, several million dollars, came from the estate of her late husband, Donald, a lawyer in Chicago who was instrumental in the formation of the Wisconsin Central railroad and became its chairman.<p>
She spoke affectionately and unsentimentally about her husband. "He taught us that you don't quit something just because you lose interest in it. You finish. I see this in my kids all the time." At the same time she disagreed with him politically, noting that he had become more conservative as he grew more prosperous. "Just before he died, he looked at us with a wry smile and said, 'You mean I'm going to leave all this money to you five pinkos?' And we said, 'That's ri-ight.'"<p>
The money came without restrictions, and it proved at first a source of trouble. "Suddenly we just had this pot of beans, and it's very off-putting to people who don't have it. I was constantly being hit up for money. I was asked to fund a bowling alley, a garage, a mussel farm. I was invited to join this board and that. I assiduously stay off boards -- it's insulting to be asked if you aren't particularly qualified. But now I just say, 'If it's not about girls in Illinois, sorry.'"<p>
Why girls? Though never materially deprived, McLachlan felt drawn to the plight of girls in the worst of circumstances. "Don't get me wrong. I love men. Men have been the most important thing in my life. I went to college for one reason. Because I realized that if you didn't you couldn't get your picture on the bridal page of The New York Times. But it took me 50 years to learn how to stand up to a man. I know lots of women, married to rich men, who cannot say, 'I want $10,000 to spend as I see fit.'"<p>
Rightly or wrongly, one hears in this self-characterization the rationale for a foundation devoted to the needs of impoverished teenage mothers, a kinship with kids whose lives in no evident way resemble hers. McLachlan met with her children and said she wanted to start a foundation. They readily agreed -- "They're real hair-shirt types anyway" -- and took an active hand in the planning. "It was six weeks from mission statement to our first grant. It felt so good to do this. It was a relief to my conscience. It's such a high!"<p>
It has become a generally accepted truth in our time that in order to accomplish much, even to have a successful "relationship," you have to learn to love yourself. When we forget this, we're quite willing to pay a psychotherapist to remind us. Odd that for most of human history self-love was not felt to be much of a problem.<p>
I was struck by this recently while reading a little book about giving, in this case about giving something even more basic than money: blood. The book is The Gift Relationship, by a Briton named Richard M. Titmuss, and it contains a sentence that stands our popular psychology on its head (the author is speaking of voluntary blood donors): "To 'love' themselves they recognized the need to 'love' strangers."<p>
These words were still in the back of my mind a few weeks later as I listened to Paul Schervish, a Boston College sociologist. Schervish, whom I visited in his office, is something of a contrarian among sociologists. For one thing, he studies a segment of society that tends to bore his fellows: the top of it. When he interviews wealthy subjects, he listens for what he terms their moral biography, the story they tell themselves and others to balance the books of their lives. <p>
I asked Schervish if there was a characteristic thing he heard in his interviews, and he provided a useful term for a familiar phenomenon: He said that the inner life of the very rich almost always partook of a "dialectic of fortune and virtue." That is, they spend a great deal of intellectual energy justifying their success in the world in moral terms. In these stories, philanthropy becomes a familiar denouement.<p>
Thinking of a "dialectic of fortune and virtue" does organize the stories one hears from the philanthropic rich. For entrepreneurs, virtue permeates the plot: Enterprise and invention are rewarded by success. Life is fair -- that's the moral of the story. But few can reach maturity believing that proposition entirely, and yet few want to attribute their own success to dumb luck. Thus, one hears from philanthropic entrepreneurs the phrase that seems so pat but has, for them, a sense of resolution as well as seemliness: "I want to give something back."<p>
For inheritors, the story takes a rather different and in many ways more challenging turn. Their reward arrives at birth, and for some, their lifelong effort is to understand why. The story can include an inheritance of virtue as well -- a tradition of family good deeds or a simple sense of genetic worth. But even inherited virtue must be enacted. Here philanthropy often plays a bigger role, and it can become the theme of a life. From inheritors, one hears the other stock explanation of their motives: "I want to make a difference."<p>
This phrase, too, can become tiresome, but when I mentioned it to Schervish, he helped me to hear it afresh. <p>
"Perhaps the dominant characteristic of the very rich," he said, "is a quality I call 'hyper-agency.' If the well-off want to take a vacation, they find the right place and go there. But if the very rich find the right vacation place, they can buy it. When they say they 'want to make a difference,' they mean that they want to operate in philanthropy the way they operate in the rest of the world."<p>
And of course they can -- and do. Although making a difference isn't a foregone conclusion, it does happen, and it is a not inconsiderable pleasure to see part of the world change for the better as a result of your beneficence. But it may not be enough, just as making a billion dollars may not be enough.<p>
Chat for any time with Schervish and you realize that, though one doesn't generally think of sociology as a spiritual enterprise, it is for him. I asked how he defined our subject, mentioning the commonly received definition of philanthropy: voluntary action for the public good. <p>
"Well, that really doesn't do it, does it?" he said. "All sorts of activities -- in business, in politics -- could be defined that way, and yet we wouldn't call them philanthropy."<p>
Philanthropy, he pointed out, stands outside of any market, whether organized around money or votes or power. "It is a social relationship. The difference between philanthropy and other actions is that philanthropy happens in response to affective rather than effective claims. It is the nature of such claims that they have no real standing. They can be ignored without consequence -- except for spiritual consequence."<p>
Schervish is dismissive of the rhetoric of meliorism that has dominated American philanthropic tradition -- present from Cotton Mather onward and triumphant in the Carnegie doctrine "Improve the race!" We hear a version of this language constantly today -- notably in the national conversation about welfare reform. We hear it in the "ancient Chinese proverb" that so many people like to repeat: "Give a man a fish and he eats for a day. Teach a man to fish and he eats for a lifetime."<p>
Said Schervish, "Sometimes what people need is a fish. Who," he asked abruptly, "is the spiritual leader of the world?"<p>
"Mother Teresa," I said without thinking, though really I know very little about Mother Teresa.<p>
"I think that's right," he said. "It's surely not the pope! And what does she do? She changes bandages. Sometimes that's what people need."<p>
It may be that the somewhat discredited word "charity" needs a new life. Caritas, its Latin root, blending love and care, at any rate stands at the center of Schervish's concept of philanthropy: "You have to love the needer, not the need. If all you care about is providing food or medicine or money, you're not there." It rests on a biblical sense of the identity of self-love and love for others. Schervish pointed out that philanthropic acts are always suspected of self-interest -- a tax break, a name carved in the building, etc. But it is foolish to try to escape self-interest; it is necessary only to recognize that the ultimate self-interest is interest in others.<p>
The need for that recognition is universal, but are we romantic to think that perhaps the need is even more acute among the very privileged? I have found myself thinking this way lately, thinking that the ultimate use of philanthropy -- beyond the improvement of the race, beyond the alleviation of social woes and the strengthening of class bonds -- may be the solace it offers the philanthropist. I discovered a passage in an essay by Paul Schervish in which he seemed to have reached the same conclusion: "The greatest incentive to develop a moral identity of care may be the profound needs of the wealthy."

						I HEAR AMERICA EARNING<p>
"The Richest Towns in America" (July/August), by Jeff Blyskal, must have been quite an undertaking, with so many wealthy enclaves tucked away and often relatively little solid information to go on. I love to see such reports, as they give evidence to trends in wealth creation, migration, and disintegration.<p>
As a Chicago resident, I'm surprised that many North Shore communities rank ahead of Lake Forest, a time-honored benchmark of wealth for the Midwest. Perhaps my greatest surprise is that of the very low ranking -- in my opinion -- of Tuxedo Park, New York, at No. 55. In relative terms, Tuxedo Park makes Atherton, California, look like a cheap, nouveau-riche enclave of superficial notables. Tuxedo Park, where the gentlemen's garment gained its name, was and still is the embodiment of civilized wealth in America. It is a pity that statistics fail to quantify the true sense of wealth that Tuxedo Park has -- and has always had. 
Peter Hayes Millen
Chicago, Illinois<p>
"The Richest Towns in America" suggests a correlation between cost of living and desirability: "The higher costs in New York suggest the area is more desirable than Kentucky or Arizona and simply worth the price." As an economist and nonNew Yorker, I can tell you that is not always the case. Perhaps Kentuckians, Arizonans, and others pay less for housing because they earn less -- because they are willing to forfeit higher wages for a perceived higher quality of life elsewhere. Costs, including housing, are a reflection of what the market will bear. How much people can and will pay depends on income. Some studies that explore quality-of-life issues suggest that people are paid a premium to live and work in undesirable places, not the other way around.
Richard M. Stein
Westville, New Jersey<p>
I purchased your July/August issue solely for the cover story about America's richest towns and neighborhoods. What could have been a fascinating article became nearly meaningless, however, because of the lack of maps accompanying the tables. I work for a mapping company and consider myself knowledgeable about this country's major cities and suburbs. But how many people outside of the immediate area have heard of Hewlett Bay Park, Muttontown, or Centre Island, New York? 
Scott Bornkessel
Houston, Texas <p>
"The Richest Towns in America" would more accurately be titled "The Richest Enclaves in America." You'd be stretching the definition of "town" to include Russell Gardens, Flower Hill, Munsey Park, and Oyster Bay Cove, to mention just a few Long Island localities. Each qualifies as a small residential municipality, but each is more accurately part of a larger town. Beyond the adjacent area, these names would not be readily recognized as separate entities even by many longtime Long Island residents.
Una L. Mahar
Vienna, Virginia<p>
HOME SWEET ATHERTON
Just a note to clarify "Atherton's Little Acres" (July/August), from an Atherton resident's perspective. It is only very recently that Atherton has become a high-profile, high-wealth town. It began as, and to some degree remains, a quiet suburb of San Francisco. There is still, thank heavens, a relatively balanced mix of people, including those who paid considerably less than $1 million for their Atherton acres (in some cases as little as $7,000).
Mary Perkins
Atherton, California<p>
WHO YOU CALLING FOGIES?
Will somebody please tell Susan Lee ("Young Fogies," July/August) that Worth is a magazine targeted at the small investor! A writer is supposed to address her audience, not smugly tell us that we are incompetent to buy stocks, as well as bonds ("Bonds Away!" May). For whose benefit is Lee dispensing financial advice, her pals in the mutual-fund companies?
Robin J. Arzt
New york, New york<p>
I certainly hope Susan Lee was writing with tongue firmly in cheek. I am an amateur investor -- and have been for 25 years -- who maintains a portfolio of 15 to 25 stocks. I like being in control of how I invest my money. To me, mutual funds are for those individuals who do not, or will not, take the time to do their own money management.
Tom Reincke
Fort Wayne, Indiana<p>
JACKIE'S BOOKSHELVES
Having also attended the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis auction preview at Sotheby's, and having perused in greatest detail the auction catalog, I was amused by much of Robert Plunket's article "Jackie's Last Word" (July/August). However, I found Plunket's supercilious comment that Mrs. Onassis's library was not that of "an inquiring mind" to be offensive. The lady's personal library contained hundreds of volumes, covering a wide spectrum of specialized interests, such as architecture, art, theater, French literature, world and American history, ballet, philosophy, and biography. Perhaps Mr. Plunket has not previously been privy to the reading material of an inquiring mind with such cultural refinement.

						For personal-services firms, your chores are their business<p>
By Anne Field<p>
The most sought-after commodity these days isn't gold or pork bellies: It's time. Indeed, the average American's work year has increased by 163 hours over the past two decades, or the equivalent of one month, says Juliet Schor, author of the modern exhaustion classic The Overworked American. And the pace never lets up.<p>
That's where personal-services people come in. For $15 to $150 an hour and up, they take care of those time-consuming, irritating chores: registering the car, walking the dog, waiting for the cable guy. All the stuff Mom used to do -- only now she's out of the house, in the office, churning out buy-sell orders. "Everyone needs a wife," says Molly Hanford, who runs More Than Just Errands, a personal-services firm in Philadelphia. Here are some of the services these folks provide:<p>
Handling mundane essentials. For $20 to $60 an hour, firms like More Than Just Errands, Work! in San Francisco, and TimeSavers in nearby Mill Valley will do just about anything that's legal. Jessica Van Lieschout, an interior designer who divides her time between Aspen, Colorado, and Marin County, California, uses TimeSavers two to three times a week to drop off dry cleaning, mail packages at the post office, walk the dog, do xeroxing, make raspberry jam for fund-raisers -- whatever she needs. Another client paid TimeSavers co-owner Kim Carbone $150 to shop for and buy an anniversary present for his wife. Carbone bought a $4,000 pair of diamond studs -- and the wife was none the wiser.<p>
Dealing with red tape. Renewing a car registration and getting a passport are the banes of a time-deprived person's existence. When Geoff Lewis, a magazine editor in New York, let his car registration expire, he ignored the problem as long as he could. But a half day before his vacation, he knew he couldn't put it off any longer. So he paid It's Easy in New York $20 to do the job for him. If he'd needed to pay a moving-violation fine, It's Easy could have taken care of that, too. In Washington, D.C., Travel Document Systems helps people obtain passports and visas for $40, or $60 for a rush job.<p>
ber-cleaning. Rent-a-Mom in Reston, Virginia, doesn't just clean. For a minimum of $60, its "moms" will also organize drawers and closets. TimeSavers will reorganize an entire house, setting up filing and bill-payment systems, cleaning out closets, and coming in regularly to maintain the setup.<p>
Buying your wardrobe. For a $255 annual fee, Susan Dresner of Successful Ways & Means in New York will take inventory of a client's closet, then choose stores that sell garb most suited to that person's body and lifestyle. For an extra $95 an hour, she'll do a pre-shop, carefully selecting an array of attire for the customer to choose from when he or she gets to the store.<p>
Moving. Some firms take care of the entire awful job for you -- working with architects and contractors to help prepare your new home, then packing and unpacking your stuff and supervising the move. For the ultimate in pampering, the Intrepid New Yorker in New York will find you the right neighborhood, house, schools, and nanny, as well as chimney sweeps and brass polishers, then oversee the whole project from beginning to end. Cost: $2,000 and up.<p>
Because hiring strangers to take care of intimate details can be unnerving,  you want to make sure to use a place that's on the up-and-up. Always ask for references. As important is longevity: Chances are, a long-lived firm has been around partly because it's reputable. Also find out if the company is insured, and ask to sign a contract. The toughest part of the whole deal is finding a firm in your area. If you call a place that doesn't do quite what you need, ask for suggestions. Most companies will be glad to help: Personal service, after all, is what they're all about.<p>

A myriad of ways to see the leaves before they leave<p>By Rudy Maxa<p>In the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, the hills are about to be alive with dead leaves. Which means prime touring season for fall-foliage lovers. But how do you know where to go? When are the colors at their most spectacular?<p>In the last couple of years, some state tourism offices have begun offering toll-free phone numbers with recordings that detail autumn's progress. North Carolina visitors can receive updated color reports by calling 800-VISIT-NC; Massachusetts has a toll-free number for foliage updates in the Northeast (800-632-8038). If you really want to get particular, call the forest office in any state for on-site reports.<p>There are even more sources of information on -- you guessed it -- the World Wide Web. Not just leaf updates, but entire driving itineraries with precise directions as well as listings of sights, B and B's, and eateries along the way.<p>"Stop at Kilgore's General Store (Main Street; 802-326-4681), which makes its own breads and soups," advises a Web site called the All-Time Best Foliage Tour of Northwestern Vermont (http://www.newengland.com/itins/itin.vt.bestfoliage.html). The write-up even notes that service can be slow at Kilgore's, located in the town of Montgomery Center, but there's always J.R.'s, also on Main Street, known for its "standout sandwich of fried eggplant with garlic mayonnaise." For what the site calls "the last word in foliage panoramas," ride the Jay Peak aerial tramway just down Route 242 a piece. Or you can choose Route 58 and go through Hazen's Notch; Route 58 is a gravel road "through deep woods ablaze with the yellow foliage of birches."<p>Now that's detailed information. For basic driving tours of New England, check out the Web site at http://newengland.com. For some leaf gazing along the Mohawk Trail (Massachusetts Highway 2), click into http://www.freeways.com/fun/greatdrives/mohawk.html -- a site that claims the drive from Orange to Williamstown, Massachusetts, is one of the country's more scenic stretches of roadway in the fall. North Carolina updates its Web site (http://www.commerce.state.nc. us/commerceress/fall2.html) with precise information, such as last year's notation: "Sandhills Community College in Pinehurst reports that the dogwoods and Bradford pears are beginning to turn reddish-brown."<p>Late September and early October are prime viewing times in the Northeast. Prime time slips further into October, of course, the farther south you go. It's best to avoid weekends, when most sight-seeing takes place; on roads such as the Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina and Virginia, traffic can be bumper-to-bumper.<p>Want to avoid the crowded roads? Take to the sea. Several cruise lines offer fall-foliage tours, most of which begin in New York in September and make stops along the New England coast, then turn around in Canada. This year, for example, Holland America Line's Veendam offers five cruises, at a starting price of about $2,500 per person. But all five jaunts were sold out by early summer; the cruise line is accepting bookings for next fall (800-426-0327).<p>Regal Cruise Line's Regal Empress (800-270-7245) offers a single, 12-day foliage cruise out of New York; prices begin at $1,300 for an inside cabin ($1,800 for an outside cabin). The September 29 sailing was nearly sold out by early summer, so plan ahead for next year. Princess Cruises' Royal Princess (800-421-0522) has scheduled four ten-day East Coast foliage tours, but all are already sold out. The moral: If you want to admire the leaves from a deck chair, book early for future falls.<p>Land, water...that leaves the air. At some rural airports, pilots offer flight-seeing foliage tours -- just keep an eye peeled for signs advertising flights. It's probably the most breathtaking way to see the carpet of reds, golds, browns, and yellows that blankets the East Coast. And, as with cruises, you leave the driving to someone else.<p><p><p>

						A poster can be an investment of historic proportions<p>By Anne Field<p>It's a safe bet that when James Montgomery Flagg designed his poster "Wake Up, America!" in 1917, he wasn't thinking of creating an investing opportunity. The immediate goal of his work, printed at the behest of the Mayor's Council of New York City, was to warn Americans about the perils of staying neutral in World War I. And this would be no one-of-a-kind work of art; the posters were put up all over the city. Today, a copy of "Wake Up, America!" costs as much as $7,000. <p>Other propaganda posters provide a similarly dramatic window into 
history, at more affordable prices. Russian posters from the early Soviet era start as low as $200 and run up to $40,000 or, occasionally, more. World War I and II posters rarely cost more than $7,000 and often go for as little as $150 to $300. And experts feel these prices have plenty of room to grow.<p>What makes one work more valuable than another? Many of these posters' creators were well-known painters and illustrators, ranging from Gibson Girls originator Charles Dana Gibson, who headed the quaintly titled U.S. Division of Pictorial Publicity during World War I, to Russian graphic artist El Lissitzky. But the lack of a designer name doesn't mean lack of value: A poster for Oktober, a 1927 movie marking the tenth anniversary of the Russian Revolution, was recently offered for $22,000, despite the anonymity of its creator.<p>That's because other factors are important as well, not the least being the condition of the piece. Since posters weren't meant to have a long life, they tend to age poorly and so are usually graded to indicate what kind of shape they're in. Generally, you'll see either 
a letter, from A+ on down to D, or specific words, from mint to poor. (World War I items often get top marks because many people at the time, expecting the war to be the one to end all wars, tried to preserve their posters by keeping them under their beds.) Another ingredient that lifts prices is scarcity. Finally, works produced through the older technique of lithography tend to be more valuable than newer, photo-offset posters. With lithography, the artwork is drawn with a grease pencil directly on a sheet of limestone, then inked and pressed on paper, producing colors that are especially luminous.<p>Bolshevik Bravura. While the common image of Soviet propaganda is a larger-than-life Lenin staring ahead with a piercing gaze, those posters are typical of a later era. More fascinating artwork was produced in an earlier period -- 1917 to 1937, when artists were allowed to engage in a startling amount of experimentation. That innovation continued until the late 1930s, when Joseph Stalin clamped down on anything smacking of the avant-garde and mandated social realism as the only suitable style for all official propaganda.
Some major names participated in Soviet poster art, and their work tends to be the most desirable. Works by El Lissitzky, which have gone for as much as $100,000, are the top of the market for now. A 1930 poster by photomontage artist Gustav Klutsis recently sold for $36,000; even one of his postcards carries a price tag of $1,000 or so. Then there are the "ROSTA windows" -- hand-stenciled sections of daily bulletins posted in shop windows by the Russian Telegraph Agency during and just after the 191820 civil war. You can't get one window for less than $2,000, and they usually come in sets 
of at least four. A group of six by Malyutin recently sold for $11,000. <p>But many posters are much cheaper; anonymous pieces from the Russian civil war might cost $200 to $500. Though they often depict scenes of violence -- they were meant to mobilize the country against invaders and so-called White Russians, who fought the Bolsheviks in the revolution -- they can be almost hypnotic in their urgency and drama. These posters just started to reach the West under perestroika. Since then, museums have been snapping them up like crazy, and no one knows when the next crop of goodies will be unearthed. As a result, prices have doubled or even tripled over the past five years. "The supply is here now, so now is the time to buy," says collector and dealer Jim Lapides, owner of the International Poster Gallery in Boston.<p>Military Manipulation. Posters of World Wars I and II are considerably less rare -- and easier to collect. Every major fighting power issued its own propaganda, urging men to enlist and citizens to buy war bonds, conserve their resources, and keep their mouths shut. The rarest U.S. pieces are recruiting posters, many of which were designed by well-known artists. Much more common are those that hawk bonds: They were printed in huge quantities and posted everywhere, from banks to stores and post oces. <p>The costlier World War posters tend to be the work of high-caliber artists and illustrators like Flagg, who used his own face as Uncle Sam's in his famous "I Want You" recruiting poster. German works are more expensive; Nazi posters are practically nonexistent, since most were destroyed in bombing raids or by German citizens fearing the ire of Allied occupiers. German World War I posters are almost as scarce but of a particularly high artistic quality. Hans Rudi Erdt's rare "The U-Boats Are Out" sells for around $10,000; posters by German master Ludwig Hohlwein can go as high as $15,000.<p>Lots of World War posters are dirt cheap, however, and many cost less than $1,000. Norman Rockwell's ubiquitous "Four Freedoms" posters cost about $200 apiece. Anti-espionage posters (for example, Cecil Beall's picture of two workers sharing secrets at a bar while an image of Hitler eavesdrops in the background) go for $250 to $300. And the investment outlook for posters in this group is positive. "In 20 years it will be the 100th anniversary of World War I; there was a spike in prices for World War II posters during the 50th-anniversary celebrations," says Tony Fusco, president of Fusco & Four, a Boston marketing consultant specializing in art. "If you want to put away something for retirement, put away your World War posters."<p>Propaganda Pitfalls. The biggest trap for the beginner is the little matter of spotting a fake. Of course, you want something from the original poster run, not a reproduction, which is hard to discern with photo-offset stuff. But a reputable dealer knows the telltale signs. The type of paper or ink, the shades of colors, even the size of the paper can send off warning signals. As with any collectible, you have to read up on the subject. Attend some shows; the International Poster Show appears every year in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. Informative books on the subject include The Bolshevik Poster (Yale University Press) and Persuasive Images: Posters of War and Revolution From the Hoover Archives (Princeton University Press). Fusco also suggests you go to at least five auctions before attempting any real bidding. "Auctions don't guarantee the authenticity of their goods," he says. So be sure of your eye before you plunk your money down. <p>Finally, more than many collectibles, posters require a big commitment -- and a very personal one. An image of a Russian peasant, blood dripping from his hands as he fights his enemy, may not be the first thing you want to see when you wake up in the morning. <p><p><p>

						Inside an oven mitt the hand of genius sweats<p>The rich may be different from the rest of us, but they don't 
necessarily stand out in a crowd. In fact, since there are more than two million millionaires in this country, it's a sure bet most of 
them are anonymous to most of us -- the man shaking sand out of his towel at the beach, the woman in front of you at the ATM. The same might be said for the objects in our lives: Products, tools, and ingredients surround us unnoticed, yet a lot of them have made someone a lot of money. Take the humble kitchen. Fortunes have been made there by men and women who came up with good ideas and followed through. Now they're basking in the sun, if not in the glow of fame.<p>
BEADED ANTIQUE FLATWARE 
Towle Silversmiths<p>With 41 percent of the flatware market in his grasp, LENNY FLORENCE is the silverware king, and he ascended that throne in classic rags-to-riches fashion. As a child, he says, "I knew what I was going to wear one year because my brothers wore it the last." His first break came in high school, while he was working at a jewelry store. A customer was so impressed with Florence that he paid for his education. After graduation, the man promised Florence 50 percent of Raimond Silver if he could lead it out of debt; Florence did, making more than $1 million for himself. He then built a company that copied the designs of expensive silverware and merged it with Towle Manufacturing. Florence says he has met six of the last seven U.S. presidents, been honored by the Vatican, and built 
a home for retarded children in Israel.<p>
ENAMEL-ON-STEEL COOKWARE
Chantal Cookware<p>Martha Stewart with a German accent. That's HEIDA THURLOW -- mechanical engineer from Dsseldorf, former devoted homemaker, now businesswoman with more than $10 million in annual sales. Thurlow's parents wanted her to take over the family's steel-
furnace-linings business, but she moved to Houston in 1969 and married a steel-importing compatriot instead. To make him happy she took up cooking, but when she couldn't find the right cookware -- "There were no fun colors, no lids I could see through," she says -- Thurlow designed and produced her own enamel pots and pans. Now divorced, she skis in Park City, Utah, where she has a second home, and dives in the Cayman Islands.<p>
ZAK ZANY ZOO ANIMAL OVEN MITTS 
Zak Designs<p>IRV ZAKHEIM was in his 20s when he gave up his dream of playing professional baseball, but he quickly found the hot hand in another field: sales. First he sold life insurance and puka-shell necklaces in Hawaii; next came embroidered pot holders. His winning pitch, however, was Zak Zany Zoo Animal Oven Mitts. More than ten million have been sold in the last dozen years, grabbing 75 percent of the specialty oven-mitt market and netting him a rambling old Victorian home in Spokane and a vacation home on Deer Lake in northeastern Washington. While the oven mitts are still hot, Zakheim's main business these days is licensed children's dinnerware. Think Toy Story plates.<p>
GOOD GRIPS UTENSILS 
Oxo International<p>SAM FARBER, who already had a modest fortune from his own kitchen-supply company, was enjoying splitting his retirement between southern France and the Berkshires in western Massachusetts when another business idea took hold. Moved by his wife's arthritic struggles with kitchen gadgets, he wondered why there were no easy-to-use tools. He came up with a line of utensils called Good Grips, which were an instant success. He sold this company, Oxo International, less than three years after starting it for $6.25 million. Though still involved in day-to-day affairs at Oxo, Farber swears that he's retired now. He dedicates his time to the Outsider art -- created by untrained and often institutionalized men and women -- that he collects, writes about, and promotes.<p>
EXCALIBUR NONSTICK COATING
Whitford<p>Maybe Wharton graduate DAVE WILLIS had no choice but to go into business for himself. Says Willis, "My father, who has his own oil business, always used to say to me, 'When you start your own business...' I was never sure, but when I got fired from my first job, it was the obvious next step." He and a friend started a 
chemical company; when they sold it a few years later, Willis received $792,000 and ownership of a dry, talcum-like lubricant, polytetrafluoroethylene. "I wasn't poor," says Willis, who was then 34, "but I had four kids. I had to work." Willis and his partner created Whitford and produced nonstick coatings. Kitchen uses now account for 60 percent of Whitford's business; its materials are incorporated into such cookware lines as All-Clad, Cuisinart, and Chantal (yes, Willis knows Heida Thurlow -- in fact, he knows her number by heart). <p>
VIKING MODEL VDSC 305 SS
Viking Range<p>FRED CARL was once what he calls a "fifth-generation builder." Among other things, he customized kitchens in the homes of the wealthy. Then, in the mid-1980s, when he was renovating his own kitchen, he designed the Viking Range. Although Carl does well by 
continuing to target the wealthy -- purchases by such folks as Tom Cruise, T. Boone Pickens Jr., and Martha Stewart, among others, help him top $20 million in annual sales -- his comfortable life hasn't changed much. "I hang around the house, play a little golf, read, draw, sketch," says Carl, who has spent his entire life on the same block in Greenwood, Mississippi. What has changed is Carl's stock portfolio: 
"I feel very good about my son's long-term future," he says.<p>
BUTTERFLY BOWL 
Namb Mills<p>The folks at Namb Mills want you to believe that PAULINE CABLE got the recipe for the secret Namb alloy from a Los Alamos physicist working on the Manhattan Project. Cable denies it: "There's no truth in it at all whatsoever." Her ex-husband did work at Los Alamos, but as an accountant. The Cables had been newspaper 
reporters in Dayton, Ohio, before moving to Santa Fe in 1941. In 1953, she took over a small sand-casting foundry in Namb, New Mexico, where she concentrated on making bowls from the Namb alloy, which conducts both heat and cold especially well. The first year, Cable had $2,500 in sales; she reached close to $1 million in annual sales by 1982, when she sold the company to the Hillenbrand family of Indiana. She has since retired to Tucson.<p>
GINSU KNIVES
Ginsu Consumer Products<p>"We amazed all of America with the Ginsu knife," says BARRY 
BECHER, who with his partner, ED VALENTI, helped revolutionize gizmo marketing -- with an already existing product, no less (the knives came wholesale from Quikut, an Ohio cutler). Lore has it that the knife got its name from the combined names of the partners' wives. Valenti dismisses the myth: Neither he nor Becher has been married to a Ginny or a Sue. "We wanted something Asian and exotic," says Valenti. "In English, Ginsu means never having to work another day in your life." In other words, that's what selling first a million knives at $9.99 apiece and then over two million at $19.99 means. Though Valenti and Becher sold their company in 1984, the knife hasn't lost its edge. Ginsu Consumer Products is now owned by Warren Buffett's <a name="NYSE:BRK.A"></a><b>Berkshire Hathaway</b>.<p>

						How to ensure that your will be done<p>By Alexander Bove Jr.<p>Few legal battles generate more bitterness than a will contest. Children are pitted against parents, brothers against sisters, and for what? Money, that's what. Some claim it's a matter of principle, but the rule is, the larger the estate, the higher the principle.<p>It's hard to make a will that's entirely contest-proof, but that doesn't mean you should worry about losing a contest. A study by the American Bar Association found that more than 99 percent of all will contests are unsuccessful.<p>Nevertheless, many people lose sleep over the possibility that their estates will be contested, and for those people, there are a couple of options. One is a no-contest provision, which penalizes a contesting beneficiary by causing a forfeiture of that person's bequest. But for this approach to be successful, you must give that person something worth losing. "A no-contest clause in your will does not mean that a contest is prohibited," says William Zabel, an estate lawyer in New York City and author of The Rich Die Richer and You Can Too. "It merely means the contestant will lose his share if he attempts to interfere with the probate of the will."<p>Another common strategy is to place your property into a living trust rather than distribute it through a will. You can maintain control of the assets in your living trust as the trustee. On your death, a successor trustee would automatically take over and distribute the assets as you have directed. The advantage of a living trust is that the assets avoid probate and so are not subject to a will contest. And although a disgruntled heir could try to break the trust, the contestant would face considerable legal fees, and the odds of succeeding are even slimmer than the odds of winning a contest.<p>Even without those safeguards, a will contest is an uphill battle for the contestant. For one thing, there are very few people legally able to mount a contest. Common will contestants include a spouse, a child or grandchild, or even more-distant relatives -- but it must be a person who would have a claim on the estate should the will be overturned. Less common but just as viable would be someone mentioned in a previous will but left out of the current one. People are often worried about a divorced spouse contesting a will, but an ex-spouse usually has no standing to make a contest. In addition, prenuptial contracts can contain an agreement that neither spouse will contest the other's will.<p>Should someone decide to contest your will, the most common claims are that the will was not properly signed; that the testator (the person who made the will) was not mentally competent at the time of signing; and/or that the testator was induced to sign the will through fraud or undue influence. A will can be contested only because of how it was completed, not on the basis of what it contains. And any of these problems can be obviated by a properly prepared and signed will.<p>Incompetence, for example, is difficult to prove, and the burden of proof is on the contestant. By themselves, eccentricities are generally not accepted as convincing evidence of incompetence, so leaving your estate to chickens or directing that your body be buried on the moon will not by itself disqualify your will. Fraud might occur when a person is persuaded to sign a document that she thinks is, say, a neighborhood petition, when, in fact, it is a will (it has happened). But if you know what you're signing, fraud, too, is difficult to prove.<p>So if you're concerned that shafting someone is going to incur a contest, don't fear: An heir's anger at how little he or she was left is not good grounds for a contest. When he died around the turn of the century, Harry Preston of Philadelphia left his wife, Anna, the absolute minimum allowable under Pennsylvania law -- a third of his estate. In doing so, Harry described her as a "fiend in human form," an "unnamable beast," and a "she devil," by whom Harry stood "in daily fear of being murdered while asleep." Which might well have happened if Anna had seen what he wrote about her in his will, but the harsh words were not grounds for a contest. Anna took her lumps -- and her third.<p><p>

						Millennium approaches, from Seattle to the South Seas<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>Got plans for a night out three years from now? If not, you had better hurry, because faster than you can say "Alka-Seltzer," folks are making reservations for New Year's Eve 1999. Even the islands of Tonga will be booked -- as soon as someone builds the
hotel. Closer to home, New York's Rainbow Room blocked out 200 of its 1,000 spaces two years ago before it stopped taking reservations. It has a 600-person waiting list, though the $1,000 per head doesn't include bubbly. <p>Over at <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Walt Disney</b></a> World, Mickeyphiles are also shut out: The resort's hotels are already filled, even though no millennial events have been announced and no price has been set. At least the big-name entertainers -- Goofy, Donald, Pluto -- can't back out. You won't be quaffing Moet at the Seattle Space Needle, either. In 1991, a group of 12 families reserved all three of its levels for themselves and friends. <p>Many potentially world-class events still have room, but these tend to be of the pie-in-the-sky variety. Brad Roberts, a former tennis coach now operating a travel company called First Light 2000 in London, has leased a huge parcel of land on New Zealand's Chatham Islands, where he plans to offer millennium packages. "It's the first area to see the sunrise of 2000," says Roberts, who has a letter from London's Royal Greenwich Observatory echoing his claim. As for transportation and the islands' accommodations, he admits, "You've caught us with our trousers down." <p>Indeed. The largest place to stay on Chatham's ten islands has just 12 rooms. "We've had some inquiries about New Year's 1999," says Denise Sutherland, co-owner with her husband, John, of the Chatham Island Lodge. "I guess we have a lot of preparation to do." <p>Over on the islands of Tonga, 1,580 miles north of Chatham, the Eve of 2000 buzz is big. According to Simote Poulivaati, manager of the International Dateline Hotel on the island of Tongatapu, half of his 76 rooms have been booked by First Dawn Celebrations. Operated by Londoner Wayne Morris, First Dawn will fly you from Los Angeles to Tonga, where you'll greet 2000. Then it's off to Western Samoa, on the opposite side of the date line, to catch the millennial sunrise once again. The damage: just $10,000 to sing "Auld Lang Syne" twice during the six-day trip. Morris has room for 450 celebrants, and he hasn't started accepting reservations yet. The motto for this date-line hopper? "Be the first -- and the last."<p>Poulivaati says he's heard talk of "a Mike Tyson boxing event" and "a Billy Graham appearance" as possible crowd magnets. Also, a rumor that an American might build a 300-room, five-star hotel in early 1999 has spread throughout Tongatapu. So far, though, only one event is planned. "Our king will make an address and do something on the Internet," says Poulivaati. "We only hope he's still alive by then. He's in his 70s and weighs nearly 300 pounds." <p>Perhaps the best deal in the South Pacific can be had on the Tongan island of Vava'u, where retired Kentucky oilman Carter Johnson eagerly awaits the right inquiry. "Don't call about booking a room because I won't give you a price," says Johnson, owner of the 47-room Paradise Hotel. "But for $2.3 million, I'll sell you the whole spread. I'll even throw in my four-bedroom residence."<p><p><p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> SOUL OF THE REVOLVER <p>Are you among the millions of financially comfortable people who carry big credit-card balances every month, paying crazy charges and wondering why you don't just cut it out? Steve Szekely, master of plastic, says he sympathizes. And approves.  <p> By Mike Steere  <p> Seven square inches of silvery plastic with the blue-white-and-gold emblem of Visa International -- here is mine own slain albatross. I didn't shoot it. I revolve it.  <p> Month after month I carry a credit-card balance that in almost two years hasn't gone up much or down much. Noisy self-recrimination, oaths to charge no more, to get to zero next month, in six months-- all that I've sworn and suffered has yet to bring down the balance. Becoming a "bad" -- credit-card talk for a defaulter-- isn't even an issue. I could zero the balance today by taking a bite out of cash savings, but I don't.  <p> I revolve for no logical reason.  <p> I revolve because I'm a revolver.  <p> Revolving taints the rest of my personal finances, which are disciplined and sound. It makes me feel ridiculous.  <p> No, it makes me feel sinful.   <p> It makes card issuers feel good. The sin of revolving, repeated in 50-million-plus American households, is the great redeemer for the banks and pseudo-banks that issue credit cards. About two-thirds of the country's 78 million creditworthy households revolve, according to Robert McKinley, president of RAM Research Group, an information clearinghouse that publishes bankcard news and statistics. Last year, bankcard revolvers paid about $56 billion in finance charges, providing 80 percent of issuers' revenues.  <p> Were we all to be born again as transactors -- zeroing our balances every month, paying no finance charges, but getting all the bank card goodies for free -- plastic, as we know it, would cease to exist. When nobody else is listening, credit-card professionals call transactors "deadbeats," because most transactors are unprofitable guests of the system, if they don't actually cost money.  <p> Nobody, however, is worried about a mass conversion to transacting. Indeed, leading issuers have chosen to live or die on finance charges. The current card-marketing free-for-all, which brokeout in 1992, could be called the War of the Revolver. With issuer slocked into no-fee, low-rate offers, there's no one else worth fighting for, because finance charges are virtually the only source of profit.  <p> Revolvers have always been the revenue-producing lords of plastic. In the 1990s, the revolver is God.  <p> In this credit-card cosmology, Steve Szekely is a holy man, a seeker, a guru. A consultant. A longtime industry analyst who is highly regarded for clarity of thought and expression, Szekely (say it zuh-Kelly) recently went independent. Before that, he spent 13 years with Payment Systems Inc., which is based in Tampa, Florida. First, he was PSI's eyes in Washington, gathering financial news in the capital. Then, he moved to Florida and spent eight years doing credit-card research using a national consumer panel. <p> It was his grand and inclusive view of the business that drew me to Szekely. An introductory phone call took in the Crusaders' sacking of Constantinople and Spain's pillaging of the Incas-- both the Crusaders and the Spanish court got in over their heads to bankers, Szekely says. His larger point is that, yes, there's been a lot of loan-related suffering, a lot of evil. But it has involved the huge institutional debts of governments and businesses and people so powerful that they're really governments and businesses. Personal credit -- e.g., Mr. Regular's Pittsburgh Steelers co-branded Visa -- didn't do it. So don't expect Szekely to approach consumer debt as a dark force in the republic.  <p> Szekely is aggrieved by the moralizing tone in most press reports about credit cards. Plastic-bankrupts-nice-folks horror stories-- which are flacked by consumer groups and dutifully featurized by broadcasters and in newspaper lifestyle sections -- get on his nerves. The notion of the victim cardholder, he says, insults consumers, the vast majority of whom don't get into trouble. Current loss rates, pushing 5 percent, are generated by only about 2 percent of cardholders.  <p> Szekely is irked, too, by the gloom and doom that often pervades business reporting. A New York Times headline: a shaky house of plastic with no quick fix in sight. From "Debt Be Not Proud" in The Chicago Tribune's "Your Money" section: "Plastic is the culprit that could wind up hurting the economy."  <p> Card debt has climbed, along with delinquencies and write-offs. Issuers and debtors may well get pinched if there's economic trouble, as they did in the last recession. But Szekely and other debt watchers insist that the numbers don't point toward a looming national crisis. Card-industry profitability slumped a bit in1995, but cards still outperformed the rest of banking by almost two to one. When you consider that issuers did this well while fighting a price war, which brought interest rates to historic lows, the atmosphere of panic seems strange.  <p> "If you don't like something, it's easy to talk about Armageddon, apocalypse," Szekely says. Disapproval, informed by folk morality that stigmatizes personal debt, is the real story behind the stories, which say more or less the same thing: Plastic is apact with the devil, for which we will pay terrible prices. Szekely says that the last time he looked Americans spent about as much on bankcard fees and finance charges as on tobacco. But nobody, so far, has died of revolving.  <p> "Are credit cards evil?" He is asking so he can answer. "To the extent that meeting wishes and needs is evil, to the extent that somebody should not have gratification.... I believe that people should have the discretion to buy what they want to buy when they want to buy it, assuming they can afford it. But my definition of being able to afford has a future component to it!"  <p> Yow, one-man bankcard opera. I fly to Tampa to take a front-row seat.  <p> In a collarless short-sleeved shirt, Szekely gives off a living-in-Florida-and-loving-it glow. He's enviably trim for a guy in his late 40s. Male-pattern hair loss sharpens a downward-pointing wedge of black hair over a face that comes to a Magyar-Italian ethnic edge. The face is a Lugosi update.  <p> We're having an early matinee, poolside at his house, and the topic is basic numbers. Profitable life for an issuer begin sat about $100 per card per year, Szekely says. A bankcard account in active use that generates less revenue is a wash, if not a loss.  <p> Time was, nonperformers paid their way, or most of it, with yearly fees. But on a no-fee account (roughly two-thirds are now no-fee, according to Szekely), revenue comes in but two ways: through interchange -- the issuer's cut of the charges paid by merchants for transaction processing -- and through the finance charges paid on month-to-month balances.  <p> The first (transactor money) averages about 1.25 percent of purchases. The second (revolver money) is annual interest, which averages about 18 percent for bankcards, according to RAM Research-- shockingly higher than the current barrage of low-rate offers. <p> The magic $100 in revenue, says Szekely, comes with about $8,000 to $10,000 transacted per year. The rough threshold for a revolver, though, is just $1,000 carried from month to month. The numbers say that bankcards recapitulate Aesop: Low, slow revolvers beat all but the fastest transactor hares. A few specialized issuers bet on the hare and win, but this is a small niche of the market. American Express, the biggest transactor player, has roughly a tenth as many cards in force as Visa (26.7 million versus 238.9 million; MasterCard has 149.4 million cards in force and Discover 44 million).  <p> Since most cardholders revolve, and since the national average for balances on active accounts is about $2,000, prospering with bank cards looks like a no-brainer. When average is profitable, who needs a consultant?  <p> It's not that simple, says Szekely. Aggregate numbers don't point to the best customers. "All the action," he says, "is at one end."  <p> Szekely cleaves revolvers into low enders and high enders, based on income and financial exposure. Low enders borrow on plastic because circumstances force them to. These revolvers are bad news: Real need scares the hell out of those who extend unsecured credit. Here lurk too many $300 balances paid down in minimum monthly installments from struggling low-income cardholders.  <p> High-end bads are even worse -- just as risky and more expensive. Ah, but the high enders who pay up. "They spend lots of money over an extended period of time and take an even longer time to pay it back," Szekely says. "But they do so dutifully. That's the holy grail."  <p> Szekely's high types borrow on their cards for reasons that don't necessarily make sense. The driving force is gotta, not necessity. Gotta have the Jerry Garcia tie I saw on lunch hour,Windows 95, a custom bicycle instead of a factory-built one. Some are doing reasoned pre-spending against a raise or bonus. Others are temporarily cash pinched but still honoring their gottas. Whatever the stress, it isn't financially life threatening. The best of the best are high earners, the better to shoulder a big balance without feeling it. If the rich are A students, Szekely's highs get Bs. Their income is in the 60th to 90th percentile. <p> Szekely says there are five million to ten million individual account holders in this bright, gold-bearing vein in the U.S. mountain of plastic. They're the only customers worth having. They're why issuers have dropped fees and, more crucially, driven interest rates to historic lows, while burying us in billions of direct-mail solicitations.  <p> After Szekely makes a few broad verbal strokes, I can picture his high enders. Some of them live in my building. I go out to eat with others. Good Lord, I am one of them. They (we) can't possibly be hard to find and target.  <p> Wrong, says Szekely. "They're an elusive animal."  <p> We start another open-air session with bankcard tarot. Mulling the questions of the hour -- Who is this perfect revolver? How do you get him or her on your mailing list? -- Szekely studies Visa, MasterCard, <a name="NYSE:AXP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10085"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Amex</b></a>, and Discover cards, with his and mine on the table. We took them out as an aid to concentration. Looking at my worn and much-revolved Visa, he shows a slice of teeth and chuckles.  <p> Szekely and other card gurus can rattle off the parameters of revolverhood. The young, the recently relocated, those who earnless money than their neighbors, Szekely says. K. Shelly Porges, a Northern California marketing consultant and former marketing executive for both American Express and Bank of America, says that credit-phobic Chinese-Americans are the slimmest ethnic pickings. But other ethnic and minority groups tend to be above-average revolvers. Physicians, notoriously bad at financial management, are an exception to the rule that the affluent don't revolve. John Almash, formerly a senior vice president at MasterCard and now a researcher and consultant in Ossining, New York, would rather meet a revolver than a transactor on a blind dinner date. "Maybe a revolver would be more fun," he says.  <p> This stuff is great entertainment, but Szekely says such indicators fail as targeting vectors. Revolving turns on the "who" rather than the "what," and marketers' data bases can be remarkably blind to "who." Demographics such as zip code, income level, gender, and age do great things for some sellers, but not for card issuers. Demographically speaking, Mr. and Mrs. Revolver look like everybody else.  <p> Issuers have taken to using new kinds of data crunching from credit bureaus. Szekely says that the bureaus, which have long helped creditors stay away from bads, are privy to information-- such as number of bankcard accounts and size of balances --that may open a window on current and past revolving. Using this information and newly devised formulas, bureaus score consumers on probable revenue generation.  <p> The fact that issuers go to the same data wells to try to avoid write-offs and to target revenue producers says something important about revolvers. As Porges puts it, "The difference between a very good customer and a very bad customer is very little." Potential bads and ideal high enders, both big-balance carriers, can be indistinguishable, especially from the stratospheric altitude of mass-card marketers. Rewards and risks are found in the sameplace, and they're hard to separate. In aggressively managed account rolls, like those of plastic's growth leaders, profits and write-offs rise and fall in sync.  <p> There are hints abroad of new, potent statistical models that pull responsible revolvers out of the great gray mass of everybody, while purging Ma and Pa Bad. These techniques process credit history and such factors as magazine subscriptions and auto-brand ownership, using fuzzy logic, neural nets, and other arcane computer tricks. In a wonderfully patronizing don't-try-this-at-home quote to The New York Times, Richard Greenawalt, president of a company called <a name="NASD:ADVNA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12489"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Advanta</b></a>, warned lesser issuers away from his firm's level of techno-wizardry. "Some people will get hurt," he said. "There are thousands of details in what we do that are hard to copy. "Other growth leaders associated with advanced cyber-marketing,such as <a name="NYSE:COF"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42309"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Capital One</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:FUS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15687"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>First USA</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:KRB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12449"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MBNA</b></a>, are silent on the subject, like the navy guarding the whereabouts of nuclear subs.  <p> Identifying the revolver -- the better to mail him or her Visa and MasterCard offers -- is only part of the issuers' problem. At last count, according to RAM Research, there were about 430 million Visa, MasterCard, and Discover cards in force in the U.S., nearly two for every adult and child. As Szekely keeps pointing out, all this prolific plastic is not equal. Only about 300 million cards are actively used. High-balance revolvers have more than their share of cards -- five or more apiece, Szekelysays. Typically, two or more of the accounts get almost all of the profitable month-to-month balances, while others might be paid down every month and still others just sit there. The payload gets switched around, to an ever growing number of alternatives. Cardholders close almost 9 percent of card accounts annually. <p> So even if the data told issuers exactly what a primo revolver looked like, they'd have a hard time knowing where to find one. We have here a shell game played in bad light, fast, with a few hundred million shells, with constant additions and subtractions. The best guesses form the basis of mailing lists, which number in the millions on big, national promotions. Issuers blitzed the country with some 2.7 billion solicitations last year and got a response rate of less than 2 percent, according to Behavioral Analysis, an organization that monitors industry mailings.  <p> Calling this market "mature," as card folk are wont to, is euphemizing."Glutted" or "frantic" is more like it. But, as Szekely says, with the industry's earnings figures singing backup, there's still a lot of money to be made in plastic. The money is in revolvers.<p>  <p>Should I be flattered? Somebody is expending enormous effort, sending out billions of pieces of mail, on the off chance that somebody like me will say yes.   <p> Or furious? The issuers are betting against common sense and resolution, and they're winning.   <p> Szekely makes a great case for revolving as a perfectly reasonable and honorable financial-management choice. Say your joy in life is televised sports, and all that stands between you and heaven, embodied in a 48-inch TV with built-in stereo speakers, is the purchase price. Buy now on plastic, and gratification may well justify the finance charges. Just add the interest to the price and calculate. Is it worth it -- yes or no?  <p> Beautiful, Steve, but this TV buyer of yours is really a cross-dressing transactor. You said your own panel studies imply that revolvers generally don't weigh. They're surprised when they add up what they owe and what it's costing. They say they never meant to let the balances get so high. The whole revolver phenomenon, at the level of the golden high enders, is based on people who can't quite see what they're doing, doing things they neither need nor intend to do.  <p> It's clear now why issuers have a hard time picking revolvers out of the crowd. The bigger mystery is the inability of revolvers to see their own revolving. They -- we -- can't get a fix on the balances, the finance costs, the new charges that keep the balances from ever going down.  <p> Plastic blindness is more than a metaphor. Researchers have found that cardholders consistently and seriously low ball what they borrow and owe on bankcard accounts. Lawrence Ausubel, an economist at the University of Maryland, calls this "the under estimation hypothesis." His analyses show that bankcard holders admit to about $4 out of every $10 they owe on plastic. By contrast, they're 68 percent accurate on auto-loan balances. Somehow, dollars and cents are harder to see when you're looking through plastic. <p> Szekely has serious reservations about Ausubel's methodology, his reasoning, his results. But I'm running with the prof on this one. I am, after all, a revolver, and the Ausubel stuff has me ringing like a big brass gong. It also brings me to the ultimate question: Why do high-end revolvers -- the bank card industry's bottomless pot o' gold -- do it? By definition, they don't have to. They've got enough to purchase what they need, enough extra to save up for the shiny what-the-hecks and wouldn't-it-be-cools that they're now borrowing to buy. The finance charges might be painless, but they're a minus that could be a plus, helping to buy still more goodies. (Last year, mine would have paid for a round-trip to Paris.)  <p> At this point, Szekely and other pros back away. At first, the lack of engagement with the inner revolver seems surprising. But it makes sense. These people are professional trackers, readers of spoor, twigs, turned-over leaves. Understanding the quarry's motives might be helpful, but the signs that lead you to it count for more. Revolving might be psychological, but as Porges says,that doesn't mean psychology is the best way to find revolvers."Why" might not make a dime for the issuers who pay the cardheads. And the experts and their subject matter are at odds. The card pros want to get next to revolvers. Revolvers want to quit revolving. <p> I've never known a revolver who didn't want to, who didn't have a plan to, reach zero, once and for all, by a certain date. Most of them never make it. If they do, they usually don't stay zeroed for long. The impulse doesn't change. Nor does the low-level self-loathing. In my case, money is really the least of revolving's cost. The big one is the feeling.  <p> Ausubel seems to have the best explanation for the revolver's trap, his under estimation hypothesis. If you never know where you are in relation to zero, you'll have a very hard time getting to zero. In his recent paper "The Credit Card Market, Revisited," Ausubel hypothesizes about his hypothesis, speculating that card holders under report for the same reason other people under report arrests for drunken driving and filing for bankruptcy: because they're ashamed.  <p> If the professor is right -- and I'll bet this month's Visa charges he is -- shame itself is the revolver's shameful secret. This might not be why revolving begins, but it's the reason it's so incredibly hard to end. There would probably be a lot less revolving if people weren't ashamed of it. Call something a sin, and people will do it sinfully. "It's like sex," says RAM Research's McKinley, trying to shine a little light into this strange zone of compulsion, guilt, and denial. More like solo sex, in that most people do it but can't stand to picture themselves doing it.  <p> Szekely acknowledges the power of shame in the revolver's dilemma. All his personal-finance advice is about getting card use out of the soul and into broad daylight. Tune out all the neo-Puritan and Poor Richard hooey -- the anti-plastic knee jerk that drives Szekely wild -- and you can make reasoned decisions, item by item, dollar by dollar, about how to use bankcards. Revolving needn't be a bad deal at all if you look at it in advance, do the numbers, and decide to pay the price. But daylight also makes it easier to stop revolving. The shame-free revolver is a transactor waiting to happen.  <p> "Why not?"  <p> The cards are put away. Szekely is asking why I think I shouldn't revolve. Are the finance charges a problem? Is there any doubt I'm good for the amount owed? No and no again.   <p> "So what's wrong?" I'm exercising a choice, he declares, that is all mine to make. "No. Big. Deal."  <p> Szekely looses a word storm on the whole unjust, hypocritical world that would heap shame on me, my kind, and plastic.  <p> Cash on hand, Szekely insists, is an "artificial constraint." We soar from quotidian dollars and cents on the wings of bank cards, which also break the bonds of time. "You're dealing with disposition of assets," he says. "Your cash holdings are an asset. You have another asset -- your future earnings potential. You can leverage that by using credit cards." For as long as he's talking, buying with plastic -- revolving, if I so choose -- is like a healthy celebration of self and the spoils of a common people's revolution. For millennia, bankers have given the royal and wealthy personal credit lines, Szekely says. "Why shouldn't they do it for the consumer?"  <p> "I would never," he says, "claim that credit cards are exclusively responsible for our economic well-being." Then he does something darn close. "Gotta have the spending power!" Szekely crows. Visa, MasterCard, and Discover stuff the consumer economy's horn of plenty. If you want the goods and the wealth, you want the plastic. You want revolvers, too.  <p> Yes! For a wonderful moment, I own Florida itself, or at least the many parts of it where plastic passes for money. It's mine, because I and my kind paid for it.  <p> Glory be. I still owe on the damned Visa card. Maybe I'll die owing. But the shame and sin have been lifted. I'm a revolver, Steve, and I'm okay.  <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> MENDING WALL <p>With age, it's the ageless that grows more real and more beautiful. A writer's encounter with New England's immortal stone walls.  <p> By Nelson Aldrich  <p> "I'll be building walls till the day I die," Barry Patch told me sometime ago.   <p> He leaned down, I remember, over the ruins of the old stonewall he was working on and plucked out a rock that looked like a bear's shoulder blade. On a freestanding drywall such as this,the stones have to fit as tight and smooth as nature or a three-pound hammer (no mortar) can make them. But they also have to slope inward as they go up, about one inch per foot for three or four feet on this particular wall.  <p> Mr. Patch pondered the stone for a moment and set it down in a gap. He turned it this way and that -- no go -- then tossed it into the wall's central core, where it fell, chu-unk, as snug as a chipmunk in its hole.  <p> I asked him how high he could go with a wall like that. "Half way to the stars," he said, "if I could make the base wide enough."A fine New England answer: the romance of the stars; the prudence of going (only) halfway.   <p> "When you buy meat, you buy bones," runs an old New England maxim. "When you buy land, you buy stones." Centuries ago, when the region's farmers began to clear their lands, some believed the devil had seeded the ground with rock -- to test their faith and their backs.   <p> If it was a test of faith, then the Yankees were not found wanting; an 1871 Department of Agriculture survey counted 20,505 miles of stone walls in Connecticut alone -- almost enough to circle the globe. All that hard-won order and beauty made an enduring monument to thrift, hard work, sobriety, and endurance -- the traits we Yankees take as romantic and like to think of as our own.   <p> My romance with walls began last summer, when my wife and I paid a visit to some friends who live down the road from our country place in Connecticut. We went to admire their new swimming pool; I stayed to admire the walls encircling it. I liked the roughness of it -- the sight reminded me of a line from Thoreau: "There is a soberness in a rough aspect [of a wall] which addresses a depth in us."   <p> My depths, however, were to prove anything but sober on the subject.  <p> The stonemason, a big, handsome man named Jim Frazer Jr., was still working around the pool. For the hell of it, I asked him to come along to our place and have a look at a tumble down 300-footwall between the field in front of our house and an uphill stretch of driveway. "Let's see," he said, and strode off to walk the length of it. He returned looking solemn. "Eight thousand dollars,"he said.  <p> I studied the wall as it was, all scattered and for lorn under ropes of poison ivy and wild grape. Then I thought of the wall as it might be -- to visitors, a witness to our tender concern for the New England landscape; to us, gazing out from the house, a stroke of pictorial genius.   <p> In a bold stroke of contractor mind reading, Jim said, "This road, leading up into that lane of sugar maples up there, it reminds me of one of those watercolors my mother loves so much.I tell you what, don't pay me anything down. Pay me as you can, as we go along. I'd really like to do it for you."   <p> "So let's do it," I said. We shook hands, and then, passing under the sugar maples with walls on either side, he said, "You know, I have to warn you. You let me fix up that wall down there, and you're going to want me to fix them all."   <p> He was right. I'm rebuilding walls like a man possessed. There are probably two miles of them on our place, and we've made a good start on just about every one that you can see from the house. Besides the driveway wall, we've built a curved and terraced retaining wall around the patio, and another, simpler retaining wall by the ruins of the barn. There's a free standing wall to keep children from falling into what had been the milking room, now a badminton court, and a circular wall that once supported a silo. Then, too, there's the 50-foot  wall I need as a backdrop for our tea roses and grape arbor.   <p> Why am I doing this?   <p> Douglas Richardson, a stonemason in Salisbury, Connecticut, in the northwest corner of the state, tells me that weekend householder shave created a strong market for walls, new and rebuilt. "It is pure aesthetics," he says.  <p> Aesthetics it is for my wife, too. Stone, for her, is the perfect setting for the drama of her flower gardens. I'm not immune to the looks of the things, either. But I'm a New Englander, and stone walls are New England's archaeology, the stubborn evidence of a time, a place, and a people before now. Again and again, in winter especially, I'll be tooling along some highway, trying to ignore the Heritage malls and Pilgrim motels, when a darkline of stone cutting through the woods catches my eye, reminding me of the place as it was when some God-fearing Yankee heaved the stones out of the soil, laying claim to his New World home.  <p> Archaeology, someone once said, is a sentimental science. If so, perhaps wall building is a sentimental craft. Certainly for Barry Patch, the man whom Jim Frazer hired to build most of our walls, and for Frazer himself, there's a powerful romance in stones. The two grew up together and learned to work with stone by helping local farmers after school. Their favorite pastime, then and now, is to scavenge the countryside for Indian stone artifacts -- arrow heads, axes -- and there is stone in their Swamp Yankee drawl. It's in their movements, too -- watching them "stack stone," you might suppose they were playing a very deliberate game of chess.   <p> Douglas Richardson is another stone romantic. In 1988, he quithis job (and the ulcer that came with it) as a television-network executive to wrest a living from the craft he'd learned during his college years, apprenticed to Italian stone masons in Pennsylvania."There's something elemental about arranging rocks," he told me. "They're the world's first building material, after all. Brick walls and concrete walls -- anybody can build them who can use a level. But stone walls are different, beautiful. I've just finished the foundation of a barn. That's all -- a foundation.But a foundation is everything, isn't it? And breath taking to look at as well."   <p> Most of the derelict walls you see in New England were never as fine and beautiful as the ones Patch and Richardson build. The Yankees who put them up -- to keep livestock in, to divide pasture from cornfield -- weren't sloppy, though. Sometimes they went as far as digging three- or four-foot trenches, so the foundation would lay below the frost line, protected from heaving in spring. But by and large they made do with whatever rocks came to hand. Come March there'd be plenty of time to go out "mending wall," as the title of Robert Frost's poem has it.  <p> Barry Patch, on jobs like mine anyway, uses a good many of the old rocks in the wall he's rebuilding. Some are "trash," which he throws into the core of the wall; others are "building rocks"-- flat on the top or bottom, or squared off in some useful way. There are never enough of these, so he relies on Jim to truck in supplies of smooth-ish, flat capstones he can lay along the top of the wall, the "icing on the cake," as he puts it.   <p> Many wall builders believe the best rock for capping is schist mixed with mica, which splits clean and easy, while others prefer granite. Contractors buy stone from developers and farmers, excavators and big landowners, all of whom are happy to get rid of the stuff. To developers, walls are just old property lines, and farmers today are equally indifferent, with barbed wire to keep the cows in and their metes and bounds on file down at town hall. "Those old Yankees," Barry says, "they're mean bastards. You tell 'em you're looking for building rocks, and they say, Huh, huh. Shoulda been here ten years ago -- before we buried the damn things.Huh, huh!'"   <p> There's also a black market; in 1988, The New York Times reported that in Westchester County, just north of New York City, stones were being stolen from walls, reservoirs, roads, and even cemeteries. A few years ago, someone made off with a 15-foot section of one of our walls, and in the northwest corner of Connecticut, around Sharon and Kent, I've heard that clients are anxious enough about buying stolen rocks that they ask contractors for a bill of sale, to prove ownership of their new walls.  <p> Richardson says the different styles of walls you see in New England can be accounted for by the nature of the local rock, not by the ethnicity of the builders. "Italians own the reputation for building good, tight walls," he says, "but every culture in the world, including the old Yankee, had its own greatness in the craft."  <p> If there's a lot of mica schist in the ground, then you'll find walls that are as tight as a layered cake. If not, you'll find "farmers' walls with class," as Patch describes mine -- rough but not jagged, bonded through and through, and squared off along the top and at the ends. Always, though, the ancient recipe is the same: two stones over one, one stone over two.   <p> Am I being sentimental? Most of us want to know about one another's work. And with stonework, of course, at least for a banker, writer, or some other kind of "symbolic analyst," there's the knowledge that muscle goes into it, and some blood. Patch always stops talking when he picks over a pile of rocks; the work requires concentration and fantastic visual memory. He never wears gloves;he says it spoils his touch. Consequently, the dirt and the stonedust dry out his fingers so badly they look like a mud flat during a drought. "See there," he said one day, holding out a hand,"the cracks run so deep you can see right down to the red meat."He binds the fissures with masking tape.  <p> John Jerome, in his memoir Stone Work, writes that he moved from New York City to rural New Hampshire looking for a "more accurate alignment with the physical world." He found it, inpart, through building a wall. Slowly laying stone upon stone put him in "the present tense more effectively than pushing the button to close elevator doors."   <p> "It's hard to work with stones without working with time," says Christopher Hewat, a former mason, now a sculptor. Of course we all work with time and in it; trouble is, most of us work with what wall builders might call paper time. People do give up paper time for stone: Richardson did. But most of us can't; we can't let the money go, the buoyancy, the mobility, the view! <p> I can't. I've been bobbing along up there on paper time for too long. I remember complaining about this to Barry Patch one afternoon last April. "Don't worry," he joked. "You won't have to hang on much longer." It's true. I am 60, and my wife finds my passion for stone walls distressing. How much, she wonders,will they add to the value of the place? At 60, she feels, my interest in my two-year-old daughter's welfare should put a brake on my lust for mending wall. At my age, hearts don't just "go for it"; they might just go. I should get real, look at the bottom line.   <p> Perhaps so. But when I look at the "real" world of the investor,what I see is the uncertain, contingent, fluctuating market,whose bottom line has none of the virtues of an actual bottom: no stability, no both-feet-on-the-groundness.  <p> "Good fences make good neighbors" is something every New England schoolchild learns -- and also its negation, "Something there is that doesn't love a wall." No market forces hover over Robert Frost's walls; nothing threatens to vaporize their absolute value-- or, with it, the values of the community. There's only the tension between civilization and chaos, solitude and union --between stone walls and whatever it is that wants to tumble them down. Investment values, I tell my wife, are the enemy of all this. I don't want ownership; I want possession. I want reality as in "real property," mine and my family's. I want rootedness, historical connection, defiance of the randomness and brevity that underlies all human activity.   <p> Investment capital cares nothing about who or what possesses the things it's invested in. And to know this is to feel dispossessed.There was a moment a year ago when someone persuaded me that the casino-derived wealth of the Indians in the state was sending the price of property sky-high. Feverishly, right then and there,I decided to liquidate (sinister word) our place. The rumor proved untrue, and the investment value of our house slumped, followed instantly, in my market-distracted mind, by all its other values:the historical, the symbolic, the aesthetic. The dismal science had obliterated the sentimental one. I was just a bettor in a big casino, my piece of New England a chip.  <p> How are we supposed to love a place and its imagined future-- throwing money into stone walls, planting trees, building gardens -- when actually, decisively, it all belongs to the market? I can't. All I can do is banish the thought of what really owns my realty -- not least by building stone walls that some passer by may see centuries from now, cutting through the sere winter woods.  <p> And I'll build them myself. From now on, short though Barry Patch thinks my future may be, I will be spending some of its tacking stone -- standing with both feet on the ground, investing sweat and, if I'm sloppy, a little blood. It's bound to do my heart good as well.  <p>  <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> THE MASTER PASSION <p>Orville Wood was a miser. For him, money was power.   <p> By William Green  <p>  <p>J. Orville Wood was laid to rest on a bitterly cold and blustery morning in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He had lived for 102 years, yet fewer than a dozen mourners appeared at his funeral. His six grandchildren stayed at home. His two children could not bring themselves to attend.  <p> Most of the people huddled together in the cemetery that day were Wood's neighbors. Even they -- his only friends -- would remember him primarily for his miserliness. They would recall how he had stolen rolls of toilet paper from the hospital when his third wife, Ruth, had a broken arm set; how he had stomped around the supermarket, grabbing food from Ruth's hands and shoving it back onto the shelves; how Ruth had been forced to wear a cheap golden-brown wig to save money on hair-salon bills.   <p> So it seemed fitting that Wood was buried in a thread bare suit in a veterans' cemetery where the plots and headstones are provided at no expense. Even in death, he had saved a buck.  <p> In the months following Wood's funeral in that winter of 1985, his lawyers and bankers discovered a myriad of assets nobody had known about. Treasury bills and certificates of deposit worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Stock in a slew of blue-chip companies from <a name="NYSE:BEL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10197"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bell Atlantic</b></a> to <a name="NYSE:AIT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10094"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ameritech</b></a>,<a name="NYSE:XON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10537"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b> Exxon</b></a> to <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a>.Cash hoarded in seven banks.  <p> No one was more astonished by the inventory of Wood's assets than his son, Roger, a San Francisco insurance salesman and financial planner. How had Orville, a teacher and printer who had never earned more than $4,000 a year, accumulated more than $1.1 million?And why had a man with so much money lived like a pauper?  <p> It was not just the size of Orville's estate that dumbfounded Roger. It was what the old man had chosen to do with it. In his will, Orville left his wife, Ruth, a mere $20,000 a year, which she would forfeit if she ever remarried. Roger was to be provided with a pension of $500 a quarter after Ruth's death, while Orville's daughter, Julia, was to receive $12,000 a year. But the bulk of Orville's money was to be donated to the University of Pittsburgh-- an institution for which he had expressed no affection.  <p> Five days after the funeral, Roger, then 65, wrote to Ruth.It was hardly a traditional sympathy note: "These past 40 or so years have been difficult. There has not been a day nor an hour when I have not thought of [my father]. I start to read a book and memory goes back and haunts me. It wakes me up about three or four in the morning and keeps me awake. It is well to forgive and forget the past, but it cannot be done."  <p> Misers hold an odd fascination. In the 17th century, Molire wrote a play called The Miser, in which the main character is so stingy that he reputedly steals oats from his own horses. Two hundred years later, George Eliot published Silas Marner, a novel about a miser who spends his evenings gazing adoringly at his gold. Most famously, Dickens immortalized Ebenezer Scrooge,"a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetousold sinner" who is besotted by "the master passion, Gain."  <p> Occasionally, a real-life miser makes it into the news: Anne Scheiber, for example, who died recently with $22 million after a singularly drab and loveless life, or Olive Swindells, who lived in a run-down Maryland house filled with trash and 70-year-old newspapers before dying last year with millions of dollars in stocks. But these misers usually remain fleshless and unreal. Having hoarded their emotions just as they hoarded their money,they often die friendless, barely remembered by anyone but their brokers.   <p> Orville Wood, however, refused to disappear without a trace. Convinced of his own importance, he recorded his life in bizarre detail. He kept a diary for more than 80 years, often using the back of incoming mail to save paper. He wrote endless letters to his children and composed more than 140 poems about everything from love to stock picking. In his 70s, he wrote a 262-page unpublished autobiography.   <p> After Orville's death, Roger searched through his garage in San Francisco and dug out every letter his father had ever sent him. He devoured them in a single sitting, then reread them so often that he learned whole paragraphs by heart. He pored over the diary that his mother, Helen, had kept before divorcing Orville-- page upon page filled with pain and loathing. He discussed Orville with a psychiatrist. He elicited a short memoir from his sister, Julia, who still cannot bear to speak openly about Orville. Roger even wrote his own, 295-page unpublished account of his father's life.   <p> Then, last summer, Roger embarked on the final leg of his decade-long quest to understand his father. Traveling from Pittsburgh to Chattanooga, he interviewed people who had known Orville; he visited places where the old man had lived. What he uncovered is a tale about the devastation caused by an all-consuming addiction to money.  <p> The Bible warns, "they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil."   <p> Orville Wood's father, the Reverend Wallace Wood, knew only the evil of poverty. As a farmer and an it inerant evangelist minister in Sligo, Kentucky, he battled hopelessly to support his seven children. In 1892, when Orville was nine, Wallace borrowed$45 to buy family necessities; it took him eight years to repay the debt. A decade later, in a letter to Orville, he confessed,"Many a day I have left home just before meal time like I was mad. But I was not mad. I knew there was not enough for all of us to eat."  <p> When Orville was 11, his mother died. Wallace married a woman whom Orville despised, so, at 15, he ran away from home to earn his keep on farms in Indiana and Ohio. He husked corn, dug potatoes for eight dollars a month, and trapped rabbits.  <p> After a year, he headed for Morgantown, Indiana, wearing a brown derby that was too small for his head. His elder brother, Emerson, ran the local newspaper, so Orville became an apprentice printer. For the next decade, he continued in this trade, hawking his services as a "tramp printer" from Illinois to Ohio to California. He moved incessantly, always looking for a better job, for a bigger paycheck. He read the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin and dreamed of greatness.   <p> Wherever Orville went, his fear of poverty followed like a bogeyman. He had seen how debt had ravaged his father's life, and he had learned how thrift had made Ben Franklin. He copied out a list of the great man's sayings: "If you would know the value of money,go and try to borrow some"; "Buy what thou hast no need of, and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries."  <p> Orville failed to note another of Franklin's observations: "Money never made a man happy yet, nor will it.... The more a man has, the more he wants."  <p> Orville saved with almost religious fervor. When he earned ten dollars a week, he spent four dollars on room and board and paid five dollars into his savings account. Eighty years later, he still had precise records of how much he had earned and saved in those early days. After all, he wrote in his autobiography,"next to knowledge, money is power."  <p> It is August 1995, and Roger Wood, now 75, is standing in front of the home in suburban Pittsburgh where he grew up. He has seen it only once before in half a century. "There wasn't any reason to come back," he says. "It had some bad memories, I guess."  <p> By now, the gray facade of the house is hidden beneath aluminum siding. The porch has rotted. The cherry, quince, and peach trees in the yard are gone, and a blue surfboard lies by the back door.Camera in hand, Roger talks about the house with the detached interest of a tour guide. Then his eyes grow distant, and he lapses into gloomy contemplation. He is an amiable man with a delightful chuckle, but these moments of silent melancholy are never far away.   <p> In the early 1920s, the house cost $9,000. Orville could afford it only with a hefty mortgage and the $4,000 that Roger's mother, Helen, had saved as a teacher. Orville divided the 12 rooms into three apartments, then rented out two of them for $65 each per month. "I slept in the pantry, and my sister slept in the livingroom," says Roger. "So, during my childhood, it wasn't our home. It was a rental home."  <p> When Roger was two, Orville landed a job at the H. J. Heinz Company. As superintendent of the printing department, he helped to produce advertisements for products such as pickling vinegar, baked beans, and tomato soup with rich cream. The annual salary was $4,000 -- about $30,000 in today's money. It was hardly a fortune, but it was an impressive sum for a farmer's boy who had once dug potatoes for eight dollars a month. It was also a pleasant place to work. Henry Heinz, "the Pickle King," provided his employees with a swimming pool, roof gardens, and a splendid auditorium with its own musical director.  <p> Flush with pride, Orville allowed himself the first extravagances of his life: a fine set of French Haviland china, a Tiffany glass lamp that hung over a carved Italian dining table, and a walnut Edison gramophone on which he played grand opera and military marches. He even paid $1,825 in cash for a 1924 Haynes automobile.It was a beauty, with an olive-green body and a two-inch stripe of cardinal red. "Here he was at Heinz," says Roger. "He lived in a fancy suburb.... Maybe it was to show people he'd arrived." <p> Yet Orville could not bear to squander even tiny sums of money on his family. He instructed Roger to use only two squares of toilet paper per trip to the bathroom; refused to pay for a doctor when Roger, who was five, cut his face with a straight razor; forced Roger to bathe in dirty water used by his sister, Julia.  <p> Sometimes, as a treat, Orville would unlock the top drawer of his four-drawer filing cabinet and remove a candy bar. He would slice off a sliver each for Roger and Julia. Then he would wrap the remains of the candy bar and return it like a cherished heirloom to the safety of the locked drawer. "The fact that we missed out didn't matter to him," says Roger. "Because he had missed out so much."  <p> When Roger was 13, Orville bought a new Oldsmobile coupe for $908. With Roger in the backseat, Orville drove to Chicago for the World's Fair. It was a dazzling event, so filled with the promise of a bright future that 39 million people came to see it. The exhibitions included a golden-roofed Buddhist temple, a Japanese teahouse, a million-dollar display of diamonds, a robot, a polar ship, a life-size reconstruction of a brontosaurus, and a Sky Ride that featured futuristic "rocket cars." It was all illuminated by 40 miles of neon tubing.   <p> Roger, who has kept the catalog for more than 60 years, remembers the fair as a highlight of his childhood. But he also recalls the panic he felt when, standing on the brink of all these marvels,he realized that each exhibition would cost a dime or a quarter. Growing up with Orville's miserliness, he had become convinced that he deserved nothing.  <p> "Don't you want to go in?" asked Orville.   <p> "No," said Roger. "I don't."  <p> Roger is driving from Pittsburgh to Ohio along the same route his family used to take when visiting Helen's parents. He drives slowly with one hand on the wheel, occasionally hitting a sidewalk, lurching to a sudden halt, or asking, "Was that a red light?"  <p> Along the way, he pulls over for a pit stop at a <a name="NYSE:MAR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10958"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Marriott</b></a> hotel and sees a buffet table set up for a farmers' conference. He stares intently at a bowl of red apples: "My father would take two of these," he says. "Should I do it?" A minute later, he hurries back empty-handed to the car, embarrassed and amused at how close he had come to this act of petty thievery. "My wife would call that an Orvillism," he says.  <p> That afternoon, Roger arrives in Lima, Ohio, the town where his mother grew up. He drives past the site of the house where she lived, finding nothing but an empty field.   <p> At 25, Helen left her home here to marry Orville, whom she had met six months earlier at an Ohio college. Orville, who was serving as a lieutenant in the army, bought her a Fourth Liberty Loan Bond for a wedding present. The marriage began inauspiciously. The day after the wedding, Orville left Helen to have a free hemorrhoid operation in a military hospital. He also neglected to mention that he had previously divorced a woman in Cleveland.  <p> A year later, Helen gave birth to Roger, a seven-and-a-half-pounder with his father's blue eyes. Orville dashed off an ecstatic letter to his wife's family. "He is the best boy ever.... What more would I want?" He signed off with the words "Yours in Glory, J. Orville Wood."  <p> But things soon turned sour. Orville applied for membership in a Masonic lodge and was rejected. Then, in 1925, he was fired by the H. J. Heinz Company. Before Helen died in 1987, she told Roger that Orville had been caught billing the firm for gift she had sent to relatives.   <p> Eventually, at age 47, Orville earned a master's degree in arts and education from the University of Pittsburgh. He had trusted that knowledge would bring prosperity. But he never again held a job as lucrative as the one he had lost at Heinz.   <p> Fifty years later Helen would observe, "When a man begins to feel inferior, he turns to hate."  <p> In the early days of the marriage to Helen, Orville became obsessed with investing. He took correspondence courses in the economics of business, exchange and speculation, and investment, and grew so fascinated that he kept his course books for the rest of his life, finally bequeathing his beloved 24-volume set of Modern Business to the Chattanooga Public Library. The library has since thrown out all but one volume.  <p> Orville eventually became rich thanks to a series of great bull markets, not least the one that began in the early 1980s. On February 24, 1983 -- his 100th birthday -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 1100 for the first time. Two months later, it broke 1200. A week before his death in 1985, it hit 1400. <p> However, Orville's investing career began less fortuitously. In 1924, he put $200 into Florida real-estate bonds on the advice of his brother, Emerson. Then the Florida property boom imploded, and Orville lost 75 percent of his stake. Undeterred, he met with a broker on Saturday mornings, dissected technical investment newsletters, and monitored the ticker tape in the local Citizen's Bank.   <p> By the 1930s, he had built up a portfolio of stocks purchased on a 10 percent margin. The prices soared until he had made thousands, but the market hit the skids, and he had to keep selling to meet margin calls. Before long, his investment was worth barely $300. <p> But Orville was hooked. To bankroll his habit, he set aside every dollar he could lay his hands on. He mended his own shoes. He saved money on towels, soap, and lightbulbs by stealing them from a high school where he taught printing. He even invested the rental income, which should have gone to pay off his home mortgage. In 1934, notices were posted on neighborhood trees to announce that the Dollar Savings and Trust Company had seized the house and would auction it on December 3.   <p> The sheriff's sale was averted at the last minute, but Helen remained convinced that Orville had intentionally shamed her. Writing to Roger years later, she recalled, "I was nearly a nervous wreck because your father kept gambling on the stock market and losing money. He did not know enough about it."  <p> The marriage soon grew worse. In a letter to Roger, Helen explained,"Orville became impotent and blamed me, instead of going to a doctor." The rift was intensified by a series of power struggles over money. Helen was far from extravagant, but Orville berated her endlessly for such sins as smothering too much butter on potatoes and using too much hot water in the bath tub. Helen, whose nickname for Orville was Scrooge, avoided trouble by waiting for him to leave the house before she took a bath.   <p> By 1941, Helen was suffering from severe depression. Orville began to twist the knife. He canceled her charge accounts and her power of attorney over his stocks; he took the cash from their joint account and deposited it in his own account at another bank; and he locked her out of the bedroom.   <p> Dreaming that Orville might change his ways, Helen gave him a copy of A Christmas Carol. But Orville longed to break free. In 1942, after 23 years of marriage, they divorced.   <p> Helen retreated to Lima, Ohio, and bought a small, ugly house not far from her parents' home. When she died, at the age of 93, Roger discovered a 79-page manuscript titled "Anatomy of a Divorce." She had written it in a half-crazed scrawl in the months before the divorce judge ruled that Orville's "barbarous treatment" had endangered her life. "Now he wants to ditch me,"Helen wrote. "I am left broken down in middle age.... Why was my economic status less than that of a servant? My life was tortured because of his love of money, which was his master passion."  <p> Roger tidies his unruly hair before entering the alumni-relations office at the University of Pittsburgh. Despite these efforts, he resembles nothing so much as a nutty physicist. He wears a plaid tie, an unmatching plaid jacket, and black running shoes. His spectacles cling to the tip of his purplish nose. His yellowy-whitebeard is so long that it brushes against the breast pocket ofhis shirt, which he has stuffed with enough pens to last him a year.   <p> "My father gave $400,000 to the university," Roger tells the receptionist.   <p> Leland Patouillet, the executive director of the university's alumni association, quickly emerges from his office, ready to bestow attention on the benefactor's son. Over lunch, Patouillet says most of the people who give money to the university want to make "this world a better place" and leave "a personal mark.""What's more virtuous than having a scholarship named after youth at helps young people study?" he says.  <p> The irony is that Orville -- who used his money to establish the J. Orville Wood Scholarship Fund -- had shown no concern for the education of his own children.  <p> At the time of the divorce, Roger was studying for free at West Point. One night, he was caught wandering dazedly around the parade ground, suffering from double vision and what his mother called "mental confusion." On his release from the hospital, Roger received an honorable discharge and headed home to Pittsburgh. Orville picked him up at the train station and delivered him to Helen with the words "He's your problem now."  <p> Roger enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh, but he soon discovered that Orville had no intention of helping him with school bills. So Roger paid his own way by getting a job as a timekeeper in a local shipyard. For two years, he worked from11 p.m. to 7 a.m. each night, slept in the afternoons, and studied in his spare time.  <p>"It wasn't a question of him not having the money," says Roger."There was just a complete lack of interest. That was the devastating part."  <p> In 1946, Orville married for the third and final time. His bride, Ruth Matson, was 40 years old and desperate to have children. Orville was 63, wore dentures, and wanted little more than a glorified maid servant.  <p> They were both disappointed. Ruth dreamed of making a home, but Orville uprooted her 27 times in three years, moving from Ohio to Tennessee, Florida to Kentucky, New Jersey to Virginia. In 1952, he finally tired of roaming and bought a small ranch-style house in the suburbs of Chattanooga. To save money on food, hereared 140 chickens in a shed that he had built himself and harvested his own vegetables. In one year alone, he calculated, this enabled him to save two dollars on lettuce and four dollars on parsnips. <p> Ruth finally had her own home, but Orville refused to waste money on such luxuries as a washing machine or a telephone. "They wore clothes till they were falling off them," says one of their neighbors, Evelyn Mason. "Their sheets and linen were pathetic. It was unreal what they lived with.... I told him one time, 'They're not going to let you pad your casket with that money.' He just died laughing."   <p> Orville once claimed that the divorce from Helen had left him with nothing but a $300 car, an insurance policy worth $500, and a bank balance of less than $40. But by now he had managed to save a small fortune, much of it invested in blue-chip stocks such as <a name="NASD:MBLE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14148"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mobil</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:UK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11540"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Union Carbide</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>. He was so proud of his financial skills that he wrote a five-stanza poem titled "Stock Market," which he sent to Roger. It ended with the lines:  <p> It's hard to choose which stock to buy;  <p>It's dangerous to speculate; <p>So let alone the "cats and dogs"; <p>Buy blue chip stocks for your estate.  <p> So take a hot "tip," pard from me; <p>Investigate before you buy; <p>Pay cash for all you can afford; <p>Then buy 'em low and sell 'em high.  <p> In A Christmas Carol, Scrooge abandons his miserly ways and becomes a loving second father to Tiny Tim. In Silas Marner, the miser finds salvation when he comes to love his adoptive daughter more than his gold. But in the real world, old misers seldom learn to cherish their children as much as cash.  <p> In 1946, Roger moved to San Francisco, where he married Phyllis Anderson, a bright, sweet-natured teacher whom he had met in church. They bought a modest house, had three children, and built a good life together. But Phyllis always detected in Roger "a kind of intangible misery," which she blamed on his parents."You never quite have peace of mind," she told him recently,"because they never permitted you to."  <p> Roger earned two master's degrees; became a chartered life-insurance underwriter, a certified financial planner, and a chartered financial consultant; taught for ten years at the College of San Mateo; became an elder in the Presbyterian Church; earned a listing  in Who's Who in the West; and got a Ph.D. by writing a 600-page thesis on the causes of low self-esteem.   <p> But his father remained unimpressed. In 1951, the old man visited San Francisco for a weekend and left in a paranoid rage. He had convinced himself that Roger and Phyllis were urging Ruth to abandon him.   <p> After that, Roger did not see his father for years. But Orville continued to send letters.  <p> 1951: "You all detest seeing me contented, happy or prosperous. None of you will be contented until I am dead. Then you will be disappointed. Don't live in anticipation of getting rich, paying off mortgages, or taking world tours on possible inheritance." <p> 1958: "I am very much undecided about things when I am gone.I can't imagine what you would do with 2530 grand. However, I would like you to have whatever automobile I may then have, also all my books and papers."  <p> 1959: "I had thought of making an ambitious material gift to you and am today purchasing a $1,000 government bond for you.It will be kept in my safety deposit box here."  <p> 1963: "Had you any guts or backbone you would assert yourself and use your own mind and get out of that town. I am not expecting any kind of answer to this or any other letter. In fact, if one should come I may return it without opening."  <p> 1966: "I do feel concerned with your troubles, but how can I help so far away. Handouts have never put anyone on their feet. I never was helped financially, and I am thankful now that I was not for my own self-reliance and independent character. What if I should send you a thousand dollars, five thousand dollars, the price of a new car? All these things would not last long with you."  <p> 1970: "I have reached one important conclusion based on a life of activity and practical affairs. That conclusion is that the way to a successful, happy and useful life is through hard work and thrift."  <p> Then, out of nowhere, Orville sent Roger an elegant invitation to his 90th-birthday party. Roger could scarcely afford the plane ticket, but he was afraid of what Orville would say if he didn't show up. The party was a disaster. Nobody else had been invited, and Orville spent the afternoon watching a bowling tournament on his wavy black-and-white TV screen. For dinner, Roger, Orville, and Ruth split two pork chops.   <p> They went out for an afternoon drive together, during which Orville kept hitting the plastic cones in the road. Roger turned around in the passenger's seat so he could chat with Ruth, who was sitting in the backseat.  <p> "Don't sit like that," said Orville.  <p> "But I want to talk to both of you," Roger replied.  <p> "Put your feet forward," Orville ordered. "I won't drive unless you sit with both of your feet forward."  <p> Roger -- his palms sweaty and his throat dry -- could do nothing right. Orville criticized him for drinking too much coffee and mocked him for watching 60 Minutes. At one point Orville announced to no one in particular, "He's the worst person who has ever been here."   <p> Roger never saw his father again.  <p> On a muggy afternoon in the summer of 1995, Roger enters the Life Care Center of East Ridge, Tennessee, and asks the way to Ruth Wood's room. He has not set eyes on her in more than 20 years. A few months after Orville's funeral, Ruth contested the will and was awarded $400,000. But her health soon deteriorated,and the bulk of her inheritance has gone to pay for permanent care in this retirement home.   <p> Roger finds Ruth asleep, dressed in a nightgown imprinted with the words hospital property. Her thin white hair has been teased and blow-dried, but her eyes are sunken, and her cheeks have collapsed. She is 89, has Parkinson's disease, and can no longer get out of bed on her own.  <p> Roger wakes Ruth and tells her who he is. A nurse hears her weeping and asks what's wrong. "It's just that it's overwhelming," says Ruth.   <p> Leaning over the bed, his beard hovering inches from Ruth'sface, Roger asks, "Did you have a happy marriage?"   <p> Ruth struggles to find the words she needs and the strength to say them. "I liked most of it," she says. "We had differences....I don't think I can tell. He was hard to get along with. I expected more."  <p> "What was my father's attitude to me?" asks Roger.  <p> "I think he was proud of you. He didn't let people know it." <p> "Did you have any control over money?"   <p> "Just a few dollars," Ruth replies. "I let him have control. It gave us peace."  <p> The following morning, Roger parks his rented Mercury Sable on the grounds of the Chattanooga National Cemetery. Ten years have passed since Orville's death, but Roger has never seen his father's grave. He strides through a quiet, bug-ridden corner of the cemetery, and there it is: a slab of gray marble with the inscription J. ORVILLE WOOD FEB 24 1883NOV 14 1985.   <p> Roger snaps a photograph, hurries back to the car, and drives away -- all in under a minute. "Well, that's over with," he says calmly. "What emotion should I feel? Sadness or something?" <p> At 75, Roger may be at the end of his journey to understand his father. In his unpublished book -- once titled "Self-Discovery and Recovery Through Understanding, Acceptance and Forgiving After a Father's Final Rejection" -- he concluded, "My father did not know how he could be accepted, understood, even loved....Because love had never been shared with him, he could not share love with others."  <p> Even after all these years spent studying the old man's life, Roger knows that his memories of Orville will always haunt him. Yet he is happier than ever before. Now semi-retired, he takes trips to countries such as Israel, Italy, and France. He studies the genealogy of his parents' families. And he sees each of his three children almost every week.   <p> He and Phyllis live contentedly in the same modest house they have shared for more than 40 years. It's a cozy, welcoming place, overflowing with compact discs, videos, self-help books, college mugs, and framed photographs of their children.   <p> Phyllis is especially fond of the patio, which Roger has transformed into a bird sanctuary. "It doesn't interest him," she says. "He did it simply to make it nice for me."  <p> Occasionally, Roger catches himself thinking about money in ways that remind him of his father. When he travels abroad, he often stays in cheap hotels with shared bathrooms. When he eats in restaurants, he sometimes fills his pockets with free crackers. <p> But Roger has never denied his family. A few months ago, his daughter gave birth to a girl named Sarah -- his first grandchild. To celebrate, Roger wrote a check for $5,000 and presented it to Sarah in a tiny box decorated with a pink ribbon.  <p>One day, when she is old enough to understand, Sarah will open her grandfather's picture album to find a photograph of herself holding that check. Beneath the photograph, she will see the words that Roger has written with a joy that Orville never knew:"Grandpa adds to Sarah's Education Fund."  <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> READY, AIM, FIRE BACK <p>So you go the ax. You don't have to get the shaft.  <p> By Dick Noel  <p> After 19 years with the same employer, I recently lived through every modern executive's nightmare: I was abruptly fired from my senior-level position. You, too, may be vulnerable and wondering,What should I do if they suddenly cut me loose?  <p> In spite of working without a written contract, I refused these verance offer, refused to resign, and refused to meet with the outplacement counselor. Five months after my termination, I forced a settlement that left me a happy, retired 53-year-old with a comfortable lifetime income and a healthy nest egg.  <p> What should you do if you're called in for that fateful interview? First of all, keep your emotions under control. Ask for a written list of the reasons for your termination, as well as the details of the proposed severance package -- severance pay, benefit coverage,etc. -- and a copy of your personnel file. Tell your superior you do not wish to meet with an outplacement counselor but will get back to him or her in a few days. Then pick up all the written materials and leave.  <p> Before you agree to anything, talk to a lawyer -- I hired a shrewd litigator with a reputation for toughness. In addition to the notes and written materials from your severance interview,the lawyer should look over the company's employee manual, performance evaluations, and any relevant correspondence from superiors, including notes regarding any promises. I had a recent Christmas card from the CEO of my company's holding company -- my boss's boss -- telling me what a great job I was doing. I also had 18 consecutive positive performance reviews -- followed by one negative review from the boss who eventually fired me.  <p> Have your attorney send a demand letter to your ex-employer,stating that you have no doubt a jury would conclude you have an implied contract that has been breached. If the company is interested in avoiding an unpleasant lawsuit, it'll probably respond by saying it has done nothing wrong but is willing to hear what you have to say. At this stage, any proposal acceptable to you will most likely be unacceptable to your employer, so submit a package that would make you more than happy. If your employer responds with something reasonable, you can settle quickly. More likely, you'll get an unacceptable take-it-or-leave-it counter proposal-- or, as in my case, a door slammed in your face.  <p> At that point, if your lawyer feels the case is strong, file suit for breach of implied contract and/or breach of good faith and fair dealing. Allow several weeks for the complaint to sink in. Then discuss with your lawyer the idea of a one-on-one conference with your superior's superior (the higher the better) to try to settle the case. If your attorney thinks you have the proper negotiating skills, he shouldn't stand in your way.  <p> If you use this approach, try to arrange a meeting at your home.I had my boss's boss come to my house, which relaxed me and put some emotional pressure on him. Take charge and present your terms -- sizable but not outrageous, leaving room to negotiate.You now have leverage you didn't have before: The complaint will soon become a public matter; senior company executives will be scheduled for depositions. Stay noncombative, stressing the benefits of settling: Both parties save on legal expenses, you save the strain on your family, and your employer avoids negative publicity,many lost employee hours in and out of court, and a possibly substantial jury verdict.  <p> Attorney Mike Brow of Burlington, Vermont, estimates that 70 to 90 percent of wrongful-discharge suits are settled before going to trial, and this is how my case ended -- decidedly in my favor. But don't think a jury trial can't also end well. Accordingto Jury Verdict Research of Horsham, Pennsylvania, plaintiffs win 70 percent of all discharge suits involving breach of contract and 64 percent involving lack of cause, with median judgments of $130,000 and $99,884, respectively. I've been in front of juries as defendant, plaintiff, and expert witness, as well as having served on a few, and the bottom line is this: Corporate giants get little sympathy.  <p> <p><p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> DRIVER EDUCATION <p>Golf schools where the classes are as fun as the homework  <p> By Rudy Maxa  <p> Giving Families the Business  <p> Is there a golfer alive who doesn't want to improve his or her game? No. Are there hundreds of golf schools that want to help those golfers? Yes. Can you expect the same level of instruction-- and the same level of fun -- at all of them? Absolutely not. <p> Some variables to consider: What's the student-to-teacher ratio?Four to one is good. How much golf will you actually play? Make sure a school isn't all lectures on theory and video tapes on form. And will you have fun? "So many of them have been realgulags," says James Dodson, an editor at Golf Magazine. "They used to be like a prison. You listened to talk about 'reverse pivot' and then hit balls until your hands bled."  <p> Here are a number of schools that promise something better: <p> Nicklaus/Flick Golf School (800-642-5528): Co-founded by Jack Nicklaus and Jim Flick, this school emphasizes developing a consistent swing. Schools are in Palm Beach County, Florida; Scottsdale,Arizona; Pebble Beach, California; Harbor Springs, Michigan;and Park City, Utah. The Florida and Arizona schools operate year-round except in the summer; the others run in the summer only. All offer nearby luxury-hotel packages. The Scottsdale Princess, for example, offers a Nicklaus/Flick deal startingat $3,195 per person for four nights, based on double occupancy.That includes just about everything but dinner.  <p> Pine Needles Lodge & Golf Club, Southern Pines, North Carolina(800-747-7272): A single-course resort, Pine Needles runs year-round three- and four-day seminars that boast a four-to-one student-teacher ratio for all levels of players. A four-day, three-night program that includes playing the course with your instructor costs $1,595(based on double occupancy) and covers all meals, lodging, instruction,greens and cart fees, taxes, and tips. Peggy Kirk Bell also teaches five-day "Golfaris" (short for golf safaris, though no wild animalsare involved) seven times a year: five for women only, one for couples, and one for kids.  <p> David Leadbetter Golf Academy (800-424-3542): The man famed for mending Nick Faldo's swing wants to do the same for you atone of his six schools in La Quinta, California; Bradenton, Lake Nona, and Naples, Florida; Chicago; and Alpharetta, Georgia.All are year-round except for the Chicago school, which is open from April through October. A three-day course at the Bradenton school, for example, costs $1,375.  <p> Dave Pelz Short Game School (800-833-7370): According to Pelz,the short game accounts for 70 percent of all shots. Hence his three-day programs -- at the Boca Raton Resort & Club in Florida(September to June) and the Ranch at PGA West in La Quinta, California(October to May) -- stress wedge shots and putting. Prices runfrom $1,775 (excluding lodging) to $3,200 (including lodgingand Pelz himself teaching theory).  <p> Golf Digest schools (800-243-6121): For the benefit of those who don't live near a golf mecca, these schools travel around the country to various resorts. Programs run from a half day to five days, with special programs available for women only,a short-game clinic, and a "playing school" with lessons on a golf course rather than at the range. A three-day course, including lodging, goes for $2,715 based on double occupancy.  <p> If attending a school sounds too intense, call the PGA at 407-624-8400:Your local PGA office can recommend pros who will work one-on-one for a reasonable fee. Heck, says Dodson, one of the greatest short players in the game, Paul Runyan, lives near Los Angeles and offers lessons for $100 an hour.  <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> CLEARER THAN A BELL <p>PCS phones are to cellular what compact discs are to records--so much better that they're the inevitable next generation  <p> By Aaron Rosenbaum  <p> Stuart Zuckerman, a principal of Zuckerman Brothers, a residential real-estate developer based in the Washington, D.C., area, doesn't have a traditional office. He coordinates his subcontractors by phone from job sites around the region. Zuckerman found cellular service inadequate because of its poor sound quality -- and frequent episodes of no service at all. Regular phone and beeper services were simply not convenient for him. So in January, Zuckermans witched to a personal-communications system called Sprint Spectrum. <p> "There's no comparison between the two," Zuckerman says. "This new technology eliminated nearly all of the problems that we had with our cell phone."  <p> American Personal Communications -- in partnership with <a name="NYSE:FON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11560"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sprint</b></a>, <a name="NASD:TCII"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14870"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>TCI Cable</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:COX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=43269"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cox Communications</b></a>, and <a name="NASD:CMCSK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13034"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Comcast</b></a> -- launched Sprint Spectrum's PCS service in the WashingtonBaltimore region last November, and the service is expected to be available in other major metropolitan areas across the country within a year or two. Unlike the cellular-phone system, which has two providers in each market, PCS will have three or more. While most PCS service providers remain coy about their launch dates, <a name="NASD:OMPT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=47791"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Omnipoint Communications </b></a> in the greater New York area has announced it will begin operating its systems this year.  <p> As a digital device, the PCS phone is to a cell phone what CDs are to tapes and vinyl records. In addition to its superior sound quality, a PCS phone can receive and send wireless voice communications through walls and inside tunnels. The new system also duplicates state-of-the-art cell-phone features such as three-way calling,caller ID, call forwarding, call waiting, numeric messaging, and voice mail. Because the bandwidth is wider, more calls can be completed at once, so that at peak times common cellular problems with getting through are avoided. And while cellular calls can often be overheard by unwanted cell-phone users, eavesdropping on a PCS call is nearly impossible.  <p> Unlike cellular, there's no burdensome contract or activation fee. The mobile PCS phone units, now made by <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:NOK.A"></a><b>Nokia</b>,and <a name="NASD:ERICY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41776"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ericsson</b></a>, can be purchased off the shelf for $100 to $200,then programmed remotely with a call to a Sprint Spectrum number.And if you later buy a new PCS phone, you can keep the same number.<p>The monthly minimum operating cost is $15. For a heavy user such as Zuckerman, who uses his PCS phone about 15 hours a month, Sprint Spectrum offers 10 peak hours and 10 off-peak hours for$150 per month (with no contract). Cellular One, which requires a one-year contract, charges $169 for the same amount of time on its cell phone. For 30-minutes-per-month service, Sprint Spectrum charges about $25, as opposed to $29 for Cellular One, which further restricts its 30 minutes to off-peak hours. Additional peak minutes cost 31 cents from Sprint Spectrum, as opposed to 29 cents from Cellular One.  <p> At this point, the primary drawback to the PCS is that users can't place calls from outside their service area. This won't change until there is a nationwide network of regional systems in place, which would require all cellular and PCS providers to develop special roaming agreements covering all combinations of vendors. While the Federal Communications Commission may requirethe companies to offer these agreements, it hasn't happened yet.(PCS technology also causes some interference with hearing aids,which may pick up a pronounced buzzing sound from the digital signals.)   <p> In the meantime, there is sure to be increased competition among PCS providers. Four heavy hitters in the telephone industry (<a name="NYSE:BEL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10197"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>BellAtlantic</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:NYN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11044"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Nynex</b></a>, U S West, and <a name="NYSE:ATI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16964"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Airtouch Communications</b></a>) formed a joint venture in 1994 called PCS PrimeCo, which was intended to compete in the PCS market. PCS PrimeCo has invested $1.1 billionin licensing fees and will be investing  almost $1 billion increating a nationwide network. It hopes to start up its service-- which will eventually cover 11 major cities -- by the endof this year, though there are rumors that the partnership has been troubled by internal squabbling, and there remains some doubt over when its product will reach the market.  <p> I tested the Sprint Spectrum PCS service in the Washington area for a month, comparing it to the local cellular service. The results were impressive. The sound quality is like that of a good cordless phone; most cell phones are a step below that. Although disconnection did happen occasionally, particularly on calls placed near the edge of the service area, there was always some warning, such as a slight warbling in the sound. <p> PCS phones are as small as the best  cell phones and provide more talk time on a single battery charge -- up to three times as much as a cellular phone running on an equivalent battery. The PCS phone can also act as a pager, because it's able to store voice mail and numeric messages from a caller even with the phone turned off or out of calling range. The system sends such messages through as soon as you reenter the service area.  <p> Until PCS technology becomes available across the country, it will be most useful to those heavy business users who don't travel much but seek better quality, standard messaging features, and longer battery life. The already reasonable prices are bound to drop even further as PCS and cellular battle for market share, but PCS's superior quality would seem to mark it as the wave of the future. Zuckerman, for one, is never going back.  <p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> PETER McMILLAN TAKES A FLIER <p>The story of an ordinary institutional broker -- barely worth his million bucks a year -- who developed some extraordinary ideas about real risk and real reward  <p> By Donald Katz  <p> By the time of the late-autumn cocktail gathering at the Australian Embassy in Washington, D.C., Peter McMillan had grown used to public wonderment over the quixotic and crazily dangerous thing he had done. The aviator, 36 years old and still resembling some tousle-haired frat jock dressed up in a sport coat and gone slightly pious for a day, stood beside the Australian ambassador, his hands clasped behind his back. A crowd composed of air-force officials, National Geographic Society executives, third-world diplomats, and a collection of other local elites listened attentively as the ambassador, Don Russell, spoke about heroes and the power of dreams and of the bits and pieces of childhood that sometimes arise to carry people out and away from the general flow in ways that make others think they've lost their minds.   <p> It had been more than a year since McMillan checked out of the rarefied upper-middle tiers of a San Francisco financial-services establishment to spend every bit of the million dollars he'd saved -- and then some -- on a single-minded determination to build an airplane and fly it more than halfway around the world. As for the gatherings in his honor in cities here and abroad, they had less to do with the trip per se than with his decision to make it in a craft designed not long after the Wright brothers floated their winged motorbike off the ground at Kitty Hawk. <p> McMillan had, in fact, chosen to transfer a significant stock portfolio, his IRAs, all of his available credit, and just about every other dollar he could lay his hands on into a great parade float of an open-cockpit World War I bomber made out of cloth and wood and wire. McMillan's Vickers Vimy biplane, built from a 1918 design, usually flew at 75 miles per hour, often just a few hundred feet above the mountains and treetops. It was powered by a pair of 360-horsepower engines driving gigantic wooden propellers that tossed icy water and wind directly onto the young stockbroker's leather-helmeted head.  <p> For his part, McMillan couldn't have said if his former colleagues back in the trading room at Montgomery Securities regarded his repudiation of the faux warrior culture of the investment house and his weird rejection of a seven-figure yearly income as bemusing, threatening, or simply aberrant. McMillan was a guy who could have had it all in the world of money and yet somehow became confused about the applications and profitable rewards of risk. He'd blown it all in pursuit of some romantic revivification of a forgotten Australian flyboy named Smith -- that and a measly15 minutes out near the footlights that he would never be able to take to the bank.  <p> But the crowd gathered amid the Australian Embassy's blond-wood elegance did understand McMillan's will to adventure and reenactment. The guests stood before stunning aerial photographs of the Taj Mahal and the Sydney Opera House, shot from the gunner's perchin the nose of McMillan's plane. They gazed up at a single stretch of antique cloth stripped from the wing of the original Vimy biplane, in which two Australian pilots had made the first flight from an airstrip near London to Adelaide, Australia, in 1919.  <p> "We are here to consider the kinds of adventures we used to read about as kids," the ambassador said. "We gather to consider what is involved in going forward in the face of everyone around you saying that what you are doing is completely absurd."  <p> McMillan spoke later. "I think that the flight was a way to demonstrate to myself that while I might have been born into a time of wimps and paper shufflers," he observed in his slightly scratchy voice, "maybe I could be as good as people who weren't. Maybe I couldn't be truly heroic in the older sense, but I could at least try to do something that would allow me to know how real heroes felt."  <p>
Peter McMillan grew up in North Carolina, the son of a would-be aviator who became a doctor instead. His father took him to the Outer Banks to see Kitty Hawk and the Wright Brothers museum, and they would travel to the airport just to watch the planestake off and land. At night, Peter reads.<p><p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> TICKET MASTERS <p>Good brokers want to be your friend. Don't be afraid.   <p> By Teri Karush  <p> If you think ticket brokers are just scalpers with 800 numbers, you're sort of right. Like scalpers, ticket brokers charge premiums that rise or fall in accordance with your desperation -- at least in the 41 states that don't regulate ticket resales. But unlike scalpers, brokers are legal and above board, and they're renewing efforts to present their operations as customer-friendly rather than shady. With a mix of caution and diligence, consumers can use brokers to get good seats at less than outrageous prices.  <p> Perhaps the best way to use a broker is to find a reputable agency and stick with it. Or even better, find two you trust and play one off the other. Brokers are more likely to negotiate fees with regular customers, who may also find more desirable seats passed their way. "Ultimately, ask your friends for a recommendation," says Lance Haver of the Consumers Education & Protective Association in Philadelphia. "The best information is always word of mouth. "For out-of-town tickets, choose a broker located near the event venue. That keeps the broker from having to buy the tickets through a middleman, whose fee would get tacked on to your purchase price.  <p> How can you tell a shady broker from a reputable one? One big warning sign: There's a phone number but no office where you can go to pick up your ticket. Too-good-to-be-true prices are another indication the tickets (and the broker) may not be legit. A legitimate broker will explain fees and cancellation policies without being asked and is available 365 days a year and through curtain time in case anything goes wrong. Make sure the broker is registered or licensed if either is required by the state.  <p> You can also call the National Association of Ticket Brokers to see if there have been any complaints against a particular agency. The NATB, located in Burlington, New Jersey, has a code of ethics and a complaint board that works with state officials to help resolve reselling problems. "A lot of brokers were scalpers as kids," says Barry Lefkowitz, the executive director of the NATB. "As they've grown up, we're seeing more and more legitimate small businesses evolving in the industry. Ticket brokers do for the entertainment consumer what stock brokers do for investors." <p> In most states, brokers can charge as much as the market will bear: For hot events, brokers commonly peddle tickets for three times or more their face value. Several states limit broker premiums to a certain percentage above face value -- although loopholes such as New York's "reasonable expenses" clause enable brokers to charge much more (anything over 32 percent is considered unreasonable). Louisiana, Michigan, and Minnesota permit resale for face value only. It pays to know how much brokers can legally charge in your state; if you need Broadway seats, for example, a New York agency is limited by the 32 percent rule, while agencies across the river in New Jersey can extract unlimited pounds of flesh. And any broker who skirts the resale limit is one to be avoided. <p> The nature of the business means that brokers deal in high-demand, high-priced tickets. "They are a luxury," says Lance Haver. "Be prepared to pay for a luxury."  For example, in February, the cheapest seat at July's Olympic opening ceremony in Atlanta --a $212 face value -- went for $1,000 if you called the right broker. That might not sound like such a bargain until you learn that another broker was asking $2,000.  <p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> OFFSPRING BREAK <p>Kids deserve a vacation of their very own  <p> By Anne Field  <p> We like to think of a vacation with the kids as a series of idyllic <a name="NYSE:EK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10500"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kodak</b></a> moments. Fact is, it can also be so exhausting that you feel like you need another break when it's over. The good news is that more hotels, resorts, and cruises are offering affordable relief in the form of children's programs. Some are included in the base price, some are extra, but they're almost always a godsend for parents and kids alike. "They let you be a person, not just a parent,'' says Dorothy Jordon, author of Great Adventure Vacations With Your Kids (World Leisure), to be published in May. Here are some of the best.  <p> ADVENTURE TRIPS. Several of Abercrombie and Kent's family-oriented tours include organized children's programs. At the seven-day trip to the B Bar Ranch outside Yellowstone National Park in Montana, for example, children participate in their own ranch activities, including horseback riding, Western crafts, and an evening of singing songs around a campfire. A ten-day tour of Costa Rica provides supervised pool play and nature walks for children under six while parents and older kids raft in the Corobici River or go on other excursions. (800-323-7308; $1,935 for the B Bar Ranch trip; $1,750 for the Costa Rica tour.)  <p> Temptress Voyages' cruises in Belize and Costa Rica feature nature and hiking activities for children (4 through 17) when the Temptress ship is in port. Each evening, guides give kids a briefing about what they'll see the next day. On rainy days, kids may do anything from baking cookies to painting. They can also dine with their new friends from a separate kids' menu. (800-336-8423; six-night cruises per child are $895 for Costa Rica and $500 for Belize.)  <p> SKI RESORTS IN SUMMER. At Beaver Creek Resort's Matawin Teepee Village (Beaver Creek, Colorado), children aged 6 to 13 can campout over night in a tepee and engage in such Native Americaninspired activities as archery and arts and crafts. Kids over five can attend a day camp or take day trips involving hiking, horseback riding, fishing, and rafting. Toddlers and babies go to a junior version of the day camp. (970-949-5750; $45 to $65 a day.)  <p> The Targhee Institute at the Grand Targhee Resort (Alta, Wyoming) offers programs on various ecological themes. The "Earth, Air, Fire and Water" session teaches kids to identify local fossils, minerals, and edible plants; "Liquid Gold" covers water formation and related topics. There are also a day camp for kids three and up, and day care for kids aged two months and up. (800-targhee;$25 a day.)  <p> At the Resort at Squaw Creek (Squaw Valley USA, California),the Mountain Buddies program runs full- and half-day sessions seven days a week. Each day has a theme: On dinosaur day, for example, campers make cardboard stand-up dinos and play duck,duck, dinosaur. Kids can also swim, hike, and participate innature-related science projects. (916-581-6624; $55 a day, $25 a half day.)  <p> THE CARIBBEAN. At Aruba Sonesta Resorts (Seaport Village, Aruba),in addition to the usual swimming and arts and crafts, kids aged5 to 12 hike along nature trails on the hotel's private island and take such field trips as a rock-hunting expedition to Aruba's north coast. The evenings feature movies, bingo, and miniature golf. (800-sonesta; no additional charge.)  <p> El Conquistador's Camp Coqui (San Juan, Puerto Rico) accepts campers as young as three. There's a heavy dose of education mixed with appropriate activities -- say, a talk about marine biology after swimming. In addition to salsa and merengue lessons, kids learn indigenous arts on a 100-acre island used only by hotel guests. For older kids, there are Ping-Pong tournaments and disco parties. (800-468-5228; $38 a day.)  <p> Holiday Inn Sun Spree Resort (Montego Bay, Jamaica) offers a nursery for little ones six months to two years old. Bigger kids enjoy such activities as a tour of a sugar plantation and a ride on a glass-bottomed boat. Kids can eat in their own dining area; teenagers dance in their own disco. Teens also stage a reggae concert and make puppets for a puppet show. (800-holiday; free for children under 13, $50 for ages 13 to 17.)  <p> CRUISES. Camp Carnival runs from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. on all of Carnival Cruise Lines' cruises. While activities are much the same as on other cruise lines, notable features include a kids-only aerobics class, karaoke parties, makeovers for teenagers, and photography workshops. One ship, the Super Liner Holiday, which sails from Los Angeles to Baja, Mexico, has more than 60 video and arcade games -- your eight-year-old will be thrilled. (800-438-6744; no additional charge.)  <p> Premier Cruise Lines' Big Red Boat is the most kid-friendly cruise around: Five programs, divided into age groups, run from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. for kids aged two and up. A typical tour starts with a three-day visit to <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Disney</b></a> World, then continues with acruise to the Bahamas for another three or four days. The piecede resistance: During cruisetime, if your kids are at least two,you can leave them in the kids' area overnight. Says spokesman Brad Parker, "You could conceivably leave your children 24 hours a day." After three days of fighting crowds at Disney World, you might think it's not such a bad idea. (800-327-7113; no additional charge.)  <p>

						March 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Review  <p> AMATEUR BULLS ON THE LOOSE  <p>  <p>THE MOTLEY FOOL INVESTMENT GUIDE <p>By David and Tom Gardner, Simon & Schuster, $24  <p> THE WHIZ KID OF WALL STREET'S INVESTMENT GUIDE <p>By Matt Seto and Steven Levingston, William Morrow, $22  <p> THE BEARDSTOWN LADIES' STITCH-IN-TIME GUIDE TO GROWING YOURNEST EGG <p>Hyperion, $19.95  <p> THE BEARDSTOWN LADIES' COMMON-SENSE INVESTMENT GUIDE <p>Hyperion, $10.95, paperback  <p>  <p>By Eric Tyson  <p> Wonder whether the U.S. stock market is cresting? Consider this sign: The number of investment clubs registered with the National Association of Investors Corp. has ballooned from 3,600 in 1980 to more than 18,700 today; the previous high of 14,100 clubs, reached in the early 1970s, coincided with the beginning of a dismal decade for stocks. Another sign? The uptick in stock-picking books by unknowns claiming strategies and performances that make Warren Buffett and George Soros look like bush leaguers.  <p> Beating market indexes and top money pros isn't easy, but you'd never know it by reading the recent books from Matt Seto, the Gardner brothers, and the Beardstown Ladies. All claim simple stock-picking systems. The boasts they make!  <p> Take The Beardstown Ladies' Common-Sense Investment Guide, newly issued in paperback. The now famous authors trumpet annual returns in excess of 23 percent during the past decade. Not likely. The club's M.O. is selecting highly ranked stocks from the respected Value Line Investment Survey, but Value Line itself runs an SEC-audited mutual fund that invests solely in stocks it rates highly. Over the past ten years, it has underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index. Seems the Ladies should've taken over management of the Value Line Fund by now. When asked to document their performance, though, a spokesperson says the club chooses "not to make our investing return an issue, we're not out there to be bragging." Maybe the Ladies haven't seen their own book jackets lately. <p> Matt Seto's book, The Whiz Kid of Wall Street's Investment Guide, grew out of a Wall Street Journal article portraying Seto as a prodigy whose stock picking and predictions were putting Wall Street's investment pros to shame. For Seto, investing is a science, and a simple one at that: "If you read the company's numbers correctly and foresee the good news coming, you're sitting on a gold mine." Seto is probably sitting somewhere else now: For a second Journal article, on January 3, 1995, Seto read the tea leaves and predicted 1995 would see interest rates rise and the Dow climb only 2 percent; his top stock pick was <a name="NASD:COTIF"></a><b>Cott Corporation</b>,then at $9.75. Well, as almost everyone knows, interest rates plunged and the Dow soared 33.5 percent; Cott closed the year at $5.50. Seto, much like the Beardstown Ladies, backpedaled when asked to substantiate the 34-percent-annual-performance claim blazoned across his book's cover.  <p> The Motley Fool Investment Guide, by Tom and David Gardner, is humorous and breezy, but it has an attitude problem: The Gardners sound like political-talk-show hosts on a mission. They're convinced the financial establishment, brokers, financial publishers, mutual-fund companies, and the like are feathering their own nests by making investing unnecessarily complicated. The brothers' idea of simplicity? Select high-yielding, low-priced Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks and wait for the 25 percent annual returns to roll in with minimal risk, of course. Their system resembles the newsletters they criticize for promoting rear view-mirror strategies, though,to their credit, they can document their market-beating returns (albeit over a short period).  <p> The greatest shortcoming in these "investment" guides is their limited focus. Despite their titles, these books are pulpit-pounding sermons on stock picking, to the exclusion of mutual funds, real estate, and other investments. Novice readers need to beware the plain-folks voices: They're quiet when it comes to such issues as dividend taxation and the difference between short-term and long-term capital-gains taxes, the generally wise strategy of funding tax-deductible retirement accounts, and diversification and asset-allocation decisions. The Beardstown Ladies, in the new Stitch-in-Time Guide to Growing Your Nest Egg, attempt to tackle some of these broader issues, but they prove neither savvy nor trustworthy. A chart listing precious metals, futures, and stocks as both high-risk and high-return investments is not only inaccurate but may lead to bad decisions.  <p> Even for those who want to concentrate on stock picking, these books are not the right place to start. The original Beardstown guide, its 172 pages on investing full of cute drawings and blank space, can be read in a couple of hours. But to beat the stock market, more than money and a couple of hours are required: Lots of time must be invested, too. Start with Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street, a great investing primer. Or try James Collins and Jerry Porras's best-seller, Built to Last, which analyzes long-term corporate winners. As a dividend bonus, you won't have to face any outrageous performance claims.  <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Investing<p>AN EASY ROUTE TO EXTRA RETURNS<p>By Andrew Feinberg<p>It's a simple strategy, but it works. Buy the ten stocks among the Dow Jones Industrials with the highest dividend yields each new year and hold them for 12 months. Since the end of 1928, this strategy has outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index by 2.8 percentage points a year. Granted, it didn't work wonders in 1995, generating a total return of 37 percent, which just matched the S&P 500's phenomenal 37.1 percent. Still, it outdistanced the average equity mutual fund by 5.9 percentage points, according to Lipper Analytical Services.<p>This success isn't a statistical quirk. Stocks offer juicy yields when they're out of favor because companies generally keep dividends steady even if the share price falls. Buying the ten highest-yielding Dow shares each year forces investors to ignore market sentiment and stick with a powerful, value-based, contrarian strategy, says Jim O'Shaughnessy, president of O'Shaughnessy Capital Management in Greenwich, Connecticut. This premium yield compensates investors when the market is down and when a stock is in the doghouse for a long time. <p>The strategy could be especially timely in 1996. The top-yielding Dow stocks often outperform the S&P index in market declines, says O'Shaughnessy. In 1973, for example, the S&P 500 lost 14.66 percent, but the high-yielders gained 3.88 percent.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Investing<p>THE 60-MINUTE ROCKET SCIENTIST
Tips for turning your computer into a high-powered investing tool.<p>By Jim Jubak<p>Software that analyzes stocks, bonds, and mutual funds has made the most powerful and complex mathematical tools of Wall Street's market wizards accessible to any investor willing to fork over the cost of a program. The right on-line sites and the best electronic news sources can keep investors a jump ahead of the crowd for less than the cost of a subscription to The Wall Street Journal. But the easy availability of all this information__performance data on 6,000 mutual funds, fundamentals on 7,000 stocks,earnings estimates from every analyst on Wall Street, and much more__has turned the individual investor's traditional dilemma inside out. Once, the problem was a lack of information; now investors risk being overwhelmed.<p>I spent the better part of two years sorting through the options and issues__all of which shifted on me repeatedly__and I've emerged from my explorations with The Worth Guide to Electronic Investing: Everything You Need to Know to Use Your Home Computer to Make More Money in the Stock Market. My goal in writing this book (to be published in May by HarperBusiness) is to help investors ferret out the best data and combine them into sound investment strategies. I ran hundreds of programs on my computer (more than a hundred are reviewed in the book), spent time on all the on-line services, and visited too many Internet sites to count. Here, adapted from that book, are some of the most important things I learned:<p>*SUBVERT THE SYSTEM. Remember that the user, not the software, sets the rules. For example, Reuters Money Network (called WealthBuilder in the Macintosh version) comes with a setup routine that is so cumbersome and annoying that many users will stuff the program back into its box__which would be too bad, because this is one of the best programs around for both beginners and more experienced investors. But you can bypass the setup, even if you don't know a hard drive from a bagel. Just head for the "expert" option, which appears after about four screens on which the program asks for details about portfolios, income, and expenses.<p>Skip that__it will take days. Choose "expert," set up the modem, enter a few preferences, and download stock quotes, news stories, and fundamentals on stocks and funds. (From Reality Online, 800-346-2024; $24.95 for Windows, $49.99 for Macintosh; monthly memberships for $12.95 or $19.95.)<p>*DON'T BE AFRAID TO PUT PROGRAMS TO UNEXPECTED USES. Academic research shows that most investment return is a result of the asset class an investor picks rather than specific asset choices in that class. But it's hard to find an easy-to-use, inexpensive program that will break a portfolio into asset classes and calculate returns from each. A simple trick can turn the newest versions of Quicken (version 5 for Windows, version 6 for Macintosh) to just this task. When an investor enters a new stock or other asset into a Quicken portfolio, the program asks for the type and goal of each asset__offering default answers such as stock, bond, etc., and college, retirement, etc. Instead of using the default terms for type, use the "new" command to write in the names of the specific asset classes you want to track: income, large-cap growth, etc. Then, in the program's "portfolio view," tell Quicken to group assets by type. The program will automatically calculate the percentage of the portfolio in each asset class and apply simple performance measures such as percentage gain. Investors can use the goal menu simultaneously to track assets by, for example, industry. Fill in the sector for each asset and use "portfolio view" to group assets by goal. (From Intuit, 800-816-8025; $39.95 for disk versions, $59.95 for CD-ROM; Windows and Macintosh.)<p>*BE AMBITIOUS. Many investors use software to track the performance of the stocks and mutual funds they own. Why stop there? Use the computer's facility for comparing alternative investments to set up a shadow portfolio that tracks stocks on your wish list. This gives you a feel for price trends and volatility. Users can also keep a folder of news on stocks to assemble dossiers on management and strategy. Programs such as Dow Jones News/Retrieval Private Investor Edition can set up several different portfolios (and easily update the price of each issue) and provide a steady flow of investment news. Another option is Stock Investor from the American Association of Individual Investors. It can create a targeted shadow portfolio. That is, an investor can design a portfolio called, say, "Motorola" that will consist of high-technology stocks that might replace a stake in <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>"Motorola"</b></a> . Fill this portfolio by creating a screen based on factors crucial to the stock's success. For example, use Motorola's current growth rate and return on equity to search for companies that do better on those measures__and Intel will pop up. (From Dow Jones Business Information Services, 800-815-5100; $29.95 a month; Windows and Macintosh. American Association of Individual Investors, 800-428-2244; $150 a year for nonmembers, $99 for members; DOS and Windows.)<p>*EXPLORE THE FUTURE. It's fairly simple to create quick and dirty versions of the "what if" models used on Wall Street to test what would happen to a security if interest rates went up or the economy sputtered. Stock Analyst from Quant IX Software can portray the risk and reward of an investment under different economic scenarios. First, plug in such basic economic variables as the current inflation rate and the yield on three-month Treasurys. Then add projections of a company's earnings and dividends. Stock Analyst will value the company's stock. Now, suppose the company is a utility.Keep the company's fundamentals constant and change the economic variables to see how hard the stock would be hit by a rise in interest rates. Or say it's a growth company.Keep the economic factors steady and change earnings to see how vulnerable the stock might be to an economic slowdown. (Quant IX Software, 800-247-6354; $69; DOS; Windows scheduled for late 1996.)<p>*APITCUTE IS WORTH A THOUSAND COLUMNS OF NUMBERS. The opening graph of the Stock Selection Guide from the National Association of Investors is the single-best fundamental tool I've seen for grasping the character of a growth stock. That's because it uses pictures instead of words to capture a stock's essence__and then, unlike a paper chart, allows an investor to visualize alternative futures. For example, what could better characterize a stock such as <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a> than the rock-solid line that graphs the company's sales for the last ten years? It climbs at a steady 15.9 percent a year from 1988 through the present with hardly a quiver. Just as revealing is that the more erratic earnings line moves well above the historic trend in the three most recent quarters. This graph poses the crucial investment question succinctly: Will the stock price follow the ten-year historical earnings trend or reflect the new, higher growth rate of the last few quarters? By drawing and then redrawing the graph, with a few clicks of a mouse, an investor can create charts of five-year earnings projections or see if Hewlett-Packard has ever matched its recent rocket-like growth. (National Association of Investors, 810-583-6242; $69 for nonmembers, $49 for members; Windows and Macintosh.)<p>*COMPUTERS ARE A GODSEND FOR THE MATH-PHOBIC. The McGraw-Hill Pocket Guide to Business Finance contains all the formulas that bedevil investors. But its use requires reading strange mathematical squiggles and using a pocket calculator. Now this book has been turned into a software program, the McGraw-Hill Financial Analyst, so all an investor has to do is "turn" to the work sheet that best fits the case at hand, type in the numbers, and hit the return key. The 201 formulas calculate everything from the required return on an investment to the future value of a stock with growing dividends. (McGraw-Hill, 800-722-4726; $69.95; Windows.)<p>*BUT NEVER TAKE A PROGRAM'S WORD FOR IT. Many stock-screening programs let an investor compare companies to competitors by sorting stocks with a Standard Industrial Code number. That can be misleading. For example, the SIC numbers in Morningstar's U.S. Equities program erroneously lump Hewlett-Packard, which makes computers, printers, and test equipment for engineers, with Pitney Bowes, which makes postage meters and mailing systems. Both companies, the program says, are in SIC 3570, the category for "manufacturing machinery computer equipment."<p>Fortunately, investors can use the same software to set a benchmark for an industry. In the retail sector, for example, pick an upscale store to track margins against, or a thriving established store with which to compare same-store sales. Add some retailers popular with Wall Street analysts, since they will be comparing any retailer to those favorites. Skim analysts' buy recommendations electronically from sources such as Standard & Poor's. Download the fundamentals on four or five companies into a single file to pull up when examining enticing retail possibilities. (Morningstar, 800-876-5005; $145 annually with quarterly updates; DOS only.)<p>

Worth magazine/Features<p>Q & A: THE BUSINESS OF DOING GOOD
Bill Shore, of Share Our Strength, turned hunger in America into a business, and charitable giving into a service industry. <p>By Larissa MacFarquhar<p>In 1984, Bill Shore founded the anti-hunger organization Share Our Strength on the paradoxical premise that a charity should be run like a business. <p>Shore, 40, a former congressional staffer who worked for Senators Gary Hart and Bob Kerrey, thought a charity should try to meet donors' needs, as well as the other way around. This strategy has driven SOS's growth from an organization with an annual budget of $30,000 to one with a budget of $16 million and roughly 50 employees today. Meanwhile its collaboration with <a name="NYSE:AXP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10085"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Express</b></a> has made SOS the best-known anti-hunger group in the country. Larissa MacFarquhar spoke with Shore about his organization.<p>WORTH: What prompted you to create Share Our Strength?
BILL SHORE: The Ethiopian famine in late 1984, which made me want to complement the work I was doing in government with something more hands-on in the private sector.
The idea was to build a charitable organization that not only redistributed wealth but created new wealth. I didn't want to be just another charity fighting for its little slice of the pie. <p>Why not?
Most nonprofits are trying to accomplish very difficult tasks with that tiny portion of the financial universe that consists of what's left over: the money you and I and businesses donate at the end of the year. That makes about as much sense as trying to get a truck up to the top of a hill by asking people to push it a little bit on their way home from work rather than building it an engine. Nonprofits need to build reliable moneymaking engines that fuel their efforts, because all the charitable intentions in the world aren't enough to solve big problems like hunger. <p>What is SOS's engine?
One of our most profitable projects has been a series of food-and-wine tastings called Taste of the Nation. The first year we did it, 1988, it raised $252,000; last year it cleared $4.1 million. We'd been contacting chefs and restaurateurs, and realized they'd be happier to participate in a food-and-wine benefit that cost them $800 than to send us a check for $50 once a year. <p>Why the resistance to donating cash? 
I think people are looking for a way to feel connected to an organization, and looking for a way to contribute something that nobody else could. If the National Kidney Foundation asked me to contribute $5,000, I'd probably say no. But if they said, We know you used to be a swimmer in high school, would you referee a swimming event for us?, I'd probably say yes__that would be fun. People involved with SOS feel connected to us and usually become donors without us even asking. <p>How did Taste of the Nation come to be sponsored by American Express?
A few restaurant-industry people knew the company was having difficulty getting restaurants to accept their card because they charge a higher transaction fee than MasterCard or Visa. They came to us and said, It would be beneficial for you two to become partners; restaurants would respect American Express for being involved with SOS, and SOS would benefit if American Express became a sponsor of Taste of the Nation. So American Express began paying a sponsorship fee in the neighborhood 
of $500,000. <p>And that led to your Charge Against Hunger program?
Right. American Express said, Let's think about doing something larger, [and] we worked out what would become Charge Against Hunger: American Express agreed to donate three cents to SOS every time the card was used in the last two months of the year, up to $5 million. For the three years we've done it, it has added up to about that. Also, Amex is getting an increasing number of merchants to match the contribution when the card is used in their stores. So the total will be $6 million or $6.5 million this year.<p>Could other charities replicate your approach? 
I think a lot can. Somebody told me the American Heart Association is considering lending its name and logo to medical products. The key is to build up the value of your name and establish a constituency that respects and feels connected to what you're doing. <p>Where do you get the remaining $7 million of your annual budget?
The visibility we get with American Express has helped us build relationships with a slew of companies. We've worked out an arrangement with Gallo and with Fetzer, for instance, where they give us $10 or so for every case of particular wines they sell to certain restaurants. The idea is that if a Fetzer and a Beringer chardonnay are about the same in price and quality, restaurateurs involved with us will buy the Fetzer. <p>We've also created a few products: fiction anthologies, children's stories, cookbooks, sweatshirts. Many top chefs would love to help us develop a line of food products, but we're proceeding cautiously with that because it would require up-front outlays of cash and be considerably more risky than licensing our logo.<p>If you sold a line of products, would you lose your nonprofit status and have to pay taxes?
Possibly, but I would welcome that. It would validate that we're creating wealth. I've felt for some time that the distinction between "for-profit" and "nonprofit" has become outmoded. There are what I call community-wealth enterprises: for-profit companies that give their profits back to the community. Paul Newman's company, Newman's Own, is a great example. After taxes, it donates 100 percent of profits to charity. <p>How does SOS spend its money?
When people think of a hunger organization, they think of getting food to people. That's a necessary task, and we do it, but it's a low-impact strategy for creating lasting change. So we give grants to organizations that work to affect policy at federal and state levels__like the Food Research and Action Center here in Washington. <p>We fund research at Tufts University's Center on Hunger, Poverty, and Nutrition Policy on the link between nutrition and cognitive development in children. We give money to failure-to-thrive clinics that treat kids with malnutrition. 
The Boston City Hospital's Grow Clinic, for instance, we give about $50,000 a year. We give about $450,000 a year to New York's Children's Health Fund: They drive health-care vans to welfare hotels and shelters, and treat homeless kids for malnutrition and other things. Last year we gave $300,000 to a Native American nutrition project at Johns Hopkins University. <p>And we give grants to food banks. They store surplus food from producers like Kraft or Nabisco and redistribute it. They use our funds for warehousing and transportation. <p>The fact is, the hardest work at SOS now is not raising money but spending it so that it not only helps people now but puts them in a position where they're not going to need more help in the future. <p>Does your charity-as-business philosophy extend to staff salaries? 
We hired a consulting firm [that] surveyed similar organizations and determined for each position the low, high, and midpoint salary. They advised us that if we were interested in keeping staff we should set our salaries between 80 and 100 percent of the midpoint. That's what we've tried to do. The problem is we're still not competitive with for-profits. <p>What does the future hold for SOS?
We need to expand into other industries. People who work in finance, sales, advertising, or public relations could be enormously valuable to us as consultants or as members of our board. And there is potential in the most unlikely places. I just met with one of the more successful real-estate agents in Rochester, New York, and she's developed a program in which the parties to a transaction__the brokers, the attorneys__each contribute $10 to an organization that works with homelessness. She figured out that if everybody involved in a real-estate transaction in this country gave $10, it would raise something like $377 million a year. If only 5 percent of those people got involved, it would still be a lot of money. <p>How large will SOS become? 
One of my biggest gripes with the nonprofit community is that it tends to think small. We've got to build a much, much bigger effort if we want to make a dent in the fact that 39 million people live in poverty. One of the ironies is that the better we do our job, the more ammunition we provide people who believe that the government doesn't need to be involved in fighting poverty. But look at the numbers: $16 million a year makes us a very large anti-hunger organization, but the federal government spends $40 billion a year just on food-assistance programs. There's no way organizations like ours could ever come close to replacing that.<p>

Worth magazine/Features<p>VEGAS CALLING
At last, the Hard Rock Casino gives the people what they want: cooler music to lose money by.<p>By Elizabeth Royte<p>On a sunny Tuesday afternoon in Sin City, to the tune of ringing slot machines and tumbling dice, I learn that 1,564,898,299 acres of Amazonian rain forest remain unmolested by the logger's saw and the farmer's torch. At a craps table, a large man behind a tiny nose ring cries out, "Roll it, Baby," then roars in delight as Baby makes him $50 richer.<p>My information about the natural world comes from an electronic ticker over five slot machines, whose drop the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino will donate to Conservation International and the Natural Resources Defense Council. Unfortunately, these socially responsible slot machines host not a single gambler. "Rain-forest acres?" says a croupier when I ask if anyone plays the machines. "I thought that ticker was a jackpot. I never noticed the numbers were going down." No matter, really. Nearly every other seat in the house is full, and the expandable coffers of Peter Morton, the genius behind the Hard Rock restaurant empire, continue to fill.<p>That a casino today even nods to social consciousness surely signals a brave new Las Vegas. Morton calls his latest venture, which opened last spring, "Vegas for a New Generation." He means this literally__his hotel targets gamblers between the ages of 21 and 45, as opposed to the industry median of 46__and he means it metaphorically, in the sense that old-generation gamblers prefer to take their camp without irony and their losses without a backbeat.<p>The Hard Rock is an experiment in niche marketing, a way for Morton's Hard Rock America to get a piece of the $40 billion gambling industry. As gambling's legal and moral constraints disappear across the country, a new, younger audience will surely emerge. Morton is betting that rock and roll, that hoary marketing device, will lure this segment of the market away from all the other casinos__as well as the riverboats, racetracks, and lotteries__and into his hotel. But will the kids buy into it, or will the Hard Rock be recognized as yet another Vegas theme park, designed to distract while the corporate hand separates a fool from his money?<p>Subtlety is unknown in Las Vegas, and the Hard Rock does not break tradition. A 90-foot Fender guitar looms over the porte cochere. Tom Petty wails "Runaway Train" into the parking lot. A giant inscription over the hotel's front door reads, when this house is rockin', don't bother knockin'. Inside, the Sex Pistols set the tone: the only notes that matter come in wads.<p>Things are clearly spelled out, you have to give Morton that. This is the casino that rock built, and I, a music lover with some disposable income, should be the ideal customer. I'm old enough not to roll my eyes at Tom Petty but still contrarian enough, in the classic rock-and-roll sense, to put the establishment through its paces, to make it win me over. Thus the inscription over the registration desk: here we are now entertain us__lyrics by the late Kurt Cobain of Nirvana. It's a simple acknowledgment of roles. I am the human target, and the Hard Rock will be working 24-7 to nail me.<p>I stroll around the grounds until I feel at home. The circular casino lies at the center of the hotel, surrounded by a sports and race book, restaurant, bar, cashier's cage, registration desk, and concert hall. Among the impedimenta of gambling, I note the guitars of Stevie Ray Vaughan, Pearl Jam, Soul Asylum, Chris Isaak, Depeche Mode, Guns n' Roses, R.E.M. I study the costumes of Madonna, Chrissie Hynde, the Cranberries, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and the leather jackets of any mainstream rocker you can think of.<p>Over my head hangs a chandelier made of 32 gold-plated saxophones; Zildjian cymbals cover the lighting fixtures in the hallways; atop groupings of slot machines, many of which use the necks of actual Fender Stratocaster guitars for handles, sit Elton John's rhinestone-covered piano from his "Bitch" tour, a drum kit from John Densmore of the Doors, a Harley-Davidson, and a red '59 Corvette convertible. It looks just like a Hard Rock restaurant, but more spread out. "The principles of marketing to diners and gamblers are the same," Morton tells me later from his office in Los Angeles. "The Hard Rocks are museums of rock and roll. We're succeeding here because, for Las Vegas, this is a totally unique and different product."<p>Indeed, no other gambling emporium has spent a million-plus on a sound system that pumps music nonstop into the casino, elevators, restaurants, gym, and even the pool, underwater. The music is programmed by modem each day from Hard Rock America's corporate headquarters in Los Angeles, and the songs on the six 300-disc CD players repeat as seldom as every three weeks.<p>I can't say I hate the music:I hear David Bowie's "Let's Dance," the Beach Boys' "California Girls," the Pretenders' "Back on the Chain Gang"__all nice songs. But I can't help noticing that this is just the shiny, happy side of rock and roll. I suppose that if I were running an amusement park I'd avoid anything edgy and dark, too. But the Hard Rock has staked its reputation on a certain hipness, and as night falls I'm still hoping to find it.<p>Instead I meet a mustachioed septuagenarian sliding down the inside of elevator number two (the writing on the wall: don't let the elevator bring you down__Prince). He's been here three days, he's up $15,000, and he's a little wired after two days without sleep. "I love the music, I wish they'd turn it up!" he shouts at me. "You don't mind losing so much if you're boppin' to the music." Boppin'? I wish him luck and hurry to the caf.<p>Ken, 45, a high-rolling blackjack player, is enjoying a late-night tuna steak. "The decor doesn't matter to me at all," he says. "I like this place because it's upbeat, the staff and the gamblers are young, and they're more personable than at other casinos. This town really needed a place like this. You can only take so much Frank Sinatra."<p>Morton would be pleased: Ken pushed most of the buttons. But Ken is 45, and he wouldn't know Alice in Chains from Alice Kramden. It's just a happy accident that Morton's demographic net hauls in people like Ken who dig the youth scene and enjoy playing the big fish in a little pond__elder, high-rolling statesmen to those guppies testing the waters at the table games. At most casinos, the slot machines get the most play, but at the Hard Rock, younger gamblers lean toward the more complex games:craps, roulette, and blackjack. Someone has to teach them how to play, and people like Ken are happy to oblige.<p>I turn to Andre, who's dabbing tiny spots of butter onto his baked potato. "I came to the Hard Rock for the food," he says almost defensively. "My parents like those other places, where you pay $3.95 for prime rib, but I like to know where my fat is coming from." I almost laugh aloud. Andre, who fits the demo seamlessly, gambles at the Hard Rock not because he likes the music, or is taken by the decor, or thinks the cocktail waitresses look cute in their leopard hot pants, but because here he can count calories. "And the memorabilia?" I ask. Andre sighs. "Everywhere I go," he says, "they've got the shirt Hendrix wore in Monterey."<p>Andre heads for the gym, and I watch Ken lay down $500 and $1,000 bets on the purple baize of the blackjack table, trying to recoup $40,000 from yesterday's excitement. We switch tables once to escape three noisy, drunken brothers. I'm mesmerized by the speed of the dealers' hands, the terrible outflow of cash. Busty waitresses bring us sodas. I stay nearly two hours without thinking of moving.<p>Casinos trade in illusion, all of it formulaic. The lights are low, mirrors abound, sight lines are short, exits are disguised__the better to keep at bay hints of time and space beyond the gambling floor. At giant showplaces such as the Flamingo, the Mirage, or Caesars__where the casino floor is 117,000 square feet, as opposed to the Hard Rock's 30,000__every detail reminds the patrons that they're gambling, from the flashing lights and Sinatra to the rich colors and outlandish costumes. But at the Hard Rock, the iconography of Vegas is largely absent. The floors are hardwood, the air is smoke-free, and desert sunlight streams through the foyers. The only thing vulgar about the place is that it's here at all.<p>The clientele is atypical for Vegas as well. Perhaps the hotel is too upscale for Vegas hoi polloi, with its $22 steaks and, the week I was there, only one $5 blackjack table. The morning sees its share of elderly people in shell suits, but as the day wanes, so does the median age. Still, the casino isn't exactly larded with hipsters in black leather. The only person I meet who'd look out of place in a Gap ad is an angrily unemployed construction worker who sits at the bar for two days straight, talking in staccato bursts about nothing, furiously punching a poker machine, and nursing glasses of cranberry juice.<p>Because of legal gambling's peculiar calculus__a lot comes in and very little goes out__you'd expect operators to avoid reminding patrons that they're probably going to lose. While other casinos and state lotteries hype the good life that lies beyond the next roll of the dice, the Hard Rock consistently nods to loss. The five-dollar chips are stamped with a line from the Red Hot Chili Peppers: give it away. A foyer is inlaid with the lyrics from the Eagles' "Desperado": don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy, she'll beat you when she's able. <p>That's a refreshing bit of honesty, I thought at first. But really, the quote wouldn't be there if it didn't work, if the marketing experts hadn't determined that it would spur the target group to gamble even more.<p>With all this quoting about, I think I might turn a corner to see Beck's i'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me? in ten-inch letters. But that might, finally, be going too far, reminding patrons of gambling's enormous social costs. If the Hard Rock has any qualms about glamorizing gambling for the younger generation, they're not in evidence. "Our research shows that young people love to go to rock-and-roll concerts and gamble," Morton tells me. "Our target audience is a 30-year-old yuppie who drives a BMW convertible and goes to Bruce Springsteen shows."<p>Bruce isn't there to wince at this, so Ido it on his behalf. But the more important point is that Morton is creating a powerful lure for yuppies-in-training as well, and may be contributing to a nationwide rate of pathological gambling among high-school and college-age youth that's double that of adults. After leaving the casino, I poke around the scientific literature and learn that gambling is the fastest-growing teenage addiction in the country. Not only is there a plethora of new ways to gamble__more states now have lotteries than don't, and it recently became possible to gamble via modem on the computer__but many of these new institutions and opportunities lack adult gatekeepers. Naturally, the Hard Rock does all it can to exclude minors, but it also does all it can to attract them__from booking Sheryl Crow in the Joint, the hotel's 1,400-seat club, to cultivating a nonstop party atmosphere. <p>Morton, a 60 percent owner of the hotel, and Harveys Casino Resorts, with 40 percent, spent $100 million building this youth magnet. Hard Rock America is privately held and won't divulge how much money the hotel is making, but Morton will say it's on track to produce revenues of $100 million in its first year. <p>"We're substantially ahead of projections," he says. The Hard Rock's retail store, which hawks mugs, T-shirts, beach towels, bath gel, key rings, teddy bears, water bottles, and golf balls to an apparently logo-starved constituency, reportedly takes in $80,000 a day__75 percent ahead of forecasts. Each day, the hotel turns down 300 requests for weekend stays. Things are going so well that Morton plans to expand the place next year, to a total of 700 rooms.<p>My second night at the casino I retire at 1 a.m. but wake when my neighbors bounce into their room at 5:30. Their giggling drives me nuts__are they rolling in dough? I call security on them. Then I put the do-not-disturb sign on my door, noting that it reads, i hear ya knockin' but ya can't come in. This is starting to get to me. <p>It turns out__and no one should be surprised__that rock lyrics make beautiful ad copy for casinos. Morton didn't need to hire writers to promote his hotel; the lines are already there, in classic songs about loss and risk and bright lights and sex and money and gambling. A hotel brochure is broken into segments: "Back in the High Life" touts the restaurant; "Welcome to the Hotel California" extols the swimming pool; "My Momma Told Me, You Gotta Shop Around" describes the wonders of the retail store. Morton knows his guests don't feel pandered to when he turns songs into slogans. They feel flattered. They can sing every reference. <p>Ever since Phil Collins outraged his fans by singing "Tonight, Tonight, Tonight" for Michelob, marketers have exploited rock and roll to reach their target audience__upwardly mobile youth unencumbered by mortgages and tuition. David Bowie stumps for Schweppes; Janis Joplin, from the grave, sells Mercedes-Benzes; the Beatles spurred the Nike Revolution. There have been some notable holdouts: Springsteen refused to let Ronald Reagan adopt "Born in the U.S.A." for his 1984 campaign, and R.E.M. wouldn't sell "It's the End of the World as We Know It" to hype Windows 95, despite a reported offer of several million dollars. These days, a band more often makes the news when it says no to an ad agency than when it says yes. <p>"Rock and roll has become corporate, but what can you do?" says Kevan, 25, sitting at the bar. "You shouldn't question it too much." The lead singer of an L. A. punk band, he's in town with a few mates from Scotland__rockers all. Kevan, from Leeds, England, wears a pink denim jacket, several earrings, and black sunglasses, which stick to his forehead through some sort of torsional force. He has shaved hash marks in his eyebrows; his beard is one thin stripe coming up from his chin and two thin stripes slanting across his cheeks. "The shaving is a real bitch," he tells me. <p>Kevan longs to sell out, once his band gets signed. He figures it's the natural progression. "As long as you still believe in what you do, selling out is okay," he says. "I want to make a ton of money." This young man is depressing me. Here he is, superficially the embodiment of punk anarchy__with his sissy pink jacket and his tattoos and his go-to-hell hair design__and all he wants is to walk in Peter Morton's shoes. "The Sex Pistols ripped everybody off," he says. "The Hard Rock casino is the rock-and-roll swindle all over again. It just makes me laugh." <p>He orders another rum and Coke, then lights a Marlboro. "You come to Vegas to lose money, drink, and have a good time. This place is just what you'd expect."
I sip my beer and consider Kevan's wisdom. I start to think he's right. What did I expect? The good people that surround me came to gamble, not have a significant cultural experience. This is Las Vegas, not Austin; it's a casino, for Chrissakes. As my next interview victim, a rock-loving 23-year-old, says to me, "We're being marketed to anyway, it might as well be rock and roll."
Iturn to Elizabeth, a perky 21-year-old wearing cropped hair and a striped T, and ask, "Do the words 'industry weasel' mean anything to you?"<p>I read in a newspaper that the Hard Rock is "relentlessly hip," and I couldn't tell at the time whether that was a compliment or a complaint. The sentiment, at any rate, misses the point. The hotel's idea of hip comes from a completely consumerist, top-down perspective. The jackets and guitars that festoon the casino weren't lovingly collected by fans but bought with more than $2 million of Morton's money by a full-time professional curator. If anybody's T-shirt was sweaty when purchased, it surely is no longer.<p>The Nirvana diorama makes a perfect metaphor for all that's been bothering me about this place. Here are Kurt Cobain's thermal shirt, his guitar, and his leather jacket. The front page of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, with news of Cobain's suicide, sits among photos of the band, amid a scattering of rocks and gravel. But there's nothing organic about any of this. Everything has been meticulously arranged to elicit a reaction. And I resist. Even the letters of tribute that fans have slid through cracks in the display case__a bit of wholly spontaneous fetishism__have been culled and rearranged in an artful tableau. "We take out the bad notes and leave the good ones," the hotel's marketing director tells me.
Finally Ithink I understand what Peter Morton is after. He doesn't just want to spark an emotional response; he wants to control it.<p>At long last, I spy a gambler at the rain-forest slots: Dominique, a woman in her late 30s. Black catsuit, white face, black bangs. When Dominique first heard of the Hard Rock, she says, "I thought it was pretentious and ridiculous, just another tax write-off for Peter Morton. I thought it would be a complete failure, that it would be filled with geriatrics from Ohio." But one night at about 3 a.m., when she had run out of luck at the Rio, she decided to stop by. She ordered a Coke with a cherry, and the waitress told her the Hard Rock didn't serve food with red dye. "I thought that was bogus at first," she says, "but now I think it's conscientious."<p>She's come around in other ways as well. "I assumed the Hard Rock was the land of young and good-looking people," she says. "In L.A., the place had a reputation for being stuck-up. I felt that attitude__that I wasn't pretty enough to be here. I was wrong. Everyone is friendly, the casino's small, and now it's one of my favorite spots." Dominique is playing the rain-forest slots because she's hoping for some grace from the gods of gambling. She feeds $100 into a machine__it takes less time than reading this paragraph__and rings up $150 in profits. She smiles as she scoops up her coins, then glances at the diminishing acres. "Do you think the ticker's going to speed up because I won?" she asks. <p>The ticker seems unaffected by anything__real or symbolic. The numbers just keep dropping, representing nothing but the idea of loss. Morton sits on the board of the Natural Resources Defense Council, and he gives that group and Conservation International more than $150,000 a year from his own pocket plus whatever the slots take in. By the time I leave the Hard Rock Hotel, the rain forest has 1,561,275,286 acres left__a drop of more than three and a half million in just three days. <p>I share a taxi to the airport with a young, intelligent, and music-obsessed software designer from San Francisco. "I think this is the coolest place in the world," he says. We creep past the flashing lights of the strip and discuss marketing strategies. We talk about what it's like to fit the demo. "I do feel targeted, yeah," he says, grinning. "They nailed it. And it doesn't bother me at all."<p>

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>GOING BANKLESS
Brokerages' super-accounts are crashing the banks' party.<p>By Jerry DeMuth<p>Returning to their Bergen County, New Jersey, home from a winter in Puerto Rico, Doris and Stanley Goldstein were faced with three months' worth of stock-dividend checks, credit-card and checking-account statements, two other bank accounts and two brokerage accounts to reconcile, and numerous fees and charges to make sense of. <p>"I told my husband, 'Something is wrong,' " says Doris Goldstein. Now the Goldsteins receive one monthly statement that lists all their activity__dividends received, interest earned, deposits, withdrawals, gold-card activity, and checks written. <p>The Goldsteins' account isn't at a bank__it's a Smith Barney Financial Management Account, one of numerous banking-type accounts available at brokerage firms, including Dean Witter, Dreyfus, Fidelity, <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>, Paine Webber, and Prudential. These accounts offer just about everything banks offer, even loans (based on margin borrowing). They also provide a range of investment choices__mutual funds, money-market accounts, tax-free funds, certificates of deposit, bonds, stocks, and other securities. <p>But only 1.3 percent of households with annual incomes of at least $24,000 use brokerage firms as their primary financial institution, according to USBanker magazine. That's probably because the accounts require hefty minimum balances, from $10,000 at Dreyfus and Fidelity to $20,000 at Merrill Lynch; for additional services, even higher minimums may be required. However, those balances can include securities as well as cash. <p>Brokerage bank accounts also lack federal oversight and FDICinsurance. But some, such as those at Fidelity and Smith Barney, are protected by private insurance. Annual fees range from a high of $100 at Merrill Lynch to zero under some conditions at Fidelity. There may also be fund-transfer fees and a charge for printed checks. But check writing is free, and the $500 minimum once standard with brokerage money-market accounts has disappeared.<p>Dean Witter, 800-869-3326; Dreyfus, 800-377-2200; Fidelity, 800-544-6262; Merrill Lynch, call your local branch; PaineWebber, 800-762-1000; Prudential, 800-222-4321; Smith Barney, 800-634-9855.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>BACK IN THE BLEACHERS
Baseball springs eternal in Florida and Arizona<p>By Rudy Maxa<p>It happens every March in Florida and Arizona, and it's called spring training. Well, it doesn't happen every March: Last year's labor turmoil delayed and curtailed the spring season, but this year, things are back on schedule. Through the entire month of March, the major-league teams have games slated almost every day against one another. Tickets for some hot clubs, such as the American League champion Cleveland Indians and the defending World Series champion Atlanta Braves, could be hard to get for weekend games, but seats for most teams should be readily available. <p>Florida is still the spring-training capital, though eight teams__most of the western squads, plus the Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago Cubs__call Arizona's Cactus League their spring home. The other 20 teams prepare for the regular season in Florida, mostly in towns along the coasts. The easiest way to find out where each team plays, and to get maps to all of the stadiums, ticket information, and game schedules, is to pick up a copy of Spring Training Baseball Yearbook, a 116-page magazine available each February at Barnes &Noble, B. Dalton, and larger newsstands around the country. <p>Spring training was discovered as a vacation hot spot five or ten years ago, says Myles Friedman, the editor of the annual publication. "But it's still very intimate, with ballparks that seat between 6,000 and 10,000," he says. "That's compared to a major-league stadium that seats between 40,000 and 60,000." This intimacy makes it much easier for fans to get autographs from their favorites and even chat with a player now and then over a fence.<p>If you just want to drop in on a team in Florida or Arizona and catch a game or two, check out Spring Training for the team or town of your choice. Each listing provides all the pertinent information on the games; prices range from $4 for bleacher seats to $18 for box seats, and many tickets can be secured through national ticket agencies. <p>But if you really want to savor baseball, if total immersion with like-minded fans is your idea of a great way to spend a week, then you should talk to Russ Everett of Broach Sports Tours in Charlotte, North Carolina. From March 24 to 30, Broach runs a rolling baseball fest whose participants depart Charlotte on a luxury European motor coach for the 13-hour drive (with rest stops every two hours) to Florida. The tour touches all the bases in the Grapefruit League, starting with Dodgertown in Vero Beach, winding through Baseball City, St. Petersburg, Clearwater, and Fort Myers before ending in Tampa. Fans see 13 teams spread over seven games (the tour hits the New York Mets twice), including the Indians versus the Toronto Blue Jays in Winter Haven. On the way back to Charlotte, the bus stops in Atlanta for an exhibition game between the Braves and the Boston Red Sox.<p>The cost for the whole enchilada is $469 per person, based on double occupancy, or $625 for a single traveler. (The tour company can pair you with someone, if you prefer.) If taking a bus from Charlotte to Florida and back isn't your idea of fun, you can meet the group in Florida and just participate in the six days of baseball for about $100 less. Call 704-333-9191 for details.<p>Included in the price: all lodging, game tickets, and transportation. Not included: beer, hot dogs, peanuts, and Cracker Jack. <p><p>

						March 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> THE DAY OFF THAT PAYS OFF <p>You know all the little financial things that you should have taken care of by now but never got around to? Today's the day. <p> By Ken Kurson  <p> Everyone's done it: received a phone bill and wondered if it wasn't way higher than it had to be, paid a year's life-insurance premium and wondered if the insurer would survive until the policy was due, charged a big purchase yesterday and been stung by the interest payment today. Putting your financial house in order can be summarized in three words it's a drag. But here's an idea: Play hooky and spend one day doing all the little things you've been putting off for too long. No, it won't free you to ignore your finances for the rest of the year, but the little program outlined below should give you a day that's productive without being painful.  <p>  Here's what you need to get started: <p>*The most recent bill, statement, or policy from the five facets of your financial life you're going to tackle today. <p>*The White Pages and Yellow Pages. <p>*A Touch-Tone phone you'll reach so many phone trees it'll feel like Arbor Day. <p>* A book of cross word puzzles. Nothing beats a puzzle to combat the boredom of being put on hold and you'll already have the pen in your hand. <p>*A magnifying glass. Sometimes the details on insurance policies, bank statements, and credit-card bills really are in fine print. <p> If you do your work well, we'll provide a few suggestions along the way for rewarding yourself for addressing the various tesserae of your financial mosaic. Ready? Begin.  <p> Banking Rule No. 1: Keep your monthly bank statements. Rule No. 2: Organize them. Rule No. 3: Analyze them.  <p> First, find the part of your statement that lists the fees and expenses. (If you've broken rule No. 1, you can obtain copies from your bank, usually at no charge.) It's no surprise that these fees have been rising. For example, say you deposit a check that someone wrote to you, only to discover that the check writer had insufficient funds to cover the amount. In 1993, the percentage of banks that tacked a fee onto that already annoying situation was 65.5. By 1994, the number had jumped to 81.7. (Thrifts were even sterner, going from 71.2 percent to 93.5 percent.) At anaverage fee of $6.89 ($8.36 for thrifts), it's the kind of thing that can easily wipe out a month's return on an interest-bearing checking account.  <p> Beware of strict minimums, too. Part of the reason you need this day of financial house cleaning is that you don't like to sweat the details on a daily basis. So if keeping an eagle eye on every cent you spend to avoid dipping below the minimum isn't your idea of time well spent, you're bound to incur a charge every now and then. It should concern you and prompt you to consider moving your business if your account costs more than the industry average. Some salient averages: monthly checking charges, $6.14 ($5.58 at thrifts); transactions at another institution's ATM,95 cents a piece; stop-payment requests, $13.29; overdrafts, $14.92.  <p> Armed with your statements, you shouldn't have trouble finding an institution with a pricing structure that matches the way you do business. As always, there's no harm in asking your bank to provide incentives for you to keep your account there including waiving a stop-payment fee or overdraft charge now and again, though you shouldn't count on going to that particular well too often. (For information on consolidating your banking and brokerage accounts, see "Going Bankless," page 126.)  <p> Ready for a treat yet? Some superstation is bound to be showing The Lucy Show or The Beverly Hillbillies. Kick back for a few moments and let Mr. Mooney and Mr. Drysdale boost your confidence in the people looking after your money.  <p> Credit What you should have learned already is that the way to get something from a financial provider is to call up and ask for it. Banks are often willing to lower their credit-card rates and fees for good customers (you haven't missed a payment lately, right?). Your current issuer will probably match the best rates you've been offered.  <p> Nothing shook up the staid but profitable business of credit like the announcement in September 1992 that <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> wasteaming with Household Bank to offer rebates of 5 percent ofall charges toward the purchase or lease of a GM car. And nowcards are being tied to everything from computers (<a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple</b></a>) to beer (the Coors Extra Gold Card).  <p> If only these cool cards weren't such rotten deals. The dirty little secret of the credit business is that the interest rates on rebate cards average about 5 percentage points higher than those of the best non-rebate cards. "The interest rate is the bottom line," says Robert McKinley, the president of RAM Research Group, which tracks the credit-card industry. "Most premium or rebate cards charge 9 to 12 points over prime. That's just way too much."   <p> Suppose, for example, you carry a balance of $3,000 and charge $400 per month. Since a typical rebate card will award benefits equal to 1 percent of the amount charged, the $4,800 you spend annually on new charges entitles you to a refund of $48. But the extra 5 percent on your $3,000 balance will cost you $150. In other words, you lose $102.  <p> Rebate cards, then, are useful almost solely for cardholders who never carry a balance. Even for these people they're questionable, because rebate cards often come with high annual fees. When you call for the details on a rebate program that interests you, be sure to inquire about the annual fee, and don't be afraid to ask that it be waived or that the interest rate be lowered. <p> If you're still curious about rebate cards (and for some people,they do work beautifully), you can subscribe to Rebate Credit Cards, a quarterly newsletter from RAM, for $39, or you can get a recent sample copy for $10 (see "The Day's Directory," page125). It's not what you'd call a light read, but the information is comprehensive and clearly presented.  <p> It's now midday. For a credit-card story over lunch, rent the Brat Pack schlock favorite St. Elmo's Fire: Demi Moore impresses her friends with all the super cool furniture she bought with plastic until a series of missed payments brings the repo man a-calling.  <p> LIFE Insurance Take a look at your current life-insurance policy, where you'll find the name and location of your insurer, among other fundamental details. Scores of insurers, even those with big names, fail each year, and getting your money back (for a cash-value policy or an annuity) from a defunct company is a big hassle not to mention costly, since state insurance regulators typically allow those claims to be paid off at 80 to 90 cents on the dollar. So investigate the rating of your insurance company.  <p> Simply call the company's toll-free number, identify yourself as a policyholder, and ask for a recent report card, which is generally free. Or if you bought from an independent agent, make him or her earn some of that fat commission. "Your agent can get all of a company's ratings and send them to you, unabridged and without the insurer's editorializing," says Mark White, a vice president on the insurance side of Jack White & Co., a San Diego discount brokerage and insurance dealer. "Any professional agent ought to have that information at his fingertips."   <p> While you have your agent on the phone, ask about commissions. Agents, unsurprisingly, tend to recommend the products that pay them the highest commissions. Moreover, unlike the load on a mutual fund or the interest rate on a credit card, both of which the government requires be disclosed in a standard format, commissions on insurance typically remain unknown to consumers. <p>Don't be shy about asking an agent what he or she is being paid for selling you a policy. Commissions generally amount to 50 percent of the first year's premium on a cash-value policy (that is, whole, universal, or variable these cover 80 percent of the life-insurance universe), and 10 percent of each year's premiums on property-and-casualty policies, according to Jeff Yates, executive vice president of Independent Insurance Agents of America. Beware if your agent is getting more, and remember that in some states negotiating for a partial rebate of commissions is possible. <p> If you have a cash-value policy, your agent or insurer can provide a little-known but valuable document called an in-force ledger. This is basically a score card that shows the exact cash value of your policy and projects that value into the future. Some agents automatically send these statements, but there's a good chance you haven't been getting yours.  <p> Another important piece of paper to have is your medical-information file sort of a medical credit report. The file lists any health problems that may affect your rates or eligibility for life and health insurance, so you'll want to make sure it's accurate and up to date. The Medical Information Bureau will send you one for eight dollars.  <p> Breaktime: Check the TV guide for Double Indemnity, insurance's finest moment on film, which seems to be rebroadcast on cable just about weekly.  <p> Long Distance The skirmish for your long-distance dollar has taken to the television screen with a fierceness that would make Ed Rollins blush. The big three <a name="NYSE:FON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11560"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sprint</b></a>, <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a> will promise virtually any dowry should you choose to take them as your mate. They will even offer to let "those other companies" know that you're satisfied with the service you're getting and don't want to be bothered by solicitations to jump ship.  <p> With so much pressure being brought to bear, what's a person playing hooky for a day to do? First, gather your last three phone bills. Count the number of interstate long-distance calls made and calculate their average duration. Consider the time of day you tend to dial, and note how many of your calls reach foreign ears.  <p> Now you're ready to let your fingers do the walking. "Call your carrier rep and say, Here are the calls I make, what's the best you can do for me?' " says Lynne Butler, senior analyst at Market Dynamics, a Bethesda, Maryland, company that publishes the newsletter Long Distance for Less.  <p> A favored ruse of the long-distance slugfest is to offer promotions that promise a reward for switching from one's current carrier. That you may be satisfied with your current provider is no reason to miss out on the 50 bucks or better yet, to get paid for not switching. Go ahead and call your carrier to see if it will match the deal. Chances are it will, shrewdly spreading the rebate over several months to ensure your continued devotion.  <p> AT&T is generally a shade pricier than Sprint and MCI, but this behemoth has a flagship program that is proving popular. True Reach offers a 25 percent discount on all domestic calls for customers whose long-distance bills total more than $25. Bills between $10 and $24.99 receive a lowly 10 percent discount. But who wants to sit around figuring out if their bill is going to total $25? Clearly, it's for those pretty sure to make at least $25 worth of calls a month.  <p> If simplicity is your goal, the clear choice is Sprint. The Sprint Sense program offers a flat rate on interstate calls:10 cents a minute from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., Monday through Friday and all day on weekends; 22 cents a minute from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. during the week. There's no minimum usage before the discount kicks in. So any interstate ten-minute call after 7 p.m. costs a buck, plain and simple. What's more, a cash-back program offers a rebate of 10 percent of the year's total long-distance bill after 12 consecutive months in Sprint Sense. And unlike AT&T and MCI, which both vary rates slightly depending on the distance of some out-of-state calls, Sprint's rates are one-size-fits-all. <p> MCI's big deal is Friends and Family, but the company modified the best-known element of the promotion under the duress of heavy AT&T advertising suggesting that "calling circles" belonged next to McCarthyism on the list of intrusive practices. "That's right,we responded," says MCI customer representative Caroline Smith. "You don't want the list, we don't ask  the list." MCI's best possible deal on ten-minute evening (5 p.m. to 11 p.m.) call matches that of Sprint, but unlike MCI, Sprint doesn't care whatservice the person you're calling uses or how far away he or she lives.  <p> As if you don't have enough long-distance choices, there are also the  
so-called resellers. Companies such as Voice Net and Ameracall buy excess line capacity from the big three and sell long-distance service for less than the major leaguers. And since you access these companies by dialing a five-digit prefix or an 800 or 950 number, you don't need to replace your regular long-distance carrier to take advantage of prices that are scraping the cellar, particularly during the daytime.  <p> Time for a little treat: Fire up the Victrola. Remember Tommy Tutone's Big '80s classic, "867-5309"? You're going to save money; you've earned this dance.  <p> The final hurdle Take a deep breath, for you're about to call one of the nation's largest bureaucracies: the Social Security Administration. Open Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.,the agency is a patience tester no matter what, but the shortest waits are before 9 a.m. and after 4 p.m., Wednesday through Friday. When a human being finally replaces the saxy Muzak (no phone trees here we're talking about the U.S. government), ask for a copy of your earnings history. You'll get a form. You'll fill it out and send it back. And then you'll know if all your FICA donations that is, yours and those that your employer makes on your behalf are being recorded correctly. "Do this every five years," says Thomas Grass of the human-resources consulting firm Watson Wyatt Worldwide. Though they occur infrequently, discrepancies between the amount you've paid and the amount shown on your earnings history grow more difficult to reconcile as time elapses. Catch them early and you'll save yourself heartburn later.  <p> It's evening. Your mouth is dry and your fingers are ink-stained. Your ear rings and your neck cramps from shouldering the phone. Your eyes are glazed by cathode rays and you're wondering if life wasn't simpler in the eras of most of the shows you've watched. But look over there, in the corner where a mountain of bills, receipts, statements, and policies once teetered precariously. It's now an easily managed pillar of information, testimony to the organizational fire power you've expended. You sigh and reflect. It's been a day well spent.<p><p><p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> WHAT COMES AFTER SUCCESS? <p>Why would anyone leave the lucrative security of a director's post at a major Wall Street investment house?  Nancy Havens-Hasty wants to prove she can go it alone.  <p> By Larissa MacFarquhar  <p> Nancy Havens-Hasty was one of the first female investment bankers on Wall Street possibly the first. In 1971, after graduating from Harvard Business School, she accepted an offer from the corporate-finance department of Kidder, Peabody. Then she moved on to Oppenheimer as an arbitrageur before settling in 15 years ago at <a name="NYSE:BSC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10191"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bear Stearns</b></a>, where she rose to become co-head of the100-person high yield/bankruptcy department and the first woman elected to the firm's board of directors. Recently, she left to start her own hedge fund in a one-room office with a staff of two. Hedge funds, made famous by people such as George Soros and Julian Robertson, are limited partnerships of no more than 99 investors; each must have a minimum net worth of $1 million or annual earnings of at least $200,000. These funds are allowed to engage in riskier investment strategies than mutual funds are, and use options, short selling, and borrowed money in search of high yields. Writer Larissa MacFarquhar spoke to Havens-Hasty about her latest excellent adventure.  <p> WORTH: You were a Bear Stearns director. Why in the world would you give that up?  <p> HAVENS-HASTY: I was about to turn 50, I'd begun to think quality-of-life thoughts, and I realized that what I really got off on at my job was the straight forward investing figuring out the risk-reward of a situation, making the investment, and watching it go up or down. Now I can make pure investment decisions, whereas when I was on the brokerage side sometimes we would buy positions for the sake of a long-term relationship with a particular customer. It's nice to have just one goal, which is to make money.  <p> W:  You arrived on Wall Street in 1971, the year after Kate Millett's book Sexual Politics became a best-seller and the Justice Department filed its first sex-discrimination-in-the-work place suit. What was it like then being a woman in finance?  <p> H-H:  I'm battle-scarred, but it's also been fun, in some ways, being first. In the beginning there were a lot of silly barriers. My first office was called the bull pen, and it was definitely the first time they'd had a cow in there. A man there didn't want me to go to a particular job because the president said "damn" and used a spittoon! Some of the wives didn't want me to travel with their husbands.  <p> It was very difficult at first to convince people to send me to corporate clients, though corporations were way ahead of Wall Street in their acceptance of women. I ended up having a lot of clients that were considered less desirable within the firm. I had a lot of S & L's. I was a physics major and I had worked for <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>, but I had none of our computer clients. I did have everything that had anything to do with being female. I had a pie company. I had a manufacturer of fabric. Once, somebody suggested I become a cosmetics analyst. I never wear makeup!  <p> W:  Did you try to make yourself more acceptable to your bosses? <p> H-H:  I did, but especially at the beginning, I didn't do a good enough job presenting myself as someone who cared deeply about my work. There was an assumption right through the '80s that the men were more serious about their jobs than I was, and I didn't do enough to combat that. If I could do my career over again, I would take fewer vacations, and make a thing of it: you know, advertise the fact that I hadn't had one in a year. I would never mention the possibility that I might be going out on dates. I'm not naturally the kind of person who, if my work is done five minutes before my boss leaves, waits until five minutes after he leaves to go home, but I would do more of that if I had the perspective that I have now.   <p> W:  So how has being a woman affected your career?  <p> H-H:  It took me longer to get every promotion than it would have if I had been a man, but I was very lucky to be at a place like Bear Stearns, which is very bottom-line-oriented. These days, finance is a fairly nondiscriminatory profession because results are all that count. It's not like you can schmooze your way through bad numbers, you can't. They're right there in black and white.  <p> W:  What about the career/kids issue?  <p> H-H:  Put it this way: My second son was born at noon, and I was on the phone with my trader at 1:30. It was May of 1990, and I was in charge of the hot department at that time: bankruptcy. And when you're running a major department on Wall Street, especially a sexy department, if you leave for too long, they find someone to replace you. I had had a local anesthetic, but I knew I had a very short window of time before the epidural wore off and they put me on morphine or something, so I took advantage of that window! My trader was blown away. He said, "Nancy, you just had a baby," and I said, "Yes, but Greg, I want to know where these bonds are!" During the following three weeks that I took off, I probably talked to the office ten times a day.  <p> W:  Why start a hedge fund now, when many are having trouble outperforming bread-and-butter mutual funds?  <p> H-H:  Hedge funds are entirely driven by the individual managers and their investment strategies. So, for instance, while the people who specialize in shorting didn't have such a great year in 1995, the people who specialize in risk arbitrage had a wonderful year. There's almost nothing you can say about hedge funds in general.  <p> W:  What's your investment strategy?  <p> H-H:  I'll be investing in risk arbitrage and distress the two things I've been dealing in for the last several years. I'll also invest in junk bonds, but only high-quality junk bonds, if that's not an oxymoron: the ones that I believe have less than a 1 percent chance of having problems. I specialize in event-related investing, like bankruptcy. In a bankruptcy there's an event that ends the bankruptcy. In a merger, the merger happens. In a liquidation, the liquidation has a date. I like to be as insulated from the market as possible, and event-related investing allows me to be.  <p> W:  That sounds rather conservative. Aren't most hedge fund managers risk-takers looking for high returns?  <p> H-H:  To some degree that's true. But with a hedge fund you can actually make your plays more conservative because you have the flexibility to use instruments you can't use if you're running a mutual fund. In a market like this, where the averages are hitting new highs every day, if we find overvalued stocks, we can short them.   <p> I'm a very conservative investor. If you look at the numbers that I've turned out over the years, you'll see that I have a lower volatility than the indexes I'd be compared with, like the bankruptcy index. I don't do as well as they do in the best periods, but I do substantially better in the bad periods.  <p> W:  Do you ever take vacations? <p>I do, but I spend the first three or four hours of each day on the phone. That's why I like to go away out west. You can wake up at 6, spend three hours on the phone, and still get to your ski lesson at 9:30.  <p> One of my priorities in starting this fund was to eat breakfast with my children, and I'm pretty much doing that. I don't have many more hours at home, but when I'm there, I'm a lot less exhausted. What used to exhaust me before was the constant negotiations with customers, with other heads of departments but when you are dealing only with markets, with impartial forces, it doesn't take as much out of you.  <p> W:  At big firms, the logistics of doing business are taken care of. What's it like dealing with that yourself?  <p> H-H:When I was at Harvard Business School, I took this course called Starting New Ventures, and I decided I would never start one because there was just no end to the awful things you had to do. And in fact, getting the office set up has been even more difficult and time-consuming than I expected. This morning I spent an hour trying to get my computer to fax something! When Iwas at Bear Stearns, my assistant just called the computer person. <p> W:  Do you worry your fund will fail?  <p> H-H:  Not too much. I tell myself, You've done it before you should be able to do it again! But when you're starting out you cannot afford to make mistakes. You just can't. So this next year is extraordinarily crucial for me.  <p> You know, it doesn't take a genius to do well on Wall Street. It takes somebody who is incredibly thorough and finicky, a real perfectionist, and someone who is fairly competitive and doesn't like to make mistakes. But it's not rocket science. It's just hard work and being brutally honest about admitting that, when something's going down, you have made a mistake and should cut your losses. This is what I really love to do.  <p><p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Feature  <p> THE SUM OF OUR DREAMS <p>What are your dreams? What annual income would you need to fulfill them?  <p> Contributors: Jane Birnbaum, Sara Corbett, Monica Corcoran, Carol Marie Cropper, Erik Cushman, Gretchen Reynolds, Donovan Webster  <p> Jerolim Vukic, 53  <p>Owner of a men's hair salon,  <p>New York City <p>$50,000 <p>"I'd go to the beaches in Florida, California, and all around the world. I'd rest nice in the sun and swim in the water. I love the water. I'd buy T-shirts, key chains, and hats for all my friends. I'd buy a speedboat and go fast."  <p>  <p>Christine Gingerich, 18 <p>Baker,  <p>Free Union, Virginia <p>$1,000 <p>"We're Mennonite Christians. We don't really have salaries. But I'd use that money to buy a few personal things--shoes, clothes. The rest of it I would send to missionaries working in the fields." <p>  <p>Fred Mark Dry, 46  <p>Attorney,  <p>Chicago <p>"$1 million a year, or the equivalent in future years based on inflation." <p>"I'd quit working. I'd live life. I'd work out, read all the books I've been meaning to read, spend more time with my family, spend more time on my sailboat. There's nothing really I want to buy. Maybe a bigger house. But I have everything else I want--the sailboat, the Mercedes. I'd just like the chance to enjoy it all more."  <p>  <p>George E. King, 40  <p>Construction worker,  <p>Mount Solon, Virginia <p>$35,000  <p>"I'd buy me a piece of land."  <p>  <p>Tom Lapsley, 38 <p>Bar owner,  <p>Santa Fe <p>$10 million <p>"I'd play a lot of golf, open a lot more bars. I'd have houses in New Mexico, Colorado, Boston, Hawaii, Italy, France, Hong Kong, San Francisco. My houses would be full of art, too. My country home, it'd be full of ... Rembrandts. But I myself wouldn't change much. I'd just be a very rich version of me."   <p>  <p>Mona Cavalli, 53 <p>Food vendor,  <p>Santa Fe <p>$250,000 <p>"I'd go to Africa on safari, to see the giraffes before they're gone. I'll stay in a tent, but I want a glass of wine when the day's over. I'd also go to Egypt, but after menopause so I have a sense of humor."  <p>  <p>Roque C. Garcia, 58 <p>Food vendor,  <p>Santa Fe <p>$500,000 <p>"I'd make myself a home on the land I already own, help my brothers and sisters pay debts. My hitos--my little grandchildren--can have whatever they want. I'd send 'em to college. Buy them little pickup trucks. I'd also invest in water like the French. They just put tap water into bottles and sell it."  <p>  <p>Noor M.E. Talaty, 47 <p>Newsstand manager,  <p>New York City <p>$35,000 <p>"That would be plenty. I only need $12,000 for rent. I would use $8,000 for food for my family in India and the rest for education. My children will have to work hard and get scholarships. My dream is that they become respectable people and lead a good life.I don't care about vacations or movies. In the past seven years, I've worked every day and haven't seen a single movie."  <p>  <p>Wendy Tokuda, 40+ <p>News anchor,  <p>Los Angeles <p>$10 million "just for breathing" <p>"I'd still work in news, but fewer hours. I'd set up a charitable foundation for at-risk children. I'd spend more time with my own children. And I'd have a small organic farm where I'd grow tomatoes and have a horse, chickens, and bees."  <p>  <p>Jack Jones, 76 <p>Drum maker, potter,  <p>San Juan Pueblo, New Mexico <p>$60,000 <p>"I'm a Christian. I support Oral Roberts's ministry. I'd give about 10 percent of my money to him to do ministry work in the poor countries. Also, my mother is living up in Utah with my other close kinfolk. They raise sheep and cattle, and maybe I'd buy some feed for them. It's a pretty bleak area up there."  <p>  <p>Yule Caise, 27 <p>filmmaker, actor,  <p>Venice, California <p>$60 million <p>"I'd like a salary on par with Michael Eisner's. I'd continue making the kind of films I love. I would go on a campaign to erase illiteracy and be the banner-holder of the renaissance of education for black America. I'd create a school that my mom would be head of. She'd be one of the highest-salaried teachers in the world."   <p>  <p>John Buchanan, 49 <p>Archival researcher, artist,  <p>Brooklyn, New York <p>$80,000 <p>"Money would buy me time, and I know what to do with time. I'd push my own art as far as I could. I'd go to southeast England and see the gardens ... find a wife in Southeast Asia ... buy the house I live in. But a windfall, in terms of money, for an artist could be highly destructive, because you stop doing your work."   <p>  <p>Christina Willis, 26 <p>Student,  <p>Missoula, Montana <p>$300,000 <p>"I'd like to buy a house on Cape Cod, in the Seattle area, in Montana, and a Swiss chalet. And then I'd like to be able to travel between those locations without having to spend too much time at some asinine job."  <p>  <p>Lise Stoessel, 41 <p>Nursery-school teacher,  <p>Charlottesville, Virginia <p>$1 million <p>"I'd support the arts ... Waldorf education and organic and biodynamic agriculture. I'd give my kids a good education ... travel the world ... build a house using environmentally-correct building methods. Yeah, I'd definitely use some of that million a year to get off the grid."  <p>  <p>Sharisse Tompkins, 31 <p>IRS revenue agent,  <p>Mesquite, Texas <p>$100,000 <p>"It would cover about all expenses and some new clothes and playtoys. We'd pay off our three-bedroom house with a garage you can't fit a car into ... go on some vacation ... buy a piano. I've been sort of broke the last eight years. All my money goes to day care. When you start making a decent amount, you have kids and that takes it all."  <p>  <p>Isabel Arevalo, 55  <p>Housekeeper,  <p>Los Angeles <p>$26,000 <p>"I have no dreams. The money would be completely eaten up by reality. There's the mortgage and a severely developmentally disabled grandchild living in my home with my daughter and her husband. My husband worked 15 years at a hospital doing housekeeping. He developed heart trouble and was laid off. Now that I'm old, I'd like some comfort: get a new job, go to school, cook and decorate cakes and make little party decorations for baby and bridal showers."  <p>  <p>Terry Beck, 41 <p>President of a computer business,  <p>Grand Prairie, Texas <p>$1 million <p>"I would use it for charity--maybe Christian schools. I would enjoy nicer vacations with my family ... probably build a home in the Tennessee mountains for my wife and her family. But I'm kind of satisfied. The more you get, the more you want, so if you're not satisfied with what you've got, you're never going to be satisfied."  <p>  <p>June Potthast, 60+ <p>Retired, Chicago <p>$500,000 <p>"I wouldn't want to live in a big mansion. I'd visit my brother in Long Beach and I'd buy him a couple of different colored sports jackets ... give some money to my retired friends who don't have enough. Let's see, I'd probably buy some new coats for my dog, Piko, too. He comes first now. I lost my sister and my mother, so I live alone with him."

						October 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> TOUGH LADY, TOUGH ART <p>She wasn't rich enough to be accepted by the art world. So Elaine Dannheisser went to work, building a collection the establishment couldn't ignore.  <p> By Arthur Lubow  <p> Elaine Dannheisser has always been interested in art, but it was not until she visited Europe for the first time in 1953 that she discovered her calling as an art patron. "When I came back, I read all I could about Gertrude Stein and Picasso," she says."I was so sorry that I didn't live in Paris in the 1920s and '30s.  Then I said to myself,  'I could do the same thing now.'" The center of the art world had shifted from Paris to New York, where Dannheisser lived. she was well situated to pursue her new vocation.   <p> The daughter of a florist-supply shop owner, Dannheisser grew up in Brooklyn. Her husband, Werner, was a German immigrant who had made a fortune by manufacturing engraving machinery across the river from Manhattan in Long Island City. Werner shared Elaine's love of art. He was particularly fond of French art of the 1920s and '30s, which he collected before he met and married Elaine in 1952. In the first year of their marriage, they bought an Utrillo together. "Top, top, top Utrillo," Elaine says. "Now, looking back on it, we should have been buying Picasso." The Dannheissers were ardent Francophiles, spending summers on the Riviera, visiting the Matisse chapel, the Maeght collection, and the other modern-art museums of Provence. Elaine read books about 20th-century French art and religiously attended auctions. She would clip magazine articles on art collectors.  <p> To be the wife of a prosperous husband in New York in the 1950s invited a certain way of life. "I would meet with a group of women for lunch at the Colony," Dannheisser, now a widow in her 70s, recalls of her ladies' club days. "Every time you had to wear a new outfit, with everything matching. I thought, 'My God, that's not what I want out of my life.'" Hoping to penetrate the art world, she resolved in the early 1960s to do volunteer work for an art museum. That decision would lead her on a path of studying, volunteering, donating, collecting, and in general hustling for more than 30 years.  <p> New York has three major modern-art museums: the Modern, the Whitney, and the Guggenheim. Dannheisser selected the Guggenheim, because she liked its Frank Lloyd Wright building on Fifth Avenue and because she lived nearby. She worked in a small office on the main floor, licking envelopes. She lasted a couple of months."There was an awful woman who was the head of development," she recalls. "Nobody stayed long."   <p> She placed her name on the waiting list for volunteers at the Whitney, and one day in the mid-1960s, the museum called. She became a full-time volunteer, reporting daily to her desk to coordinate fund-raisers and arrange art tours and studio visits for members. Her Whitney period ended with the arrival of Thomas Armstrong as the new director in 1974. "Elaine was a hard worker who wasn't treated very respectfully," says Berta Walker, a Provincetown, Massachusetts, art dealer who was a Whitney administrator at the time. Elaine felt that she lacked the social credentials to pass muster with Armstrong. He seemed to ignore her efforts to become more actively involved in the Whitney. "I was making all kinds of gestures and he wouldn't bite," she says. "He had bigger fish to fry." She still bristles when she tells the story of an invitation that she received to a tour for Whitney members of some private collections in Westchester County, just outside New York City. Knowing the tour would be over subscribed, she sent back her acceptance with a check the same day. She was so enthusiastic that she telephoned a friend and urged her to apply. The friend was accepted. Dannheisser was not. "I wrote Tom Armstrong a letter saying he was alienating his membership," she says."I hand-delivered the letter to his apartment house. He never even answered it."   <p> Armstrong admits he overlooked Dannheisser in favor of other collectors. "She obviously interpreted my behavior as not flattering to her," he says. "It wasn't intentional. Elaine was not a proven situation in those days. I suppose that I desperately tried to identify myself with people who had established themselves as very much engaged in collecting and could immediately help the Whitney Museum. It was a miscall. I didn't realize she could be brought along."   <p> After she quit the Whitney, Dannheisser was "floundering around, taking art courses." One day, late in 1977, her husband called her from his office to charge her with a new responsibility. For tax purposes, the Dannheissers had set up a foundation years before. To conform to a change in the tax code, they had to donate between $100,000 and $150,000 by the end of the year or else face an excise tax. Werner told Elaine to find a worthy recipient. <p> At last, Elaine had something more than her volunteer time to dangle before the museum directors. Thinking this could be her opportunity to forge a relationship with the grand old lady of the modern-art world, the Museum of Modern Art, she went to see a board member, who suggested that she become active in the prints division. "I thought that was a real put-down," she says. What she wanted was to launch her career in the art world by joining the MoMA painting and sculpture committee, which advises the museum on acquisitions. She called the head of development at MoMA and told him she would like to donate $100,000 or $150,000." He called back and said not to waste my money," she says. "He knew what I wanted. He said, 'It's not going to happen.'"   <p> So she knocked once again on the door of the Guggenheim, where, in the years since her brief tenure licking envelopes, she had become friendly with some of the staff. A lunch was arranged for her to meet Thomas Messer, the museum's director. They hit it off. As Messer recalls it, he suggested over lunch that Dannheisser might consider helping the museum acquire a significant painting and, if so, one of the Agnes Martin paintings then being shown at the Pace Gallery would be especially welcome. They went to the gallery directly from lunch and bought the picture. (Dannheisser says the Martin purchase was made some time after that introductory lunch.) The Guggenheim received the Dannheissers' contribution and became the new focus of Elaine's energies. Through Messer and the Guggenheim, Dannheisser made the leap from volunteering time to donating money.  <p> During messer's tenure, Dannheisser spent between $750,000 and $1 million on the acquisition of four paintings for the Guggenheim. "I wish I had ten Elaine Dannheissers as my friends," Messer says. Like most museums, when it wanted to buy something, the Guggenheim had to locate a patron willing to bankroll the purchase. Dannheisser's most important contribution to the Guggenheim washer acquisition of a Mark Rothko painting in 1978. She says it was her idea to buy a Rothko. Messer, who emphasizes how grateful he is, remembers that he and curator Diane Waldman decided which painting to buy in conjuction with the Guggenheim's Rothko retrospective. Presented with their choice, he says, Dannheisser agreed. At the time, the Rothko estate was reeling from legal turmoil, and the paintings were difficult to obtain. The estate was very choosy about where the paintings wound up, placing major pictures only with museums or first-rate collectors. Dannheisser says she wasn't interested in buying a Rothko unless it was "a great one" and she could get a great one only by buying it for a museum. Fifteen years later, she is still proud that the painting she bought was on the cover of the catalog to the Guggenheim's Rothko exhibition. Later she bought a Robert Rauschenberg and a Kenneth Noland for the museum.   <p> Then Dannheisser underwent a final metamorphosis: She started a collection. Over the years of their marriage, she and Werner had bought a number of paintings, most notably a Picasso and a Dubuffet, both of which still hang in her living room. In 1980, she decided to start collecting in earnest. That summer, Messer and his wife visited the Dannheissers at their weekend house in East Hampton, Long Island. Elaine says that the idea of buying a space to exhibit contemporary art came to her overnight. When she told Messer over the lunch table, he was enthusiastic. She recalls: "He said, 'That's a great idea. Why don't we do it with you? We'll get some great curator.' That sounded very exciting. Then I realized, 'My God, I'll be walking behind someone, writing out checks.' So I didn't do that. I did it myself."  <p> The first challenge was persuading Werner to buy her an exhibition space. She knew she would need a large warehouse. "With young artists you can't buy just a few things," she explains. "You can with blue-chip. But with young artists you need a broad spectrum. "Werner, who died of Parkinson's disease in 1992, was far more cautious than Elaine. "His middle name was 'Let's wait and think,'" she jokes. She believes that, after almost a year of vacillation, he acceded to her request for two reasons. First, he sold his factory, so he had cash on hand. About the same time, Elaine was diagnosed with cancer. He wanted to cheer her up. In 1981, he bought her the two lower floors of a former warehouse in Tribeca, which was once the butter-and-egg district of the city. Today, the Duane Street building is a few doors down from Bouley, one of the best restaurants in New York.  <p> Starting with what she describes as "a small budget of maybe $30,000 or $50,000 a year" (the budget eventually doubled), she became a collector of contemporary art. She was not alone. The1980s were the boom years of the art market. "Immediately, Werner and I started going to all the art fairs," she says. "It gave me a chance to know all the art. You got to know the dealers all over the world. The art world doesn't rise and set in New York." She joined the board of the New Museum, a downtown center for cutting-edge art, where she audited lectures and joined semimonthly studio visits. She would go to every dinner and party and opening for fear that if she didn't, she might miss making an important contact. "I was into the networking of the art world," she says."Then the East Village thing happened. Every Sunday, you went to the East Village, come hell or high water, and you boughtsomething impulsively. I read all the magazines. I lived and breathed art in the '80s. That's all I did." Art dealer Douglas Baxter, now at the Pace Wildenstein Gallery, says, "Besides taking care of Werner, her main occupation was her interest in art.She was like a professional."  <p> Dannheisser was collecting paintings by many of the celebrated artists of the time: David Salle, Eric Fischl, Ross Bleckner, Anselm Kiefer, Sigmar Polke. Reminiscing in her duplex apartment on Park Avenue, she describes how, after several years of buying paintings, she revised her acquisition strategy. "One day," she recalls, "I walked into my place on Duane Street and said, 'My God, this looks like a rich woman's East Side apartment.'" She sold almost all the paintings. (For a single Fischl, which she had purchased for $12,000 in 1981, she received $1.4 millionin 1989.) In 1985, when she was already in her 60s, she started buying video, conceptual, and installation art. "I don't think we're living in a time of painting," she says. "We're living in a period of new technology and electronics."  <p> As art prices appreciated at vertiginous rates in the 1980s, collectors scrambled to buy work by young painters whose prices seemed certain to soar. Since the demand exceeded the supply, gallery owners typically offered the best work only to their most loyal customers or, if they were hoping to build an artist's reputation, to museums. By focusing on conceptual and installation art, Dannheisser entered an area with fewer competitors than she had found in her quest for paintings. "I loved [Francesco] Clemente, and I never got a major Clemente, because Angela [Westwater, Clemente's dealer at the Sperone/Westwater Gallery] would never sell me one," she says. "Sometimes you would buy something else to get what you wanted. You had to be supportive of a gallery to get anything. It was such a cobweb of nuances. You couldn't walk in and say to one of these women and they were mostly women 'Iwant this.' They would look at you as if you were crazy. Mary[Boone] never wanted to sell me a great [Julian] Schnabel, soI never bought one and now I'm very happy."   <p> Certainly, art in the late 1980s was a seller's market. But once Dannheisser focused on more controversial and, in many cases, bulky sculptures that a collector could not display in an apartment, she began demanding and getting the important pieces a collection needs to garner respect. "You have to ask, 'Is this a major work? Is it a signature piece of the artist?'"Angela Westwater says."I think Elaine has come to that thinking. I don't think her standards were always at the heights they reached. I think the process of identifying works that were major pieces became important to her later on." Dannheisser matured along with her collection."There's a confidence that comes with more experienced collecting, which gives one the patience to wait," Douglas Baxter says. "When people are less experienced, they're a bit more edgy about not being the first to get something which may only lead to a dealer not wanting to give them immediate gratification."  <p> On a warm afternoon last spring, Dannheisser conducted a personal tour of her collection. She was wearing her usual curly gray-blond wig. Her green eyes were accented by plucked eyebrows and turquoise mascara. She had a powdered-on tan complexion. She was wearing a red Sonia Rykiel jacket with gold buttons, a cranberry-colored silk blouse, and Moschino plaid trousers. Dannheisser has a perky manner but seems perpetually a bit off balance which may be a result of cataract operations more than half a century ago that left her blind in her left eye.  <p> Entering the first-floor gallery on Duane Street (the basement below provides studio space for two artists who help take care of the collection), Dannheisser and a visitor were aurally bludgeoned by the soundtrack of a Bruce Nauman video that intoned, with maniacal insistence, "Think! Think! Think!" By the door was a Rebecca Horn assemblage composed of two paintbrushes mounted to a motorized contraption, and, beneath them, a bunch of crude wooden picture frames attached by metal rods at different angles to the wall; the wall and the frames are splattered with blue and black paint. A Joseph Beuys on the other side of the roomis a mysterious array of a galvanized iron bucket, a cheap white enameled basin, a glass jar with an encrusted bottom that sits on a film-reel canister, and a stack of old film prints on top of which are two rubber stamps bearing the artist's name.   <p> In an alcove that normally houses a Nauman work, Learned Helplessness in Rats, Dannheisser had placed a Robert Gober bed and, above it, a Gober barred window. There was a large Nauman drawing (later manufactured into a neon sculpture, which Dannheisser kicks herself for not buying) that was one of the collector's first ventures into conceptual art. It depicts two men in superimposed poses, thrusting guns and penes into their own and each other's mouths. On seeing it offered for $10,000 in a Chicago gallery in 1985, Dannheisser knew immediately that she must have it. "I always was a very impulsive person, and I always make my mind up very quickly," she says. "I tell myself, 'If you have to think about it, you shouldn't have it.' I never intellectualized about it. I never had to meet the artist. I never had to understand it completely. If it did something to me, I would buy it."  <p> Dannheisser weaved swiftly through the handsome exhibition space, identifying each work by its maker's name a Reinhard Mucha here, a Carl Andre and a Matthew Barney and a Cindy Sherman there. The art was not organized by any evident principle, but occasionally, a fortuitous juxtaposition arose. For instance, the source of the maniacal "Think!" was two TV monitors, one on top of the other, each showing a man's head (shouting "Think!") bouncing up and down like a basketball. Right nearby was the famous Koons of three basketballs floating in an aquarium. Dannheisser seemed to have a special affection for certain artists, such as Nauman, Gober, and Richard Serra. "He's very important to me," she would say. She describes the sort of art she prefers as "tough art." On a countertop just outside the bathroom, in the one somewhat homey touch, was a pair of portraits of Elaine and Werner by Robert Mapplethorpe.  <p> Considering that she was surrounded by her collection, Dannheisser seemed none too comfortable on Duane Street. She hadn't been coming down there much recently. Of course, it was difficult to feel comfortable with Nauman's voice shouting "Think!" every few seconds. "It drives you crazy," Dannheisser said. "Maybe I should shut it off." She was happy to leave for lunch, at a place she chose a SoHo art hangout, Mezzogiorno. When she walked into the restaurant, she was greeted effusively by a fellow diner, Antonio Homem, co-proprietor of the Sonnabend Gallery. She was mid-pasta when another famous art dealer, Leo Castelli, entered. Dannheisser tried to catch his eye but couldn't. On the way out, she stopped at his table, and Castelli too spoke to her with urbane warmth. Dannheisser glowed.    <p> Once Dannheisser resolved to build a collection of her own, she stopped underwriting purchases for the Guggenheim. Other museums began courting her. Even more important than her financial support although, especially for the smaller institutions, that could be significant the main prize now was the growing collection. Childless, the Dannheissers were inclined to bequeath their art to a museum. Although Elaine's strongest museum relationship was with the Guggenheim, she had not committed herself. And her ties to the Guggenheim began to fray after Messer left in 1988 and Thomas Krens replaced him as director. "Tom Krens was another Tom Armstrong," she says. "Arrogant, hot shot, slick, very condescending."She felt that in his pursuit of super-rich benefactors, suchas Ronald Perelman and Samuel LeFrak, he was ignoring the less rich. Busy setting up new branches of the Guggenheim as far afield as Spain and Italy, Krens had little time available, and Dannheisser didn't make the cut. She was offended when he dispatched Lisa Dennison "a second-tier curator," she sniffs; "he didn't even come himself" to ask her to give the museum her major work by Beuys, to appear in a 1992 show to mark the museum's opening of its branch in SoHo. (She refused.)   <p> Her relationship with the Guggenheim hit bottom at a dinner for benefactors in late 1994. Having been bored at some previous Guggenheim events, she brought along a friend. When they arrived, they found they had been seated separately. "I was put with five Japanese women who don't speak English," Dannheisser recalls. "And the seat next to me was empty." A couple of months later, she resigned from the Guggenheim board. "Tom Krens never even sent me a 'sorry' note," she says. "He really is unbelievable."(Krens would not comment.)  <p> Disenchanted now with both the Whitney and the Guggenheim, where would she turn? Although she had served on the board of the New Museum and on the board of advisors of the Dia Foundation, which are the best-known New York institutions devoted exclusively to contemporary art, neither institution was large enough or distinguished enough to satisfy Dannheisser's ambitions.  <p> Her thoughts returned to the Modern. She was no longer the unknown Park Avenue matron with a Picasso and a Dubuffet, the woman who volunteered for museum work and was directed to the prints division. She was a leading collector of Nauman, Koons, and Gober favorites of the Modern's painting and sculpture curator, Kirk Varnedoe. When TV newsman Morley Safer last year sought a prominent collector to defend the contemporary art that he was savaging on 60 Minutes, Dannheisser was the one he interviewed. She was a personage. In 1989, Agnes Gund, then the chairman of the MoMA's painting and sculpture committee, had invited her to join the panel, which meets every couple of months. "It came about as a mutual synergy," says Gund, now president of MoMA. "Everyone was aware that she was a collector with an interest in art that very few people had. She was in the forefront of collecting certain people."  <p> Although membership on the committee carries a high price an expected annual contribution of $25,000 it is a position people vie for. Membership had been Dannheisser's goal at the start of her museum patronage career. But her ambitions had swelled with her collection. What she wanted even more now was to join the museum's International Council, which convenes semiannually for a week of meetings and dinners. Last year, with Gund's sponsorship, she was asked to join the council. "The minute I resigned from the Guggenheim, the relationship with the Modern became more relaxed," she says.  <p> Dannheisser is warmly disposed toward Varnedoe, but her primary relationship at the Modern is with Gund. Gund has made Dannheisser feel appreciated. "When we have lunch, Aggie says, 'I'm so glad you're going to come on the board,'" Dannheisser says. "I think they have respect for my ideas and what I think." Although not a bridge player, Gund has accompanied Dannheisser to her bridge club. Last year, when Dannheisser underwent a gall bladder operation, Gund visited her twice in the hospital. "And she has no airs," Dannheisser says approvingly. "She's very down to earth." For her part, Gund says, "I've gotten very fond of Elaine. I don't feel I'm doing it as a job. I'm doing it because I like her." <p> Although the details are still to be worked out, Dannheisser has decided that the Museum of Modern Art will be the final resting place of her collection. In return, she expects or, it might be more accurate to say, demands a few things: She will be asked to join the board of trustees, her collection will be spotlighted in a special show, and a catalog of the collection will be published. She plans no stipulations on how her art must be displayed. She says she doesn't even much care if the Museum of Modern Art sells off some of her acquisitions. "They want to be able to sell things and buy others in my name, which is fine with me," she says."I'm not one of those people that love everything they have. I get rid of things myself to buy the work of another artist." <p> Once some legal matters are settled, perhaps as early as this fall, Dannheisser will be asked to join the MoMA board. "We would like to have her on the board," Gund says. "It's not going to be something where she has to sit in the middle of the road and scream, 'I want to be on the board.' But it hasn't been dealt with yet." Her ascension to the board will be a quiet affair. The festivities will come when the museum presents a selection of Dannheisser's work in a special show. The party to celebrate the opening will be the perfect payoff for the countless networking parties she has attended. Looking back, Dannheisser is not quite sure how it all happened. "Once I climbed Mount Etna it's a long story and when we got out of the jeeps, I wondered, 'What amI doing here?'" she says. "And then someone pushed me, one leg and then the other, until I got to the top. When I was building my collection, I never realized it was going to be such a good collection. I just went with it. And I still don't understand sometimes what people are raving about." <p>

						<p>By Donald Katz<p>Michael Bloomberg, information-age billionaire and self-proclaimed Colonel Sanders of the high-tech financial-news scene, slaloms through the copper rain forest of sculptures and fountains in the lobby of Manhattan's Grand Hyatt Hotel. He descends via escalator into a crowd of media and technology pros gathered for yet another conference called to discuss the whys, wherefores, and imminent profitabilities of the convergence of old-fashioned media and new digital technologies. Bloomberg acknowledges the freshly composed smiles and hearty hellos"Mike ... Hey, Mike"that rise from within the large crowd. It's clear that most of the conference attendees know exactly who he is, and from Bloomberg's perspective, this is the world as it ought to be.<p>"I was out late last night at a dinner party with some Wall Street people," Bloomberg had mentioned on the way from his Park Avenue office to the new-media conference, an affair sponsored by the venerable banking house Alex. Brown & Sons. "There was a journalist there and two other couples, and they all knew who I was, even though I didn't know them. You know, you get in that situation, and ... well, you love it. On the other hand, it's very humbling when people don't know who you are. Even people in the business you would think would have to knowespecially after all that money we spend in advertising."<p>Every day it becomes more difficult to imagine an urban American failing to recognize Mike Bloomberg's name. In the car on the way downtown, a voice hailing from the New Yorkbased Bloomberg Information Radio station had intoned the Bloomberg name a dozen times between machine-gun updates of the latest prices and market trends. Other Bloomberg radio outlets were meanwhile repeating Mike Bloomberg's last name in France, Belgium, and Spain. Dozens of public television stations and several cable TV networks were reciting the Bloomberg mantra during Bloomberg Business News reports. Other televised Bloomberg news items were being beamed via satellite to London, Frankfurt, and Milan. The New York Times business section had that morning run a number of short articles attributed to Bloomberg's army of 375 business reporters stationed in 56 worldwide bureausthis just a few pages from a huge advertising banner that spelled bloomberg in vertical type down one side of a full page.<p>On the previous Sunday morning, some 6 million copies of a personal-finance supplement called Bloomberg Personal had fallen out of newspapers in 18 American cities, and as soon as the big <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley</b></a> building rises over Times Square, five long blocks west of the Grand Hyatt Hotel, the bas-relief bloomberg sign that now curves bulbously around the corner of West 45th Street and Broadway will be joined by a computer-driven megasign that will cover an entire facet of the new office tower with all kinds of real-time information flashing beside yet another multistoried bloomberg.<p>But these are only the more public displays of Mike Bloomberg's cultural and economic status. A large percentage of the men and women at the conference had come from offices outfitted with special computer terminals with the word bloomberg inscribed above the on/off switch. A "Bloomberg," as such a terminal is known, is by now more essential to a great many financial professionals' desktops than pencils or Prozac.<p>A Bloomberg is the only way to get Bloomberg Financial Markets, a service that instantly offers up information about activity on dozens of global markets. It will deliver the latest news about any public company, as well as historical details about the company's securities and business results. Years before other computer screens went Technicolor, Bloomberg's were already presenting the firm's elite clients with intricate multicolored charts and graphs delivered on demand. A Bloomberg will impart the most arcane and many-variabled analyses of bond prices, or audio renditions of a CEO addressing shareholders, or instantly comparable data about that CEO's stock options and related pay-outs, or gossip from the vaulted halls of the Bundesbank, or reports on the weather and traffic outside a user's window, or up-to-the-minute results of the latest cricket match in Perth or sumo wrestling combat in southern Japan.<p>The Bloomberg is a control freak's dream machine. It displays an instant sense of the measurable world held in momentary stasisparticularly that part of the world connected to money. The machine generates a mechanical and electronic reduction of dozens of societies in motion, with all the related data edited, considered from hundreds of different angles, refitted to any number of customized matrices and analytical methods, digitized, and then mainlined through telephone wires. The Bloomberg is a miniaturized CIA for money workers who crave the illusion of control, and Bloomberg users will tell you that jockeying the screens quickly becomes an addiction. In certain Wall Street houses the Bloomberg junkies around the office are called "infomaniacs." <p>Some 53,000 Bloombergs sit on desktops worldwide, each costing its user $1,100 a month or more, and despite the recent rush of older and more deep-pocketed rivals into the desktop land grab, Bloomberg's user population has grown by 40 percent annually for all but one of the past five years. Bloomberg has become a global brand according to any number of standards.<p>Yet Mike Bloomberg can still perceive a generalized awareness gap separating Bloomberg, the extremely profitable financial information system; Bloomberg, the nascent media and multimedia empire; and Bloomberg, the driven and emotional working-class wise guy from Boston who recognized the value of computerizing financial equations for professionals when most of them were still using scratch pads and bound volumes of charts.<p>Pioneer and billionaire though he may be at age 53, Bloomberg will rest only when that gap finally closes.<p>"Sure, okay, I'm a media mogul," Bloomberg replies when asked to confirm the obvious. "I'm not married to Jane Fonda, and I don't raise buffalo in Montana like Ted Turner. But I do have a 6 millioncirculation magazine. I've got a 100,000-circulation magazine. I've got worldwide television and radio tuned to me. I've got the fastest-growing computer-networking company. So by those standards, yeah, a media mogul."<p>But in true contemporary media-mogul fashioneven as his name flies across thousands of wireline systems, through the air, and through outer space, and is festooned across urban vistas and recited over and over from digital minarets everywhereit isn't enough.<p>Bloomberg regards his notoriety and a flourishing New York social life as indications of how far he's come from a working-class boyhood. His father was a nose-to-the-grindstone bookkeeper at a small dairy in Somerville, Massachusetts, and Bloomberg grows reflective and soft-spoken when he describes childhood Sundays when his father took him along to work. His mother still lives in the small house where Michael and his sister grew up.<p>Bloomberg's own two children make weekend jaunts with their father to horse shows in Virginia and to meetings at their private schools; he describes the distance between his own hardscrabble youth and the privileged life he provides for his children with the shorthand joke "My kids wouldn't date me." Bloomberg's capacity for self-knowledge is one reason friends and colleagues take pleasure in his success and even enjoy his obsessive efforts to insert his last name into every view and soundtrack.<p>"Do I care what people think?" Bloomberg self-inquires when the conversation turns to the vagaries of legacy, fame, and personal satisfaction. "Am I flattered when people say, Oh, there's Mike Bloomberg'? Well, yeah. The other night I was having a drink with this woman after a party, and she says, I found it so-o-o fascinating that people kept deferring to you at the party.' Now keep in mind where she's coming from. A widow who doesn't want to stay that way. You were the center of attention,' she says. Yeah, because there were a bunch of bankers there after me to do deals, and I was clearly wealthier than the rest."<p>Bloomberg is not, as yet, mentioned with regularity in New York gossip columns, but he is beginning to socializedivorced as he has been for two years nowwith women who are. "Then again," Bloomberg notes, "how many single heterosexual billionaires do you think there are, fer Chrissakes?"<p>For all the fun he obviously has at work and play, Bloomberg seems to suffer a fate similar to that of other business kingpins who charm or philanthropize themselves into elevated social circles. Once they're inside, the very perspicacity (or paranoia or field-commander insight) that aided their climb to power seems to undermine the possibility of their ever gaining a satisfying sense of where they stand. "It's like with academics," Bloomberg says of his nonbusiness areas of personal pursuit. "You can't measure performance or value, so they all get lost in back-stabbing and politics."<p>Since he's too smart to misread a banker on the prowl or a widow on the make, Bloomberg remains most comfortable in business, which offers a measure of what can be trusted and believed. "After a point, dollars, as has been said so often," Bloomberg says, "are just ways of keeping score."<p>Bloomberg is different, though, from most of the others dominating information businesses. For he has known the intimate association of menand that's what they all werefor whom ego and the use of money as a way of keeping score were entwined and celebrated in ways not on display in America since the turn of the century. <p>Back at Salomon Brothers during the late 1970s, "Bloomy" was known around the equities desk as the sane one. A partner of the firm at age 30, Bloomberg had risen to the top of the equities desk at the investment bank alongside two legendarily wild and crazy guys of the moment's Wall Street scenea brilliant and personally excessive fellow named Jay Perry, and a brilliant and profoundly Machiavellian fellow named Dickie Rosenthal. <p>Bloomberg had come to Salomon in 1966 after working his way through Johns Hopkins University and then attending Harvard Business School. "Goldman Sachs offered me a job at $14,500 a year and Salomon offered one for $9,000," he recalls. "But Goldman had some very specific role and position in mind. At Salomon, they said, We don't know what you'll do, just come in and learn.' And I thought that made more sense."<p>Eventually Rosenthal (who taught Bloomberg how to fly and later died at the controls of his own plane) jockeyed himself into the upper echelons of the firm over Perry (who also died young, of leukemia, not long thereafter). In 1979 Bloomberg left the equities hot zone for the decidedly unsexy information-systems side of the business. Sixteen years ago, most stock and bond traders still tended to sit at their desks with books and pamphlets piled all around them. They would hit the books to figure out yields, and they would scour their desks for the company "B-page" that listed the securities the firm had on the books that day. Quotron screens were by then offering general price information on desktops, but none of it was customized to the needs of a bond-oriented firm or an individual.<p>Bloomberg, who had studied engineering and physics at Johns Hopkins and was not afraid of technical matters, worked to set up a computer system that allowed traders to quickly assess all sorts of information about securities, as well as news and even messages from colleagues. It did irk him to note that as soon as he left the trading desk, the financial markets came alive and trades that used to move in 10,000-share units were suddenly jumping around in 100,000-share pieces. But then again, in 1981, Salomon Brothers was merged with the Phibro Corp. commodities-trading firm, and Bloomberg and the 61 other partners at Salomon Brothers got huge payouts of cash and convertible bondsportents of the surreal Wall Street windfalls to come.<p>Bloomberg's take was reportedly about $20 million. "I became a charter member," he recalls, "of the lucky-sperm club."<p>But late that same year, Bloomberg was asked to leave the company. "I loved Salomon Brothers," he says now. "I would have stayed there forever if they hadn't thrown me out."<p>In Bloomberg's version, he "lost the confidence of the executive board," for reasons having to do with his being a strongly opinionated "pain in the ass." But it's hard to find evidence of particularly fiery clashes or former colleagues who remember him as a great challenger of authority. It seems that the Bloomberg tempermost often described in terms of his penchant for slamming telephones against hard surfacesflourished more fully once he was out on his own. "Everybody would be a lot better off if we yelled and screamed and said so when we're annoyed," he says. "Keeping it in and pledging to get somebody later is how wars start."<p>Immediately after leaving Salomon, Bloomberg combined some of his own new capital with $30 million in seed financing from <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> to launch a service business called Innovative Market Systems. The new company offered a hardware-based financial information and analysis system similar to the one he had managed at Salomon Brothers. Bloomberg anointed the product with the bland moniker Market Master.<p>"I didn't want my name on the product or the business at first," Bloomberg says. "I didn't want people to think it was just me. Pretty stupid, huh?"<p>One thing Mike Bloomberg loves to do these days is give a speech. He holds forth in a fast, slightly nasal, streetwise manner at varied gatherings several times each week, invariably without the aid of text or a single note. He contends that his appearances are essential to his role as his organization's perambulating brand name. Hence the line, one of his favorites, about being his organization's Colonel Sanders. "Reuter is dead," he says. "Dow is dead. Jones is dead. Knight is dead. Ridder is dead. So we have an advantage. I'm alive."<p>In the few days before the Alex. Brown conference, Bloomberg had gotten up to speak before a conclave at Johns Hopkins, where he is the chairman-elect of the board of trustees. He'd spoken at a First Boston conference and traveled to Frankfurt to give a speech. And he'd held forth in his rapid-fire, free- associative way via satellite to a group in Sydney, Australiafrom a studio in Denver. Bloomberg describes with great enthusiasm a 1994 speaking event in Tokyo at which he was positioned three stages above a huge audience wearing translation headphones. "Bill Gates was there tooand this was a year and a half ago ... when Gates was bigger than he is now, and I was smaller than I am now. It was heady stuff."<p>At the Alex. Brown conference, Bloomberg's words seem to emanate directly from fierce synaptic processes playing out in his head. He easily unravels a vision of technology advancing so rapidly that the Bloomberg delivery system no longer holds a technological edge. "The purely technical battles are ones we will lose," he says quickly, "because once you fill a screen faster than the eye can take it in, or offer resolution the eye can't discern or audio better than the ear can perceive, you can't take it farther. There is no stopping technology. ... You already see pictures of terrorists and African bushmen using cellular phones. Five years from now you will have unlimited bandwidth at zero cost, and infinite computing capacity, too. So this is why two thirds of the 2,000 people working for our company are working on content. And the content is why Bloomberg will eventually have a channel on every cable system in the world."<p>This last reference is to the new 24-hour Bloomberg Information TV system, which is provided free to cable operators and which top-of-the-line desktop Bloombergs now receive. When the system is fully in place, Bloomberg TV will appear in little anchor-person windows in one corner of every Bloomberg screen. If you don't activate the system for a given period of time, the Bloomberg presenter will reappearthe news anchor as screen-saver.<p>As his speech progresses, Bloomberg speaks even more quickly and without pause. In the back room, the columnist George F. Will, who is scheduled to speak during the lunch break, takes in Bloomberg's performance. "Now here is a man," says Willa fellow not unaccustomed to self-appreciation"who is in love with the sound of his own voice."<p>Later, at a smaller "breakout session" attended by a dozen investors and money managers, Bloomberg continues to describe technological advances, including some that will not entirely change life as we know it: "For instance, you see a pile of boxes in a warehouse and you want to know which box has the ribbed condoms inside. Well, there'll be a chip in the box to tell you. Hit the button, and you'll know where the condoms are." New technologies will become simple commodities, Bloomberg argues, shifting power from phone and cable companies and into the hands of the providers of content. <p>Bloomberg has already made himself rich by marrying "content," as everything from dictionaries to digital pornography is known in the new media scene, with the communicative capacities of the computer. He has accomplished without much celebrationas he will observethe very thing that hundreds of entertainment, media, and communications companies are investing in and forging alliances to pull off. "Today the gatekeeper is still the distributor," he says at the breakout session. "You don't give [John] Malone [leader of the TCI cable television empire] or [Gerald] Levin [CEO of <a name="NYSE:TWX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11482"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Time Warner</b></a>] a piece of the action, and you're really fucked."<p>At this, the eyes of a woman wearing a Nancy Reagan knit suit and sitting across from Bloomberg appear to begin watering. The man next to her looks down and starts tracing nervous circles on the tablecloth with his water glass.<p>"The business-information market our business is in really is much smaller than people think," Bloomberg continues. "The Wall Street Journal sells 1.8 million copies a day. Now the population of the United States is 250 million. So less than 1 percent get The Wall Street Journal, and you can make the argument that few people who care about business don't get it. Non-O.J. news and business information describe a small marketplace. Business news is upscale and you can sell advertising against it, but it's small."<p>"How can you say that?" the man drawing circles pauses to ask. "Look at business television. Look at CNBC." <p>"CNBC!" shoots back Bloomberg, who would prefer to envisage his own ventures as competition for CNN instead of CNBC. "CNBC's ratings are an asterisk, a big zero! UPI and Reuters are trying to replicate CNBC, but there's very little there. All CNBC has done is replace the boardroom at the retail brokerage office. The old guy in Florida who used to go sit around at Merrill Lynch and watch the ticker for entertainmentmaybe buying 100 shares here and thereis the viewer of CNBC. CNBC also offers you next week's prices.' Analysts come in and tell you next week's price. Even though they just don't know. It's no better than infomercials. Who gives a shit?"<p>"I guess I should watch my language," Bloomberg muses later. "I'm sure there are people who don't like me because of it. An article in The Wall Street Journal once called me profane.' My mother read it, and she said, Ya see, just like I always told you.' I said, Oh, bullshit.'"<p>"What he's evolved is a magnificent front," says Morris W. Offitt, one of Bloomberg's buddies from the Salomon days and now a Wall Street banker-to-the-rich. "The brashness and the tough-guy routine are drawn from trading-room style. He's quite ... well, tender."<p>"People might not like me because I'm brash," Bloomberg says matter-of-factly. "People might not like me because I'm Jewish, because I'm short. Sometimes people just aren't going to like you. I'm not particularly refined at times, and I should probably watch myself. People will say to me, Sure, it's easy for you to say whatever you want and speak your mind now that you're wealthy and powerful.' I usually reply, How do you think I got wealthy and powerful? Thank you.' But the truth is, I've always been a wiseass. I was a wiseass back when I thought a six-pack and a ride on the Staten Island Ferry was a great date.<p>"Then again," Bloomberg says reflectively, "maybe I would have been even wealthier and more powerful if I had learned to keep quiet. Who knows?"<p>It turned out that soon after Bloomberg began selling his expensive but quickly delivered and carefully packaged information (his name went on the machines in 1985), the number and kind of customers willing to pay for it began to multiply by the day. Among Bloomberg's first paying customers were brokerage-house analysts and global monitors at the World Bank. Traders of government bonds and other debt instruments were also early fans of Bloomberg boxes, but a more generalized craving for financial data seemed to intensify as the bull market propelled the financial-services industry toward enormous cultural prominence.<p>The potential value and imagined security borne of superior access to financial information has been a subject of interest to money professionals since the Battle of Waterloo and the genesis of haute finance. It was in the summer of 1815apocryphal though much of the tale isthat Nathan Rothschild and his banker brothers are said to have used their private system of carrier pigeons and "post boys" to ascertain the joyous news that General Wellington had prevailed against the Frenchand then to spread through London the terrible news that Wellington had failed and all was lost. The Rothschilds bought heavily into the plunging London currency and equity markets, as the story goes, before sitting back in the parlors of various overstuffed clubs to wait for the truth of the great British victoryand the attendant windfall profitto arrive by slow boat.<p>During the 1980s, the galloping increases in raw computing power and the flourishing of complex securities markets created new capabilities and demands for high-tech information delivery. Traders looked over their shoulders for fear that faster "analytics"the specialty of the original Bloombergswould allow a competitor looking at a different screen to blindside his or her trading strategy. Portfolio managers on the phone with someone trying to sell them a few million dollars' worth of bonds needed to believe they had access to the same data as the seller.<p>The general public also clamored for information access, the perception being that the Wall Street wealth machine was connected to breaking news. Takeover rumors in particular created the belief that fast access to news would make you rich. In 1988, still in the afterglow of the market-crash trauma of a year earlier and the resulting perception that information insiders got out before the fall, full-page ads from Bloomberg's competitors began to appear in newspapers, offering "Wealth Insurance." "Can a $29.95 membership in Dow Jones News/Retrieval really help ensure your personal wealth?" the ads inquired.<p>The answer, according to Bloomberg and most other money pros, wasand still isabsolutely not. As Nicholas Leeson, the cocky 28-year-old Barings PLC trader, recently demonstrated via losses that cost his nose-in-the-air old-line banking firm its solvency, access to a great wall of glowing screens cannot impart the ability to truly see.
"Success," as one of the Bloomberg Information Radio ad lines puts it, "is simply information plus imagination."<p>"That individual investors would necessarily do better if they could afford Bloombergs is a myth," Mike Bloomberg says. "In the end, investment success is about judgment, a bit of luck, and some diversification to make up for the fact that nobody is that smart or that lucky all the time. Some of the pros managing other people's money with our terminals at hand don't do any better with their personal portfolios than non-pros. On the other hand, I certainly hope the perception that the technology is requiredin some cases so that fiduciaries can have machines as a prophylactic against lawsuitscontinues to spread. People are essentially herd players."<p>Bloomberg saw early that technology would continually enforce the imperatives it creates. If your competitor has a remote paging system and you have only a phone answering machine, the perception of his or her superior access to quicker connections argues for the purchase of a new pager. Bloomberg stats-hounds now have access to some 7,000 different analytical protocols. A customer with an idea for a new way to compare prices or securities or market reactions can phone a Bloomberg software specialist, who will customize mathematical filters and algorithms on the fly. <p>But there are only so many serviceable angles from which to observe prices, and many business and financial managers don't put much stock in intricate technical analysis or instant responses anyway, so Bloomberg has continuously flooded the virtual files behind his clients' screens with more information. He has added 20 services a month to the system for several yearsanalyses of arcane Far Eastern securities located just a keystroke away from horoscopes and fishing columns and a service for ordering flowers.<p>Several years ago, Bloomberg's much larger competitorsnotably the hidebound and bureaucratic century-old British house of Reuters and the hidebound and bureaucratic century-old American house of Dow Jonesvowed to present new high-tech "Bloomberg killers." But Bloomberg and his army of kid reporters continue to flourish, though lately even Mike Bloomberg has wondered how long the bull market in Bloomberg can last.<p>Some observers of the recent slowdown in the spread of Bloomberg terminals (growth is down to 1,050 terminals a month, as compared with 1,100 a month in recent years) say that Bloomberg should abandon his custom-made, monogrammed terminals and sell his stuff as software anyone can use. "Yeah? Well go buy a PC and put Windows on it," Bloomberg scoffs. "It'll crash every day. We do better with our own hardware." (Bloomberg is a pragmatist, though, and later he acknowledges that he is considering selling the software and wire feeds that would allow his services to appear on non-Bloomberg PCs.)<p>"Our growth has only slowed a bit," Bloomberg says. "The problem is that Wall Street is contracting. I can't do much about Goldman Sachs going from five floors in a building in Hong Kong to three floors. They are going to need fewer terminals. They let go 10 percent of their workforce, they need fewer terminals."<p>Bloomberg's new vision of growth involves forging into the world of general news and information and selling "110 percent of what I have"by which he means constant repackaging of the upward of 2,000 news stories his reporters gather and the 30 different interviews with CEOs and other business figures they generate and update during a day. Bloomberg seems to be moving from a customized and narrowed system into a mass-media marketplace. The strategy mirrors the way business and financeand its data and institutions and myriad heroeshave muscled from their specialized corner into the general cultural purview, but many people wonder whether Bloomberg isn't taking a terrible chance.<p>So the bankers and deal makers of the media scene tell Bloomberg he must hedge his bets and go public or sell off equity to raise cash for his new ventures. For more than a year, periodic rumors have told of leveraged buyouts, initial public offerings, and takeovers. Bill Savoy, the money manager who runs the $4.6 billion portfolio of <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> co-founder Paul Allen, has tried to get Bloomberg to talk turkey on the phone, and Bloomberg just says, "No thanks," and then says he has to go.<p>Bloomberg is approached several times a week, orif he's among the right crowdseveral times at once. As he starts to leave the Alex. Brown conference, talking of Rollerblading (" ... so I hadn't learned to stop, but I'm going down this hill trying to keep up with a great view of this gorgeous woman, and I totally wipe out and"), he is interrupted by a grinning banker. "Mike!" says the man, grasping Bloomberg's hand and moving close to murmur into his left ear.<p>"No, thank you," Bloomberg says in full voice as he straightens up and breaks away. "Not for me."<p>Another man, in pinstripes and tortoise-shell glasses, approaches and begins to whisper in Bloomberg's other ear. "You're welcome to come in and talk to me," Bloomberg says in a loud voice before the whisperer finishes whispering. "But I'm just not interested."<p>Bloomberg rushes out to the street, where buses and taxicabs decorated with his name ply the avenues. "Sometimes you do find yourself looking at it all and wondering if you can keep it going," he says, drawing in a long breath. "It's a scary thought."<p>The lobby of the main Bloomberg Business News offices, on the 15th floor of a Park Avenue building, is invariably overflowing with visitors and employees and noise. Young Bloomberg reporters in rumpled shirts and ties hobnob over wooden bowls of fruit beside better-tailored Bloomberg sales personnel and techies in Hawaiian shirts. Employees wearing ID tags come into the noisy lobby and yell the names of visitors, while against one wall of the lobby a group of Japanese visitors hovers over the Bloomberg Traveler laptop, which glows and changes atop a table as they type. Even the tropical fish seem to be moving around in their long tank in high gear, as if they'd absorbed the urgency of the corporate culture surrounding them.<p>Several groups of visitors mill around in anticipation of their turn in one of the four glass-walled conference rooms along one side of the lobby. With hardly any enclosed rooms built into the Bloomberg headquarters, Bloomberg himself once huddled for two hours in one of the glass-walled rooms with CBS chairman Laurence Tisch. He got a big kick out of his reporters' reactions and the rumors that immediately circulated out of the office about takeovers, since Tisch was only trying to get Bloomberg to increase his donation to the United Jewish Appeal.<p>In the Bloomberg television studios, executives tethered to lavalier mikes wait to participate in one of the many live interviews and forums the company produces daily. After each TV interview, the Bloomberg journalist who asked the questions writes a story and puts it into the computer system and out onto the newswires. The voice portion of the interview is digitally edited as a radio spot at one of the many jet-pilot consoles and loaded into the network as well. The video portion travels out as television. <p>At one edge of the whirl of activity resides Matthew Winkler, who started up and now runs the Bloomberg news operation. Winkler's desk is piled high with a decidedly analog mess of paper-borne data. He wears a credentials tag around his neck and holds a phone to his left ear. "Nobody has been executed yet," Winkler is saying to a caller. "But the firing squad was assembled."<p>A PR official from Banc One has phoned to complain that a story about the bank's losses from derivatives trading was presented as a headline well before the text came over the Bloomberg. The loss had been known to professional observers of the company for some time because of Securities and Exchange Commission filings, so the PR guy is arguing that the headline without the story could have confused the dedicated marketplace. <p>Winkler agrees.<p>"I tell our reporters that we write for dopes and pros," Winkler says. "We have to be wise to the fact that what a reporter thinks is news might not be news to the pro. Today's problem could have been avoided if the headline had simply referred to the SEC report."<p>Winkler is widely regarded as a smart, tough, and driven manager of his reportorial troops. A quote by a former employee in a recent Columbia Journalism Review article compared Winkler's personnel skills to Captain Queeg'swhich didn't bother him muchand his charm to that of fringe political guru Lyndon LaRouche. "That did get to me," Winkler says. "Largely because I don't really know if Lyndon LaRouche is charming or not."<p>Winkler first learned about "the Bloomberg" when he was stationed in London for The Wall Street Journal during the mid-1980s. One day he realized that one of his sources was answering his questions about money and markets with impossible speed and confidence. Winkler finally asked the guy how he did it.<p>Back in New York at WSJ headquarters, Winkler came across Bloomberg and his gee-whiz system again. He was appalled to learn that the WSJ was using Bloomberg's bond information as news. At the time, the Bloomberg bond analyses depended on data from Merrill Lynch, and Winkler thought the source was less than journalistically independent. Though Bloomberg bond news is now drawn from a multitude of sources, newspaper editors occasionally voice a similar concern over the acceptance of free Bloomberg wire reports, the sense being that news given away as brand advertising may be less objective and independent than news sold on the open market. But many of those editors still run Bloomberg news items, and most acknowledge that while the reportage might be short on analysis, the system remains a professional source of pure news.<p>Winkler's distrust of Bloomberg inspired him to cowrite a 1988 Journal feature about the man behind the box. He says he went to some lengths to discover dark secrets about Bloomberg and his business. "The worst thing I came up with was that he gets mad and breaks phones," Winkler says. It was Winkler's story that caused Mike Bloomberg's mother to say "I told you so" about his language.<p>Winkler went to work for Bloomberg not long after that, and much of the news-market skepticism that originally greeted his young army of journalist-irregulars eventually fell away as Winkler drove quality standards higher. A media newsletter recently identified Winkler as one of the most highly remunerated business journalists in the countrythough comparative salaries and titles are frowned on in Bloomberg company culture. The news anchors on the TV service all rotate regularly to avoid anyone becoming more important than the news he or she reads. "I want all our employees to hurt us if they leave us, but I don't want anybody to be able to hurt us fatally," Bloomberg proclaims.<p>"But then again," he adds, rising from his desk in a relatively unprotected sector of the floor housing the Bloomberg radio technology and personnel, "I run this business by trial and error."<p>A stream of celebrities and senior policy mavens flow past Bloomberg's alcove almost every day now, because Bloomberg made a deal to have PBS talk-show host Charlie Rose broadcast his nightly show from a Bloomberg studio. Bloomberg says he looks at Rose's presence as "good for the troops." ("We had Faye Dunaway in here today," he said one afternoon. "You think a reporter who sees superstars like that in here every day will want to go somewhere else? Bullshit!") Bloomberg also seems to admire what he perceives as Charlie Rose's social capabilities. He calls Rose "the ultimate WASP" and notes that Rose dates a woman with acknowledged New York social credentials. Bloomberg says he is interested in potential introductions.<p>Bloomberg talks a great deal about his social life and social aspirationsand about women, with and without generally acceptable rectitudebut he didn't even get up from his work to walk 30 feet to meet Dunaway. He drops his single-guy-on-the-town allusions into conversation, but then he'll spend his weekends sharing hotels and houses with his ex-wife and kids. ("We still jog together and stuff," he says of his former wife, whom he met while at Salomon Brothers. "But I was too obsessed with business for her, and she was too obsessed with macrobiotic food for me.")<p>After Faye Dunaway left, Bloomberg did get up from his desk to travel downtown to offer advice to a gathering of 900 high school students. He told the students about things to do and say in a job interview, and he talked about hard work as a means of transcending an economic station. "I went to a public high school with hundreds of kids too," he told the students. "I worked my way through college. I am the average guy. I'm 53 years old, and I am the average guy."<p>Bloomberg's pleasure atop a podium and interest in charitable and social endeavors cause some friends and employeesand a lot of bankersto suspect that he's ready to back away from hands-on management of the franchise. Others say that the organization has reached a transition point at which a managed corporate structure needs to emerge from the trial-and-error style of the founding entrepreneur.<p>"Bullshit," says Bloomberg.<p>"When everyone in the world knows who Mike Bloomberg is," Matt Winkler says, "then he won't need Bloomberg Financial Markets or Bloomberg Financial News. Then I think he will be able to relax and back away. He says he's like Colonel Sanders these days, but he's a Colonel Sanders who sprints into the kitchen every few minutes to taste the chicken and order the recipe adjusted."<p>"People think I don't have an exit strategy," Bloomberg says a few days later over lunch, a playful look in his eyes. "But I do. My estate will eventually give it all to charity."<p>Bloomberg had ordered a bowl of clear soup 20 minutes earlier. When the soup finally comes, it's the wrong kind. And Bloomberg, who has broken handheld consumer technologies and screamed obscenities at well-paid employees who can't get jobs done to his satisfaction, continues to wait patiently. "You know," the hard-charging billionaire says to the flustered waiter, "it's only soup."<p>Then he launches a typical stream of personal updates. He notes that he didn't like the Financial Times' recent estimate of his personal worth (about $2 billion), nicely making the point that the estimate was there to be looked up. He reports running over a chipmunk while driving near his Westchester County, New York, estate. "I really felt shitty," he says. "Had a tear in my eye. I won't fish because I don't want to kill things. I'll eat a steak, but I'd never walk up and shoot Bessie. Guess I'm kind of a romantic."<p>Bloomberg then says he'd become annoyed with a woman at a party the previous evening because she was complaining about taxes. "Frankly, Madam,' I said to her, I want to pay more taxes. I want more gray hair, more birthdays, and more taxes every spring.' Around then," he says, flashing a grin of genuine accomplishment, "I could tell they were all waiting for me to leave."<p>Later, Bloomberg says, "I know a lot of people would cash out at this point and have a bit more fun than I have. I'm at least going to start to give two days a week to Johns Hopkins when I become chairman next year. But there are still too many new things left to do with the business. <p>"It's ironic, though. Somebody could walk in my office and offer me a trillion dollars for my business. A trillion dollars. Think of all the good that could be done with that money. The day after the transaction there would be an article in the paper," Bloomberg says, his voice trailing off as he nods a smile at the waiter, who is finally bringing his lunch. "But then the day after that would arriveand nobody would know who I am."<p><p>

Worth magazine/Features<p>THE LION KING, SHORN
As Salomon flails, John Gutfreund tells his own bitter tale<p>By Christopher Byron<p>Every morning at around eight, a white-haired Wall Street legend walks off the elevator of a Fifth Avenue office building and goes to work. His name is on the door in raised gold lettering. The door itself is carved pear wood, of the sort that bespeaks permanence and respectability.<p>Unfortunately, once he's inside there isn't much for this 65-year-old man to do. Instead of a bull-market hubbub, his workplace displays an almost deathly calm. On some days the only person he sees is his receptionist, who spends much of her time talking to friends on the phone.<p>Welcome to the grim little world of John H. Gutfreund. Once chairman of Salomon Inc. and the most powerful man in American finance, he now spends his time nursing relationships that would once have been beneath his dignity: money raiser for a small software company, advisor to an obscure Indian mutual fund. He's been working on a deal that could finally return him to the world of high finance--but in a low-key role, as a consultant to one of Salomon's rivals on Wall Street. Nothing is signed yet, so Gutfreund won't reveal the firm's name. He can't afford to blow it.<p>Gutfreund's fall from grace has been extreme: As a sacrificial lamb in the 1991 bond marketrigging scandal at Salomon, he plummeted further, faster, longer, and on less evidence of wrongdoing than any other Wall Street chieftain. While household names like Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken have preserved much of their clout even after serving hard time, Gutfreund has been marginalized despite being cleared of almost all wrongdoing. He has been stripped of much of his wealth and remains hamstrung by a $300 million shareholder lawsuit that intimidates prospective business partners and could make him a pauper.<p>This past summer has been especially bittersweet for the man who once ruled the financial jungle. Gutfreund has enjoyed planning his tentative reincarnation as an elder statesman of Wall Street, activating old contacts and granting his first comprehensive interview in years. It's the start of a long, painful return to life. But he has also watched as Salomon, which he raised from obscurity to immense power, turns into a financial morass for Warren Buffett, the investor he enlisted to save the company back in 1987.<p>In this spectator role, however, Gutfreund at least can indulge in a kind of schadenfreude--for his venom toward the folksy billionaire, whom he blames for his sad state, is clear.<p>"Buffett is a genius, but he's really in a jam now," he says with ill-concealed relish.<p>"It's very difficult when friends shun you because they think you're a crook."<p>John Gutfreund knows this: No matter where he goes or whom he sees, he is treated as a villain. This spring, he faced down the perception during a talk he gave at Dartmouth's Amos Tuck School of Business. He faced it down again when he returned to his alma mater, Oberlin College, for his 45th reunion. And he faced it down once more when Fortune recently reported that he had been "barred from the securities business for life."<p>Gutfreund, who hasn't been barred from anything, sued the magazine, which printed a correction. But he was devastated to realize that his bad-guy image is so entrenched that even business editors believe it. That's partly why he resolved to end four years of brooding isolation. The result has been a kind of personal catharsis, a pouring forth from a man who has kept too much bottled up for too long.<p>Gutfreund's side of the story never got a public airing in the heat of the 1991 scandal. Yet as the former Salomon chairman gives his own blow-by-blow account, the scenario he spins isn't especially flattering. His tale is sprinkled with admissions of failures and missteps, as well as a rather testy defensiveness. Still, his perspective is important historically and provides a telling glimpse into the management culture of 1980s finance, a culture too often built on quicksand.<p>Gutfreund sums up the nub of his defense thus: "I'm simply not a details man." For the bond-rigging scandal in particular, the excuse seems valid. The law-breaking occurred three levels below Gutfreund, and other Salomon officials didn't seem worried about it at first. But it's also a cop-out that's piercingly relevant as Salomon's current crisis escalates. Gutfreund built a company where "details men" weren't highly valued. As with so many Wall Street leaders, his goal was to forge big-money deals. Ensuring that the pursuit was honest and well-documented was a chore for the backroom boys.<p>Under Gutfreund's leadership, Salomon earned a reputation for lax record keeping. Computer systems were unable to produce routine audit trails, and even so basic a matter as the physical security of stock and bond certificates seemed casual, with the result that millions of dollars' worth were stolen from Salomon's vault. Whenever evidence of suspicious behavior was unearthed, Salomon's institutional impulse was frequently like a macho reaction to pain: Ignore it until it puts you in the emergency room.<p>Such an attitude bedevils Salomon to this day. Gutfreund is by no means responsible for the company's current woes: In spite of everything, the year he left was very profitable for Salomon. But his seat-of-the-pants legacy may be seen in the fact that twice in recent months Salomon has taken embarrassing write-downs for failing to reconcile its general ledger accounts--the corporate equivalent of forgetting to balance one's checkbook.<p>Gutfreund appears now to realize the significance of such a culture--and to understand what's at stake. "I look at a company like Barings," he says, "and I see a firm that only yesterday looked as solid as the earth itself. Then along comes some out-of-control kid, one thing leads to the next, and suddenly there's no more Barings. It gives one pause."<p>Right through the 1991 bond scandal, however, Gutfreund was as much a practitioner as anyone else of Wall Street's worst habit: Hoping it'll go away.<p>For 13 years, John Gutfreund ruled supreme as Salomon's chief executive officer and eventually as its chairman. From his beginnings as a Korean War vet working the municipal-bond desk, he had risen to recruit his own worldwide army of 9,000--including a cadre of the most feared investment bankers in the history of high finance. Not for nothing did Business Week tout him on a 1985 cover as "The King of Wall Street."<p>To the public, the morose-looking Gutfreund was best known as a symbol of the 1980s, poster boy for a greedy ethic lampooned by Michael Lewis and Tom Wolfe. He earned millions, lived in a spectacular apartment overlooking the East River, and had an equally grand abode in Paris. Limousines and jets transported him everywhere, and he cut a swath in society with second spouse Susan, a former stewardess who seemed the very incarnation of a trophy wife.<p>Within the world of finance, however, it was another story--a far less cartoonish one. With Gutfreund in command, Salomon Brothers changed the face of Wall Street, engineering the sort of lightning-fast megadeals that have come to dominate investment banking. Like the legendary mail room at the William Morris talent agency, Gutfreund's Salomon spawned a phenomenal array of talents: William Simon, James Wolfensohn, Henry Kaufmann, Lewis Ranieri, John Meriwether, Michael Bloomberg, and many more. The place was mythical among bankers--and Gutfreund was Lion King of its testosterone-soaked trading floor.<p>Then came the bond scandal, and in just 16 weeks Gutfreund saw this world tremble and collapse. Wall Street, true to form, trampled right over him. For many people, Gutfreund's humiliation was fodder for the 1980s morality play. But the truer villain here--and the only person to serve prison time--was Paul Mozer, an intense and self-absorbed young trader for Salomon. Ironically, Mozer didn't even register on Gutfreund's radar until too late. "I barely knew the man," says Gutfreund. "If I'd spoken to him for more than a total of 30 minutes in five years, it would be a lot."<p>The whole thing had started back in the summer of 1990, when Mozer got into a spat with the U.S. Treasury. The dispute arose over debt auctions in which Wall Street's "primary dealers"--Salomon was the largest--would submit bids for government securities. These bids might be for a dealer's own account or for one of its clients. No one was allowed to buy more than 35 percent of whatever was being auctioned.<p>Mozer had publicly chafed at this limit and, according to later charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission, soon began evading it. Mozer, who declined to comment for this article, ultimately settled a civil suit by the SEC without admitting or denying the agency's allegations. He accepted a plea bargain in a related criminal prosecution and was sentenced to four months in prison.<p>By bidding both in Salomon's name and in the name of unwitting Salomon clients, the SEC says, Mozer could illegally snag extra securities for Salomon to trade. In February 1991, however, the maverick had the bad luck to place a fake bid on behalf of a client that had submitted a real bid through another channel. Sharp-eyed Treasury officials noticed that the combined bids exceeded the 35 percent limit.<p>Though no one yet thought this was more than a minor foul-up, Mozer figured he was in trouble about two months later when he got a letter from Treasury raising the issue. So he went to his boss, John Meriwether, and fessed up--sort of. Noting that the government had flagged a violation, Mozer acknowledged making an unauthorized bid but dismissed it as a one-time lapse in judgment. Meriwether believed him.<p>It was just the sort of problem Salomon was ready to overlook. That was doubly true for John Gutfreund, who says he was less active in daily operations than most people realized. Occupied since the mid-1980s with charitable causes, diplomatic activities, and New York's social whirl, he saw himself becoming Solly's Mr. Outside--the face the firm showed to regulators and the world. "Sure, I used to wander the trading floor," he says of tales that he could hear a nickel drop across the room. "But I didn't really get involved in anything. I was like a general walking among his troops."<p>Gutfreund says the business of actually running Salomon fell to Tom Strauss, his president and chief operating officer since 1987, and to the department heads under him. Still, Mozer's screw-up didn't go unnoticed by Gutfreund. After speaking with Mozer, Meriwether called together Strauss and the company's general counsel, Donald Feuerstein. The group quickly agreed that Gutfreund needed to be told about the incident.<p>The three men met with their boss in late April as he was preparing to depart on a business trip. Gutfreund says no one seemed to think the fake bid was terribly serious, and that the session lasted a half-hour at most. But Feuerstein says he told Gutfreund that Mozer had probably committed a crime--and that telling regulators would be both a good idea and a smart safety measure.<p>Most of the meeting, then, was devoted to discussing whom to tell about the phony bid. Should they tip Treasury, which was already steamed at Mozer? Or should they tell the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which also had regulatory power and which liked Salomon better? Neither Meriwether nor Strauss would comment for this story, but the other two participants say the meeting broke with the understanding that Gutfreund and Strauss would chat with Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed, as soon as an opportunity arose.<p>Trouble was, neither man wanted to do the deed. "Bottom line?" says Gutfreund. "I just didn't get around to doing it. There was no pressure of time." And there were plenty of other pressures to distract him. Scarcely had the meeting broken up when Gutfreund resumed his hectic life as Mr. Outside. He flew hither and yon over the coming weeks, and by the time he had returned from a trip to Europe, Mozer's fake bid was a distant, half-repressed memory.<p>That was hardly the case for Mozer himself. According to SEC charges, he kept submitting illegal bids. At a late May auction, Salomon roped a stunning 86 percent of an offering of two-year notes. Other dealers had bet that these notes would drop in value, however, and were waiting to buy them cheap in the secondary market. By cornering the resale market, Salomon caught its rivals in a classic "short squeeze," forcing them to pay exorbitantly to cover their bets. All of Wall Street was livid, believing Salomon had broken the rules. An unsuspecting Gutfreund returned from a trip to Tokyo and walked into the firestorm. Oblivious to the larger pattern--no one at Salomon had connected the events of February and May, he says--the chairman convened a crisis meeting. Mozer attended, says Gutfreund, and nodded brazenly the whole way through.<p>Inside Salomon, concern was slowly building about Mozer. Yet neither Gutfreund nor Strauss had talked to the New York Fed, so government regulators were still unaware of the trader's record. Company counsel Feuerstein, in particular, was getting worried about this fact. He apparently didn't talk to Gutfreund, but says he urged Strauss several times to call Corrigan. And when the SEC opened a formal inquiry into the May squeeze, Feuerstein hired an outside law firm.<p>An internal probe began in early July, and within a month the ugly truth was in full view: Mozer had caused the squeeze--and it was no isolated event. Investigators reported that in at least nine auctions, including the February one, the rogue trader had violated Treasury rules. The aggregate worth of Salomon's illegal overbids was enormous: $15 billion.<p>Now Gutfreund's foot-dragging took on a sinister cast. He had known of a problem since April but had done nothing. An uncharitable observer might even paint him as a co-conspirator. "Sure," Gutfreund says now, "I procrastinated in bringing up an unpleasant topic with the head of the New York Fed. What can I say? With the luxury of hindsight, I can see that it was a mistake."<p>An even bigger mistake would follow. According to Gutfreund, he was advised that Salomon was under no legal obligation to disclose its prior knowledge of Mozer's February overbid. On August 9, therefore, Gutfreund approved a press release revealing that the May bond auction had been rigged. The statement didn't mention that he and others had known of a Mozer problem for months. Gutfreund notes that he didn't draft the release--but he was certainly aware of what it omitted.<p>In any case, the secret didn't stay quiet for long. The following Monday, The Wall Street Journal quoted Salomon insiders saying that Gutfreund had likely known of Mozer's activities far earlier. Federal regulators were rousted into action. Gerald Corrigan of the New York Fed--to whom Gutfreund still hadn't talked--called the Salomon chairman the next day. In icy tones, he told Gutfreund that his actions called into question the competence of the entire firm. Gutfreund says Corrigan told him, "We're looking at revoking Salomon's status as a primary dealer"--a step that could have threatened the company's viability.<p>Gutfreund was shocked: He believed his handling of the matter had been correct, given the facts available at each step. But Salomon director Charles Munger--a representative of investor Warren Buffett --was incensed to hear that the company hadn't told the whole story. He quickly forced Gutfreund to issue a second press release, admitting that Salomon had sat on news of a false Mozer bid for months. This revelation marked open season on Gutfreund. Within two days The New York Times joined the fray with a front-page story featuring photographs of Gutfreund and Strauss.<p>"The second I read that story I knew I would have to resign," says Gutfreund. He resolved on the spot--against the advice of his wife and his lawyer--to bow out gracefully for the sake of the company. "You've heard the TV commercials that say, 'I found my job through The New York Times'? Well, I'm the guy who lost his job the same way."<p>Only at this point, says Gutfreund, did he call his biggest investor, Warren Buffett, to talk about the crisis. This would prove to be the costliest delay of all.<p>Gutfreund had recruited the financial savant from Omaha, Nebraska, in 1987 to keep Salomon from the hands of Ronald Perelman, then viewed as a corporate raider. Through his vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett had plunked down $700 million for a special issue of preferred stock designed to hold the aggressor at bay.<p>For his consideration, the billionaire gained two seats on Salomon's board but not much else: Gutfreund rarely bothered to call him. As a result, Buffett had spent the summer of 1991 stewing as he learned from the newspapers and from his representative, Munger--anywhere but from Gutfreund --about his deteriorating investment. Still, both Buffett and Gutfreund were level-headed businessmen, and the best course of action was clear. "I briefed him on the situation," says Gutfreund, "and I asked him to fly to New York to step in as interim chairman. He agreed."<p>When Buffett arrived, he met with Gutfreund and Gutfreund's lawyer, Philip Howard. On the issue of severance, says Howard, the billionaire coldly refused to put anything in writing. "It was all understood," says Howard, referring to what Gutfreund claims was a verbal agreement to pay Gutfreund his vested retirement rights, various stock options, his 1991 bonus, and two years' salary. In total, the amount came to more than $25 million.<p>An irate Buffett evidently understood nothing of the sort. Shortly after taking over, he had Salomon's board pass a resolution denying anything but token compensation not just to Gutfreund but also to Meriwether and Strauss, both of whom had also resigned. Then Buffett moved to deny the three their retirement and stock benefits. Such rough handling from a businessman known for his probity sealed the idea that Gutfreund was guilty of something.<p>Practical men, Meriwether and Strauss negotiated settlements that gave them about $20 million and $8.5 million, respectively. But Gutfreund, who thought he had acted nobly by falling on his sword, took the insult harder. Feeling deceived, he demanded to go to arbitration. He wound up getting nothing--and that, along with a $100,000 fine from the SEC in 1992 for failing to supervise Mozer's superiors, set the tone for his downward spiral.<p>So recently astride the world, Gutfreund became the embodiment of damaged goods. Some friends stuck by him, developer Alfred Taubman and mogul Laurence Tisch among them. But for most of Wall Street's machers, John Gutfreund became the man who wasn't there, a lion shorn by events that were murky, hard to follow, and neatly summed up in a rhetorical thought: If Gutfreund didn't do anything wrong, why did he quit? And why did Buffett ream him so good?<p>The battering to Gutfreund's pride was extreme. What most observers expected would be a short slump turned into years of phones that never rang. "By last winter, John was a total basket case," says one longtime friend. "He seemed barely able to function at all." Adds a former colleague: "I've worried more than once whether I'd pick up the papers one day and read that John had done something really foolish."<p>Gutfreund says he never saw himself in such a dire state. But he does describe something like shame at his fall. "I figured when I retired, I'd be able to put $1 million or $2 million of my own money into interesting deals that came along," he says bitterly. "Now $100,000 would be a significant amount. A number of people had asked me to manage $10 million or so of their money. But it just didn't seem right when I didn't have any of my own in the pot." <p>It's hard to feel too sorry for Gutfreund: He's still well-off, and he's edging back into the game. But his hard-won humility is welcome in someone who is a former Master of the Universe.<p>Benched from the big leagues of money, Gutfreund remains an astute color commentator. On certain subjects with which he has experience, moreover, he shows the true zeal of a convert. "Controls are deficient throughout all of Wall Street," he warns. "The day will inevitably come when companies get hurt."<p>Ironically, Gutfreund's comments come in early July, just days before Salomon predicts a huge second-quarter loss of $65 million. The hit is completely unexpected and serves as the latest embarrassment for a staggering regime installed by Warren Buffett. To all appearances, Salomon Brothers as Gutfreund knew it is now falling to pieces. More than two dozen top officials have quit this year. Every time one problem is fixed, another one erupts. And though it hardly speaks well for the durability of his work, Gutfreund can't hide a morbid satisfaction at the pain Buffett is feeling.<p>"Running an investment bank is like running a Hollywood studio," he says with a measure of pride. "You have to contend with the huge egos of talented people. If you don't keep them happy, they just pack up and go elsewhere."<p>Gutfreund's smile will likely keep growing this autumn--for his business hopes are brightening even as Buffett faces a tough choice. When he came in as a white knight in 1987, the billionaire bought $700 million in preferred stock, exchangeable for Salomon common at $38 a share. The first tranche comes due in October--about $175 million worth. Given Salomon's woes, Buffett must take the stock: Cashing out would show he's lost faith in the company. But at a recent market price of $36 a common share, the Omahan will be throwing good money after bad.<p>It's a nice illustration of Buffett's bind. But where does all this leave Gutfreund? Well, he's still fighting for his back pay and benefits, and he'll achieve a sad vindication if Salomon flatlines on Buffett's watch. In the meantime, he can boast that he finally has better prospects than the company he left in disgrace. For a humbled legend who once imagined retiring in grand style, it's bitter consolation. But it's consolation nonetheless.

						Ernie Olde is a fourth-generation money man, heir to a proud financial tradition. His forebears would be thrilled to know he built Olde Discount into the nations most profitable brokerage. But what would they make of the anger, hurt, and legal trouble that have accompanied his rise to the top?<p>By William P. Barrett<p>Several times now this century, an E.J. Olde has been laid to rest at the highest point of Clinton Grove Cemetery, a 140-year-old burial ground near the northern Detroit suburb of Mount Clemens. The name has been passed down along a prominent line of money men, beginning with the very first Ernest J. Olde, a German immigrant who made good as a business owner and real estate baron. Today, great-grandson Ernie is wealthier even than <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab</b></a>, his biggest rival.<p>This latter E.J. Olde--culmination of his family line and most successful propagator of its name--is fourth in the declension. He turns 58 this month, a tall, broad man with graying blond hair and, of late, a pronounced paunch. The company he founded, Olde Discount, is the countrys fourth-largest and arguably most profitable discount brokerage, with about 200 offices nationwide. Ernie himself is worth perhaps $800 million. For all this wealth, however, many who know him describe a chronically angry and unhappy individual.<p>Oldes turbulent personality has put him in a standoff with a world whose rules he seems to disdain. Over the years, court and regulatory pleadings have accused him or his firm of everything from securities-law violations to discrimination. Olde has become a virtual exile from the U.S. With his 37-year-old second wife and their two small children, he shuttles among plush residences in Florida, Canada, and the Cayman Islands, a tax haven that seems now to be his main residence. He is absent for long stretches from company headquarters in Detroit.<p>Public photographs of Olde are rare, and he has unlisted telephone numbers in three countries. He didnt respond to requests for an interview, and, after receiving a list of questions, his attorney said that Worths information is grossly inaccurate and part of a sensationalist, malicious attempt to discredit Olde Discount. The company asked for ten days to answer and, after two weeks, supplied a partial response. Oldes top aide, Randal Mudge, had called earlier--but mostly to note that the company that publishes Worth is owned by a unit of Fidelity Investments, one of Oldes main competitors. Mr. Olde does value his privacy, said Mudge. Hes not going to be available to discuss his personal life.<p>Oldes personal life is of interest to many investors, however, for it helps explain the unusually aggressive ethos that pervades the business he has built.<p>On the financial-services map, Detroit is well off the interstate. Yet in 1994, while many big brokerages suffered downturns or laid off employees, Olde Financial, the parent company of Olde Discount, won a place of honor by adding hundreds of workers and earning a hefty $65 million on revenue of $300 million. Discount leader Charles Schwab Corp. made more money, $135 million, but it needed more than three times the revenue and seven times as many customer accounts. Olde Financials profit margin and return on equity may be the best in the brokerage industry.<p>Almost 90 percent of this extraordinary money machine is owned by a single man: Ernie Olde.<p>Olde (pronounced OLE-dee) is a smart businessman with an inventive mind. His refashioning of Olde Discount during the 1980s as Americas full-service discount broker--unlike most other discounters, his brokers give stock recommendations--has been wildly successful. He has exploited market niches brilliantly and attracted customers through simple measures such as slashing fees or offering free trades. His television advertisements are fixtures on CNBC, making Olde a household name for many investors, and he was among the first in the industry to advertise via direct mail and radio.<p>By ignoring derivatives and underwriting, Olde has avoided the big hits that have stung other securities firms. He runs an aggressive, hard-nosed, vertically integrated retail operation that seizes on new ideas and keeps a tight lid on costs. My child has the American work ethic, says Virginia Olde, Ernies mother and one of his biggest fans. One way he cuts expenses is by hiring hundreds of young, driven college graduates willing to work long hours for the training. Another is by putting Olde offices in strip malls.<p>The guy is by far the most brilliant man Ive ever known, says Dave Fleetham, a certified public accountant who worked for Olde for several years. He has very high energy. Sometimes unnaturally high: Once, when Olde visited one of his businesses and found a door locked, he lost patience and kicked it in. Bam! recalls Fleetham. It buckled right down.<p>The story bolsters other ex-Olde executives descriptions of a boss for whom conventional niceties are just obstacles to be surmounted in the pursuit of a goal. Several people even recall Olde bragging that he once sued his own mother--although she denies the story and theres no evidence of such a suit. More prosaically, as a driver, Olde has been convicted of five moving offenses since 1990.<p>Ernies biggest goal has always been accumulating money. Thats all he was interested in, says one person who has worked closely with him. A labor-relations tribunal wrote a few years ago: He is solicitous about his money, and has little tolerance for those who waste it. In fact, Ernies passion for the bottom line is so fiery that one of his own executives once sought to exclude him from a Canadian collective-bargaining session for fear his temper would scuttle the talks.<p>The roots of this money obsession run deep into Olde history, back to all the other E.J.s and their indomitable drive to succeed. But how would Ernies forebears feel to know that, in 1995, their name finally stands for massive wealth--but also for questionable dealing and unfathomable family sadness?<p>The first Ernest Jacob Olde, the family patriarch, was born in Germany in 1847 and came to the U.S. as a boy. In 1862, at age 15, he settled with his family in Mount Clemens, then a spa resort of 1,500 souls. The hardworking young immigrant had a head for money and eventually operated a wide variety of businesses, serving for 25 years as president of the local savings bank.<p>A civic pillar, the original E.J. headed a committee that put a Gideon Bible in each of Mount Clemenss 1,375 hotel rooms during a single day in 1913. His death ten years later from a stroke at age 75 was accompanied by press tributes to his financial prowess and extensive land holdings. He was buried at Clinton Grove, in the family plot he had purchased several decades earlier, leaving behind his wife of 45 years and six children--one of whom was the second E.J. Olde.<p>This E.J., too, was a successful businessman, with his own real estate and construction holdings. In time he might have exceeded his fathers wealth, but he was plagued by ill health. He died at 45 in 1928, just five years after his father, following an operation for thyroid problems. E.J. II came to rest just a few feet north of his father, in his shadow to the very end. He left a wife and three children, including E.J. III.<p>The Depression apparently stripped the Olde family of much of the wealth it had accumulated--and as a result, the third E.J. Olde embarked on his financial career without much of a head start. Still, the Olde zeal shone through. A 21-year-old college student around the time of his fathers death, E.J. III eventually took a job at Household Finance Corp., a nationwide small-loan company. He was a debt collector in Detroit, recalls Virginia Olde, who married him in 1936.<p>Shortly after World War II broke out, E.J. III was promoted to branch manager of the Household Finance office in Port Huron, Michigan. But by wars end, with a growing family to support, he had decided to form his own small-loan business. He got darned tired of taking orders, says Virginia. The only available lending license was in Marine City, a working-class town of 5,000 along the St. Clair River facing Canada, about 40 miles northeast of Detroit. The Oldes moved there in 1946, when their oldest child, E.J. Olde IV--just Ernie, to those who knew him--was seven years old.<p>Marine City proved to be a good pick. Founded in the early 19th century as a shipbuilding center, the town, like many border settlements, had an aura of intrigue and a reputation as a center for smuggling. E.J. III quickly established a E.J. Olde Loans, which specialized in lending money to local customers whose credit was too shaky to get a bank loan. The key to profitability was knowing the borrowers--and Ernest Olde knew them well. In a little pond, he became a big, prosperous fish, a popular fellow, and, like his grandfather, a civic leader. He led fund-raising drives and served as president of the local chamber of commerce.<p>It was in this milieu that young Ernie came of age. He would blossom into an outgoing kid, hardly an academic star but popular with others for his good humor and relative affluence. At tiny Marine City High School he had a starring role in the senior play and a place on the football team--No. 66, right tackle. Says classmate Ed Terhune, who now runs an automobile dealership: He was a generous, good guy. He always had a nice car and money in his pocket. He cared about people.<p>Still, in E.J. IV the Olde work ethic seemed to have sputtered out. The youngster never worked in his fathers firm and, in 1955, the year he graduated from high school, his classmates voted him two superlatives: Laziest and Biggest Eater.<p>Ernie olde is still a man of large appetites, but hes no longer lazy--if indeed he ever was. Virginia Olde says her son was always a hard worker, even if his friends never knew it. And as the business world approached, young Ernie certainly caught fire. He spent summers hauling bricks at local construction sites, for example, and bought a car with his earnings. At the University of Toledo, says his mother, Ernie was so eager to start making money that he finished his studies a half year early. He earned a degree in business administration and served as junior-class treasurer. Clearly, the family traits were beginning to express themselves.<p>During high school Ernie had begun dating Suzanne Conrad, a girl from the wealthier upriver town of St. Clair. Suzannes family had real money: Her father, Howard Conrad, was president of several utility companies. But Ernie was an up-and-comer, and the match seemed a good one. They married in 1961, following Suzannes graduation from Wellesley College in Massachusetts. At the time, the young groom was an engineer for Chevrolet Gear & Axle in Detroit. But just a year later he would move into the sexier securities business, joining First of Michigan Corp.--apparently with some help from his well-connected in-laws.<p>With his drive, savvy, and ingratiating personality, Ernie excelled as a retail broker. Simply put, he was good at convincing strangers he should handle their money--so much so that Kidder, Peabody & Co. hired him in 1967 to open its first Detroit-area office. He started strong at this new post, too, and was helped along by his father-in-law, who allowed him to handle the pension fund for one of his utilities. Still, in 1971 Ernie left Kidder in a dispute over strategy. In an unrelated deposition years later, he would explain the circumstances: I basically believed in the retail business and they basically believed in the institutional business, and over a series of weeks and months, it was determined that I should leave.<p>Even Oldes departure from Kidder, however, turned out to be a blessing. In 1971, bankrolled in large part by Suzannes family, he opened his own retail brokerage, Olde & Co. And from the beginning it made money. He has a brilliant mind, says Eugene Leich, an early partner in the venture. He understood the marketplace. His stuff was innovative and very forward-looking.<p>Ernie had become a real man on the move. Within a few years, he and Suzanne had bought a 22-room, 5,000-square-foot house in fancy Grosse Pointe Park. Their young brood consisted of a daughter, Christine, and a son, Ernst--the fifth E.J. Olde, heir to a family tradition his father seemed destined to take to new heights.<p>Despite its early success, however, Olde & Co. was still small beer compared with the powerful national houses and even local operations like Roney & Co. Ernies big chance would come in 1975, when the Securities and Exchange Commission abolished fixed-rate commissions. Before this change, investors had no real incentive to switch brokers. Now, brokerages could compete on price. Ernie understood the implications: He saw huge growth looming at the low end of the market and decided to capture some of it.<p>Thus was born Olde Discount.<p>It wasnt an easy transition--and it apparently unleashed a darker side to the Olde drive. Ernie was riding a crucial business trend, but the success that followed tore into his personal life. Trying to harness the boom in discount brokering, he worked like a madman, living fast and seeing little of Suzanne and his kids. Meanwhile, all his worst traits--his temper, his unpredictability, his money lust--surfaced under the pressure. It was as if he had started to believe that his financial talent allowed him to behave however he pleased. Ernie was just impossible to work with, says Leich, now a broker at <a name="NYSE:PWJ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11148"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PaineWebber</b></a>. He could be charming one minute and a tyrant the next.<p>Problems began to arise. The firm got hit with three fines in three years for matters such as bad record keeping. In 1978, the SEC censured the firm and Ernie himself for failing to rein in an errant broker. Partly because of Ernies volatile personality, Olde Discount had trouble keeping top talent. Turnover became part of the firms tradition, with Leich and other early executives leaving by 1979. Soon Olde Discount consisted of a revolving cast of minor characters who took their lead from an overworked, increasingly imperious boss.<p>One result of Ernies new habits was the collapse of his marriage into bitterness and reproach. In November 1977 he filed for divorce. The fight dragged on in court for two years amid charges that Ernie wouldnt pay child support and had threatened to hide his assets. (He denied the charges.) Suzanne Olde testified that their two children, Christine and E.J., then 14 and 11, werent close to Ernie. I think the problem is that their father was gone a great deal of the time, she said.<p>Suzannes mother, Martha Conrad, was far more blunt about the family dynamic. Here is her assessment--under oath--of Ernie: A German general ordering this, ordering that. It was never Will you do something? It was always Suzie, do this or do that. Go to this, or go to that. ... His children were neglected.<p>The divorce seems to have combined with other traumas to strip Ernie of familial restraints on his behavior. In 1979, his earliest role model--E.J. III, the stalwart loan man in Marine City--died of a heart ailment at age 72. The elder Olde had sold his business and retired just two years earlier, and his burial at Clinton Grove was the first interment of an E.J. there in more than a half century.<p>That same year, perhaps in need of some reliable support, Ernie convinced his well-liked younger brother, Jim, to leave his career as a schoolteacher and athletic coach and join Olde Discount as executive vice president. Jim had come down with Hodgkins disease in 1974, but the often-fatal illness had been in remission since he had relocated from Michigan to the drier climate of Phoenix. The new post was apparently a hectic one that required travel. On a family vacation to the Detroit area in 1983, Jim Olde became ill and checked into a hospital. The Hodgkins had returned in a big way. Jim never saw Arizona again, dying within a month at age 41. His remains were interred at Clinton Grove, and Ernie Olde was more alone than ever before.<p>Ernies son, meanwhile, had also been having problems--and by all accounts, his relationship with his father, who thought him a slacker, was prime among them. Like Ernie himself, E.J. was no genius in school. But childhood buddies remember him mostly as a great kid whose only real failing was a lack of ambition. Though he was in several advanced classes, E.J. preferred talking cars to doing homework.<p>Ernie tried to get the boy to shape up. Craig Fahle, a childhood friend, remembers the time Ernie coached their Little League team. He was a hell of a lot more demanding on E.J. than on the other players, recalls Fahle. If it wasnt picture perfect, Ernie was unhappy. E.J. felt he could never live up to his dads high standards. For the son of a rich man, E.J. was curiously penniless in high school. A caption in his senior yearbook reads: E.J. + MONEY = Miracle. Friends say Ernie would give E.J. a top-of-the-line Toyota Supra, only to take it back when he was angry.<p>The youngster finally began acting out in destructive ways--drinking and taking drugs. Less serious warning signs had been there for years: During the divorce proceeding, Suzanne Olde testified that she once found 11-year-old E.J. on the street taking tennis balls and putting lighter fluid on them and throwing them.<p>Through these troubles, ernie somehow remained focused on his driving goal. I want to be the richest man on Griswold Street, former executives recall him writing in memos, referring to Detroits financial district. As a result, the 1980s would become an extraordinarily productive time for Olde Discount. In the three years after Jim Oldes death, the firms offices doubled to a total of 95 nationwide. Soon after, Ernie launched what was perhaps his greatest idea--a stock-research department called Special Ventures.<p>Stock research is the only real difference between discounters and full-service stockbrokers. Ernie wanted to close that gap while maintaining his price edge--and to increase his profit considerably in the process. But traditional research costs money, so Ernie had to come up with a new way of doing things. The method he chose was simple: Olde Discount would push smaller stocks in which it made a market--meaning it could sell them to customers from its own inventory. Thus, on many trades Olde would profit on the commission and also on the markup between a stocks bid and ask prices. At first, the research that backed these recommendations was often skimpy, although the firm has since beefed it up.<p>The birth of Special Ventures would result in another growth spurt for Olde Discount. It would also generate chances for loose dealing--and by this time, Ernie had been deprived of most calming family ties and counsel from longtime colleagues. Before long, according to confidential memos from Oldes own lawyers, he began a push into illegal front-running.<p>Front-running occurs when a securities firm buys a companys shares knowing it will soon recommend the stock. When share prices rise on the recommendation, the brokerage can sell the stock to its own customers for a profit. Such a scheme was detailed in two memos from the well-regarded Chicago law firm of Fagel, Haber & Maragos, which Olde Discount had hired to handle regulatory matters.<p>In the first memo, dated June 1, 1988, the firm warns that regulators might conclude Olde Discount was taking advantage of its customers and blame Ernie Olde. The second memo, dated July 2, 1990, goes even further, accusing Ernie himself of front-running for personal gain. Both memos--which Olde Discount executives have called ill informed and wrong--surfaced during the criminal trial that resulted from Ernies 1990 firing of his own president, Herbert Burns, for allegedly embezzling $5,000 worth of postage.<p>The two-week-long Burns trial is one of the most bizarre events in Oldes career, painting an unsparing picture of Ernie as a paranoid leader who monitored his top lieutenant with a hidden video camera and a secret tape recorder. In an especially strange twist, Burnss lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger--now the attorney for death doctor Jack Kevorkian--tried unsuccessfully to admit testimony about an incident in which Ernie allegedly ordered an Olde executive to drive him through a customs barrier at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel because Ernie was smuggling cocaine from Canada. Ernie has denied the accusation.<p>More relevantly, Fieger argued that the entire prosecution was a ploy by Ernie to destroy Burnss credibility in case he squealed about the alleged front-running, and that Burns had been using the Olde postage meter to pay off valid company debts. The jury apparently agreed, acquitting Burns after a mere two hours of deliberation. Burns didnt get away completely clean: Regulators later disciplined him on a side issue. Neither Ernie nor his firm was ever charged with front-running.<p>The Burns verdict was only one of a number of legal problems that piled up throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Burns filed a $20 million lawsuit against Olde Financial that is now in arbitration. A retired Olde Financial senior vice president received a big settlement--other former executives say $1 million--after he sued the company, alleging self-dealing and commingling. A group of Canadian workers sued Ernie himself for $23.5 million, claiming among other things that their termination from an Olde printing company was accompanied by efforts to juggle the books. That suit, in which Olde denies any wrongdoing, is still pending.<p>Olde Discount also continued to have regulatory difficulties. In 1986 the New York Stock Exchange fined Olde a hefty $60,000; in 1992 it levied a $35,000 penalty for violations of securities rules. Between 1986 and 1993, the National Association of Securities Dealers fined Olde seven times. Olde Discount officials have characterized these matters as minor.<p>Then there are the accounts of racial and sexual bias. To Olde watchers, the most recently publicized charges--made by a group of female former employees--are old hat. Around the Olde organization, Ernie has long been known as someone who wants only young white men working for him. Indeed, a former Olde Discount recruiter says in a 1993 lawsuit that he was fired after violating instructions not to hire women, handicapped persons, black persons, persons with various other ethnic backgrounds, and anyone over 50 years old. Olde denies the charge; the case is in arbitration.<p>Despite these problems, Ernie has continued to profit handsomely from Olde Discount. Since 1991, according to regulatory filings, he or companies he owns have been paid more than $75 million by Olde Financial in salary, bonus, rent for properties leased to the company, and payments for services rendered. In 1994 alone, Ernie and his companies received more than $23 million in payments.<p>In 1982 Ernie moved from Detroit to Florida, which has no state income tax. Within the past year or so he has moved into a lush home in the Cayman Islands, which has hardly any taxes at all. Now he shuttles between these two places and a farm fronting Lake St. Clair in Stoney Point, Ontario, about 40 miles east of Detroit. Hes also said to spend time in Italy and Aspen, Colorado. The one place for which he apparently has little patience is Detroit proper, where his son, E.J., spent much of the 1980s growing into a very disturbed young man.<p>Since his teenage years, E.J. had worked occasionally for his father at Olde Discount--not on the financial side but on unglamorous tasks such as real estate supervision. Former Olde employees recall heated arguments between Ernie and the son he saw as a disappointment. In one curious incident, E.J. drove a company car to his college, Western State College in Gunnison, Colorado, and refused to give it back. Several Olde Discount managers were pressed into service as repo men in the mountains of Colorado.<p>E.J. dropped out of Western State after two years, returning to the Detroit area in 1989. He kept working for Olde Discount but his lackluster performance, erratic behavior, and trips to rehab caused increasing friction with Ernie. E.J. would be ready for the barrage whenever his dad entered the room, says Joe Taylor, who was fired as president of an Olde-owned courier firm in 1990. He felt he couldnt do anything right in his fathers eyes. I can recall Ernie telling me, I dont know what Im going to do with the kid.<p>Sometime in the summer or fall of 1992, E.J. left the Olde payroll. Still, the boyish-looking youngster sometimes returned to the Olde complex at Griswold Street and West Lafayette Boulevard, aimlessly walking the hallways. Hed sit down with top executives for conversations they would later recall as bizarre, paranoid, and delusional, ranting about a conspiracy involving various friends and his father. It was clear he needed psychiatric help.<p>About 10:40 a.m. on Friday, October 23, 1992, Dale Stamper stepped out of the elevator on the tenth floor of the Olde building at 131 West Lafayette, a former home of the Detroit Free Press. The maintenance supervisor--a pal of E.J.s--was heading up to check a roofing project. As he turned into the stairwell, he saw a lifeless figure, clad in a green jacket and khaki pants, hanging by the neck from an orange extension cord. Stamper recognized the corpse of his young friend--an image he still sees in nightmares.<p>The body was formally identified by Randal Mudge, Oldes top aide. Ernie was out of town.<p>On Monday, October 26, 1992, 25-year-old E.J. Olde joined his more illustrious forebears in the family plot at Clinton Grove, the youngest E.J. Olde ever to be buried there. Many of his friends, especially those from high school, missed the service: No death notice had appeared in the newspapers. <p>Sometime during 1993, however, Ernie did pay public tribute to his sons memory. A bronze sculpture--a boy clad in shorts, sitting with his arm around a puppy--appeared over E.J.s grave. Cemetery officials say Ernie commissioned the unusual work. A memorial to E.J. was also placed on a wall at Olde headquarters.<p>Meanwhile, Ernie remains in firm control of other matters. At Olde Financial he still has final word, though he now leaves most daily operations to well-paid subordinates. The firms performance has been so stellar lately, however, that its very success may be raising a question among regulators and prospective clients: Has Olde been doing too well?<p>Oldes latest annual 10-K filing says the firms number of regular customer accounts has stagnated recently--not a good sign. First-quarter 1995 earnings were off a shade, which is curious in a bull market. And The New York Times has reported that Olde Discount is among a group of brokerages being questioned in an SEC probe. (Neither Olde nor the SEC will comment.) Several nasty arbitration cases are also nearing resolution, while discrimination claims continue to attract national attention. Living reclusively on Grand Cayman, Ernie looks ever more like an exile.<p>On the personal front, however, friends say hes a little happier these days. Hes gotten married again, for one thing. It happened in 1991; his bride was Sue Shaheen, a Canadian 20 years his junior. Ernie reportedly met her when their cars were stopped together at a traffic light. Later in 1991, Sue gave birth to a girl. She and Ernie named the new baby Erica Jean--E.J. Olde once again.<p>Maybe they knew the old family name could do with some fresh hope.<p>
OLDE DISCOUNT: QUITE A DEAL, BUT FOR WHOM?<p>By William P. Barrett<p>At Olde Discount, Ernie Olde offers his clients what seems like a great deal: a full-service brokerage at cut-rate prices. How can he provide this bargain and still reap such high profits? The answer lies in the sort of full service offered by Olde.<p>At most discount brokerages, the people who answer the phones dont much care what stocks their customers buy: Theyre paid a flat salary and offer no expert opinions. At Olde Discount, however, representatives are given incentives to cold-call clients and suggest that they buy little-known stocks recommended by Oldes researchers--a twist on regular full-service shops, which follow a broader range of stocks.<p>According to employees who have left the company, Olde pays its brokers only $1,200 a month. To rise above that, employees rely on trading commissions or credits. If they sell shares of well-known issues such as IBM or General Motors, they get to keep 10 percent or less of the firms commission. But if they book trades involving 200 or so stocks on a Special Ventures list, they may take home three times as much. Why the difference? Generally speaking, Olde can sell customers these stocks from its own inventory--allowing it a nice potential profit on the markup.<p>Oldes Special Ventures list consists mainly of small Nasdaq stocks, and the firms researchers rate most of the issues a buy. While some SV stocks are well-known, like McDonalds and PepsiCo, most are obscure. Ever hear of Melamine Chemicals or Modine Manufacturing? For Olde, trading in such issues is so lucrative that the firm will waive its commission for any buy order of 1,000 shares or more.<p>If customers want to buy a non-SV stock, meanwhile, Olde brokers will often consult a company-issued cross-sell directory and suggest a lesser-known SV stock instead. Some examples from an Olde list dated January 1994: Customers interested in Southwest Airlines would be directed to Atlantic Southeast Airlines; Hewlett-Packard buyers might be directed to Acuson.<p>A Worth survey of SV issues recommended by Olde in March 1994 suggests they underperformed broader market indexes over a year, but not by much. This showing is respectable--except that buyers of many SV stocks take on more risk due to the volatility of smaller issues. In addition, the spread between bid and asked prices means that most SV buyers start off in the hole. Olde says its own studies show better results.<p>Olde also encourages margin buying--allowing customers to buy stocks with funds lent by Olde itself. This is a valid strategy, but its risky and best practiced by experienced investors with substantial assets. Olde has made it a backbone of its largely low-rent business, however: On a handout given to trainees, the firm suggests explaining margin buying to customers who say they have no money. Over the past four years, Oldes margin lending has gone up tenfold. In 1994 revenue from such loans reached $60 million, one fifth of the firms intake.<p>Accompanying all this is extreme pressure on Oldes young hires--and on their customers. In classes, Olde gives trainee brokers suggested dialogues to help snag deals quickly. Once the client says Yes,  one memo urges, keep asking for more. A sample closing line: Lets buy 2,000 shares--or would you be more comfortable with 1,000 shares? Or: I like all five of these stocks. Which ones do you like best? Great! Lets buy those. Other dialogues tell how to discourage clients from consulting with their spouses--or from requesting any information in writing.<p>Of course, Olde Discount can show regulators a manual that contains four pages of factors its brokers are supposed to review with customers before soliciting a trade. That looks good. But then theres the 1993 memo that Dan Katzman, an Olde vice president, sent to his brokers--along with three-minute egg timers. We simply do not have enough time to spend a half hour a day with each customer, wrote Katzman.<p>This type of pressure is directed at hundreds of new hires every year, often eager, clean-cut white men taken fresh from college. Olde Discount has become something of a farm team for full-service brokerages and larger discounters such as Charles Schwab. Despite the stressful atmosphere, therefore, many employees are grateful for the intense training they get at Olde.<p>Besides, if theyre good at making money for Ernie, they get rewarded. I was earning $60,000 after one year, says one former Olde broker. The problem is that I couldnt sleep at night.<p><p><p>

						<p>They want to work less, own less, want less. They call it voluntary simplicity, and its neither as easy nor as odd as it sounds.<p>By John Brant<p>On a crystalline spring evening in Oregon, a warm clear light bathes the pews of downtown Portlands Old Church. A fresh breeze combs the high trees along the Park Blocks. Far away on the eastern horizon, Mount Hood gleams in the days dying sunshine.<p>Dick Roy stands at the church door, greeting friends and counting the gate. The turnout--around a hundred--represents a fair cross-section of professional Portland. Gathered are the citys physicians, architects, and senior executives, its park-district board members, art-museum docents, and PBS subscribers, the kind of people youd want directing your corporation, examining your contract, or paddling your canoe. In the midst of this shining evening, in the prime of their lives and careers, at the heart of one of the nations fairest and most prosperous cities, these citizens have shown up for a lecture about voluntary simplicity. Theyve come to learn the curious, difficult, transforming art of wanting and working less.<p>Most everybody here seems to know Roy, either from his former life as a corporate attorney--a partner in Portlands most prestigious firm, a Harvard Law School graduate sought for his easy manner and lucid way of solving business problems--or from his new life, which he began in 1993. In the fall of that year Roy stunned Oregons legal and corporate communities by resigning from his firm to throw himself full time into the promulgation of simple, environmentally responsible living, a calling he and his wife, Jeanne, had been following privately for years.<p>We never needed very many material things to make us happy, and we reached a point where we were financially independent, Roy says during a lull in the ticket collection. I decided that from then on I could donate 100 percent of my income to what I thought was important, or else 100 percent of my time. I chose the latter.<p>Shortly after he left his job to start the nonprofit Northwest Earth Institute, which is sponsoring tonights talk, a profile of Roy appeared in the Portland Oregonian. The reader response was overwhelming--the Roys received more than 600 calls and letters, mostly from people seeking to make similar changes. Downshifting had clearly struck a responsive chord in this thriving city, just as it has in less-favored communities across the nation.<p>Downshifting is an infelicitous term for a movement toward simplicity, a gesture toward grace. It refers to choosing to make do with less. Like Melvilles Bartleby the Scrivener, the downshifter prefers not to: not to sacrifice relationships with family, friends, and community in exchange for career advancement; not to defer hopes and ideals in the name of making a living; not to fall prey to the lures of heedless consumption.<p>Evidence of this preferring-not-to is burgeoning across America. Earlier this summer the Merck Family Fund published the results of a national public-opinion survey examining Americans views on consumption, materialism, and the environment. An eye-popping 28 percent of the respondents said that during the past five years they had made voluntary changes in their lives that resulted in their earning less money--not including those who had simply retired. The most common changes were reducing work hours, changing to a lower-paying job, and quitting work to stay at home. <p>According to the survey, 68 percent of those who downshifted did so to pursue a more balanced life; 66 percent wanted more time; 63 percent were seeking a less stressful life. Fifty-three percent downshifted to spend more time with their children. A resounding 87 percent of the downshifters described themselves as happy with their change, while only 35 percent reported missing the extra income.<p>Moreover, the polls related findings suggested that these downshifters are acting on convictions held by a much wider segment of the general population. Seventy-one percent of the respondents said they had more possessions than their parents did at the same age, 66 percent reported being more financially secure, and 61 percent indicated they lived in a nicer apartment or house. Only 49 percent, however, described themselves as happier than their parents.<p>More and more people are both enervated by the frenetic pace and demands and frustrated by their inability to find viable alternatives to life in the fast lane, says David Shi, president of Furman University and author of two influential books about simple living. Two-income homes, working mothers, the 12-hour workday--people are just worn-out.<p>For these exhausted citizens, downshifting seems to represent both a means of escape and a compensatory historical law. Our abiding national imperative has always been to work harder and longer, to want and claim more, to spread out as far as our appetites and the landscape will allow. But running concurrently through our history has been a countering dream: Thoreaus pond, cabin, canoe, and garden; a career of service; a goal of sufficiency rather than surfeit.<p>In struggling toward some version of this vision, the great majority of downshifters fall short of the 100 percent commitment of Dick Roy. Instead, a father cuts back on his office hours to spend more time with his young children; a teacher shares her fifth-grade classroom to avoid the burnout affecting so many of her colleagues; an accountant resigns from her large firm to work at home and choose her own clients and hours. Because of its diffuse and disparate nature, downshifting defies precise measurements and marketing analysis; thus far, no ones figured out how to get rich off it. Its a movement comprising millions of individuals making countless personal choices. <p>In certain settings, however, downshifters are emerging in particularly bold and representative relief. Here in the Pacific Northwest, downshifting tenets are taking root among prosperous professionals in organizations such as Portlands Northwest Earth Institute and the New Road Map Foundation in Seattle. The feeling is strong that if you cant do it in the Pacific Northwest--if a person cant manage a healthy balance between work, family, and community and if the region cant decide on a path of responsible, sustainable economic growth--then it cant be done anywhere, Roy says, moving toward the front of the church. Theres a great hunger here for achieving that balance, which has to be built upon personal responsibility and some degree of voluntary simplicity. <p>At the lectern, Roy explains the Earth Institutes mission of carrying the voluntary-simplicity message into the workplace. Thus far, he says, 110 organizations and 2,500 people have participated in the institutes classes and workshops, whose texts are drawn from writers ranging from Wendell Berry to Anne Morrow Lindbergh to tonights speaker, Duane Elgin.<p>In 1981, Elgin, formerly a scholar at the Stanford Research Institute and a self-described MBA gone bad, wrote Voluntary Simplicity, which has since become a standard work in the field. We can describe voluntary simplicity as a manner of living that is outwardly more simple and inwardly more rich, Elgin explained in that book. The objective is not dogmatically to live with less, but is a more demanding intention of living with balance in order to find a life of greater purpose, fulfillment and satisfaction.<p>Elgin, a bearish, bearded, soft-spoken man, takes the lectern. Apocalyptic thinking tinges some aspects of the voluntary-simplicity movement, and Elgin speculates that looming shortages in global supplies of nonrenewable resources will eventually force people in wealthy countries to consume less. But Elgins message is largely optimistic and inclusive. He finishes his talk by addressing some myths about voluntary simplicity: that it entails living in poverty, abandoning city comforts for rural hardships, eschewing beauty, or adopting a life of drop-out, screw-off hedonism. You dont just go down to the coffeehouse and hang out with other prime-of-life slackers, he concludes. Through simple living youre actually dropping in: to community, to family, to relationships.<p>The crowd laps it up. They ask spirited questions, sign mailing lists, and continue the discussion during the coffee hour afterward. In between signing copies of his books, Elgin scornfully mentions a snotty article about the downshifting phenomenon that recently appeared in a prominent national magazine. The tone of that article deeply bothered me, he says. These are peoples lives were talking about. Downshifting and voluntary simplicity arent mere West Coast woo-woo. Theyre not just a few more passing trends. The foundation of simple living entails development of the spirit and the inner life. Simple living is a matter of the heart.<p>Embodying these words, Dick Roy stands deep in conversation with a knot of earnest, middle-aged men and women. Were living at a time when much of the underlying nature of society is inherently destructive, he says in a patient voice. The good news is that, in America, in Portland, we also have an enormous amount of free will. Jeanne and I, he adds, gesturing across the room to his wife, decided to focus our energy on free will.<p>Dick Roy serves as a prototype of one genus of downshifter, the men or women whose very success causes them to challenge the premises of the American dream. These philosophical downshifters, however, might represent only a visible and vocal minority of those heeding simplicitys call. Increasingly--perhaps epidemically--Americas professionals are having downshifting thrust upon them. More and more, downshifting is becoming synonymous with economic downturn, says Gerald Celente of the Trends Research Institute. Aging baby boomers are being downsized and responding, I dont want to work for a corporation any more. I gave them 15 or 20 years of my life and lost my job for all my trouble. Now Id rather work less, earn less, and spend less. <p>But preferring not to doesnt come easily to a man or woman reeling from job loss. Thats clear on a June morning in Cleveland as a group of downsized professionals gather in a long windowless room above the Asian market. Like the 90 or so idled executives whove driven to this meeting, the neighborhood stands in transition, a jumble of potholed streets, brick warehouses, and neon-bright minimalls, bisected by Interstate 90 as it roars toward the downtown office towers jutting along the lip of Lake Erie. Those gleaming towers lie barely a mile away. To the jobless climbing from their cars on this hazy morning, however, they seem as distant and unattainable as the Andes.<p>The downsized dont waste time staring into the distance. The defining moment of their week awaits. Straightening their ties, brushing off their blue blazers, fingering their briefcases, they file quickly into the meeting room, grab coffee in Styrofoam cups, swap hail-fellow-well-mets with their neighbors, and settle into folding chairs. The mornings speaker is introduced, a psychologist who will talk about the stress of unemployment. Then, each in turn, the members of the Career Initiatives Center rise for their exercise in self-marketing.<p>They include Steve Nemeth, a production manager who has hit the bricks three times in the last eight years; Tony Markatos, released five and a half years ago from his aerospace job in Southern California and never fully employed since; and Peter Kovalesky, a cost analyst late of a defense-industry job. One by one they state their retooled, carefully crafted career plans--looking to utilize my ability to help midsize companies solve their communications problems; seeking to help articulate clear goals for venture capitalists--until its Doug Daleys turn.<p>Hi, Im Doug Daley, and my career path has been more like a mine field, he says in a light, ironic voice. Eyebrows are raised around the room. Im a corporate attorney with over 25 years experience, but since losing my job with University Hospitals, Ive been reconsidering my profession. Ive recently come to the conclusion that to enjoy being an attorney, you have to be a shark. Well, Im a dolphin, not a shark. Now Im looking for a position in a not-for-profit or a social-service agency.<p>Daley sits down amid sympathetic titters. On the surface, he and his modest ambitions seem admirable but hardly arresting; you certainly wouldnt mark this graying, conservatively dressed, middle-aged lawyer as a revolutionary. Yet Doug Daley is in fact a man standing at the crossroads of two central trends: the diminishing of the traditional job culture and the hunger for a simpler, more meaningful life.<p>The facts and numbers of the downsizing era form a dispiriting litany, a chant that, in Cleveland, sounds like a requiem for an entire way of life. From 1980 to 1990, Fortune 500 companies cut more than 3 million jobs nationwide. The Cleveland area, with a relatively high percentage of multinational corporate headquarters and traditional reliance on heavy manufacturing, was particularly devastated. From 1981 to 1991, 87,500 manufacturing jobs--23 percent of the pre-downsizing total--were lost in the Cleveland area.<p>Through the heaviest hemorrhaging in the 80s, the great bulk of the jobs lost were in the blue-collar sector. In the last part of the decade, however, with the impact of technological innovation and global competition, the bell began to toll for white-collar employees. Especially stricken were the middle managers of large manufacturing enterprises, the contract parsers and number crunchers and payroll jockeys, just the sort of people gathering this morning.<p>The purpose of CIC, a nonprofit cooperative, is to provide support, training, and community for professionals encountering a shifting job market. And most of the members will eventually find new jobs. The positions, though, will likely be with much smaller companies and at a 20 percent cut in pay. And these people will likely be looking for work again within five years.<p>Given this, Doug Daleys proposed career shift begins to sound more hardheaded than whimsical. Rather than try to outguess the next flip in the job market or await some ham-handed, politically motivated mass action, Daley and a growing number of workers are choosing to shorten their perimeters, spend and consume less, and seek satisfaction from sources beyond the exigencies of an insecure workplace, a capricious marketplace, and an increasingly bankrupt government. Simplicity, these people will tell you, equals security.<p>At the conclusion of the Monday morning meeting in Cleveland, the downsized make a bullrush for the door, then tear across the parking lot toward the CIC offices. They anticipate a morning of intense networking, a hungry casing of fresh job listings, and a hot-eyed rush to the phones to follow up leads. Daylight is burning, and many of these people are feeling antsy. It would be different if my services werent required, Tony Markatos, the former aerospace systems analyst, tells me passionately. But corporations need what I can give them. I just have to break through. I just have to get my story to the people doing the hiring.<p>Markatos rips off across the parking lot toward the desks and phones. Doug Daley ambles patiently in his wake.<p>On a rare sun-drenched saturday morning, Linda Farris and Paul Wilson sit over coffee at the big kitchen table of their home in southwest Portland. They live on a quiet street shaded by high Douglas firs and graced by rambling houses with imaginative gardens; Wilson and Farriss own house sings with the additional resonance of being paid for. The paid-off mortgage came as a byproduct of three years of mindful frugality.<p>Children of the 60s, Farris and Wilson never planned to chase money. They envisioned lives of service, emotional and intellectual fulfillment, and environmental responsibility, ideals their generation imbibed like mothers milk. Indeed, after the two graduated from elite, liberal Reed College in Portland in 1972, their standard of living barely blipped. Even after Farris labored through medical school and Wilson earned graduate degrees in forestry and law, they got around in just one car. They took buses and arranged Byzantine schedules and bought used books but never considered themselves needy. They were driven by motives other than money. <p>But gradually, incrementally, without much conscious effort, the couple started to prosper. They finished school and paid off their loans. With a double professional income and no kids, they could easily afford the restaurant meal, the weekend getaway, the winter ski trip. They bought a second car.<p>I really enjoyed getting that car, Farris recalls with a laugh. I figured, Im a doctor now! Why shouldnt I have my own car? <p> Farris opened a small internal-medicine practice. Wilson rose through a series of public-policy posts to become administrative director of the environmental law program at the Lewis and Clark College law school in Portland.<p>It was fun, says Wilson, an intense, articulate man with a graying, neatly trimmed beard. After ten years of married life, we had a double income and some time and inclination to enjoy it. We bought art. We went out for a lot of $50 dinners. We started drinking nice wine and putting together our own cellar.<p>A few years after their daughter, Kat, was born in 1984, Farris and Wilson learned of the work of Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin. Dominguez and Robin, authors of the best-selling Your Money or Your Life, had developed a program for attaining financial independence through moderate, commonsensical frugality, painstaking analysis of every penny earned and spent, and prudent investing. The goal was to stop working for money and to use the resulting time and energy for volunteer and creative pursuits. The idea appealed strongly to Wilson and Farris but on a safely theoretical basis. My attitude was Listen, Im sorry, I spent enough years pinching and counting pennies to start doing it again now,  says Farris. I figured, Im employed, Im a doctor, I deserve to enjoy life a little. <p>So on they rolled through the end of the easy money 80s. Portland was booming, life was on the increase. Finally, in 1990, the couple found time to listen to audio tapes of a Dominguez and Robin workshop. We began going through a transition, says Farris. The program was the best tool we could find for reducing our environmental impact. We started following it, but its only been in the last few years that we started getting really serious about it.<p>During those recent years, according to Wilson, the family saved a ton of money. They paid off their mortgage and, more important, were able to downshift their careers. Farris trimmed her hours significantly. Wilson left his job at the law school to spend more time with the family and pursue freelance projects. He writes, runs his own mediation consulting business, and has served on the board of several environmental organizations. He helped design the curriculum for Dick and Jeanne Roys Northwest Earth Institute.<p>Farris and Wilson refer to themselves as liberated. Yet they acknowledge that liberation comes at a price. You cant downshift and realistically expect to remain in a mainstream position of power or authority, Wilson says. Sometimes--often--I look at the people who are making the major decisions in government and other institutions and realize that Ive chosen to remove myself from that level. I might tell myself I could do better, but the truth is Im not willing to jump through the hoops to attain and hold those positions.<p>Wilsons conflict hints at downshiftings darker side, the anxieties and dilemmas that dont appear in public-opinion polls or other studies treating downshifting as a cultural phenomenon rather than as one experienced uniquely by each downshifter and his or her family. For example, the Merck survey found that 60 percent of its downshifting respondents were women, indicating it might be more difficult for men--however intensely they might be questioning the dominant cultural paradigms of acquisition and career success--to cut loose from those paradigms.<p>Similarly, it is one thing for an accomplished, secure, financially independent, middle-age professional such as Linda Farris to change or scale back her career, and quite another for a young person out to prove and support herself. One of the things our economy is best at is providing people with the opportunity to strive and distinguish themselves, says Dick Roy. The drive to excel, to make your mark, is extremely well ingrained. A life of voluntary simplicity--at least as weve developed it so far--doesnt provide a younger person with the same clear-cut opportunities for satisfying that drive.<p>Meanwhile, older downshifters, especially those doing so more of necessity than choice--face challenges of a different order. Ive got an age problem, an overqualified problem, and a defense-industry-background problem, says Peter Kovalesky, who at 52 recently lost his job as a cost analyst with Westinghouse. But I look on my unemployment as an opportunity to do something different. My wife and I run a volunteer, peer-counseling program for 18 teenagers. Now Ive got a chance to grow the program. I think its the greatest thing in the world.<p>Kovaleskys optimism, however, will most likely temper once his severance pay runs out and he and his wife are forced to subsist on her salary as a public-school teacher and whats left of his unemployment insurance. Sure, weve got our bad days, he says. Days when my wife comes home from school and shes so tired. Public schools arent the places they used to be, you know. There are days when I want to be able to say to my wife, Hon, go ahead and retire. Days when Id just love to have an office to go to.<p>Dick Roys early career followed a classical Horatio Alger arc, showing no signs of the seismic midlife shift to come. He was raised by a single mother under struggling circumstances in the small eastern Oregon town of Baker City. An ROTC scholarship got him through Oregon State University, where he studied civil engineering. While at Oregon State, he also met and married Jeanne Hawley, an energetic young woman from Portland who shared Roys bedrock middle-class ambitions. Upon graduating, Roy was commissioned as a naval officer, and in 1963 the young couple left for a remote posting in Alaska. After leaving the Navy in 1965, he earned a masters degree in engineering at Stanford, then a law degree at Harvard. While Dick read the law at Harvard during the height of Vietnam-era cultural ferment, he and Jeanne read the environmentalist philosophers and marveled at the photos of Earth taken from the Apollo spaceships. <p>We made a lot of our most important decisions at that point, Roy says. We wouldnt have more than one child of our own--two of our three kids are adopted. We would have a garden and recycle everything possible. We would have just one car.<p>Dick Roys present car is a small, eight-year-old, dun-colored Honda, which just now is carrying him west through heavy Friday noon traffic from Portland to suburban Beaverton. He has a lunch meeting with a group of employees at a medium-size electronics-manufacturing firm who have signed up for the Earth Institute course in voluntary simplicity. He dips off the freeway and passes the massive, futuristic world campus of <a name="NYSE:NKE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14254"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Nike, Inc.</b></a>; headquarters of the vastly successful Tektronix Inc. lie nearby. This green, hilly former farmland is the heart of both Portlands high-tech boom and its new urban sprawl.<p>Portland is growing at a stunning pace, not only in population but also in economic vibrancy, and the city is fighting to maintain its small-town, environmentally sensitive soul. Aware of their abundant blessings and sobered by the destruction of signature local resources such as wild salmon and old-growth timber, an increasing number of Portlanders are haunted by the intimation that here, finally, the right economic balance must be struck, the mythical good life achieved. Sustainability, voluntary simplicity, and personal rightsizing have become civic passions.<p>Churning along in his reliable little Honda, Roy seems like just the person to cultivate and channel those passions. I think Im ideally suited to bring the voluntary-simplicity message into the workplace, he says. Because of the success I had as an attorney, Ive got a great deal of credibility within the business community. We need to make it clear that downshifting, choosing to live more frugally, arent just fringe ideas divorced from the normal working persons concerns. The workplace is where people put most of their energy and talent and aspirations. And its certainly where people spend most of their time.<p>The offices of Deanco Corp. hum with the silent melody of a well-run company. This is Roys first visit to the company, yet he wheels around the unfamiliar halls with an easy grace. A fit, vigorous, steely-eyed man, he looks every bit the former attorney and naval officer.<p>In a large conference room a dozen people look up pleasantly from their Gardenburgers and containers of pasta salad. The class, equally divided by gender, is made up of young, bright, relaxed, open-collar administrators and engineers, along with one spike-haired dude from the shipping room. Roy welcomes them to the program and for the next half-hour lays out his heretical yet nonthreatening rap.<p>He reviews the reading in the upcoming course. He talks about voluntary simplicity and describes the circumstances of his own downshifting. He lists all the corporations and bureaus that have taken his course, ranging from <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a> and Columbia Sportswear to the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Attorneys Office. Then, changing gears, he describes a group of people in Seattle who, through conscious frugality, live comfortably on less than $500 per person per month.<p>See, if you really take this seriously, Roy says lightly, you can get rid of everything and really start enjoying life.<p>The flourishing, confident folks at Deanco respond with polite, oh-sure-someday laughter. Dick Roy waits for a tactical, appraising moment--long enough to let the first seeds of doubt take root around the the room--then laughs along with them.<p>Doug Daleys got a live one on the phone, an angry, frightened, and confused woman just laid off from a major firm in Cleveland. I think CIC might be just the place for you, he says softly, rocking forward in the chair, gesturing for the kibitzers around the front desk to pipe down. Its the day after the self-marketing session, and Daley is putting in his volunteer hours as day manager at the CIC. He explains the centers mission to the woman, then covers the mouthpiece with his hand. Shes calming down, he whispers, with a smile and a wink. Sure, people change their minds about their jobs once they come here, Daley tells her. As a matter of fact, I changed my mind myself.<p>Daleys own growth through joblessness began in 1991, when he temporarily left his position as associate general counsel for University Hospitals of Cleveland to have hip surgery. After graduating from Ohio State University law school in 1969, Daley sailed into corporate practice. At Midland-Ross, a former Fortune 500 company since dissolved in a leveraged buyout, his work required extensive international travel. Two subsequent jobs, each bearing increased responsibilities and salaries, followed. Still, despite his success, Daley harbored doubts about his profession. The low esteem the public holds for lawyers really started to bother me, he says.<p>While Daley was recuperating from hip surgery in 91, he was shuffled out of a job. Daley decided to take a break from the law. For a year and half he sold mens suits in a department store, rocking back on his heels, humming along with the Muzak, counting the clicks of the escalator. Finally, disgusted at the waste of his time and talents, he quit the store late in 1993. I decided it was better to be an unemployed lawyer than an underemployed clerk, he says. Daley started dipping into his retirement funds to pay his bills and spending time at the Career Initiatives Center, looking for another legal job.<p>Daleys purpose wasnt to downshift, but while going through the centers self-assessment test, he began questioning his professional goals. At the same time, he found enjoyment and satisfaction in performing networking and counseling chores around the center. Hes turned his job search in that direction.<p>The historian David Shi points out that while voluntary simplicity has gone in and out of vogue for centuries--Jesus, Buddha, Thoreau, and Gandhi, after all, could all be construed as their respective eras equivalent of downshifters--it has always represented a minority report. Voluntary simplicity--consciously, deliberately choosing a more frugal, simple way of life--runs against the grain of our consumer culture, he says. Unless they have no choice about the matter, and if history is any indication, a majority of Americans are never going to live simply.<p>Indeed, even in Cleveland, the fat life seems always at hand. Downtown, in the shadow of the various corporate headquarters, baseball fans fill the new, jewel-like Jacobs Stadium for Indians games. The Cleveland Clinic, Case Western Reserve University, and the citys museums and cultural institutions are all flourishing. Down at the Flats along the Cuyahoga, young professionals sip drinks at sidewalk cafes and watch the giant barges lumber through. A few blocks away, the postmodernist blade of the brand-new Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum thrusts confidently into the future.<p>But here at the CIC, in the booming shadow of the interstate, the future bears a more layered cast. Morning winds down, and with it the early euphoria and sense of purpose. A dozen or so diehards are still poring over job listings and bleakly considering an afternoon of cold-calling prospective employers, but most of the members have flaked off for home. Doug Daley still energetically mans the front desk, fielding phone calls, directing traffic.<p>Watching him work, Im reminded of an observation Paul Wilson had made in Portland. Whatever world youre in, one part tends to reinforce the next, he said. The mainstream job culture is full of reinforcements--a salary, a structure for your time, an office to go to every morning, clothes to wear, people to talk to, a title or profession to label yourself with. When youre safely in that world, it all makes perfect sense, and you couldnt imagine living differently.<p>But it works the same way in a simpler life, Wilson continued. You might start riding a bike to work for exercise, for instance. But riding a bike makes you aware of the air youre breathing, which leads to rethinking your consumption and recycling patterns. You cut down on all the stuff cluttering up your house and realize you really dont need such a big house. And without a big house, you dont need a high-pressure, self-destructive job to pay for it. One morning, you wake up and wonder how you ever could have lived that way.<p>Doug Daley looks like he hasnt been on a bike for decades, and global warming is probably the least of his concerns. Yet he, too, is striving for an artful and sustaining balance while struggling to leave one world for another.<p>This makes me feel good, he says, gesturing toward the desk and the phone. Helping each other out makes a lot us feel good.<p>Sometimes I look back and regret its taken me this long to come to these conclusions, to make these changes, but thats who I am, thats how I got here, Daley says. If a lot of money doesnt follow, thats all right. I figure Ive got 15 to 20 years more in my working life. Ive already spent that long being unhappy, personally and professionally. For the second half of my life, I want to be able to get up in the morning and go to work with the semblance of a smile on my face.<p><p>

						July/August 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> JOHN GRISHAM, MEET JENNY JONES <p>David Ramus is a best-selling novelist for the 1990s: a pony-tailed ex-junkie with a dysfunctional family, a string of wives, and a Frenchman on his tail. It's great for book sales but a bit maddening for the art-world folks to whom Ramus still owes millions. <p> By Vincent Coppola  <p> So glad you could make it." Judy Carlisle smiles and welcomes the FBI agent who's trying to put her former husband in prison. Many other enemies of soon-to-be-famous novelist David Ramus have joined her today, making for a grim choir in the gray-green U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Atlanta.  <p> For the occasion, the 40-year-old Ramus is dressed in funeral black, as befits a trendy writer. The pony-tailed former art dealer doesn't glance back at Carlisle, his third ex-wife, to whom he owes more than $200,000. Seated at a crowded defense table, Ramus just shakes his head bleakly as a dozen attorneys take turns denouncing and defending him.  <p> "We're not talking isolated instances of fraud and dishonesty," fumes one lawyer, setting the day's tone. "We're talking wholesale fraud and dishonesty."  <p> When summoned to the stand, the embattled Ramus opens with grand bravado, declaring himself a man whose "great love was art." Unfortunately, he adds, he was also an alcoholic and an addict. "People don't trust me," he says, groping for humility. "I understand why." His voice is as resonant as a Pentecostal preacher's. <p> But soon Ramus wilts under a barrage of questions. The writer turns to Judge James Massey, seeking aid as the lawyers swarm at him. "I invoke my Fifth Amendment rights," he says, sweating. "Your Honor? How should I say it? I take the Fifth? The Fifth?" <p> Before the hearing is over, Ramus has invoked his constitutional right more than 100 times, refusing even to identify his signature on a bounced check. The FBI man snorts in disgust, realizing he won't get any clues here about the whereabouts of millions Ramus says he lost in the art market from 1991 to 1993.  <p> Carlisle whispers bitterly: "He thinks he's smarter than everybody."<p>But Judge Massey isn't impressed by Ramus. "This is a no-brainer," he says, tossing control of the author's tangled affairs to acourt-appointed trustee. "He can't block off ... his past." <p> Six weeks later it's May, and David Ramus's past hasn't just caught up with him, it's threatening to roll right over him. Besides being bankrupt, the novelist is reviled in the highest circles of the art world. He's being dogged by a former French paratrooper bent on justice. And the U.S. Attorney in Atlanta has just announced three felony fraud charges that could put him in prison for 30 years. With the exception of Cathy, his fourth and current wife, everyone who knows Ramus seems to be suing or vilifying him. <p> But in a bizarre 1990s twist, all this might actually be good news. Ramus's trial will likely coincide with a marketing blitz to support his appearance on best-seller lists this fall. Having received $1 million for domestic rights to his first book, Thief of Light, he's being promoted as John Grisham with earrings and a tattoo on his butt. The criminal charges should combine with a $200,000 publicity budget and a 125,000-copy first printing to propel Ramus to instant fame.  <p> Thief deserves much of the success it will get. The book is a pulpy but full-tilt thriller about art dealer Adrian Sellars, a man addicted to heroin and high risk. Sellars has a lucrative sideline, commissioning fraudulent paintings that Japanese gangsters use to bribe politicians back home. When the arrangement falls apart, he's targeted by razor-wielding yakuza. The made-for-Hollywood scenario may not be plausible, but it's gut-wrenching in its honesty: Many of the plot points, including a harrowing heroin withdrawal, come from Ramus's life.  <p> The book is also a dead-on account of the furious hustle that went on behind the genteel scrim of Madison Avenue's art galleries, auction houses, and salons during the speculative 1980s. In Thief, Impressionist masterpieces are merely "pictures" and appreciation means a jump in retail value. Empty seats make inflated bids at overheated auctions, while "recently unearthed estate pieces" flow through the back door from nearby galleries. In 1995, as the art market begins to perk once more, it's a timely portrait. <p> Again, Ramus knows what he's talking about. The 1980s art bubble was his habitat, the pivot on which his life has turned. First, this unforgiving market landed him in a psychiatric ward, wracked by withdrawal pains and with a herd of creditors on his tail. Then, at his lowest point, it supplied the material for his reinvention as a blockbuster novelist. It's been quite a turnaround for Ramus, a college dropout whose previous experience with creative writing was limited to bad checks.  <p> On a drizzly spring day, Ramus allows a visitor into his rented Atlanta house. In person, the writer's mildness seems at odds with his flashy image: He's like a piano teacher who wants to pass for a pirate. After greeting his guest, he glances into the front yard, fearful that a process server, or an irate Frenchman, might be lurking in the azaleas. Then he locks the door and sinks into a brown velvet sofa. Brushing back his shoulder-length hair, he tries to explain how he came to land on the cusp between fame and misfortune.  <p> Like his new novel, Ramus's story quickly accelerates beyond the twists and turns of standard fiction. It's a dysfunctional family saga, played out against an art market that reached obscene levels of greed just as Ramus himself spun out of control. "I was one of those people born without a barometer as to who he was," he says. "So you try to grab on to something to define yourself. If it's not your reflection in some woman's eye, maybe it's drugs. Or money."  <p> Or all of the above.  <p> Ramus grew up amid the wealth of Palm Beach, Florida, in a family where illusion often masked a harsh reality. His maternal grandfather, Milton Freshman, was an auctioneer who moved to Florida from Atlantic City after World War II. Freshman always kept a chauffeured Rolls-Royce outside his elegant Trosby Auction Galleries on Royal Poinciana Way. As a liquidator of prominent estates, he was a legendary businessman, but as a Jew, he wasn't invited through many front doors.  <p> Richard Ramus, David's father, was a burly man, six feet five inches tall, who married Freshman's daughter Connie, a profoundly troubled young woman. From the start, Richard struggled to live up to the expectations of his richer in-laws and took it out on his family. "My husband was unaffectionate, super sensitive, angry," says Ramus's mother, now named Connie Kaufman. Indeed, Richard Ramus exudes bitterness even today. "David is my son," he says before hanging up on a reporter. "Unfortunately."  <p> Kaufman herself suffered savage bouts of depression. One time David found her overdosing on pills in a Holiday Inn. Another time she slit her wrists. As she was wheeled away on a gurney, she screamed at her terrified son: "Who are you to save my life?" Ramus's parents divorced when he was about ten, remarried, and divorced again when he was a teenager. "Our home was stormy," Kaufman says now.  <p> Palm Beach, meanwhile, was idyllic. For a role model Ramus chose his uncle Bobby Freshman, whom he remembers as "romantic and beyond cool." With his friend Reed Galin, now a correspondent for CBS News, Ramus lounged at the beach, played tennis at the country club, rode his bike along the coast. "It must have been such a dichotomy for him," says Galin. "He knew he was lucky, but at the same time he had this really troubled family." Indeed, the youngster's loneliness was palpable. He began drinking and liberated pills from his mother's medicine cabinet, passing them out like jelly beans in an attempt to make himself more popular. <p> Ramus did poorly in school. His real education came when he passed through the neoclassical faade of his grandfather's auction house. There he'd spend hours. Paintings told stories to Ramus; he could sense every brush stroke, understand every emotion, feel life pulsing beneath the varnish and oils, a gift marvelously apparent in Thief of Light. Nonetheless, Palm Beach began to seem like a prison. His friendship with Galin faded, while his relationship with Richard Ramus festered. "David always wanted to do it better than his father had," says Galin.  <p> If so, he seemed destined to fail. Searching for a sense of family, the younger Ramus also stumbled into a disastrous marriage. It ended when his young wife cleared their apartment into a rental van and drove off. He dropped out of the University of Florida after just a year studying painting. "I had no talent," he says."But it was clear to me who did, as clear as if a light was shining on them. I began to believe I could be a great art dealer." <p> His opportunity would come, but at the price of losing his only hero. In 1973, Bobby Freshman died of a heart attack on the golf course. Soon afterward, patriarch Milton Freshman developed Alzheimer's disease. Despite some misgivings, Richard Ramus was tapped to take over Trosby Auction Galleries. David swallowed his pride to become vice president. "I wanted very much to have a father," he says. "A wise father in a gray suit and a striped tie. A man I could go to and say, Dad, what do I do now?' "  <p> But Richard Ramus wasn't much of an example. The business was already shaky due to years of high-expense living by the Freshmans. In 1979 the elder Ramus moved shop to Atlanta, but he couldn't stave off the inevitable. Within three years, Trosby had declared bankruptcy. More than 200 clients were left unpaid for a half-million dollars in jewelry, antiques, and furniture the Ramuses had sold. Richard got a slap on the wrist from the Georgia Auctioneer's Commission for mixing company funds with clients' money. David was never censured, and quickly began distancing himself from his father's ethics. "That's the irony here," says Bernard Karr, a New York antiques dealer who knows both men.  <p> By 1980, David Ramus had started up a side business appraising art for insurance companies. With the collapse of Trosby, this would become his route into independent art dealing. He was just 25, but his timing couldn't have been better.  <p> Before long, Ramus found a valuable 19th-century painting covered in dust on a local woman's porch. The lady wouldn't sell for a penny less than $15,000, so he brought in a collector who put up $7,500 and cosigned a $7,500 note. It was the young man's first taste of speculative debt.  <p> In New York, Christie's agreed to auction the painting. Ramus was sure he'd get $30,000. But he encountered what he says was a "knockout ring," a scheme in which dealers collude to lower the winning bid. His first big deal looked set to top out at $25,000. Heart pounding, only a few dollars in his pocket, Ramus began bidding to force the price up. It was a huge risk but when he ended by getting his price, the rush was as good as drugs. He began rising fast.  <p> "I didn't learn the right lesson," he says now. "The right lesson was to take the safe $25,000 and buy another good painting to sell. But I have this thing there's never gonna be enough on the plate for me."  <p> His appetite carried over into his personal life. He dated women who were emotionally adrift, eager to believe in the dashing art dealer. In turn, they would mother him and get high with him. A marriage to Atlanta heiress Lisa Dettelbach flared bright and fell apart. Then Ramus met Judy Carlisle, a custodian's daughter from Michigan who had come south to study art. "He was so charming, so tasteful," Carlisle recalls, her voice dripping venom. "An artist with all these sensitivities." Their common-law marriage produced a daughter in 1987.  <p> Ramus was in the fast lane now, living on Park Avenue in New York City, wearing Armani, and advertising in Vanity Fair just as the art market exploded. Two Mercedes gleamed in the driveway of his Atlanta condo. He flew to Paris to buy off the walls of the best galleries. A million dollars in paintings,Renoir, Matisse, Monet, Degas, passed through his galleries each month. Another fortune vanished up his nose. Even conservative collectors found him seductive, an avatar of all that was right with the 1980s. <p> "I was working my ass off," says Ramus. "And I was partying. Drinking, smoking pot, snorting coke." His world was as chaotic as a Kandinsky. "You knew when you got invited to David's house, you'd get ripped out of your mind," says Ramus's current wife, Cathy, who was part of the same scene. "We'd smoke pot, eat caviar, drink vodka out of little shooters." In darker rooms, Ramus would vacuum up cocaine and pop the Dilaudid tablets he got from a friendly dentist.  <p> One night at Chez Jacqueline, a restaurant in lower Manhattan, Ramus approached the daughter of a New York movie icon.  <p> "Have you ever smoked opium?"  <p> "No," she replied, "but I've got some heroin. Come with me to the bathroom."  <p> "That was it," says Ramus. "I knew what heroin did. It was what I was looking for, something to fill the hole inside me."  <p> "What is a painting worth?" asks David Ramus philosophically. "It's a couple of dollars worth of oil paint on a couple of dollars worth of canvas. It becomes valuable only when enough people have a shared perception that it's worth money."  <p> During the go-go 1980s, however, everyone suddenly shared this perception. Many even believed art got more valuable daily. And because they did, it did. Fine art doubled in price annually. In 1987, Van Gogh's Irises sold for $53.9 million. Dealers and art investors expected to see a $100 million painting before long.  <p> Amid the insanity, Ramus thrived. He jetted to Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka, where corporate buyers snapped up all the French Impressionist paintings he could deliver, even bad ones. "I made a lot of people a lot of money," he says proudly. But by now he was buying paintings on payment schedules that would make a used-car dealer blanch. He was confident that the surging market would always bail him out. "I could walk into any gallery and say, I love that. How much is it?' " he says.  <p> In the South, Ramus became something of a celebrity. A group of prominent collectors funded a million-dollar line of credit for him at an Atlanta bank, allowing them to share in his profits. Among his new partners were swells such as millionaire banker Scott Probasco Jr., carpet magnate Nathan Lipson, and blue-blood businessman Noel Wadsworth. These men had no idea whom they were bankrolling. "Everybody is happy," says Ramus. "But nobody knows I'm a performing addict, snorting vast quantities of heroin." <p> In December 1989, the performance came to a crashing halt when Ramus's body gave out. He detoxed in an Atlanta psychiatric ward, an experience he captures to the last twitch and spasm in Thief of Light. Then he flew to the Betty Ford Clinic to get his head together. While still hospitalized, he sold a painting by the French artist mile Bernard for $1 million, clearing a $250,000 profit. He might have kicked heroin, but he was still addicted to another kind of rush.  <p> In the fall of 1990, however, the art market's fever finally broke. "It was like somebody threw a switch," says Ramus. Pundits blamed slumping Tokyo real estate, overambitious auction houses, rumors of war in the Middle East. Whatever the cause, it was no short-term phenomenon, the bubble had burst. At some auctions only one in five pieces sold. Sotheby's stock fell almost 65 percent.  <p> Ramus flew into a panic: His life was based entirely on rising prices. "My dealers stop buying," he says. "I have a $40,000-a-month payment here, a $30,000-a-month payment there, $10,000 over there. A $6,000 interest bill. A judge decides I should give [Carlisle, with whom he had split] $14,000 a month in temporary alimony. I can't sell a thing to save my life, so I start taking whatever I can get. A $300,000 picture goes for $50,000. I've got people screaming at me for money. If you're the loudmouth that's going to hurt me the most, you get paid."  <p> Hundreds of dealers saw their businesses wither and die this way and thousands of fine-art "investors" were stuck with big losses or paintings they never wanted for their own walls. That's not why Ramus has been spending so much time in court lately. To understand why everyone wants his hide, consider instead this fact: On June 30, 1992, the balance sheet at David Ramus Ltd. listed assets of $3.1 million. A year later, when Ramus shutdown his business, he was $4 million in the hole. "The question occurs:Where did the money go?" says Peter Quist, one of the attorneys at this spring's bankruptcy hearing.  <p> On this issue Ramus is rather vague. But he hardly allayed his debtors' suspicions by leaving nothing in the window of his defunct Atlanta gallery but a magician's hat and some playing cards. <p> Jokers.  <p> For three years now, Jean-Pierre Guillaume has pursued Ramus as doggedly as Inspector Javert stalked Jean Valjean in Les Miserables.It was Guillaume and his wife, Suzanne, who pressured the U.S. Attorney's office to indict the former art dealer this May. As with many of Ramus's creditors, Guillaume's gripe concerns a painting that Ramus sold without handing over the proceeds. This practice, prosecutors allege, could explain much of the money missing from Ramus's business.  <p> Guillaume is the son of renowned Paris art dealer Paul Guillaume, who was an intimate of Picasso and Modigliani. The Frenchman first met Ramus while living on a peanut farm in southern Georgia. Guillaume was getting divorced, and his art collection was to be divided in the settlement. Ramus came to appraise it and did a good job, too, says Guillaume.  <p> The real trouble started in 1991, when Guillaume consigned a painting, William Merritt Chase's Wash Day in Brooklyn, to Ramus for sale. The art dealer got $145,000 for it from millionaire Atlanta developer Thomas G. Cousins but he didn't notify Guillaume of the sale and, federal prosecutors say, kept the money for himself.  <p> Guillaume sued and won, but Ramus defaulted after making just two reimbursement payments. Then, according to a judgment by Fulton Country Superior Court, Ramus sold the Chase painting again for $151,500. This time he didn't pay Cousins. Irked that Ramus had profited twice from his art, Guillaume bombarded local prosecutors with documents, depositions, allegations. "I've got to prove that the justice system works," he says. "It is one of the reasons I came to America."  <p> Ramus frets that Guillaume, who saw combat as a paratrooper in Algeria, might be passionate enough to take justice into his own hands. The bearded, 60-year-old Frenchman seems loath to reassure him. He shrugs when asked whether he has ever followed Ramus around Atlanta in his Land Rover. "I am not in that business anymore," he says jokingly.  <p> Such fears, lawsuits, and judgments are piled like snowdrifts over Ramus's life. According to bankruptcy papers, he owes at least $3.6 million to private creditors and another $357,000 in taxes. His rich southern investors are on the hook for his $1 million credit line. Ramus even owes his boyhood friend, Reed Galin, who says he lost $125,000 when an Andrew Wyeth painting vanished.  <p> Although he can't quite explain where all the money and paintings went, Ramus swears he'll pay his debts eventually. Remorse, however, is a different matter. Playing back events in his mind, he says, he's not sure he'd do anything differently.  <p> "I couldn't bear being a failure," he says.  <p> "This is how I live now," says Ramus with  a sigh. He's conducting an Architectural Digest tour in reverse, pointing to a crack in the ceiling. "This bathroom leaks. We can't use it." He scurries past a set of glass doors, not wanting to draw attention to the swimming pool.  <p> "We sold the stereo to buy groceries," he claims. "And I almost got $800 for that couch from a pregnant woman. I told her velvet would feel so good when the baby was born. I had her this close. "Ramus plops himself forlornly onto the couch. "Please keep in mind," he says, "that the only person whose lifestyle changed because of all this has been me."  <p> But in fact, Ramus has been doing fine lately, especially considering that, according to his bankruptcy filing, he has no income. True, his Japanese jet-setting has been scaled back to sushi on Wednesday nights. But Cathy Ramus just got a new BMW. And Ramus himself enjoys an occasional stay at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Palm Beach "for research." For this return to luxe, the couple must thank Ramus's production of one of 1995's most eagerly awaited novels. <p> Ramus wrote Thief of Light in ten months, starting in October1993. His preparation included two days in jail, the arrest was engineered by Guillaume, a few beers with local novelist Charles McNair, an evening writing course at Emory University, and the unshakable notion of "a guy in a box with no way out." The book was pecked out on a borrowed word processor as Cathy acted out many of the scenes for him. Says Ramus: "It felt as natural to me as a boxer stepping into a ring."  <p> McNair's own first novel, Land o' Goshen, had taken 14 years to write, so he was dubious about his protg's chances. "On a hot summer day, he brought the manuscript to my front steps," says the writer. "He was so scruffy-looking I didn't even let him in the house. I took it and sat on the porch, thinking I'd read a few pages and send him the obligatory Hang in there' note. But soon I was consumed."  <p> McNair gave Ramus the name of a New York editor, and within days the publishing world was a buzz over a thriller that read like a freight train. Soon Harper Collins executive editor Larry Ashmead, who'd read the manuscript himself, made an offer: $500,000. At the time, Ramus was unemployed and Cathy was cooking for $7 an hour. Ramus's agent turned him down anyway. Ashmead doubled his bid, and Ramus had a new career.  <p> "It was hilarious," says art dealer Vance Jordan, who had spent two years and a small fortune to collect $200,000 Ramus owed him. "I figured the news stories were a plant. I never thought the guy was literate."   <p> Next came a race to see who'd get dibs on this bonanza. Ramus set up JJN, a limited-liability company named for his three daughters, with his wife as sole shareholder. JJN received the first payment from Harper Collins and quickly paid $51,000 to Ramus's creditors, a move that did little to assuage them, especially when they heard about Cathy's new BMW.  <p> In November, Guillaume and others tried to establish that their fraud claims took precedence over any other losses. But a month later six of Ramus's major creditors, the southern art collectors, forced the newly hot author into Chapter 11, putting all other legal maneuvers on hold.  <p> In the resulting bankruptcy filing, Ramus listed assets of just $1,500.  <p> Which leaves us, as they say, in medias res. Ramus has earned another $700,000 selling the foreign rights to Thief of Light. He's working on a second novel, keeping a weather eye out for FBI agents and unhappy Frenchmen. And he's coaching his daughter Juliana's soccer team. After he was indicted on criminal charges in May, he went out and treated himself to a thick steak covered in barnaise sauce at Chops, one of Atlanta's top restaurants. <p> The novelist's trial will likely get underway around the time Thief hits bookstores this fall. A huge promotional campaign in September will feature his sensitive face, full-page ad in The New York Times, national tours, television and radio commercials. Ramus will squeeze in court dates between the interviews. Meanwhile, the whole affair is already fading from memory in New York's art world, pushed into the background by a market that's once again attracting "fresh meat," to use the Thief term.   <p> "Believe me," says dealer Vance Jordan, "David Ramus is no longer the most wanted man on Madison Avenue. The most wanted man right now is a new client."  <p><p>

						America's top financial talk-radio host is smooth, all right--so smooth he could take the Mafia's money as a kid and still have a million people listen to his advice. It'll be harder to talk his way out of links to investment swindlers and a sex scandal. <p>By Christopher Byron<p>Sonny Bloch settles behind a microphone in his little studio in Tampa, Florida, flips some switches and spins some knobs, and begins his nightly ritual of seduction. Over the airwaves his voice spreads like a balm, soothing an AM dial that's more often inflamed by hate and fear. Bloch, by contrast, seeks to reassure. His subject is personal finance; his mission is to ease the frustration of everyone who's ever been confused by fine print and fast talk.<p>Bloch listens to problems and he gives back plain truths. He charms the young lovers who want to buy a new home together. He comforts the retiree who wants to withdraw money from a Keogh account without penalties. He bonds with the bus driver who is refinancing a second mortgage. For more than a million listeners in 41 states, he is shrink and accountant in one. People lay bare their lives and their bank accounts for him. In return, he gives them straight talk for an age in which money provokes more anxiety than even sex.<p>Like all talk-radio stars, the 58-year-old Bloch builds his business on intimacy--or rather, the illusion of it. Since Franklin Roosevelt we have invited these disembodied voices into our homes, and over time we have come to trust them. Rush Limbaugh tells us how to think; Dr. Ruth how to make love. And in the 1990s, ever-growing numbers of people tell us how to mind our money. Perhaps a half-dozen personal-finance experts now dispense advice nationally over the AM airwaves; many more operate locally. Some of the names are familiar: Ken and Daria Dolan, Adriane Berg, Bill Bresnan. Bloch stands above them all in his easy rapport with listeners. People feel they know Sonny Bloch. When they stop his Cadillac to thank him for his help--and they do--it's as if he himself had talked the bank into approving their loans.<p>Perhaps as a result of such devotion, Bloch's show is the longest-running of its type in the country. He attracts gilt-edged advertisers such as <a name="NYSE:S"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11338"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sears</b></a>, Lincoln Mercury, and The Wall Street Journal, and welcomes guests such as Gerald Ford, Louis Rukeyser, and W. Randall Jones, founder of Worth. Bloch is heard nightly on stations including powerful WOR-AM in New York. Yet beneath it all, The Sonny Bloch Show is just that--a show. And Sonny himself is its velvet voice for hire. Despite his listeners' loyalty, he's not always looking out for them. As with many of radio's financial talkers, Bloch is also interested in making money for himself. And his on-air expertise, it turns out, is a shtick that's for sale to just about anyone.<p>Demand for financially oriented talk radio is higher than ever, but there's little policing of what goes out over the airwaves. As a result, radio-based swindles are proliferating, often targeting credulous advice-show listeners as their victims. From Dallas to Buffalo to Miami, schemes involving everything from pesos to stamps to trivia quizzes have been shut down. And shockingly, several of the deals under investigation have been pitched by Sonny Bloch himself. If talk radio is the 1990s equivalent of 1980s televangelism, then Bloch may become its first Jim Bakker--a star struck low by scandal. Three grand juries are investigating Bloch's promotion of various soured investments, while the Securities and Exchange Commission is also probing his conduct. There may even be a sex controversy brewing: When the Feds raided Bloch's condominium on Tampa Bay earlier this year, they found what court papers describe as videotapes showing Bloch in sex acts with apparently underage females.<p>Bloch says he's been an innocent dupe in some financial shenanigans--and he dismisses the sex tapes as products of his own youth, so dated as to be "almost laughable." He will look you full in the face as he makes his defenses, and his voice will never waver. For a moment, you may even believe him. But then you'll discover that Sonny Bloch's tales seldom add up to the whole story. There's a pattern of half-truths here that makes the very idea of Bloch being Middle America's financial advisor seem laughable.<p>In fact, Bloch's life story is a saga almost Runyonesque in its color and bathos. Ever since he spent one heady year as a lounge singer, it seems, Sonny has hungered for fame and fortune. And he has followed that dream the only way he knows how: He takes the money, he asks few questions, and he makes sure the show goes on.<p>It's a lesson he learned young, on the payroll of none other than Mafia boss Meyer Lansky.<p>
In the summer of 1958, rock 'n' roll was sweeping the country, and young Sonny Bloch, who had a knack for music and was in his fourth year at the University of Miami, wanted to be part of it. He was already a big man on campus: president of his fraternity and the pep club, dating the most beautiful coeds. But the action--the adulation--was in music, so it was toward music that Bloch turned.<p>A born salesman and charmer, Bloch formed his own group. He called it the Coralairs, and it featured himself as lead singer, with four classmates as backup: Sal, Tony, Dave, and Arnie. But the group needed a single to take to the radio stations, and no Miami recording label was interested. So Sonny asked his father, a successful real estate developer in Detroit, to set up a vanity label. Bee Records was born and quickly produced a 45 with Sonny's own "A Lover Is a Fool" on the A side and, on the flip, an up-tempo jingle called "Baby Blue Eyes."<p>It'd be nice to think that Miami immediately went mad for the record, and there's a side of Sonny that remembers it that way. But Sal Ronci, the group's arranger and trumpet player, tells a different story. Tracked down in Daytona Beach, Florida, he strokes a graying mustache and talks of payola: "We had to give a local DJ 10 percent of the business" to get the record airplay. The tactic worked: Soon everyone in Miami was toe-tapping to the Coralairs, and the group was booked at local nightspots like The Rockin' M.B. Sonny became a local celebrity. Wherever he went, teenage girls would begin squealing. It was great.<p>One night toward the end of spring semester, an agent approached the band. Would they come to Havana and play a place called El Comodoro? Four thousand for the week? Free room and board? Cuba then was America's fantasy island, shimmering like a forbidden city in the Caribbean sun. "Of course we were interested," says Sonny. "Wouldn't you have been?" It was all too exciting. Havana! Guys and Dolls, Sky Masterson. They were headed for adventure, five clean-cut guys in their chinos and a dinged-up Ford station wagon with "Sonny Bloch & The Coralairs" painted along the side.<p>In those days you could still catch a ferry from Key West to Cuba, just 90 miles away. The trip lasted maybe eight hours and deposited Bloch just minutes from Malecon Boulevard, Havana's answer to the Cannes Croisette. A man was waiting on the pier. He was short, thin, impeccably dressed. But there was something about him that Sonny and his band mates remember vividly even now--something cold and unblinking. "Welcome to Havana," said the stranger in perfect English. "My name is Santo Trafficante. You will be my guests on the island."<p>The boys were stunned by the scene in Havana. They were normal American youths, half-mad from testosterone poisoning even in the best of times. Now they had landed in a world where the smells, sights, and sounds of sex were everywhere. Fifteen-year-old putas stood on every street corner, while beautiful showgirls scampered naked between dressing rooms. The lads explored with gusto--and so it was not until a few nights later that Arnie sat bolt upright from a book he was reading about Cuba.<p>"Listen to this!" he announced, white as a sheet. "Do you know who this Trafficante guy really is?" The band members blanched in turn at the news: Santo Trafficante of Tampa, Florida, was a mob kingpin and drug smuggler who controlled every brothel and nightspot in Havana. "I was a nice Jewish kid from Detroit," says Sonny now. "What did I know from the Mafia?"<p>Maybe they should have taken the next ferry home, but they didn't. And within two weeks the Coralairs were the rage of Havana--it was good for Trafficante's business. The group played the Deuville and the Teatro National, then began appearing weekly on El Show Des Shows, Cuba's answer to Ed Sullivan. The high point came when they opened the Sans-Souci, Trafficante's attempt to outdo the Tropicana as the gaudiest, swankiest nightclub ever. Before they knew it, they were even playing private parties for Trafficante himself.<p>If you were a friend, or if he wanted to cultivate your favor, Trafficante would empty the room out, close the place down, and have the Coralairs play for just a handful of people, says Bloch, echoing the accounts of other band members. Then in would come the prostitutes, and the men would take their pick and go upstairs while the band kept playing. One rainy weekend, says Bloch, John and Bobby Kennedy came over from Palm Beach; Trafficante closed down the Sans-Souci for them.<p>Once a week, a man even more cold-eyed than Trafficante would pay the boys for their efforts. "It was Meyer Lansky," says Bloch. "He paid me cash money--$4,000 a week." Bloch pauses a moment, perhaps realizing it's unseemly for radio's favorite financial advisor to admit he was once on a Mafia payroll. "I mean, we were just kids," he adds hastily. "What did we know?"<p>Actually, Bloch loved his days in Havana. The delirious times ended only when Fidel Castro's revolution drove the Coralairs from the city. The Batista regime had but three months to survive, and the dictator's troops were so jumpy they would machine-gun anyone who looked at them cross-eyed. One morning Sonny heard shooting outside and got up to look into the street. Bodies hung out of cars; blood pooled in the gutters. We've got to get out of here, he thought. <p>But back in Florida, Bloch couldn't get Cuba out of his mind. He went back by himself a half-dozen times that winter, then reassembled most of the group for a last glorious tour the following summer.<p>
Still, the Coralairs were never destined for real show-business success. They broke up soon after the second summer, and most band members went on to quieter lives. Only Bloch couldn't give up the glitz--not realizing he didn't have the talent to become more than a B-list lounge singer. As the vogue swung away from club acts, Bloch's gigs became increasingly low-rent. He remembers playing a mob-owned joint in New Orleans and some spots in Chicago and Kansas City. And although Castro had driven Trafficante back to the U.S., Bloch says he met his mob sponsor one more time--presiding at a Sinatra concert a year or two before the murder of John Kennedy, in which Trafficante was rumored to have played a part.<p>Eventually Bloch succumbed to pressure and went into real estate, the family business. His father put up some money, and Bloch built a boring but healthy business developing real estate near <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Walt Disney</b></a> World in central Florida. For years the money came easily--but to Bloch it all seemed empty somehow. Where was the applause? Where were the dancing girls? In 1977, his desire for a life in the spotlight reached crisis level. He sold off his real estate business, bought a condo in Palm Beach, and sought to make a name for himself as a playboy among Florida's nouveaux riches. One photo from the era shows him sitting rather ridiculously atop a polo pony, mallet at the ready. Another shows him as a runway model for Gucci clothing, looking like Tom Jones's cheesier cousin.<p>Then, one day in September 1979, Bloch finally stumbled on the calling that could replace music. He was motoring along Ocean Drive in Palm Beach when a man came on the radio and started answering callers' questions about real estate. Bloch turned up the volume; it was a subject he knew well. But the guy didn't have a clue! He called the radio station himself.<p>"That guy you've got on doesn't know what he's talking about," he remembers saying to the station manager.<p>"Oh, yeah? Then maybe you'd like to come in and do it."<p>"Well, maybe I will."<p>A month later, he was on the air.<p>In talk radio, Bloch found a stage on which he could shine as brightly as he ever did in Havana. His financial advice wasn't what made him a hit--it was his voice and his personality. Bloch seemed able to talk with authority about virtually anything. Within three months, the Associated Press had signed him up to do a syndicated show.<p>Bloch easily gained the trust of his listeners. But either he didn't know about the responsibilities that went with that trust--or he didn't care. He aggressively blurred the line between his own opinions and on-air plugs for his advertisers. In the process, Bloch became a sort of financial rent boy, doing television infomercials and offering his credibility for hire on the radio. And the advertisers loved it. Bloch's shows began with a by-the-book disclaimer. But then for two hours a night the host would slide seamlessly between advice to his listeners and enthusiastic testimonials for his sponsors.<p>And what sponsors! Bloch was as picky about them as he had been about the Coralairs' patrons--which is to say, he took the money and asked few questions. Penny stocks? "Ride with them and take the profit," said Sonny. A travel agent discount card? "It was incredible--I made up the cost in one trip," said Sonny. Advertisers lined up to profit from the unsophisticated investors who would take Bloch at his word.<p>But that was not the worst of it. Behind the scenes, Bloch had undisclosed business links with the promoters of some of the lousiest investments he hawked.<p>
Unlike his flirtation with Santo Trafficante and Meyer Lansky, Bloch's ties with convicted swindlers can't be explained away as a youthful indiscretion. Indeed, prosecutors hope to put the radio talker in prison because of his promotion of various felons' schemes. At the top of their hit list: Bloch's links with the DeAngelis brothers of Brooklyn, New York.<p>Bloch says he first got involved with the DeAngelises in 1992, when the eldest brother, Jack, told Bloch they were starting a gold- and silver-coin investment firm to be based in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. Naturally, they wanted to advertise on The Sonny Bloch Show. Bloch remembers the three siblings as respectable enough and says he accepted them as sponsors after having them "checked out."<p>He couldn't have checked very deeply. At the time, Jack DeAngelis was on probation from a 1986 conviction for conspiracy and fraud. The coin firm, prosecutors have charged, was just another swindle: The brothers were willing to take money from Bloch's listeners but not so eager to provide gold in return. (Jack wasn't charged, but his brothers pleaded guilty to several charges in the scheme.) When the coin company began to unravel, Bloch insisted he had been duped too--that he had no business with the DeAngelises except for the spots on his radio show. This wasn't true.<p>In fact, Bloch had numerous links with the brothers. Jack DeAngelis had his own radio show, for example, Collector's Corner; Bloch-controlled Independent Broadcasters Network distributed it to radio stations around the country. Bloch also appeared as a host for seminars sponsored by the DeAngelises. A column by Jack DeAngelis appeared in Sonny Bloch's Action Line, a newsletter published by Bloch; the DeAngelises plugged Bloch in their own newsletter. And Federal Communications Commission filings show that the brothers were involved in Bloch's efforts to raise millions of dollars by selling investments to his own listeners. The aim: To build a network of small AM radio stations that would buy Bloch's programming.<p>Even without the DeAngelises' involvement, these "limited liability company" deals reflect poorly on Bloch. In his on-air spiels, he invited listeners to invest in at least two stations. Each pitch closed with a toll-free number listeners could call for a packet of financial literature. One packet featured a small radio station in Middletown, Connecticut, while another featured a station in Gainesville, Florida. Remarkably, the prospectuses in both packets were essentially the same--it was as if a single document had been prepared on a word processor, then modified with a few search-and-replace commands.<p>For the Middletown promotion, according to The New York Times, Bloch solicited 200 memberships at $5,000 per unit, a total of $1 million. But for their money--nearly four times the station's eventual purchase price--investors got only a 25 percent interest. Meanwhile, Bloch-controlled Broadcast Radio Group put no money down and received 75 percent ownership. What happened to the surplus $720,000 invested by listeners? Bloch has said most will be spent on "future improvements, promotion, and programming," including shows from his own syndicate.<p>Bloch displayed other links with felons by plugging a "wireless cable" deal on his show. Many wireless-cable investment companies--which raise money to distribute cable-TV programming via radio waves instead of wires--are scams. Both the Federal Trade Commission and the SEC have issued alerts on the topic since 1992, and Bloch should have been wary of anyone pushing such a deal. But in late 1993 or early 1994 he accepted a wireless-cable promoter as a sponsor anyway.<p>Bloch says the deal came to him when a man named Alan Herr approached him to buy time on the show. Again, Bloch says he checked the deal out--but again, he couldn't have checked very closely. Herr was a felon who had been sentenced to 18 months in prison for commodities fraud. His father, Herbert Herr, was sentenced to two and a half years for the same scheme. Bloch knew both men. Alan Herr was associated with a New York art gallery for which Bloch had taped an infomercial; Alan's name and signature also appear on offering documents for some of Bloch's radio deals. Herbert Herr worked for the Bloch operation, fielding telephone calls that resulted from the host's on-air promotions.<p>No one knows how long Bloch has had such links to some of the people pushing deals on his show--or whether he could be as big a dupe as his listeners, as he now maintains. Either way, his cozy world began to fall apart last year when federal regulators received a flood of complaints involving his show. There were gripes about the Herrs' wireless-cable deal, gripes about Bloch's own radio deals, and gripes galore about the DeAngelis brothers and their gold-coin scheme. "We want to work with you on this," the brothers had allegedly told some ripped-off customers. "How about half your money back?"<p>
"Here--listen to this."<p>Sonny Bloch is breezing through downtown Tampa, top down on his Caddy convertible. He takes a cassette from his shirt pocket and pops it into the tape deck. Out comes a shrieking, banshee-like voice. Sonny had better be careful, the tape goes, because he never can be sure if he might be coming out the door one day when a bullet is coming in. Or words to that effect. Bloch carries the tape around like it's a Medic Alert bracelet. "I wanted you to hear it," he says. "This way, if something happens..."<p>Bloch's paranoia may be justified: He's certainly being assaulted from all sides these days. In February, federal agents raided his offices here, seizing tax records as well as tapes of his radio show. They came back a week later and searched his home for a suitcase with $1 million in cash. They didn't find it--but they did come up with those compromising sex tapes. "See, I told you," says Bloch in a show of unconvincing bravado just hours after the raid. "This is a witch hunt."<p>Radio stations that carry Bloch's show have also begun to feel the heat. In February the FBI arrived at New York's WOR-AM, one of the largest talk-radio stations in the country, to cart away more than 700 hours of tapes. "I think WOR could lose its license because of Bloch," says a former top official at the station. Yet WOR remains supportive of Bloch, who is a huge money-spinner for it.<p>In his high-rise digs on Tampa's Harbour Island, where he lives with his second wife, Hilda, Bloch now seems genuinely frightened by what lies ahead. A lifetime of self-promotion is crumbling; the spotlight isn't so warm anymore. "I haven't slept in three days," he confides. Still, he says, no one can get his money--how much, he's not telling. Perhaps sensing storms ahead, Bloch started shedding his wealth into trusts more than 15 years ago. He says he has no assets.<p>The sole extravagance in his apartment also helps keep Bloch sane these days: his one-man broadcast studio, umbilical cord to what's left of all the fame and adulation. Bloch may spend his days in a cold sweat, but he has yet to disclose this fact to his fans, to whom he still broadcasts every weekday. Why should they know? When the evening newsbreak is over and AM stations nationwide patch into Tampa, those listeners want a voice that's smooth and trouble free.<p>And that's what Sonny gives them.<p>"Welcome to The Sonny Bloch Show," he purrs, as he has every weeknight for the last 14 years. "We're here to talk about money, business, real estate--and life."<p>Then he does exactly that. Sonny Bloch has taken the money, and he has asked few questions. Now the show must go on. <p><p>

						A financial scandal at Harvard says much about the medical
industry's lax controls. It says more about a flawed genius 
who tackledand embodiedthe riddle of the human heart.<p>By William Green<p>Before Bernardo Nadal-Ginard arrived at his Boston office on a brisk Monday morning in October 1993, the Spanish native was a figure of immense stature in the medical world. He was cardiologist-in-chief at Children's Hospital, a prestigious teaching institution affiliated with Harvard Medical School. He was a tenured Harvard professor in both pediatrics and cellular biology. And his research into heart disease was so acclaimed that he was talked of as a potential Nobel Prize winner.<p>Nadal-Ginard was driven and intense, known not just for his medical triumphs but also for his superb aesthetic sense. Christie's valued his art collection at $6.75 million. He had few close friends and often clashed with his peers. But his professional admirers were legion. Says Edmund Sonnenblick, the chief of cardiology at New York's Albert Einstein College of Medicine, "He was probably the most important figure in cardiovascular research in the country."<p>But on this autumn day, Nadal-Ginard's towering reputation was about to implode. The doctor had been accused a few days earlier of stealing some checks. Now, when he tried to unlock the door to his office, he found that his key didn't work. Bewildered, he turned to his assistant, Maureen Piccolo, who tried her own key. That failed too.<p>Piccolo called the hospital's vice president, who told her Nadal-Ginard was no longer in good standing at Children's.  His office had been "secured" the night before, and he wouldn't be allowed in without an escort.<p>As a throng of colleagues gathered to witness his humiliation, Nadal-Ginard fled to a nearby lounge. He was usually a man of icy demeanor, but he was shaking now and his voice was slurred. Maureen Piccolo held his hand and hugged him as if he were a frightened child. Despite taking sleeping pills and Prozac, her boss hadn't slept properly in days.<p>Within a week, Nadal-Ginard had checked himself into McLean Hospital, a mental institution in Boston. The psychiatrists there diagnosed him as acutely suicidal. Two months later his troubles became even deeper, as auditors accused him of stealing $7.6 million from the medical foundation he had headed.<p>Nadal-Ginard's case received scant coverage in the press, even though a federal judge found late last year that he had committed fraud. Nadal-Ginard was ordered to repay $6.56 million; he faces a criminal trial this spring. Yet the famed doctor's story is tragedy of the highest order. After escaping poverty and fascism, Nadal-Ginard achieved astonishing success in the U.S., only to be destroyed by his pursuit of status and money. His downfall decimated the legendary research program he created and ended his search for a scientific Holy Graila way to use genetics to make damaged hearts repair themselves.<p>
Bernardo Nadal-Ginard sits in the living room of his duplex in Boston, surrounded by the trappings of a life he is trying to salvagetrappings by which he seems to have measured his own worth. This apartment is less stately than the townhouse he and his wife own just a few blocks away, but it bears ample testimony to his wealth and refined taste. There are books by Erasmus, Euripides, Sophocles, Gide, and Derrida; compact discs of operas by Verdi, Puccini, and Mozart. In the middle of the living room, which overlooks the Charles River, lies a sculpture of an overturned flask spilling liquid. Above the dining-room table hangs a massive aluminum sculpture of a hound in pursuit of a stag. The contemporary art contrasts exquisitely with beamed ceilings, carved mahogany panels, and grand fireplaces.<p>Amid the luxury, though, Nadal-Ginard looks pale and haunted. His face is deeply lined, and there is an overwhelming sadness in his eyes. When he speaks, he covers his face with his hands, as if to prevent anyone from peering beneath his composed exterior. He occasionally breaks into a chuckle or exercises his dry wit, but his manner is more often imperious. "I get things done that need to be done," he says tersely. "I don't do it by kissing asses." It isn't hard to see how he acquired a reputation for arrogance.<p>Though he has already been defeated in one court of law, Nadal-Ginard seems convinced that he can still vindicate himselfas if his career were just one more damaged muscle to be repaired. He spins a web of conspiracy theories to explain his fall. He attacks everyone from the dean of Harvard Medical School to the judge in his civil case, the result of which he is appealing. He has sued the trustees of Children's Hospital, the hospital's acting chief of cardiology, and his former foundation. Claiming they have all tried to "discredit and destroy" him, he demands reinstatement.<p>But the bravado is unconvincing and sadthe more so because Nadal-Ginard's earlier accomplishments were so extraordinary. Indeed, some of his old colleagues now talk as if the man they knew were dead. "We've lost a great scientist and a good friend," says Russell Medford, a former laboratory partner. "We've lost someone who was still in the prime of his scientific life."<p>Born on the island of Majorca on March 14, 1942, Bernardo Nadal-Ginard grew up knowing that others expected him to remain in poverty, to fail like his father. His parents had worked a tiny parcel of land from which they barely scraped enough to survive. General Francisco Franco's fascist government made matters harder, lowering the price of crops and limiting the quantities farmers could produce. Secretly, Nadal-Ginard's family would make surplus flour at night. Young Bernardo hid the extra wheat underground.<p>From the age of four he attended a one-room school. Though he excelled in class, he was dragged home when he was 11 because his parentswho were barely literate themselvescould no longer afford to educate him. He worked with his father, who had by now abandoned farming to make charcoal. A year or so later, Nadal-Ginard gave up this miserable and grimy job and returned to school on a scholarship arranged by his old teacher. If it weren't for this ally, he says gratefully, "I would be a manual worker."<p>When Nadal-Ginard was 14, his father developed such bad emphysema that he could hardly walk 100 yards. Taking over as head of the family, Nadal-Ginard decided they would fare better by raising chickens. "I went to ask for credit at the bank," he says. "They laughed me out." Refusing to give up, he arranged loans from neighbors and set up a primitive poultry farm that enabled his parents to live in relative comfort.<p>Having completed secondary school in two years instead of four, he trained to become a teacher. Again, people told him he would fail. But only two years later he was teaching at his old school. At 18 he married a local girl, Margarita Vicens. Proud of their noble lineage, her parents opposed the match; for a while they even refused to allow the impoverished teacher into their house. The slight just intensified Nadal-Ginard's hunger for success. Before long, he had earned a place in the medical school at the University of Barcelona. He graduated in only four years to become one of the youngest physicians in Spain.<p>After a stint of compulsory service in Franco's army, Nadal-Ginard trained at the National Institute of Cardiology in Mexico, a hotbed of medical innovation during the 1960s. In those days, cardiologistsheart specialistswere expected either to do clinical work, which involves treating patients, or to become researchers. Characteristically, Nadal-Ginard became proficient in both areas. But his inquisitive mind drew him irresistibly to the lab. "I wanted to know more about why things were happening," he recalls. "Why some people had degenerative diseases. Why some people were born with heart diseases."<p>Though his English was only rudimentary, Nadal-Ginard applied to Yale University as a Ph.D. student in developmental biology. In 1972, he moved to America with Margarita and their children, Mireya and Tania. He would never again live in insular, class-ridden Majorca. Just three years later, Bernardo Nadal-Ginard, M.D., Ph.D., landed a job as an assistant professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, in the Bronx section of New York City. He settled into a tiny laboratory and embarked on a research career. For the first time, he felt he would be judged solely by his intellect.<p>A graduate student, Russell Medford, worked alongside Nadal-Ginard for several years at Albert Einstein, usually from early morning until late at night. The Spaniard was "open, warm, and supportive," says Medford, now an associate professor at Emory University's medical school in Atlanta. "He's a person you have to get to know. He's a very shy man." Nadal-Ginard was happiest in the lab. If an experiment yielded crucial information, Medford recalls, he "would run around the room going, That's fantastic! That's amazing! That's wonderful!' The mask of being a distant person would come off."<p>Nadal-Ginard quickly made his mark as a molecular biologist, using genetic techniques to explain how muscle cells function. Again he focused mainly on the heart, a peculiar organ in that it stops producing muscle cells at birth. This characteristic poses a grave problem that would preoccupy Nadal-Ginard for two decades. If muscle cells are destroyed in the womb, say, or by a heart attack, the damage is permanent. Nadal-Ginard searched for a way to reverse this processto induce the birth of new muscle cells so that damaged hearts could become healthy again.<p>Nadal-Ginard was almost alone in using molecular biology to tackle heart problems, an approach that has since become widespread. "He was the father of this field," says Medford. Inspired by his work and by his formidable personality, a string of gifted researchers became his disciples. They were often foreigners with unorthodox rsums, people who needed a chance. Among those he nurtured were Seigo Izumo, currently chief of cardiology at the University of Michigan, and Jeffrey Rottman, now head of arrhythmic cardiology at Washington University in St. Louis. "Everyone looked up to Bernardo," says Medford. "He was a standard to meet."<p>But Nadal-Ginard's obsessive focus on work caused tensions at home. In 1979, he and Margarita divorced, and she returned to Spain with Mireya and Tania. According to Mireya, Margaritanow a nurse in Spainnever understood Nadal-Ginard's "anxiety to keep doing things. She wanted someone who could stay around at home more."<p>In January 1981, Nadal-Ginard received a telephone call from Cliff Barger, a Harvard physiologist he knew only by reputation. Barger told him that the chief of cardiology at Children's Hospitala Harvard affiliatewas about to retire. Barger asked Nadal-Ginard to apply for the prestigious position, which involved overseeing all the hospital's heart programs, including research and cardiac surgery.<p>At the time, chairmen of cardiology invariably specialized in treating patientsnot in research. So Nadal-Ginard, who didn't even have a license to practice medicine in the U.S., guessed Barger had made a mistake. "I said perhaps someone gave him the wrong name or number," he says. "I hadn't seen a patient in about seven years."<p>But Barger was serious. Children's had decided to hire someone in the vanguard of the molecular biology and genetics revolution; Nadal-Ginard would be the first cardiology chief in the U.S. who had learned to use these new techniques. The hospital didn't care that he would not treat patients. "We contacted everybody who'd ever had anything to do with him," says Barger. "Everyone agreed that this was a very unusual man, and one who could lead Children's cardiology into the next century."<p>Children's Hospital, which celebrated its 125th birthday last year, has an unsurpassed reputation for pediatric care. In 1938, the hospital won international renown when one of its surgeons performed the first-ever successful repair of a congenital heart defect. A decade later, a Hungarian named Alexander Nadas began a remarkable 33-year reign as chief of cardiology, turning Children's into the preeminent center in the U.S. for the treatment of pediatric heart disease. At only 39, Nadal-Ginard would become Nadas's successor. Russell Medford loaded his friend's lab equipment into a moving van in the Bronx and drove it to Boston. "It was a wonderful time," he says.<p>Adding to the excitement, Nadal-Ginard got remarried that year to a woman he had met in New York. Vijak Mahdavi, a dedicated researcher with a Ph.D. in biology, was extroverted and aggressive. Her background couldn't have been more different from Nadal-Ginard's: Her family had made a fortune in Iran's electrical industry and now lived in Switzerland. Nonetheless, she and Nadal-Ginard got along well. And with a cultured and elegant woman by his side, the doctor became so sophisticated that a stranger might easily mistake him for a European aristocrat. "She taught my father a lot," says Mireya Nadal-Vicens. "She often convinced him of her opinions, and very few people have been able to do that. He loved that."<p>Mahdavi also understood Nadal-Ginard's obsession with science. Indeed, she became an integral player in his new research programa role for which she was well qualified. She soon became an associate professor at Harvard and was honored for her research by the American Heart Association.<p>Although he had little administrative experience, Nadal-Ginard proved remarkably successful as chief of cardiology at Children's. He hired some outstanding clinical cardiologists to take care of patients and simultaneously built a brilliant research program. In 1986, Daniel Tosteson, the dean of Harvard Medical School, wrote to congratulate him on his "inspired leadership." Under Nadal-Ginard, says Cliff Barger, Children's cardiology department "was probably the best in the world."<p>And Nadal-Ginard's own research continued to dazzle other cardiologists. One of his first projects at Children's had a profound impact on the treatment of a disease in which the aorta and pulmonary artery are attached to the wrong heart chambers. Skillful surgeons could switch the arteries around, but the left ventricle often remained dangerously weak. Experimenting on animals, Nadal-Ginard found a simple solution: By tightening a cord around the pulmonary artery, he could make the sickly ventricle triple in strength in about four days. Aldo Castaneda, then Children's chief of cardiac surgery, tried the technique on babies with great success.<p>At the same time, Nadal-Ginard kept looking for ways to make damaged hearts revitalize themselves. Under his guidance, Children's molecular biologists discovered why muscle cells in the heart aren't produced after birth. They identified genes that, if manipulated correctly, might make new cells form. And they laid the groundwork for a future therapy by introducing these genes into the hearts of animals.<p>Nadal-Ginard's work brought him accolades from every quarter. He snagged research grants from the American Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health; he won prizes from the International Society for Heart Research and the American Cancer Society. He became director of a renowned M.D./Ph.D. program run by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and he became chair of the senior appointments committee at Children's Hospital.<p>The child of Spanish peasants had become as bright a star as any in the Harvard firmament. "I could do no wrong," he recalls. "I was walking on water."<p>Yet he also felt he was not getting his due.<p>Doctors earn widely differing sums of money, and they earn it in a wide variety of ways. Some surgeons, for example, may receive huge fees directly for their services; a top surgeon can rake in more than $1 million a year. At the elite teaching hospitals affiliated with Harvard, however, salary guidelines peg doctors' earnings at more modest levels. In 1986, for example, Harvard decreed that a full professora category that includes many of Boston's finest doctorsshould earn a salary of no more than $246,888. Nadal-Ginard easily fell within the prescribed range: Despite all the kudos, his official paycheck that year was $123,000.<p>Such guidelines may give the impression that teaching hospitals keep strict control over the earnings of their doctors. But this is a fiction. Until September 1994, Harvard did not require doctors to reveal their full income. And for those doing cutting-edge research, it was especially easy to undermine the spirit of the guidelines. In addition to their salaries, researchers can earn money through consulting fees, speaking fees, book royalties, and patent royalties and by forming biotechnology companies to commercialize their advances. In the last decade, venture capitalists have staked billions of dollars on research in molecular biology.<p>This flood of cash has created an environment in which talented scientists like Nadal-Ginard often expect to get rich. "Money has emerged in larger sums than we ever imagined was possible," says Donald Fredrickson, a former director of the National Institutes of Health. "It makes the system closer to the devil than it was in the pristine days."<p>Besides the temptations of commerce, Nadal-Ginard could also watch his colleagues making millions from deferred-compensation packages, another popular way to sidestep salary guidelines. To understand the income boost possible under such a deal, consider the case of Hardy Hendren, a top Children's surgeon who received an official salary of $344,418 in 1993, the latest year for which records are available. Hendren's paycheck fit within Harvard's guidelines, which specified a top salary of $355,422 in 1993. But Hendron received a bonus of $2.44 million that year by cashing out of a ten-year-old delayed-benefit plan.<p>Compared with peers like Hendren, Nadal-Ginard was in a frustrating position. In 1986, he had received a much-coveted award from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, a huge philanthropy in Maryland. The institute hands out grants to ensure that top scientists like Nadal-Ginard have the financial freedom to pursue their work. The HHMI agreed to sponsor some of his research and pay his salary, which would rise to $237,235 in 1993, when his grant was to come up for renewal.<p>But the institute also sent Nadal-Ginard a letter explaining that, with the exception of a limited amount of consulting, he "should not receive any other compensation" from his "university, clinics, or hospitals." Ironically, the prestigious appointment threatened to deprive Nadal-Ginard of the wealth that any other star doctor could attain by skirting Harvard's salary guidelines.<p>In Nadal-Ginard's mind, money may have been a way of keeping scoreof proving how far he had come since his days of penury in Majorca. Certainly he felt entitled to more money than he was getting from the HHMI. And he was in a position to address the problem, for in 1983 he had set up a not-for-profit foundation known as a physician practice group.<p>Physician practice groups give doctors independence from the hospitals where they work. Technically, the doctors are employed by their foundation, not the hospital. This arrangement allows doctors to make their own decisions on matters such as hiring personnel and arranging benefit plans. The IRS estimates there are well over 200 such groups scattered across the U.S., associated mostly with top teaching hospitals. Hundreds of millions of dollarsperhaps billionssluice through them each year with minimal oversight.<p>Nadal-Ginard's physician practice group, the Boston Children's Heart Foundation, was typical of the breed. It had tax-exempt status because its membersall of whom belonged to his cardiology departmenttaught medicine and conducted research. Nadal-Ginard was the group's president and treasurer and one of its three directors. He controlled revenue of up to $8 million a year but received virtually no guidance from the foundation's directors or from his hospital.<p>In fact, as with many such groups, no one paid any attention at all. The IRS says that directors of tax-exempt groups must ensure that employees receive only "reasonable" compensation. But Michael Freed, one of Nadal-Ginard's fellow directors, has testified that he never read the group's by-laws, that he had no idea what any foundation member was paid, that he cannot remember a formal meeting of the board of directors, and that no senior official saw reports about the foundation's expenses.<p>This surprises no one who is familiar with tax-exempt physician practice groups. Lawyers and accountants say many foundations don't undergo scrutiny by outside auditors and that directors often fail to monitor their groups' financial dealings. It's the hallmark of an industry that has suddenly become big businessbut thinks it can keep operating under medicine's old collegial rules.<p>It was easy, then, for Nadal-Ginard to award himself a supplementary income to reflect what he felt was his due. He gradually increased the sum until, in 1992, the nonprofit foundation paid him a salary of $229,194not bad, given that he provided no patient care, the source of the foundation's revenue. That year, the foundation also paid him more than $500,000 in various benefits. Nadal-Ginard claims these arrangements were approved by various people, including David Weiner, the president of Children's Hospital. But a U.S. district court judge has ruled otherwise, calling the deals improper.<p>Although Nadal-Ginard may have felt he deserved the extra money, he also needed it to fund an increasingly glamorous lifestyle. In 1985, he and his wife began to collect art, focusing on conceptual artists who presented complex ideas in simple but striking ways. He approached his new obsession with the same intensity he brought to science. "He has a mind that's phenomenally investigative," says Barbara Krakow, a gallery owner and friend. "He began to understand very deeply what each artist was doing."<p>Indeed, art consumed almost all of Nadal-Ginard's spare time. He became a fixture at exhibitions and auctions from New York to Zurich, Paris to Madrid, Basel to Venice. He joined the board of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston. He befriended artists, gallery owners, and eminent museum curators such as Kathy Halbreich, director of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. His daughters worried that the hobby had become another full-time job. Mireya Nadal-Vicens recalls, "We had conversations about how sad it was that he couldn't relax."<p>Nadal-Ginard says he and Mahdavi recognized many lesser-known artists who subsequently won broader acclaim, including Cindy Sherman, Matthew Barney, and Gabriel Orozco. They also bought works by more established artists such as Bruce Nauman, Kiki Smith, and Bryce Marden. The couple had such confidence in their artistic judgment that they took out a bank loan of $467,000 so they would have more to spend on art. Nadal-Ginard says he regarded this as a sound investment.<p>
Meanwhile, at Children's Hospital, things were turning sour. Despite his many successes, Nadal-Ginard seemed ill-suited to the administrative side of his job. He loathed bureaucracy and was incapable of hiding his contempt for incompetent colleagues. He tended to fight with anyone who would get in his wayespecially with superiors. "If I believe in something," Nadal-Ginard says, "I don't budge."<p>At times he acted like a despot. He had a furious argument with the hospital's chairman of pediatrics, David Nathan, who had objected to Nadal-Ginard's grabbing more lab space for his department's research. Afterward, Nathanthe hospital's physician-in-chief and a member of its board of trusteeswrote Nadal-Ginard: "You are a brilliant Chief in many ways.... But your tremendous determination to get what you want leads you to ride roughshod over perceived opponents and further, you have a one-way mind. You have great difficulty in seeing the needs of other colleagues."<p>Nadal-Ginard hated the fact that such distractions tore him away from the laboratory. "I thought I was squandering significant amounts of my intellectual resources," he says. A further source of distress may have been the state of his finances. Besides art, Nadal-Ginard and Mahdavi had been amassing property. They had bought a batch of condominiums as an investment in 1986 and still owed a hefty sum on the mortgages. They also had mortgages on their apartment on the Charles River and their Boston townhouse. Despite Nadal-Ginard's illicit income from the foundation, the couple would owe almost $2.7 million by 1993.<p>Nadal-Ginard started having bouts of depression throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s. "He slouched a lot," says daughter Mireya. "He was chronically tired." Because he had little faith in psychiatry, he sought no help. Instead, he escaped by thowing himself ever more manically into his twin obsessions, art and science. He often woke up at 5 a.m. to start working.<p>And despite everything, his research was going better than ever. In 1993, rumors circulated that Nadal-Ginard was a finalist for the Nobel Prize for medicine. He had discovered that one gene in the heart can produce many different proteins by a process called alternative splicinga revelation that changed assumptions about the way genes work. "The whole thing was falling into place," he says. "I was at the threshold of really getting the answers. For the first time in my life I was starting to feel satisfied."<p>But he couldn't live at this pace indefinitely. His insomnia got so bad that he sometimes went three or four days without sleeping. When he came home in the evenings, he would collapse. Mahdavi understood him better than anyone, but she began fighting with him over his self-destructive lifestyle. "When you're here," she would wail, "you're dead."<p>
The third director at the Boston Children's Heart Foundation was a cardiologist named James Lock. Nadal-Ginard had hired him back in 1984 to head the cardiac catheterization laboratory at Children's Hospital. Ambitious, headstrong, and willing to take risks, Lock soon earned a reputation as an innovative surgeon. One of his most notable achievements was to perform the first successful operation in which a cathetera tube threaded through veins and into the heartwas used to close an abnormal hole between the heart's upper chambers.<p>Under Lock, now 45, the catheterization lab expanded to a point where it handled more than 1,300 procedures a year. By 1989, the Stanford University graduate had risen to become the hospital's chief of clinical cardiologyhe was in charge of all patient-treatment programs. Lock has testified that he paid little attention to money matters for most of his tenure at the Boston Children's Heart Foundation. But it would be he who first suspected Nadal-Ginard of wrongdoing.<p>Nadal-Ginard admired Lock's skill as a surgeon but suspected him of craving power. For his part, Lock thought Nadal-Ginard neglected the needs of doctors who actually treated patients at Children's. Their conflict escalated in 1993, largely because Lock had to cut spending in the clinical program but couldn't get the financial data he needed from Nadal-Ginard.<p>That summer, Nadal-Ginard finally allowed Lock to peruse expense reports from both the cardiology department and the foundation. Scanning the documents for the first time, Lock noticed that his boss had issued himself a foundation credit card. "When I found out he was spending $70,000 or $60,000 or $80,000 a year on travel and entertainment," Lock later testified, "I became very concerned about my duties as a foundation director."<p>Lock challenged Nadal-Ginard but says he was told "it was none of my business." However, the younger man had just read about a scandal at the House of Morgan in the 1920s that led to a crackdown on the entire banking industry. "I told [Nadal-Ginard] I was worried that the medical profession was going to come under the same scrutiny," Lock has testified. "And when that scrutiny occurred, they were going to go after Harvard."<p>Shortly afterward, Robert Gold, the foundation's accountant, conducted a routine audit and found that several checks had gone astray. One was for $25,000 and had been made payable to Shearson Lehman Brothers, which handled some of the foundation's assets. Gold showed the canceled check to Martin Stocklan, a Shearson executive who had apparently endorsed it. According to foundation documents, Stocklan said the endorsement was a clumsy forgery: His name had even been misspelled. State Street Bank in Boston, which had cleared the check, then revealed that the missing money had been deposited in Nadal-Ginard's personal account. In the following weeks, four more improperly endorsed checks would be found .<p>These discoveries led to Nadal-Ginard's humiliating lockout at his office in Children's Hospital. They also caused the foundation to retain accountants Ernst & Young to dissect the doctor's other financial dealings. The ensuing investigation, as detailed in court documents, revealed an array of further irregularities. Most startling, perhaps, was the discovery that Nadal-Ginard had dramatically altered his own deferred-compensation plan as far back as 1988.<p>Nadal-Ginard's original plandrawn up in 1985allowed him annually to accrue a sum equal to 15 percent of his foundation salary. But three years later, Nadal-Ginard claimed that all copies of that document had been lost. He had an attorney draw up a replacement plan that increased his benefits enormouslywithout notifying his fellow directors. When Nadal-Ginard terminated the plan on December 31, 1992, he received a jackpot of more than $4 million.<p>Questions also arose over an escrow account Nadal-Ginard used to pay for his life insurance and income taxes. In 1992 and 1993, a judge has ruled, Nadal-Ginard improperly deposited nearly $750,000 of the foundation's money in this account. Another dubious deal involved a biotechnology company called Myogenics Inc., which Nadal-Ginard founded with a colleague in 1992. Myogenics attracted $7 million from venture-capital money, but Nadal-Ginard was found to have paid its first employee, Richard Odessy, with the foundation's money. Myogenics' president now calls Nadal-Ginard "untrustworthy."<p>In Nadal-Ginard's civil trial, the judge agreed with most of Ernst & Young's findings. Nadal-Ginard was ordered to return more than $6.5 million to the foundation; he had already paid back Odessy's $72,000 and $145,000 for the missing checks. Ironically, the judge found nothing wrong with Nadal-Ginard's credit card expenses, which had first convinced James Lock that something was amiss.<p>Nadal-Ginard's upcoming trial in the criminal division of Suffolk County Superior Court will focus on the same allegations. If the doctor loses this time, he faces up to five years in prison.<p>
Despite the array of damning evidence, Nadal-Ginard still claims he is "totally innocent of any misdoing." Perhaps the only people who believe him are his daughters and his wife. In a telephone interview, Vijak Mahdavi supports Nadal-Ginard's theory that his downfall was orchestrated by James Lock and David Nathan, the superior with whom he quarreled over lab space. "This is a political coup that was mounted," she says bitterly. "A lot of people were jealous. I always compare my husband to Mozart being kicked out of the royal court by Salieri."<p>The last year has had a crushing impact on Mahdavi. Before her husband's fall, she had her own research grants and seemed poised to become a full professor at Harvard Medical School. Now she claims Nadal-Ginard's enemies at Children's Hospital have dismantled her lab. A hospital spokeswoman denies this.<p>On his last day of testimony in the civil trial, Nadal-Ginard witnessed the full extent of Mahdavi's suffering. When he arrived at his lawyer's office that day in November 1994, he was handed a phone message from his wife's psychiatrist: Mahdavi hadn't shown for her appointment. Nadal-Ginard rushed home and found his wife lying unconscious on the living room floor. She had taken an overdose of Valium. Afraid she would fall into an irreversible coma, he slapped her so she would stay awake until the ambulance arrived. Mahdavi's stomach was pumped, and she has remained in a mental institution in Switzerland ever since. She is receiving treatment there for suicidal depression.<p>As he discusses his wife's breakdown, Nadal-Ginard's voice drops and he closes his bleary eyes. He walks across the room to find some documents, desperate not to let his misery show. Since being locked out of his office, Nadal-Ginard has been seeing psychiatrists himself. While visiting Mahdavi last December, his condition deteriorated and he too was briefly institutionalized.<p>It's little wonder Nadal-Ginard is depressed. In a matter of months in 1993, he was fired as chief of cardiology at Children's Hospital, president of the Boston Children's Heart Foundation, and an HHMI researcher. He lost his research grants and his income. He saw his life's achievements overshadowed by shame. One of the worst tortures, he says, was to watch helplessly as the research operation he had built up over a decade was dismembered. On one afternoon last year, James Lock met with several of Nadal-Ginard's protgs and told them the hospital could not afford to employ them.<p>Lately Nadal-Ginard has faced new humiliations. On January 6, he lost the right to travel abroad: The Massachusetts attorney general's office argued successfully that he should surrender his passport because he might flee the country. Four days later he received a notice informing him that all "right, title, and interest" in his Boston duplex and townhouse had been seized. The properties will be held as collateral for the millions he owes to his former foundation. And to prevent him from absconding with his art collection, he is tailed day and night by private investigators.<p>It's a sad fate for a man who, just two years ago, served as an inspiration to medical researchers around the world. Today, Nadal-Ginard appears in a tragically different lightas a genius who never believed his achievements were enough. In a way, perhaps, his own heart was bruised forever by the slights he endured as an ambitious child in Spain.<p>And despite Nadal-Ginard's best efforts, a damaged heart can't yet be healed.  <p><p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Feature  <p> BETWEEN ROCK AND A HARD PLACE <p>For the Jayhawks, the price for dancing on the threshhold of Rock 'n' Roll fame is compromise and debt to the tune of $1 million <p> By Fred Goodman  <p> This Valentine's Day, American Records releases Tomorrow the Green Grass, the make-or-break fourth album from baby-boom country rockers the Jayhawks. It's a pinnacle only a handful of the tens of thousands of bands in the highly competitive world of rock'n' roll ever reach. After years of sleeping on floors and mooching off friends, the Jayhawks now will live out the fantasy of everyone who ever stood up with a guitar in a bar: touring the country to support a well-promoted record from a glamorous label.  <p> But the Minneapolis band's permanent members--three college-educated friends in their 30s--are profoundly torn over the price of their success. And this ambivalence is no artistic pose. So deep indebt they may never make money from their music, the Jayhawks are an object lesson in the weird economics of rock 'n' roll, a $5 billion industry in which everyone makes a decent living except most musicians.  <p> Even if Tomorrow goes platinum (that is, if it sells 1 million copies), the Jayhawks likely won't see much of the resulting cash avalanche. That's because the band owes more than $700,000 to American Records and has other debts to various managers. In the decade they've been together, the most band members have put aside for themselves is $250 a week each, and that was just for a few months in 1993.  <p> None of the Jayhawks has bought a house in Los Angeles, their new base. None drives a rock-star car. Unless they're being wined and dined by record-company executives, they generally eat at diners and modest restaurants. While the band's following has grown steadily--its previous album, Hollywood Town Hall, sold 200,000 copies worldwide--it's possible the Jayhawks will be in their 40s before they find out whether playing music can ever pay the bills. And that's not unusual, even for very successful artists. Such well-known rockers as Bonnie Raitt and Boston's J. Geils Band toured for more than a decade before making more than pocket change. Before she died of cancer in 1992, Motown singer Mary Wells relied on donations from Diana Ross, Bruce Springsteen, and others to pay for her care.  <p> On the other hand, once a band makes it the rewards can grow enormous over time: Witness the Rolling Stones' hugely lucrative tour last year, for which the band earned $120 million. "It's survival of the fittest," says Gary Borman, the Jayhawks' well-regarded manager. "If a band is prepared to sacrifice early and sustain that over time until everything else catches up, then on the back end it can win exponentially." But in the meantime, bands must make wrenching decisions as they wait for the break that may never come. The Jayhawks have changed their sound to be more commerical. They've ditched a stock broker friend who used to manage them. They've parted ways with a band member.  <p> Yet for all the moral grappling, the band still lives without many basic comforts and securities that most professionals take for granted--a point that was pounded home when Victoria Williams, the 35-year-old singer-songwriter who is married to Jayhawk guitarist Mark Olson, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Friends rallied to the couple's support with benefit concerts and Sweet Relief, a popular album that so far has raised more than $350,000 to offset her medical expenses and help other hard-pressed musicians. Williams's condition has improved with treatment, but the crisis was a reminder of how financially shaky life can be even for recognized musicians.  <p> Saddled with mounting bills, increasing age, and decreasing patience, the Jayhawks may finally reach a breaking point in1995. If Tomorrow the Green Grass can't attract a big audience--or at least sell enough to suggest that the next album will be a hit--American Records could drop the band and shatter what's left of its members' idealism.  <p> Not so long ago, Jayhawk guitarist and former architect Gary Louris refused to do an ad for Levi's 501 jeans that could have earned the band as much as $200,000. Mildly irked but still good humored, his band mates dubbed him Mr. Integrity. Louris, a tall, rail-thin man with a perpetual air of troubled concentration, sighs: "There are times when you say Wow, we could really use the money.' But I imagined how it would feel singing, 501, 501....'"  <p> That may have been the Jayhawks' last moral stand. If Tomorrow the Green Grass is a hit, selling a half million or more, the group could begin to erase its debt and settle into comfortable lives. But as the band's rough-hewn producer, George Drakoulias, says in a cruel joke: If this album bombs, it's time to do as many Levi's ads as possible.  <p>  <p>When stock broker Charlie Pine saw the Jayhawks warming up for cult rocker Alex Chilton at a Minneapolis club in 1985, the 30-year-old music fan was bowled over by the local quartet's straightforward country rock and heartfelt lyrics. "They were very rough, but I thought the music was amazing," he remembers. "It wasn't attitude, it wasn't angst. It was songs."  <p> Pine visited the band's rehearsal space in a run-down Minneapolis warehouse, and the conversation turned to the business of running a band. At the time, Mark Olson--who had formed the group--was making ends meet as a cook and child-care worker. But he was also lining up all the Jayhawks' gigs himself, and it was proving a heavy burden. Pine quickly offered his services to Olson, whose tousled brown hair frames the kind of open face that would beat home on a Midwestern farm.  <p> Pine, now 39, was hardly a seasoned pro: His previous experience in music was limited to managing a record store and working at his college radio station. But the short, slight man was an aggressive broker with a small local firm, Engler and Budd, and he began channeling that drive into making the Jayhawks more than a mildly successful bunch of part-timers. Together with the band, Pine formed a homegrown record label called Bunkhouse Records. Over ten days and for $12,000 of Pine's money, they recorded a debut album as bait for a major-league deal. Pine used his brokerage's WATS line to promote the band to radio stations.  <p> The next step was touring--except that Louris didn't relish the idea of spending time away from home. He had been through that once already, with a failed rock abilly band called Safety Last. "I'd see other people and think about how they were going home to have a barbecue or go to bed," he says. So the Jayhawks played just short tours of the East and West Coasts--mostly to get the band in front of major-label folks in New York and Los Angeles. They traveled by van and slept in friends' homes, but there was no chance of making money. In Minneapolis, where their following was strongest, the Jayhawks could command as much as $700 a night. On the road, however, they rarely made more than a few hundred bucks to cover expenses--and sometimes worked for much less. "You might as well write CBGB's a check," says Pine of the legendary New York dive. "You don't make anything. We were told to come back and pick up $25. And by then the van had been broken into on the street."  <p> Despite strong reviews in grass-roots publications such as College Media Journal and Rockpool, the Jayhawks had trouble attracting a record company. Still, Pine got some nibbles. In 1988, A&M Records, whose roster includes such artists as Sting and Soundgarden, gave the band $1,000 to record some demos. The Jayhawks put their heart into the effort, but A&M hemmed, hawed, and passed.  <p> It was a devastating experience for the band and a personal low point for Louris, who had just been in a car accident. Although not seriously hurt, the incident rekindled all the guitarist's old doubts about the rock 'n' roll life. Deciding he'd had enough of the financial uncertainty and the traveling, he returned to full-time work at an architectural firm, throwing the Jayhawks' very existence in doubt.  <p> Desperate to make a quick deal, Pine shopped the band's A&M demos to Twin/Tone, a local label that always seemed short of cash--but that had launched the career of Jayhawk pals Soul Asylum. The tapes were polished up, a few songs quickly added, and Twin/Tone released the result as the Jayhawks' second album, Blue Earth. Despite the inexpensive, off-the-cuff manner of assembly (the album cost a paltry $10,000 to complete), the band was justifiably proud of the results; Olson believes it features some of his best work as a songwriter. "It showed that we had something going on," he says.  <p> To cap the triumph, Louris, who came down to the studio to over dub a few of his old parts, found his way back into the band. The reunited Jayhawks hit the road in a refitted ambulance named Bula--the name came from blocking out some of the letters in ambulance, which was emblazoned on the van's front. But the band was soon dissatisfied with Twin/Tone's ability to promote them. "Twin/Tone did less at radio [stations] than I did by myself when I was working the first record," says Pine, who concluded that the Jayhawks had to find a bigger label.  <p> In this respect, Twin/Tone actually proved helpful. It had cultivated a reputation as the farm team for major record companies--Soul Asylum had gone to A&M and then Columbia, for example, the Replacements to Sire. In spring of 1990, the label hooked the Jayhawks up with an American Records producer named George Drakoulias, who had just scored a hit album with the Black Crowes. "George was the first person who liked us who was also big enough in his company to sign us," says Louris. "He asked us to make a demo for him, and he went crazy."  <p> Charlie Pine was skeptical. American wasn't known for its largesse, he warned, and the country-inflected group would have a hard time getting noticed by American's brass, who are more closely associated with speed-metal and rap acts. He urged the Jayhawksto go slow and told them of feelers from Atlantic Records, Geffen, CBS. "Their time was almost there," he says now. But the group signed with American Records anyway, for $25,000--a small bonus by industry standards, but far more than the meager $5,000 they heard Drakoulias had paid the Black Crowes.  <p> As is usual in the music world, the money came with a price. Drakoulias told the band to fire Pine and hire someone who knew the L.A. music scene. "It didn't really bother anyone," says drummer Ken Callahan. "The Jayhawks wanted to do what was right for the Jayhawks. Goodbye, Charlie."  <p>  <p>The band rented modest apartments in Los Angeles for about $200 a week and, along with Drakoulias, went into the studio to begin work on Hollywood Town Hall. Unlike their previous albums, which were recorded on a shoestring budget, this one had to be polished enough to attract a wide audience. It wasn't an easy transition. <p> American Records is backed by industry giant Warner Brothers, but the label is very much the expression of founder Rick Rubin. An arresting figure who's all sunglasses, beard, and long hair, Rubin has a hot reputation as producer of such diverse acts as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the Beastie Boys, and Johnny Cash. Although he looks like a biker, Rubin rarely fails to think like a banker: Even his label's promotional freebies bear the half-joking legend "Now you owe us." American is one of the most highly touted start ups in U.S. music since David Geffen made his reputation with Asylum Records during the 1970s.  <p> Drakoulias is Rubin's housemate, cut from the same raw cloth as his mentor. Heavy set and imposing, he looks more like a pirate than a producer. When he signed the Jayhawks, Drakoulias had only produced one other band--the Black Crowes, whose debut album, Shake Your Money Maker, rose to No. 4 on the Billboard charts.While he may have known what he wanted from his new hires musically, the intense rookie wasn't adept at putting it into words.  <p> "George was not a great communicator," says drummer Callahan."Somebody is always his favorite, and he always picks on one person. To be honest, I had a really horrible time." The band also began to realize just how expensive a commercial album can be. By the time they finished Hollywood Town Hall, the Jayhawks' signing bonus was long gone--spent on basic living expenses--and they owed $250,000 to American for studio time, about average for a top-drawer act. That was just the start. American launched a long-term campaign to position the Jayhawks as "catalog" artists--a band that doesn't have huge hits but gets critical praise and sells lots of albums over time.  <p> "American couldn't have worked any harder," says Callahan. "Everyone else in the industry would say, You guys are so lucky.' We'd go to dinner with our lawyers and start bitching, and they'd say, You guys don't know how lucky you are--most bands don't get this kind of money.' "  <p> But in fact, none of the money was flowing into the Jayhawks' pockets. If the band ever succeeds, it will actually flow out of their pockets. In an arrangement typical in the music industry, American decides how much to invest in a band, gambling that the act will be able to pay it all back. Despite having no money, therefore, the Jayhawks are on the hook for half the cost of their videos--that's $75,000 owed for the three clips made to promote Hollywood Town Hall, for example. And they're responsible for all the money American advanced them to tour with the Black Crowes, an additional $200,000. Their own shows also lost money, even after they ditched a tour bus and traveled again by van to cut costs. The only bright spot was a $25,000 advance from Brockum, a merchandising company that makes T-shirts and other souvenirs. The band lived off that for three months.  <p> Emotionally, the grind began to wear on the band members. Worse, they began to wear on each other. "I was drinking myself to sleep every night," says Callahan. "I need to be physically active, but we never even had time for a walk. You're always being transported somewhere on a bus, or you have an interview to do--never anytime for yourself." After spending all their waking hours together while touring to support the modest success of Hollywood Town Hall, the Jayhawks decided separate hotel rooms were essential. They'd owe more, but they needed their sanity.  <p> By the time a new album loomed strains were showing. Callahan felt like an outsider: At one point, American had even proposed a publicity push that focused exclusively on the songwriting duo of Olson and Louris. The Jayhawks nixed that idea, but bad feelings festered and Callahan's playing suffered. Frustrated and skeptical that the band would ever make it, the disenchanted31-year-old finally quit.  <p> "I didn't want to be 36 and in the same boat I'm in now," he says. "Starting over. No health insurance. I want a home. And it just didn't seem feasible. None of it did."  <p>  <p>When they started recording Tomorrow the Green Grass in the spring of 1994, the Jayhawks bore little resemblance to the bunch of friends who played bars for fun in Minneapolis; they had become a business. Rather than replace Callahan, the three remaining members opted to hire drummer Tim O'Reagan as an employee who will play on tours. They have a similar salary relationship with keyboardist Karen Grotberg, who played on the last two albums and tours with the band.  <p> "It's just an easier way to deal with all the contracts," says Louris. "And if we hit it big and feel like it makes sense, then we'll cut people in." Actually, by the standards of just about every amateur musician, the Jayhawks are already huge. Still, they can't match the comfort that friends back in Minneapolis enjoy by working as bankers--or as investment brokers like former manager Charlie Pine, who now works for R.J. Steichen & Co. and limits his musical involvement to visiting the record store. "We're in a really weird place," says Olson. "Sometimes it makes me not want to pick up my guitar."  <p> Yet the money side can work out. For proof, the Jayhawks need only look to their buddies in Soul Asylum, who sold about 2 million albums in the U.S. and became huge money-spinners after their single "Runaway Train" hit it big. Soul Asylum leader Dave Pirner, a former roommate of Jayhawk bassist Marc Perlman, now dates actress Winona Ryder, who starred in The Age of Innocence and Bram Stoker's Dracula.  <p> To join Soul Asylum on "the next level," the Jayhawks need Tomorrow the Green Grass to sell substantially more than the 200,000 that Hollywood Town Hall did. Otherwise, American may cut its losses. Until such a reckoning, however, the cash keeps flowing and the band slips further into hock. The new album cost about $300,000 more in studio time, and the Jayhawks are once more making videos and touring. The band's debt will likely top $1 million before starting to shrink.  <p> American's anxiety over the Jayhawks became clear as Tomorrow was being recorded in Hollywood. At one point, the band was relaxing in a lounge with friend Charlie Sexton, who had dropped by to add a slide-guitar part to a new Jayhawks track. As the men talked and jammed gently together, they looked up in surprise to discover an American engineer wheeling in microphones to get it all on tape--just in case anyone stumbled on an idea for the hit that could push the Jayhawks over the top.  <p> Unsurprisingly in such an atmosphere, Tomorrow the Green Grass is more mainstream than anything the Jayhawks have done before. A bit more "classic rock," says Louris from behind his curly, shoulder-length mane. Still, Tomorrow is a decent record, showcasing the band's facility with straight forward rock 'n' roll. And Louris is evidently proud he navigated the strait between art and commerce without giving up too much. "After a few beers at night it sounds pretty good" is his final judgment.  <p>  <p>Among those rooting for Tomorrow the Green Grass to become a huge hit, count Ken Callahan number one. Having returned to Minneapolis, the former Jayhawk has made bittersweet peace with the music industry. Abandoning the drums except for fun, he set up a furniture-making shop; now he's aiming to be a blacksmith, too.  <p> After years on the edge, Callahan is optimistic about his financial future. Indeed, he's already got some prestigious customers."The guys in Soul Asylum just got money and bought houses," he says. "So I built new kitchen cabinets for [drummer] Grant Young. I think I'll sell my furniture to Pirner and Winona--and the Black Crowes, and all these people I've met who do have money." <p> Callahan may turn out to be the first Jayhawk to crack the secret of a business that nearly sucked him dry. "That's how I'm going to cash in," he says. "I'm gonna try and get their money."  <p>    <p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Feature  <p> BATTLE OVER BROADWAY <p>Tense drama will play out around a bargaining table this summer as upstart producers try to remake theater without dimming the lights  <p> By Paul Alexander  <p> From the windows of his corner office on the 19th floor of 1501 Broadway, John Hart can look down and see, amid Times Square's chaos and boarded-up stores and porno houses, the theaters he fills for a living. Urbane and at times savagely witty, Hart--the model of a take-charge producer--works the phone, looking for investors. He has joined with a team of fellow producers known as the Dodgers to bring another musical to Broadway and fill one of the theaters far below.  <p> Hart, whose gray hair and beard belie his age, 42, has a good story to tell prospective investors. His previous two efforts with the Dodgers were Guys and Dolls, the longest-running revival in Broadway history, and Tommy, a highly successful adaptation of the Who's classic rock opera.   <p> Hart and the Dodgers are producing what seems to be another sure thing: a high-tech revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. The satire by Frank Loesser and Abe Burrows, winner of both the Pulitzer Prize and the Tony for Best Musical, made a star of Robert Morse in1961.  <p> So far, How to Succeed looks like it has a good chance of turning a profit--unlike most Broadway shows these days. With a $5.2 million start-up budget, it's inexpensive by Broadway standards.What's more, it got rave reviews during tryouts late last year at the La Jolla Playhouse near San Diego, and it will feature Matthew Broderick, the Hollywood star and Tony Awardwinning veteran of Neil Simon comedies. Sure enough, the sales job has been easy for Hart. On this winter day, he's almost finished raising his half of the $5.2 million.  <p> "I talked to your wife on the phone last week," Hart tells a potential investor. Dressed in chinos and an oxford shirt, he sits at an antique wooden desk, his Tony for Guys and Dolls ona shelf behind him. "She was very interested. I'm telling you, you can't lose. So why don't you just go out in the backyard, dig up some of that money I know you have buried there, and get in while you can. You'll thank me."  <p> Maybe. But privately, Hart admits that investing in theater has become more and more risky. Guys and Dolls recouped its capitalization in a respectable 48 weeks from its debut in April 1992. Tommy,which opened in April 1993, took 78 weeks. Both shows will make a profit. Still, because of Broadway's rising costs, many productions now lose money--and even successful shows can take forever to turn a profit. That's why Hart and the Dodgers, along with a small clique of other producers, are working to ensure that How to Succeed will be among the last shows produced under the stifling restrictions of this $650 million industry.  <p> To do so, the producers may force a showdown this summer with theater owners and the entertainment unions that could result in a strike when a key contract expires on July 31. Even a shortwork stoppage--there hasn't been one since 1973--could hurt many shows, including How to Succeed. "We don't have any choice," Hart says, "if we're going to continue to produce Broadway shows." <p>  <p>Michael David sits at the desk in a small corner office that is, quite literally, crammed with furniture, mementos from his plays, personal effects, and a vast array of kitsch that includes an antique harp, a dime store display of Brooklyn Dodgers chewing gum, plastic miniatures of the Seven Dwarfs lined up on one window ledge, and a huge yellow sign that reads tommy. A pleasantly manic man who was once described by The Wall Street Journal as the "guru" of the Dodgers--no doubt because he affects a bohemian image with his blue jeans, ponytail, and beard--David, 51, is returning a few phone calls before his next meeting. On each call he speaks in a rapid, clipped cadence, as if he can hardly wait to say what's on his mind.  <p> Before long, David is joined in his office by Ed Strong, 46, a fellow Dodger whose understated style and reserved demeanor are in opposition to David's animated ways. Strong has come in with John Haber, the director of King Mackerel and the Blues Are Running, a modest off-Broadway musical revue the Dodgers are producing this spring. The two men sit on a small sofa. Soon David gets off the phone and focuses on the reason for this meeting: Haber's budget for his show.  <p> David and Strong study copies of the document.  <p> "What about these headphones?" Strong asks, pointing to a line item that might cost $1,500.  <p> "I noticed that, too," David says.  <p> Haber explains why he wants the headphones--to communicate with technicians during the show--but he soon seems ready to scrap the expense. David and Strong move on, but the exchange is telling. The Dodgers are putting only $20,000 into this revue, a paltry sum compared to the millions they'll spend on How to Succeed. Yet both David and Strong question every expense. They do this because they have to. Today theatrical producers must be maniacal in their determination to hold the bottom line. The Dodgers' ability to do that--relentlessly--is the reason they're the only American producers who can boast of having less than eight months of dark nights on Broadway during the past 12 years, an accomplishment that puts them in a league with Andrew Lloyd Webber, the composer-producer of Cats, The Phantom of the Opera, and Sunset Boulevard.  <p> Though they have produced some of Broadway's biggest recent hits, the Dodgers go out of their way to deflect publicity from themselves and toward their shows. In fact, they routinely avoid giving interviews, so the early history of the group has been unusually sketchy. "The Dodgers is an amalgam of six guys who met 15 to 18 years ago and have been together ever since," says David--who, along with Strong and Sherman Warner, constitutes a core corporation within the larger Dodger partnership. From offices high above Times Square, now remodeled to link with those of Kardana Productions, Hart's company, the three men manage the daily operations of all Dodger shows.  <p> The other three Dodgers work on particular projects for the group, but they also have careers of their own. Des McAnuff, the former director of La Jolla Playhouse, is a Tony Awardwinning director. Rocco Landesman heads Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns five Broadway houses. Doug Johnson is an illustrator; he often designs the Dodgers' graphically bold posters. The group's name "came out of the birthplace of our organization--Brooklyn," says Warner, who is 50. Studious, almost reticent, Warner oversees the number-crunching end of the Dodger operation. "Dodger' was sort of a generic name for people from Brooklyn," he says. "Short for trolley dodgers. But it also conjures up Dickens's Artful Dodger." There's also the obvious reference to the legendary Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team.  <p> In 1981, after working in not-for-profit theater for some years, the Dodgers got their break when they raised money to move Pump Boys and Dinettes to Broadway from a small theater where it was playing off-off-Broadway. It was a brilliant decision. The show ran for 21 months, spawned a national touring company, and ended up making its investors $1.75 on the dollar.  <p> The Dodgers followed this success in 1985 with Big River, the Roger Miller musical based on Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn and directed by McAnuff. The show won seven Tony Awards, ran two years on Broadway, and toured nationally. Curiously, it didn't make much profit for its investors--although as managers of the show, the Dodgers did well. Over the next several years Dodger Productions went on to manage or stage Into the Woods, a Stephen Sondheim musical; The Secret Garden, Lucy Simon and Marsha Norman's children's musical; Prelude to a Kiss, Craig Lucas's romantic comedy; and Jelly's Last Jam, for which the Dodgers served as executive producers. All enjoyed long runs, but none was a financial blockbuster. "We're most proud of making things into hits that have been declared in lots of places not hits," says David. "That applies to Big River, The Secret Garden, and Into the Woods, all of which The New York Times critic dismissed, and all of which ran for two years or more."  <p> The one production the Dodgers couldn't save was The Gospelat Colonus, a weird concept of a show that set the tragedy of Oedipus to black gospel music. It opened in 1988 and closed after just 12 weeks of previews and performances, losing its entire $1.4 million capitalization budget. "It almost closed us forever," says David about the show, which Warner fondly describes as "tremendously creative" but not right for Broadway. Despite the disaster, the Dodgers learned this from Gospel: In the future, they would gamble only on popular works that didn't need help from the critics. <p> For the Dodgers, the early 1990s have been a vindication of this philosophy. With Hart they produced Guys and Dolls and Tommy; How to Succeed, which opens at the end of this month, is next. The Dodgers are managing <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Disney's</b></a> Beauty and the Beast; with Madison Square Garden they produced Alan Menken's musical adaptation of A Christmas Carol, which will run each Christmas season at the Paramount Theater for years to come. The Dodgers are also bringing Hamlet to Broadway for a limited run this spring. The play will star Ralph Fiennes, now a bankable name as a result of his Academy Award nomination last year for Schindler's List. <p> Still, even for a team as successful as the Dodgers, a question now looms. When will rising costs make any Broadway show, no matter how cannily it's constructed, economically unviable? <p>  <p>It seemed calculated to incite reaction--calculated even for Frank Rich, a man who angered so many people during his 11-years tint as chief theater critic for The New York Times. In a Times op-ed column titled "Panic on Broadway," Rich called the December 4 closing of Angels in America, the only new American drama then running on Broadway, "the most resounding final curtain in the history of the Broadway theater." Then he went on to declare, in his usual no-holds-barred style, that Broadway hovered at "the edge of doom."  <p> Indeed, the fall of 1994 was not a good season. In October, Neil Simon, so associated with Broadway he has a theater named for him, caused a stir by announcing he would stage his next play off Broadway, citing Broadway's limiting economic structure. Besides Lloyd Webber's Sunset Boulevard, which earned $38 million in advance sales but tepid reviews, few shows opened. Most notable was Show Boat, a revival of the classic 1927 musical produced by Garth Drabinsky, a Canadian entrepreneur. In fact, so few new productions opened that, in moves that elicited both laughter and ridicule from Broadway circles, the Tony Award committee hinted publicly that it might have to start recognizing off-Broadway shows just to fill its categories. That behavior angered Pulitzer Prizewinning playwright Edward Albee, who charged that the committee's we-don't-have-anything-else attitude was insulting to theater people who worked off-Broadway, himself included.  <p> Where had all the new shows gone? The problem was simple enough.With ticket prices so high--$70 orchestra seats are common--audiences now expect to be dazzled by nothing less than an enormous falling chandelier or a helicopter rising from the stage. No quiet dramas or romantic comedies for today's audiences; they can watch those at home on television for free. And why are ticket prices so high? The $70 tag is vital if producers are to have any hope of offsetting, using their limited number of seats, both a show's start-up costs and the weekly "nut" needed to run it. Capitalization costs for musicals now vary from the $3 million to $6 million range (Guys and Dolls, Damn Yankees) all the way to the $13 million to $14 million range (Sunset Boulevard, Show Boat). Even a simple one-set drama requires more than $1 million in start-up money. Weekly nuts can also be staggering, varying anywhere from $350,000 (Guys and Dolls) to $600,000 (Show Boat). Regular expenses include rent, all labor costs including actors' wages, a producer's fee, and a royalty pool for the creative team.  <p> It is the money a show earns each week over its nut that producers use to repay gradually the investors who put up capitalization money. Once the investors have been made whole, the show goes into profit, which is divided between the producers and investors. Unfortunately, as rents and labor costs drive up weekly nuts, only megamusicals such as Cats and Les Miserables can consistently rack up sales higher than their nut--meaning that many Broadway shows never recoup their initial investment. In 1989, for example, investors put up $8.7 million to finance Jerome Robbins' Broadway, a compilation of musical numbers from Robbins's previous shows. The Shubert Organization, as both the show's producer and a major investor, provided the theater at reasonable rates. The show's weekly nut was about $425,000; at capacity, it would generate about $550,000 in sales. With excellent reviews and a Tony Award for Best Musical, the show did sell out business--but only for a time. Then business fell off until it only barely covered the nut.  <p> Jerome Robbins' Broadway ran for 86 weeks, far longer than any of the original works from which its songs came, classic productions such as Peter Pan, West Side Story, and Gypsy. Even so, the show returned only 55 percent of its capitalization, making it a financial flop. A flop, that is, for investors. The Shuberts did better. While they lost about $1 million on their initial investment, they took in more than $2 million in rent alone. Such economics likely helped the organization decide to stop producing shows and concentrate on making money as Broadway's landlord.  <p>  <p>Anyone who raises enough money can produce a Broadway show; producers need deal only with their investors and a theater's owner. Some producers open a show or two, get burned, and flee. Even those who end up with a hit may leave, usually after they learn just how perverse the business is. Because of these short half-lives, producers traditionally have had little clout on Broadway. Instead, the vital functions of this industry--including labor negotiations--have been controlled for years by the theater owners, who stay in place as producers come and go.  <p> These days, the main theater owners are the Shubert Organization, Nederlander Theaters, and Rocco Landesman's Jujamcyn Theaters. Of the three, the Shuberts are the most powerful by far--not just because they own the most houses, 16 plus one co-owned theater from a total of 28, but because they rent to some of Broadway's biggest cash cows: Cats, The Phantom of the Opera, Les Miserables, and Miss Saigon, to name four. Shows such as these provide a rich and predictable cash flow, a rarity on Broadway. So from their offices atop the Shubert Theater on 44th Street, Bernard B. Jacobs, 78, and Gerald Schoenfeld, 69, have run much more than just the Shubert Organization. Crusty and old-worldly, these two men have run the very business of Broadway. Over time, they have also found themselves at odds with the industry's younger producers.  <p> John Hart sees the conflict as partially generational. "The Dodgers and I are younger," he says. "We've been saying for years that costs have been getting out of control, and the Shuberts did everything they could to silence us. We ran our shows and they ran the [labor] negotiations. The Shuberts would dismiss me in meetings. It's intimidating when the largest theater owner tells you to sit down."  <p> The unions are the third key player on Broadway. For years, theater owners have given in to their demands, since extra costs could be passed right along to the producers. The owners, led in negotiations by the Shuberts, cared mostly about keeping the labor unions on the job: After all, a strike would stop the steady flow of rent. As a result, labor costs have ballooned ever since the late 1970s, when generous cost-of-living provisions combined with rampant inflation.  <p> But the balance of power on Broadway is shifting. Today, because they control all but a handful of shows, established producers such as the Dodgers, Cameron Mackintosh (Miss Saigon, Les Miserables), and Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Co. have as much clout as--maybe even more than--the theater owners. After a decade of success, these few producers now have the cash and the determination to fight for a bigger say in Broadway's future.  <p> "The Shuberts have always held the upper hand," says Frank Richfrom his office at The New York Times. "But now there's not so much product, and the Shuberts have gotten out of the producing business. So who holds most of the cards? The producers producing the big, money-churning musicals have more power than they have had in decades. Now the theater owners depend on them. Finally the producers can take over the various labor negotiations." <p> When it happens, the showdown will center on some of the most curious and expensive work rules in any major American business. Some are profoundly lacking in logic. For example, under union rules, producers must hire a set number of musicians for a musical, no matter how many they actually need. For Tommy, the Dodgers had to hire 24 musicians, though they needed just 16. For months, eight people showed up each week just to collect their paychecks. During lengthy negotiations, the Dodgers tried to convince the union to drop the requirement. The union finally agreed that as musicians quit, they wouldn't be replaced--but just for Tommy. Legendary producer David Merrick (42nd Street, Gypsy, Hello Dolly!) had a different approach: He would force all unused musicians to show up for each performance and play their instruments in the rest room.  <p> Other rules are arcane or outdated. A show must have a curtainman, for instance, even if the theater doesn't have a curtain. Many shows must keep a carpenter on hand for most rehearsals, though there's rarely work to be done. The salaries of theater workers are not insignificant, either. Stagehands, to name one group, make a minimum of $804 a week, plus another 58 percent in pension and other benefits. Factoring in holidays and overtime, a busy stagehand can make $100,000 or more a year--and work only a few hours a night.  <p> Bizarre work rules may infuriate producers, but the Shubert Organization doesn't seem too upset by current Broadway economics."The gloom and doom is overstated," says Lee Silver, a spokesman for the company. "This talk has gone on for generations. It started before World War II." Indeed, Silver, an older man who often speaks with a sharp, dismissive tone, has a quick answer for almost all the issues now affecting Broadway theater.  <p> On theater owners' role in the skyrocketing costs of Broadway shows: "All of this is not an accurate assessment of the theater as it has evolved over the years." On why the audience for Broadway has stagnated: "We don't get much coverage [on TV]." On why there are so few emerging playwrights: "A writer of a stage play decide she doesn't want to be bludgeoned by the critics. Many playwrights have gone to Hollywood and television to write drama." On Neil Simon's decision to take his next play off Broadway for economic reasons: "Neil Simon is not a good example of anything. [But] since he's such an icon of Broadway, it becomes a horror story." On Frank Rich's criticism of theater owners: "People believe that what appears in the Times is cut in granite. It's not." <p> Bill Moriarity, president of Local 802, the musicians' union, believes that the current salaries are justified for workers in a business as unpredictable as Broadway. Like Silver, he believes Rich's doom saying is disturbing and biased. "It was driven by a small number of producers," he says. "Those named in the column: Cameron Mackintosh, the Dodgers. They are younger people with a different type of background with unions." This is true, of course, which is why a strike may result when the current contract with Local 1, the stagehands' union, expires this summer. Producers are determined to lower the cost of their shows by tackling their biggest expense, labor, even if it means a work stoppage. "That's what has to happen," says Michael Riedel, theater critic for the New York Daily News, "or Broadway is going to stay what it is--an airport hangar for big musicals by Andrew Lloyd Webber." <p>  <p>Back at 1501 Broadway, it's another day and another blur of telephone calls for John Hart. He's currently producing his second film, Drunks, which will star Faye Dunaway. He's planning a week long sailing trip with Pete Townshend, the author of Tommy, with whom Hart has become close friends. And How to Succeed is making steady progress. It starts a run at the Kennedy Center in Washington,D.C., in February before moving to Broadway in March.  <p> Business hasn't always been so good for Hart, whose first Broadway production was Eubie, a 1978 revue based around ragtime pianist Eubie Blake, whom Hart had met at Dartmouth College when Blake came to accept an honorary doctorate. Hart followed Eubie with Onward Victoria, a show based on the life of Victoria Woodhull, who in 1872 became the first woman to run for U.S. president. It got such devastating reviews that it closed the night it opened, losing its entire $1.4 million startup budget. Modest success ensued--How I Got That Story, Smart Aleck, The Common Pursuit, The Leader of the Pack--until Hart had a chat in the fall of1991 with Dodger Ed Strong.  <p> The Dodgers had secured the rights to Guys and Dolls from the estates of Loesser and Burrows, but they wanted help raising the more than $5 million it would take to put the show on. "Can you raise money?" Strong asked Hart. Indeed he could--a little over $2 million from 50 different investors. When Guys and Dolls opened in 1992, it was an immediate sensation, and another project for Hart and the Dodgers became inevitable. That was Tommy. Now established as a team, Hart and the Dodgers are hoping for their biggest hit yet with How to Succeed.  <p> A key element in the new show will be Matthew Broderick, who can make How to Succeed into the star vehicle Guys and Dolls and Tommy were never conceived to be. Hart was instrumental in getting Broderick to commit. The actor became seriously interested in the project after he and Hart began to socialize together, often playing squash in New York City at the Yale Club, where Hart is a member.  <p> On an afternoon in early December, Broderick explains his involvement in the show over a late lunch at a La Jolla restaurant high upon a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. At 32, Broderick no longer has about him the fresh innocence that defined him when he broke onto the scene years ago. Still, for someone so young he's had a prolific career, appearing on Broadway in Neil Simon's Brighton Beach Memoirs (for which he won a Tony) and Biloxi Blues and in motion pictures such as Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Freshman, and Glory.  <p> At first, Broderick says, he was uneasy about doing How to Succeed, despite his friendship with Hart. He felt the play's lead character was too closely associated with Robert Morse. What persuaded him to do the show was the addition to the project of Dodger Des McAnuff, the winner of Tony Awards for directing Big River and Tommy. With McAnuff attached, the project promised to be innovative, for McAnuff has dedicated himself to revitalizing the theater by using new technology and cinematic techniques. <p> Even with McAnuff signed on, however, there was the problem of the script for How to Succeed, a piece rooted in the corporate world of the early 1960s. "Some people thought of the play as sexist because it's about women being secretaries and men being businessmen," Broderick says as he eats his meal. "But it's a satire. In the play, the women actually run the company." To prepare for playing J. Pierpont Finch, the ultimate corporate man, Broderick drew on his experiences with Hart at the Yale Club. "I could see all those old men with their towels and their wooden lockers with no locks, and all of their hair tonics, and their really good shower heads. It's the way WASPs live, you know."  <p> To modernize the show without destroying its lyrics, McAnuff uses a never-ending flow of characters on stage, countless backdrops that come and go, and a mammoth video wall that flashes an endless assortment of images, giving the production a high-tech, corporate feel. A few hours after lunch, when Broderick takes the stage in one of the show's last California tryouts, he brings Finch to life, reinventing the character who climbs the ladder at WorldwideWicket Co. with enviable ease. Near the end of the play, Broderick's Finch sings--to himself--"I Believe in You," the show's signature song, following it up with a breath takingly spirited version of "Brotherhood of Man," performed with the men of the cast and the astonishing Lillias White as Miss Jones.  <p> In this moment, How to Succeed achieves Broadway's loftiest goal: It moves its audience in a profound and memorable way. <p>  <p>On a wintry day in January, a passerby walking down 42nd Street in New York can look into the New Amsterdam Theater, a dilapidated building that was once the home of the Ziegfeld Follies, and see workmen and engineers planning the renovation of the historic theater. This is one of several developments that will help upgrade Times Square, too long a seedy, even dangerous section of the city. In 1993, David Letterman moved his television show to the Ed Sullivan Theater, prompting a major renovation of the Broadway landmark. <a name="AMEX:VIA"></a><b>Viacom's</b> MTV plans to convert another theater for concerts and special events. And there are rumors that a massive redevelopment project may finally start soon. Yet amid all this activity, the event that has drawn the most interest among theater insiders is the arrival on Broadway of the Walt Disney Company.  <p> After flirting with theater by opening Beauty and the Beast at the Palace last year--the show consistently plays to standing-room-onlyaudiences--Disney made a more substantial commitment by agreeing to sign a long-term lease for the New Amsterdam, which it will renovate with loans from the city and the state. The powerful media conglomerate will be watched closely. Some believe Disney productions will project a theme-park mentality on Broadway. But others are thrilled to see any major new presence here. "Disney brings in an audience that is different from the traditional Broadway audience," says Dodger Sherman Warner. "And they're serious about this. They're not carpetbaggers. They're going to make an investment in the community and stay."  <p> A few blocks away, Michael David walks hurriedly through Times Square. He's headed for the Richard Rodgers, where How to Succeed first opened in 1961 and will open again in only a few weeks. "You know," he says, "we--the Dodgers--have a continuity on Broadway now. As do Lloyd Webber and Mackintosh. We've all been around enough to learn from our mistakes. We know the business can't continue like this."  <p> He goes on in a subdued manner. "We're talking with the unions to try to resolve the situation," he says, "but if we can't resolve the situation, then we'll just have to endure a walkout." From his resigned tone, it's clear what he expects to happen.  <p> Before long, David is inside the theater, standing on the stage where yet another of his productions will soon be playing. As he lingers there, he is dwarfed by the vast expanse of stage. He looks out into the auditorium, row upon row of plush red seats, all of them empty. In a few months, this tableau may be heartbreaking. But today, while there's still hope, it inspires.  <p> "What a beautiful sight," David whispers. "A beautiful sight." <p><p>

						Dan Montano said he was rewriting the rules of Wall Street. Instead he became the central character in a rare financial drama, one in which the brokers are the victims.    <p> By Jesse Kornbluth  <p> On a pleasant morning a few weeks before Orange County discovered it had lost $2 billion investing in derivatives, Dan Montano drove his 1989 Lincoln Continental down from his home in the California hills to an office near Disneyland. His wife was by his side and he was feeling grandiose. It didn't matter that he wore suits with J.C. Penney labels or that Taco Bell was his favorite restaurant. What mattered was that he was founder and chief executive of a rapidly expanding brokerage firm that bore his name: Montano Securities. And in just two years, it had grown from a whistle-stop with seven brokers to a burgeoning operation with 10 offices employing 250 full-time and 650 part-time brokers. Before the end of 1995, he believed, Montano Securities would double or triple in size and go public. He would be acclaimed as the next <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab.</b></a>  <p> Montano's strategy for growth was poster-simple. In 25 cities, he ran newspaper ads and radio commercials aimed at retired white-collar professionals, women whose children had left the nest, immigrant cab drivers and shopkeepers. "You can be a stockbroker," the promotions declared. They offered a free seminar for further explanation. During these sessions, regularly held in overlit hotel meeting rooms, Montano would launch into a sales pitch that usually struck a chord with his audience. It went something like this:  <p> The brokerage system in the U.S. is rigged. A sham. Why? Because no one can take the Series 7 examination to become a broker without first having a job offer from an established firm. For people like you and me, it's a catch-22, a rule designed to keep us from selling stocks. The big firms don't want us. They only want to hire young white males to sell stocks to other white males. <p> Montano Securities can help. We offer jobs, training, and away to take the Series 7 exam. Join Montano, and see why the securities business can be the greatest business in the world. <p> The crowds listened to Dan Montano's story and concluded that he talked their language. They read his self-published 1992 paperback, The 21st Century Stockbroker. Then they signed up for his ten-session, $495 evening course and joined his flock.  <p>
On that october morning, Montano had planned to preach his populist vision to a magazine writer. He wanted to explain how he had enrolled 5,300 people in his course. And he wanted to add that this was just the beginning--the start of a revolution that would one day make Wall Street truly accessible to the full spectrum of the American middle class. Never mind that his firm provided its brokers with no actual training in selling, no lists of client leads, and little in the way of research. Montano Securities had already become the 30th biggest securities firm in the nation. <p> The evangelizing, however, would have to wait. Montano had some unexpected visitors. Stone-faced representatives of the National Association of Securities Dealers had dropped in for an unannounced, closed-door grilling. The regulators had no interest in Montano's visions or ideals. Their concern was the bottom line. Having noticed that a company with the unlikely name of California Quartz had just announced an investment of up to $4 million in Montano's enterprise, they wanted to know how badly he had been strapped for cash. Had his company been--not to put too fine a point on it--illiquid?  <p> The regulators left without taking action against Montano or Montano Securities. But all was not well at the company--far from it. On the very day the NASD came to visit, a conflagration was already brewing among Montano, California Quartz, and a number of familiar characters from the darker side of the brokerage industry--in particular, Pat Rooney, the former head of Rooney, Pace, a firm that itself was the subject of a two-year investigation by the NASD in the late 1980s.  <p> The prize in this battle: Montano Securities and its newly assembled sales force--a group of middle-class people with honest ambitions, clean records, and no previous connection to the shady world of bucket shops. A fusillade of puzzling financial statements and corporate shell games ensued. It lasted into the week before Christmas, when the commission checks of Montano brokers bounced and Dan Montano was finally ousted.  <p>
In the months before its founder lost control, the most remarkablething about Montano Securities--at least to an outsider--was the company's network of brokers. I talked with a number of them before the firm disappeared from beneath them--all smart, decent types. Like Jerry Markowski, one of Montano's part-time brokers,who is more like the lead in a Frank Capra film than a character from the movie Wall Street.  <p> Markowski, an immigrant from Poland, arrived in Chicago in 1981 as a 19-year-old with only a dollar in his pocket. Three years later, he had mastered English and was building electronic equipment as an employee of <a name="NYSE:ITT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10773"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ITT Corp.</b></a> But Markowski dreamed of making a fortune, and for that he had to break with tradition. "In Chicago, Polish people invest in single-family houses--it's the only way they know to make money," he said. "I bought stocks. After I made enough money in <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a> for a 25 percent down payment on a $150,000 town house, I started telling people what stocks I liked. I called a few places about becoming a broker, but when they heard my accent, they weren't interested."  <p> Markowski, now 32, married, and a father, heard Montano's radio commercial while he was driving to work and promptly enrolled at his school. Soon he was wearing a pager and carrying a cellular phone at ITT, then driving to the Montano office to service his clients and prepare a daily market report--in Polish--for a community newspaper. "There are 800,000 Polish-speaking people in Chicago and only two other Polish-speaking investment counselors I'm aware of," he told me in a ringing affirmation of his Montano affiliation.  <p> Other Montano brokers fitted the same mold: self-starters who wanted little more than a chance to succeed. Dick Schwaucker of St. Louis wore his TWA copilot wings in Montano's Chicago office when he checked prices and conferred with clients during layovers. In Washington, D.C., Jimmy Bian met with owners of Indian restaurants and groceries in the hope of redirecting the flow of investments of the Indian community to accounts at Montano. From a small desk in the Orange County office, 33-year-old Brian Chin made investment-banking connections in Korea. And Doc Norden, who would be designing particle-beam weapons at Grumman today if only the Cold War hadn't ended, called fellow members of the American Physical Society from his desk at Montano's New York office to announce, "I've switched to Wall Street."  <p> In their ignorance of the ways of the Street, many of the Montano brokers came up with good ideas about how to sell securities. "I won't let a customer invest with me until I've spent an hour in the same room with him," New York's Cy Yaranelli told me."That's a slow process--it will take me two to four years to make what I used to earn in the printing business--but I know my customers. And I smile more." There were other reasons for Yaranelli's happiness than good customer relationships. At Montano, most managers discouraged cold calling. Nor were brokers required to push stocks from the firm's inventory.  <p> "So how do they get clients?" a former <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> broker asked after being told about Montano's operating methods. "Look, when you start at Merrill, they give you a sheet each morning with numbers from one to 100. You start calling, and you keep moving. You sell funds that are brokers' dreams--no up-front costs, only costs at the end the customers don't think about.You're told to push things, and you get bonus points if you sell them on certain nights. That's the Merrill system, and it's the best on the Street."  <p> The Montano crew believed this traditionally effective system was on the verge of extinction. "Cold calling is dead," said Joan Coullahan, who signed on in Washington, D.C., so that she could work and still put her child on the school bus and take her off everyday. "Within five years, if you call people and their phone isn't programmed to accept your number, the technology will ring it busy and switch you to an answering machine. But we go to the mountain. We sit with people we know, look them in the eye, and say, I need to tell you about an infallible financial-planning concept: wealth over time.' "  <p> By and large, these recruits were extraordinarily loyal. "If the ship goes down, you'll see bubbles out of my mouth," said Chicago branch manager Nick Tscouris. Montano Securities counted on such fierce loyalty to keep it out of trouble. Montano knew that the firm would be on the hook if a broker got into legal hot water by selling an inappropriate product to a client or churning an account, but the company's systems for preventing violations of securities law were primitive by the standards of big firms on Wall Street. "Every trade funnels to this office," said Montano's son, Alex, who served as chief of compliance at the firm. "We can't stop a broker from doing something wrong, but we can catch it."  <p> "We've had to unwind a few trades, but we've had no formal customer complaints in 15 years," Dan Montano exulted back in October. <p>
Dan Montano isn't always the most credible source, either about himself or about his company. More than once, he has shown a willingness to resort to deception as a means to an end. Even his own children recount a story of how he once packed them into a car as youngsters and began driving toward Tijuana. He told them he was angry at them for not appreciating him more and that once they arrived in Mexico, he was going to trade them for children who would show more gratitude. The kids panicked and begged for another chance. His point made, Montano turned the car around. And soon they were waking up before dawn to wave goodbye as Dad drove off to work, and lining up at the door to greet him when he returned.  <p> Even Montano's outward appearance is misleading. Meeting him, you would never guess that Montano spent much of his childhood rumbling on the streets of East Los Angeles. Behind his glasses, he has the mildly pneumatic appearance of a 46-year-old man whose idea of exercise is to carry his briefcase to his car. With his short wavy hair swept straight back, he hardly looks the part of a slick, aggressive salesman.  <p> But Montano recalls that his father, "the only dark face in his unit of the Army Air Corps," became a boxer by necessity; family legend has it that he was heavyweight champion of the corps in 1945. Later, he turned professional. "If he won, we had meat," Montano says. "If not, beans."  <p> As a child, Montano claims, he was given boxing gloves before he got his first pair of shoes. He spent much of his childhood in fights, mostly winning. "People would ask: He's weak, skinny, and has bad eyes.' " Montano recalls. "My dad would explain, He knows the secret: The last guy standing wins.' " Montano didn't apply that same tenacity to his studies. "I spent half my time in gangs, half running away," he says. "In tenth grade, I got four Fs and two Ds. People thought I would die in the gas chamber."  <p> But at 14, he read a book about J.P. Morgan and decided he was destined for Wall Street. At 18, already married, he filled out applications at five New York brokerage companies with Los Angeles offices. "No one wanted me. At a Los Angeles firm called Noble,Cooke, I said I'd work for free, so they took me on."  <p> In the early 1970s, Montano worked at a firm that raised money for companies in the emerging field of computers. Some of these businesses soured; one, a small firm called Datatron, asked him to be chairman of its board. Soon, he fired the CEO and tookover as CEO himself. He was just 26. "At the next board meeting, everyone resigned," he remembers. "I knew the buzzwords, but I had no idea what a semiconductor really was." When Montano joined Datatron, he bought its stock at 25 cents. Eighteen months later, he says, it was $4.50.  <p> He started Montano Securities in 1979 with the idea of serving as an investment bank for small companies. But the firm, too under capitalized to go after the best deals, languished. Other business efforts--a trading desk in London, a plan to build a retirement community in the Philippines, and an attempt to revive a neglected gold mine--also failed.  <p> His history also includes a run-in with federal regulators. In 1992, the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that the gold mine Montano tried to rescue hadn't been tested sufficiently to support his optimistic claims. It formally ordered him to cease and desist. In another action related to the gold mine, Massachusetts also barred Montano from conducting any private placements in that state for a year.  <p> As he weaves his tale of ambition and disappointment, Montano points to a painting hanging in his office of a sailing ship fighting its way through a severe storm. In the picture, there are just a few sailors courageous enough to remain on deck, and only one gutsy enough to climb the rigging. "That's me," Montano says. "I'm lashed to the mast."  <p>
Montano's plan to become the next Charles Schwab began in 1991 while he was serving as the president of a brokerage firm called Baraban Securities. When Montano became interested in Baraban, the firm was operating under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act, which allows a company protection from creditors while it works out a repayment plan. Montano proposed that Montano Securities--still only a tiny outfit, but one he claimed was profitable--take over Baraban without any immediate compensation. He also offered to work for free, help cut costs, and even pick up the tab for the services that he, his son Alex, and several others would provide. Baraban accepted.  <p> What Baraban's management didn't know was that Montano Securities actually had a $1 million cumulative operating deficit, according to court documents. After taking control, Montano quickly began shifting his own payroll to Baraban's. This included Ann-Marie Montano, who at 18 was paid $21,000 a year to answer phones; 23-year-old Amy Montano, paid $36,000 annually as Baraban's executive vice president; and 20-year-old Alex Montano, who earned $40,000 as chief of the research department. Heading the new Baraban "Network Service Center" to assist the brokers was a Montano family friend who had failed the Series 7 exam. The new chief financial officer, who earned $78,000 a year at Baraban, wasn't a certified public accountant.  <p> Bankruptcy judge Barry Russell later concluded that Montano's tenure at Baraban was essentially "an attempted hostile takeover from within." This would-be coup, according to the judge's findings of fact, was thwarted in August of 1992 by both the appointment of a new bankruptcy trustee and an offer from Jacinto Development Corp. to buy the company. Montano directed a Baraban employee to deposit $350,000 of the firm's fast-diminishing capital into a margin account he controlled. The bankruptcy trustee countermanded that payment. Montano told his employees to ignore the trustee. With that, the trustee fired Montano.  <p> In May 1994, the bankruptcy judge ordered Montano and the former chief financial officer for the firm to repay Baraban $595,380, with Montano individually fined an additional $500,000 for interfering with the sale of the firm--judgments that Montano is appealing. <p> Two days after the trustee fired Montano, all Baraban offices received faxes announcing that Montano Securities was going national and would welcome applications from brokers. Montano began to place newspaper ads that were nearly identical to Baraban's. And then, appropriating Baraban's business strategy, he began to recruit people who wanted to be brokers, trained them to take the Series 7 examination, and then gave them jobs selling securities. <p> From the beginning, though, Montano operated the company as though selling securities was a sideline. The cash cow was the school. Each new broker initially brought $500 into the firm, but few could generate any significant business off the bat. Without another revenue source, Montano had little choice but to continue his ads and grow his school; he churned out brokers at a rapid clip until the school took on some of the characteristics of reckless expansion.  <p> In mid-1994, the firm almost went broke, and Montano slashed its expenses. New brokers couldn't get business cards printed. In the New York City office, letters to clients were never mailed, and coffee had to be imported from a cart on the street. Some regional office chiefs dipped into their pockets to buy supplies and made a joke of the crisis.   <p> In September, Montano placed a barrage of phone calls to prospective investors: "First one with money owns the firm." In mid-October, California Quartz stepped up to invest in Montano. That firm,which originally produced quartz material for semiconductors, also owns the Focus Institute, a high-level vocational institute that retrains people from the aerospace and defense industries to work with computers. Why not follow Montano's lead and trainthose engineers to be brokers?   <p> "The synergy is very good," California Quartz CEO David Lopes told me in October. "The cost of our training is underwritten100 percent by the government. Now, what Dan does in his broker-education program is the bare minimum. We want to add to it, so his people can hit the ground running. They'd be trained to sell, they'll have computer skills, they'll be expert in spread-sheet analysis. "This specialized training doesn't come cheap--Lopes estimated that his proposed five-month program would cost $7,000 to $9,000 per person. Who would pay for it? "The government," Lopes said, with a self-confidence that made Montano seem ambivalent by comparison."We're making the applications now."  <p> The terms seemed clear: Cal Quartz would purchase a minority equity interest in the firm, but Dan Montano and his wife, Vicky, also signed an irrevocable proxy that would give Cal Quartz effective control of a majority of the voting shares. But nothing was exactly what it seemed--on either side. On December 16, Montano filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws to save it from the clutches of Wall Street operators who, he claimed, wanted to turn the firm into a bucket shop. A few days before, California Quartz had replaced Montano's board of directors with its own slate. These new directors had then tried to fire Dan Montano. <p> A shadowy figure runs through these maneuvers: California Quartz's advisor, Pat Rooney. In 1988, the NASD expelled the firm of Rooney,Pace, suspended its president, and punished five former brokers for stock manipulation. Rooney, who had left the firm in 1985, was banned from the securities business in the U.S. in early1989. He now lives in Bermuda and London, where he describes himself as a financial consultant.  <p> An October 17, 1994, letter from Pat Rooney to Montano makes it clear that Rooney envisioned aggressive sales practices for Montano Securities. In the letter, Rooney suggested, "The short-term strategy for Montano should be to get as many prospectuses as is practical on the street immediately. Product quality, of course, must be kept under control and our research concept must not be violated (too much)."   <p> Roney also suggested that Montano's brokers repackage small-capitalization penny stocks into something called PRAWNS, an instrument Rooney had invented. His influence with California Quartz apparently carried a bit more weight than it might have from some other advisor--the new Montano board put in place included Pat Rooney's son, John.  <p> Dan Montano says he was outraged upon "discovering" these plans. But this doesn't ring true. Montano knew all about Rooney before he signed the deal with California Quartz. He acknowledges taking Rooney's calls for almost a year. He even said Rooney was one of the people he talked to when he went looking for cash to save his firm.  <p> There's also confusion about the financial condition of Montano Securities. "In our due diligence, we saw a lot of disconcerting things," says David Lopes.  <p> Montano's numbers apparently didn't hold up to an audit conducted by his own accountant. Although Montano told Lopes that Montano Securities had made $953,000 in management fees in 1994, the auditor could find only $102,000. Montano claimed $1.9 million in revenue from trading and other sources, but the auditor could verify only $259,000. "They're wrong," Montano says in rejoinder. <p> When NASD demanded that the deal's structure be changed in light of Montano Securities' need for extra capital, Montano attempted to revoke the irrevocable proxy he and Vicky had signed. That part of the deal was void, he claimed. Now, he said, California Quartz owned no more than 16 percent of Montano. "I looked at him as he told me this and couldn't believe it," Lopes says."We were talking about an investment of $1.5 million!"  <p> That led to California Quartz's first attempt to fire Montano. But in a replay of the Baraban scenario, Montano refused to leave. Instead, he went out looking for an investor who would rid him of Cal Quartz.   <p> Montano's near-religious fervor to rescue the firm may have been something more than mere showmanship. Lopes insists that he's not Rooney's pawn and that Montano has used Rooney's involvement as a smoke screen. "Dan had a real-people concept, and with support at the corporate level and ongoing training, the brokers who are already there can make a living for themselves and a viable business for us," Lopes says.  <p> Nevertheless, according to a draft agreement, dated December12, 1994, California Quartz proposed to sell its 51 percent of Montano Securities--for $1--to R.G. Dickinson, a securities firm that, since 1987, has been involved in 28 arbitration hearings with investors and has received three NASD censures and fines. The NASD suspended the firm in 1987. The days of common folk as brokers and trusting customers may be over at Montano.  <p>
Financial magazines often publish stories about brokers who fleece their customers. This one turns out to be a story where the only real victims are the brokers--in this instance, the people who went to work for Dan Montano. Their original enthusiasm for a high-minded idea has only deepened their recent disillusionment. <p> "Dan has told us several things that were supposed to happen, and all he's done is leave us high and dry," Mike Nixon, the manager of Montano's Washington office, told me the week after the bankruptcy, "I've heard Dan wants us to move as a group. But if Dan, Amy, and Alex Montano are involved, forget it." <p><p>

						<p>By Ted C. Fishman and the Editors<p>--------------------<br><p>26. DENNIS J. KEEGAN<br>
Managing director, Salomon Brothers<p>PROFILE: In the bond market (the world's second largest financial market, after currencies), Salomon is the 800-pound gorilla, and Keegan is its keeper. Keegan's job is to trade on the differences in yields among fixed-income securities: He makes money if he correctly guesses whether the differences will converge or widen. A key component to Salomon's success is its ability to finesse the traders in the giant U.S. Treasury Bond pit at the Chicago Board of Trade, an infamously brutal market where traders who step in front of the Salomon freight train can get crushed. POWER MOVE: Keegan's trading earned Salomon $1 billion in the firm's year that ended in September 1994. That is not a typo. CAVEAT: Keegan's power stems from his position within the Salomon franchise; it accrues to whoever has the job. John Meriwether was the first to tame the markets by honing the arbitrage trading techniques Keegan has used to such good effect.<p><br>
27. DAN HERTZBERG<br>
National news editor of The Wall Street Journal<p>PROFILE: Maybe he doesn't tell the financial world what to think on the way to work, but he certainly tells it what to think about. For a serious investor or broker, beginning a day without The Wall Street Journal is like flying blind. In its pages are what your colleagues and competitors are talking about, and what they expect you to know. POWER MOVE: Hertzberg dictates the paper's news mix, deciding what is and isn't important. The Journal can boost companies or devastate them; most days it does a little of each. One study even found a correlation between headline size in the Journal and the stock prices of companies featured in the stories. CAVEAT: Shortly after the trading day begins, the Journal's impact has hit stocks. From then on, the paper is stale, and the breaking news and market forces take over. In that respect, electronic news sources have usurped much of the paper's clout: Today traders need CNN and Bloomberg as much as they need Dow Jones.<p><br>
28. E.E. "BUZZ" GEDULD<br>
President, Herzog, Heine, Geduld, Inc.<p>PROFILE: As head of market-making activities at one of the nation's top over-the-counter (Nasdaq) stock-trading firms, Geduld plays a hand in pricing over 4,500 stocks, from active stocks like Apple Computer to small new issues. Geduld forged his reputation in the 1980s by making markets in highly volatile new issues that few other traders would touch. His firm still makes markets in scores of thinly traded stocks, where as a skilled trader he can both move the stock and keep margins comfortably wide. POWER MOVE:  Herzog, Heine, Geduld makes markets in every new initial public offering, sometimes in 50 new stocks a week. The firm accounts for about 8 percent of the daily volume in Nasdaq stocks. CAVEAT: The current Justice Department probe into Nasdaq may hit Geduld's firm hard. The probe grew out of charges that market makers manipulate the spreads between buy and sell prices; the firm faced similar charges in the 1980s.<p><br>
29. FRED GRAUER<br>
Chief Executive Officer, Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisors<p>PROFILE: Grauer personally sells his investment approach to top officials at every pension fund of consequence in the country, and now internationally. He's done nothing less than change the way institutions invest their money: Plain-vanilla stock-and-bond portfolios are becoming a thing of the past. Grauer advocates a one-two punch of indexing (designing portfolios to mirror broad-based indexes like the S&P 500) and asset allocation (diversifying portfolios among different asset classes). Wells Fargo Nikko now controls $160 billion in assets, making it the largest institutional money manager in the country and one of the top five lenders of stock to short-sellers. POWER MOVE: To diversify his company's enormous pool, Grauer has pushed billions in pension dollars into new markets. CAVEAT: Don't try this at home. Grauer's success in indexing and allocation hinges on the firm's huge assets; individual investors can't duplicate it.<p><br>
30. RICHARD G. SHERLUND<br>
Partner, Goldman, Sachs & Co.<p>PROFILE: Investors looking to find the next Microsoft would do well to watch Sherlund. The computer-sector analyst has pushed and pulled the stock ever since his firm took it public. His power to move markets is tied mainly to his ability to pry information out of the software giant. More than anyone else, Sherlund is thought to have the inside dope on how new software is testing and where Bill Gates might focus next. He comments often in the weekly computer trade magazines, whose readers not only run the computer industry but speculate on it as well. POWER MOVE: In the face of widespread uncertainty, Sherlund predicted correctly last year that the Justice Department's actions against Microsoft would mean little to the company. Up went the company's stock--and his. CAVEAT: Sherlund has proved less prescient about Microsoft's competitors. He stayed positive for too long on Lotus Development--he liked it right up to the moment it lost half its value.<p><br>
31. ABBEY COHEN<br>
Co-chair of the Investment Policy Committee, Goldman, Sachs & Co.<p>PROFILE: An important economist and priceless stump speaker for Wall Street's premier investment firm, Cohen is a coveted guest at investment seminars and conferences. Under her direction, Goldman churns out reams of strategy reports that land on the desks of the firm's institutional customers. Her recommendations are wide-ranging, covering individual stocks on one hand and asset classes on the other. The directives cover all the financial markets and relate them to broad trends in politics, resource consumption, and finance. The underlying message, of course, is that Goldman covers the world and that clients are wise to stick with the firm that trades anything that moves. POWER MOVE: Cohen was a leading voice in Goldman's recent push to persuade clients to move major assets into commodities. Her research anticipated the big jumps in commodity prices over the last year. CAVEAT: Cohen's approach suits institutional investors best. Individual investors without access to Goldman's resources would be wise to follow her lead only in the areas of stocks and mutual fund portfolios.<p><br>
32. DAN DORFMAN<br>
Market writer and commentator<p>PROFILE: The most watched reporter on individual stocks--the man for tips and rumors. He predicts a takeover, and the stock price goes up. He murmurs about trouble, and the stock price goes down. Dorfman, who offers a "pick of the day" weekdays on CNBC, is responsible for more client phone calls to retail brokers than anyone else. SEC enforcers keep a file of Dorfman's USA Today commentaries. Why? People nabbed for insider trading use them as proof they traded on public information. POWER MOVE: In a Washington Post study of the 18-month period ended last May, 95 percent of the stocks Dorfman recommended jumped in price--by an average of 13 percent--in the minutes after his television commentary. CAVEAT: Only four in ten of the stocks Dorfman recommended in the same period remained winners in the following months. Dorfman is taking his written commentary to Money magazine, where he and his fans might be frustrated by his longer lead times. <p><br>
33. CHARLES SCHWAB<br>
Chairman, <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab & Co.</b></a>, Inc.<p>PROFILE: The brokerage industry's most restless innovator. Not satisfied with attracting $120 billion in assets to his discount brokerage--nearly half of all discount-brokerage business --Schwab has begun to move in on the mutual fund companies. His company leads in providing investors computerized tools to manage their own financial affairs: Today, clients with PCs can place orders, watch market news, and track their portfolios, all without ever having to hear a sales pitch. Power  move: Schwab's firm opened 800,000 new accounts in 1994 alone. Schwab OneSource, a one-stop-shopping service for more than 250 different mutual funds from various fund families, has attracted more than $13 billion in the past two years. Anointment by OneSource is a virtual guarantee that millions of dollars will flow into a fund. CAVEAT: While still a service leader among discounters, Schwab may lose some competitive edge to cheaper deep-discount brokerages.<p><br>
34. BORIS YELTSIN<br>
President, Russia<p>PROFILE: With billions of dollars of hedge-fund, merchant-bank, and mutual fund money flooding Russia, Western capitalists have a lot tied up in the fate of the former communist state. Under Yeltsin and Russian economic coordinator Anatoly Chubais, the state has struggled to put its economic affairs in order with monetary and fiscal controls, efforts international investors have found encouraging. So far, 14,000 large and midsize companies have been privatized; all need to attract investors. To stay on track, Yeltsin must keep ultra-nationalists and die-hard communists at bay--increasingly difficult as the political culture of the country fragments. POWER MOVE: The U.S. stock market rises and falls with Yeltsin's fortunes. It slid when he faced impeachment in 1993, then rebounded when he beat back his challengers. CAVEAT: If right-wing zealot Vladimir Zhirinovsky pushes Yeltsin aside, today's U.S. investments may become tomorrow's donations to nationalist bloodlust.<p><br>
35. EDWARD HYMAN JR.<br>
Chairman, International Strategy and Investment Group<p>PROFILE: Perhaps the most respected economist on Wall Street, Hyman has topped Institutional Investor's poll every year since 1980. Hyman does not recommend specific investments but does describe the economic environment in which they will operate. His output of reports and analyses is Promethean: Every morning his office faxes clients a four-page missive filled with facts and figures, and on Mondays it ships a 20-page newsletter. Hyman has two appeals: an outstanding track record and an ability to condense masses of data into something quickly read and easily digested. It would take some looking to find a major bank, money manager, or other big investor who didn't get Hyman's service. POWER MOVE: Hyman's regular surveys and comments on the auto industry, retail chains, and the bond market rival government statistics as market movers. CAVEAT: Hyman showed fallibility in 1994 when he was slow in seeing interest rate rises.<p><br>
36. WILLIAM GROSS<br>
Managing director, PIMCO Advisors L.P.<p>PROFILE: Manages the largest bond portfolio in the country, PIMCO's $56 billion behemoth. Don Phillips of Morningstar Mutual Funds once said Gross was "kind of like the Peter Lynch of bonds," and the description stuck. It fits Gross because his performance is exceptional and his investment choices are copied by other multibillion-dollar managers. Ten years ago, when he was still just the William Gross of the bond market, reeling traders in the Chicago Board of Trades bond pit waved handkerchiefs at Gross's brokers after a series of trades that netted millions for his clients. POWER MOVE: Gross was an early, successful U.S. entrant in the bond futures and international bond markets, helping blaze a trail into markets where daily dollar volume is counted in the trillions. CAVEAT: Gross struggled through the volatile bond market in 1994 and reshaped his strategies to maximize yields. Whether the retooling will keep him at the top of the heap remains to be seen.<p><br>
37. C. FRED BERGSTEN<br>
Director, Institute for International Economics<p>PROFILE: Regarded by currency traders as the voice of the Clinton administration on economic matters--despite disclaimers from the administration itself. When Lloyd Bentsen traveled to Tokyo in 1993, he reminded his audience that he, not Bergsten, was the secretary of the treasury. Bergsten's pronouncements are taken especially seriously in Japan. His reputation there rests on his consistent prediction, made first in the early '80s, that the yen would strengthen to correct the country's balance-of-payments surplus with the U.S.; he was, to say the least, on the money. POWER MOVE: In July, Bergsten caused a strong dollar rally when he predicted that the yen had topped out. Bergsten's suggestion was seen as a sign that the U.S. would soon complete its bilateral trade negotiations with Japan. As was the case. CAVEAT: It's possible that Robert Rubin won't like having a shadow secretary and will move to minimize Bergsten's influence.<p><br>
38. LEON BLACK<br>
Founder,  Apollo Advisors L.P.<p>PROFILE: Wall Street's most successful "vulture investor," a master at buying distressed securities on the cheap and selling them later for a huge profit. Black was formerly co-head of Drexel Burnham Lambert's mergers and acquisitions department: Michael Milken worked in Beverly Hills, Black in New York. Both put together junk bond packages and helped create the distress Black now feeds on. Black is said to have big interests in up to 100 companies. He has played the junk bond market brilliantly and now has a $5 billion war chest. POWER MOVE: Black sometimes builds clout by buying blocks of securities just large enough to let him prevent restructurings that don't suit him. It's been called the "1990s equivalent of greenmail." CAVEAT: Black's business is all about taking chances, and he can misstep--as in 1992 when he offered to help New York developer Peter Kalikow prop up his financial house of cards and bid for the New York Daily News.<p><br>
39. ANNE BINGAMAN<br>
Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division<p>PROFILE: Has broad powers to review the competitive practices of U.S. companies. Can bring suit to force companies to compete more fairly or split them up, and her approval is necessary for corporate mergers. Bingaman can also exert influence on the securities industry directly, challenging trading practices on and off exchanges. POWER MOVE: Bingaman is scrutinizing Microsoft's intended purchase of Intuit, on the grounds that Microsoft could dominate the future online market for financial services. She is also aggressively investigating anticompetitive collusion by over-the-counter market makers, an effort that could put a lot of quarters and halves into the pockets of people who trade Nasdaq stocks. CAVEAT: Bingaman's fight against corporate consolidation is not always welcome in the Clinton administration. Laura Tyson, chief economic advisor to the president, believes many U.S. companies need to group to compete against other global giants. Bingaman may have also stumbled badly in previous fights with Microsoft, where efforts to rein in the company have had no real effect.<p><br>
40. NEIL PERRY<br>
Head of Latin American research, Baring Securities<p>PROFILE: Helps U.S. and European money managers get comfortable in the exploding (and occasionally imploding) Latin American equity markets. Perry runs Baring Securities' team of Latin American market analysts. His influence extends throughout the parent company, Baring PLC, the world's oldest merchant bank and itself one of the ten largest managers of international assets. According to Institutional Investor, Perry is the No. 1 analyst in his field. POWER MOVE: Perry influences the stock picks of a number of big, internationally oriented mutual funds, including those run by Fidelity and Templeton. Last year, his 100-page argument that Mexican conglomerate Desc Sociedad de Fomento Industrial was undervalued helped nearly triple the price of the stock. CAVEAT: American firms, particularly Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch, are fortifying their teams of foreign-market analysts, which may dilute the influence of Perry and Baring.<p><br>
41. ALAN BLINDER<br>
Vice chairman, Federal Reserve Board<p>PROFILE: The No. 2 policy maker at the U.S. central bank since last June. Blinder is the most dovish and talkative Fed Board member on inflation, particularly when rate tightenings threaten progress on employment. Philosophically close to Clinton, for whom he served on the Council of Economic Advisers, Blinder is regarded as the one high official at the Fed who really understands employment as an issue. Blinder, who supported last November's rate hikes, is closely watched for potential dissent. Alan Greenspan can't distance himself too far from Blinder if he hopes to get the nod from the president for another term as Fed chairman in 1996. POWER MOVE: Blinder's general endorsement of rate hikes before the Fed acted in November triggered anticipatory slumps in the bond and stock markets. CAVEAT: Six months ago, when it seemed he might regularly challenge Greenspan, Blinder would have rated higher on this list. Lately, he's been going along to get along.<p><br>
42. WILLIAM T. ALLEN<br>
Chancellor, Court of Chancery of Delaware<p>PROFILE: Nearly half the companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (and some 214,000 in all) are incorporated in Delaware. The state's court system is a prime reason. Allen presides over Delaware's specialized business courts, which probably hear more major corporate-governance cases than courts in any other state. They certainly hear the big ones. In the last decade, Delaware courts heard cases related to many billion-dollar merger battles, including those over Paramount, insurer American General, and, most recently, Santa Fe and Snapple. Companies' fortunes often hinge on the rulings of the chancery judges. POWER MOVE: Allen himself presided over 1994's Paramount/Viacom/QVC battle, during which the stocks and options put in play in the merger gyrated wildly. CAVEAT: Other states would also like a piece of the incorporation action; a number of them are amending their business laws and courts to compete with Delaware.<p><br>
43. RICHARD SCOTT<br>
President and CEO, Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation<p>PROFILE: Richard Scott wants to own your hospital, or at least buy it and close it. He is the force behind the consolidation of much of the nation's health care business; his seven-year buying spree has netted him at least 4 percent of all the private hospitals in the country. (Columbia/HCA has 134,000 employees and more than 42,000 hospital beds.) Scott influences the entire health care sector by forcing economies of scale. He bargains hard with the likes of Baxter, the nation's largest supplier of medical goods; recently he said that he could "give them $800 million [worth of business] or nothing." POWER MOVE: Last October, Scott moved to snap up another giant piece of the hospital market, HealthTrust, the second-largest investor-owned chain, in a deal worth $3.6 billion in stock. CAVEAT: Attorneys general in Florida, Tennesse, Texas, and Utah think Scott is growing too fast and are acting nervous about the HealthTrust deal.<p><br>
44. PAUL TUDOR JONES<br>
Chairman, Tudor Investment Corp.<p>PROFILE: The most successful operator of futures funds. Though his recent results haven't approached his 500 percent return in 1984 or his 136 percent return the next year, he is one of only a few futures players who consistently wins for other people. In the last three years, futures funds have averaged returns in the low single digits, some of them to the left of zero; Jones's funds (for private clients only, by the way) have been up 18 to 25 percent. Jones trades in both agricultural and financial futures with a pot of $1.5 billion. POWER MOVE: Pit traders think Jones is consistently smarter than they are (they're probably right) and rush to follow him into a trade. Last year he correctly predicted that interest rates had bottomed out, thus skirting the disasters that hit much of the rest of the financial world. CAVEAT: As its assets and trading field expand, Jones's funds have begun to resemble the huge hedge funds. In the biggest league, Jones will have to be even more of an overachiever.<p><br>
45. TOMIICHI MURAYAMA<br>
Prime Minister, Japan<p>PROFILE: The socialist at the helm of the world's second-largest economy. Shakily. After a revolving-door series of leaders (four prime ministers in a year), Murayama took office last June amid grave doubts about his future. Apparently he means to stay. Murayama abandoned the Socialist party platform and transformed himself into something like a Liberal Democrat, the kind that has long led Japan. POWER MOVE: Keeping his job this long has been no mean feat. But if Murayama is going to have any real influence on financial markets, he must show that he's willing to push for the deregulation of Japanese industry. That means dealing with the Ministry of Finance, a bureaucracy that so far has proved impervious to change. The governing coalition's slogans, touting reform and deregulation, offer some hope. CAVEAT: Murayama's allies are his biggest threat. Prominent in his coalition is the most antireformist element in Japan--the public-sector labor unions.<p><br>
46. MARTIN ZWEIG<br>
Newsletter publisher and investor<p>PROFILE: Dr.Zweig--as his ads call him--runs the most prescient and widely followed of all stock market newsletters. He has long been a popular and frequent guest on PBS's Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser. Retail brokers expect calls on the stocks Zweig mentions and bone up on them. Often it's to stave off selling, for Zweig is known for his bearish sentiments (and, his marketers won't let you forget, for calling the 1987 crash). Of the several newsletters Zweig produces, Zweig Forecast is the most widely followed, not so much for the individual picks as for advice on timing the market. Indeed, of all the famous timers, Zweig is the only one left with his reputation intact. Zweig also runs a number of mutual funds, though others in his organization manage them. POWER MOVE: Since he began publishing it in 1971, Zweig's Forecast portfolio has never had a down year. CAVEAT: As with any investment letter, the Forecast's returns are reported without consideration of transaction costs, which are highest for individual investors.<p><br>
47. LEO O'NEILL<br>
Chief ratings officer, Standard & Poor's<p>PROFILE: Standard and Poor's is one of two agencies (Moody's is the other) that grade the creditworthiness of corporations and municipalities. The agencies are almost interchangeable and by design are lacking in stars. But O'Neill's work in corporate debt means a lot of CFOs know his name. Hiring the services of one of the debt raters is often a prerequisite for corporate borrowing. The rating directly affects the cost of money, and thus bottom lines. POWER MOVE: Though statistical upgrades of corporate debt ratings have little impact on companies' stock, downgrades can sink them. Last September, when Greyhound Lines ' junk bond debt was downgraded, the companies' bond and stock prices fell 15 percent. CAVEAT: Corporate bond ratings digest information that is already available in the public domain; more and more, they only codify old news. Big changes in corporate debt always hit the markets before debt-rating agencies have a chance to examine them.<p><br>
48. RUPERT MURDOCH<br>
Chairman and CEO, NewsCorp, Ltd.<p>PROFILE: The world's most acquisitive media mogul. Murdoch has spent some $3 billion over the last two years expanding his far-flung print and television empire. He began building in the 1980s, leveraging tabloids in his native Australia to buy newspapers in the U.S. and U.K. Murdoch rarely has trouble putting together new deals or finding the money to finance them. POWER MOVE: Last May, when Murdoch's Fox network snatched eight affiliates from CBS (as well as three from ABC and one from NBC), CBS stock got hit hard, dropping from $302 to $270 in a week of frenzied trading. One NBC executive purportedly told Murdoch that the deal would cost the peacock network $100 million. CAVEAT: Murdoch is constrained by laws that limit foreign ownership of U.S. television stations. And who can say with certainty that a different media mogul won't be even hungrier in 1995? It could be John Malone. Or Barry Diller. Or Sumner Redstone. . . . <p><br>
49. MARYANN KELLER<br>
Managing director and automotive analyst, Furman Selz Inc.<p>PROFILE: The dean of auto analysts, Keller covers the business that is the heart and soul of American industry. More than a number cruncher, Keller visits plants around the globe, looking under hoods and into corporate psyches. At a time when GM seemed indomitable, Keller predicted the Japanese ascendancy in the American market in the '80s. She understood the importance of Nissan's and Toyota's commitment to customer service. POWER MOVE: Keller's late-1993 book, Collision: General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen and the Race to Own the 21st Century, is widely cited in industry press coverage. Her monthly column in Automotive Industries is closely watched for news of trouble brewing at car companies and their suppliers. CAVEAT: Despite Keller's reputation, her post at smallish Furman Selz means she has less of an immediate impact on institutional and retail customers than do auto analysts at Wall Street's powerhouse firms.<p><br>
50. SADDAM HUSSEIN<br>
President, Iraq<p>PROFILE: What's a market-movers list without a maniacal despot? Hussein carries the banner for a host of leaders in the Middle East, Asia (North Korea), and former communist states whose belligerence makes financial markets nervous. Hussein's strongest financial influence, of course, is over energy prices, but before and during the Gulf War, his behavior affected prices in everything from bonds to pork bellies. Last year, Hussein mobilized troops along the Kuwaiti border and continued to punish domestic refugees. Indirectly, Hussein's presence contains oil prices; it reminds the Saudis of the need for U.S. protection. POWER MOVE: When Hussein directed troops toward Kuwait last October, crude prices and oil stocks spiked. When tensions subsided, prices slid back. CAVEAT: Hussein rankles Americans, but he's ultimately a lesser threat than the militant Islamic fundamentalists who intend nothing less than to change the nature of government and society throughout the Middle East.<p><p>YOU SAID SOMETHING, SIR?<p>By Josephn Nocera<p>The great delusion of all incoming presidents, dreaming their dreams of glory, is that they will be able to control events. The great, harsh reality is that events almost always control them. Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton--these are the presidents in my lifetime, and though their ideas and styles and philosophies span an enormous spectrum, they do hold one thing in common: They all had to learn, usually painfully, that they have far less control of their own destinies than they had imagined. Except maybe for Eisenhower, who seemed to know it all along.<p>You know the drill by now: The president who vows to balance the budget sees it balloon on his watch. The president who wants to shrink government finds himself tied up in knots by the bureaucracy. The president who hopes to focus on domestic affairs gets consumed by nasty little wars abroad. "When you first get to the White House," a former aide to Jimmy Carter once wistfully told me, "you have a tendency to hope that things will work out the way you want them to." But they never do. So why, oh why, would anyone think it's different when it comes to the market? Markets are fiendish creatures, immune to cajoling. If I were putting together a list of market movers--which, alas, I'm not--I don't know that I'd have room for a president anywhere on it. <p>It is often said that Wall Street prefers Republican presidents because it is such a fundamentally Republican place--and because Republicans supposedly care more about Wall Street's concerns. The only problem with this theory is that it doesn't hold up. Yes, it's true that the two sustained bull markets of the postwar era, those of the 1950s and the 1980s, were presided over by Republican presidents. But there is much less to that fact than meets the eye. The bull market of the 1950s was triggered by the obvious fact that America was the world's only economic superpower--a country whose companies got bigger and more profitable every year and whose workers had more money to spend each year. Eisenhower's main task during this wonderful boom time was to get out of the way, which, to his everlasting credit, he did.<p>As for the 1980s, that bull market didn't begin until Reagan had been in office nearly two years, and while the propagandists at The Wall Street Journal would give his supply-side program the bulk of the credit, it seems far more likely that the real credit belongs to Paul Volcker, whose tight money policy succeeded in squeezing inflation out of the economy. Unlike presidents, Federal Reserve chairmen really do have the power to move markets. Remember that another Republican president, Richard Nixon, presided helplessly over the most sustained bear market since the Great Depression. The only bounce Nixon ever got took place on the day he resigned.<p>The big problem for any president comes in trying to discern what exactly the markets want. For a long time, the conventional wisdom held that the single most important thing a president could do to make Wall Street happy was to balance the budget. Yet in 1980, when Carter momentarily succeeded in producing a balanced budget--the last president to even attempt such a feat--the markets tanked on him. He was then forced to unbalance the budget to revive the economy. In came Ronald Reagan, who blithely allowed the budget deficit to double while he was president, only to have the stock market triple during that time. So much for that theory.<p>What the markets usually respond to, of course, is a strong economy. And the truth is that presidents simply don't have much effect on the larger economy; if they did, we'd never have a recession, since no president would allow it. In a multitrillion-dollar economy like ours, even the biggest stimulus package is akin to throwing a pebble into the ocean.<p>Indeed, if anything has changed over the years, it is that the situation has become gradually impossible. The economy has become much larger and more complex, so much so that by the late 1970s, when it was clear that productivity had essentially stopped growing, Carter's economic advisors could not even figure out what the cause was, much less what to do about it. The Keynesian consensus, which guided policy makers for so long and offered a measure of comfort, no longer exists.<p>But worst of all, after all this time, a president's only real weapon in managing the economy remains his handling of fiscal policy. In addition to being a pathetically small weapon--more pocketknife than bazooka--it doesn't even offer any palatable choices anymore. If a president decides to lower taxes, which can stimulate the economy, the deficit will get ever more out of control--causing the government to spend ever larger sums on interest payments to its bondholders. If he raises taxes, he'll get booted out of office by those angry, overtaxed citizens who populate the land these days. Either way, the fickle markets probably won't be satisfied. This pretty well defines the condition of being between a rock and a hard place.<p>Which is another way of saying: Good luck, Mr. Clinton. When it comes to the markets, luck is what you'll need.<p><br>
"GENTLEMEN: I'LL RUIN YOU"<p>By Fredric Smoler<p>Men with the power to move markets have stalked Wall Street for a good, long time: The pirate Captain Kidd, who had considerable power to move the marine insurance markets, took up residence at 56 Wall Street in the late 17th century. At least until our own century, Captain Kidd's moral tone predominated in the area.<p>Jacob Little, known in the middle third of the 18th century as the Great Bear of Wall Street, specialized in the "manipulated short sale": He would sell shares he didn't have for delivery in 60 days, then dump the stock all over town and spread rumors about the target's insolvency. After buying the shares back at rock-bottom prices, he'd sometimes short the company again. Little was probably the first important full-time stock "operator." Several times blackballed before being admitted to the Board of the Exchange, he died broke but with his portrait on the wall above the vice-president's seat on the exchange.<p>Daniel Drew, a contemporary of Little's, learned the necessities of his future trade as a carnival barker. He began his financial career by trading cattle, buying them in Putnam County, New York, and selling them on the Bowery, and allegedly scored his first big hit by feeding his herd salt on the final night of the drive and then denying them water. The next morning he let them gorge at a stream in upper Manhattan and within a few hours sold them by the pound. <p>Drew formed a brokerage house in 1836. Soon one of the most powerful men on the Street, he dressed in old and sometimes threadbare clothing and cackled like a hen--usually, it was believed, at someone else's ruin. Drew was nearly illiterate. He was also a fantastically efficient predator. In one famous scam, he entered the Union Club in a state of quiet agitation, sweating profusely and apparently searching for someone. Invited to stay, he instead rushed out, mopping his brow with a handkerchief and in his rush dislodging from his pocket a slip of paper, which a nearby broker quickly snared. The note said, "Buy all the Oshkosh stock you can get at any price below par." The brokers present pooled to buy 30,000 shares; Drew immediately dumped Oshkosh, and it fell 12 points a day.<p>Drew, too, died broke, having several times crossed Cornelius Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt had markedly higher business ethics than most of his contemporaries, let alone Drew, but he was not one to turn the other cheek. In a telegram to some former associates, Vanderbilt announced, "Gentlemen: You have undertaken to cheat me. I won't sue you, for the law is too slow. I'll ruin you. Yours truly, Cornelius Vanderbilt." In 1863, a number of bears, including Drew, bribed the New York City Council to rescind a grant to Vanderbilt's Harlem Railroad. The councilors themselves apparently shorted Harlem stock as well, and it fell from 1165/8 to 72. Vanderbilt, however, had deep enough pockets to secure a corner and drove the stock to 180.<p>Jay Gould and Jim Fisk, however, attempted the most notorious corner in Wall Street history in 1869, when they tried to monopolize the gold market, driving it from 130 to 160, and produced the panic known as Black Friday. It's not clear that Gould and Fisk made money on the deal, but they achieved an imperishable sort of glory: "Nothing could be lost save honor," as Fisk remarked before the event, a line equaled only by his later response to a congressional inquiry as to where some investors' money was: "Gone where the woodbine twineth," answered Fisk. The aromatic woodbine, or honeysuckle, was grown around outhouses to mask the smell. Now that was a politer age than ours, if not a more scrupulous one. <p><br>
DELISTED<p>Sometimes you move the market, and sometimes you move aside, voluntarily or otherwise. Here are four people who would have made a Market Movers list as recently as a year ago:<p>* Elaine Garzarelli: In 1987 she was one of a few people to call the crash, and immediately individual investors began to follow her. But her bosses at Lehman Brothers let her go last fall; they purportedly found her too independent, especially at $2 million a year.<p>* Mario Gabelli: Another market guru with a formerly big following. Gabelli peddled advice in print and on TV, then became a money manager. His stature as seer hasn't withstood the real-life test. <p>* Worth Bruntjen: Last year, a bright star in government bond funds. His exceptional returns were built on ultra-high-risk derivatives, however, and by August, Bruntjen's funds at Piper Jaffray had lost nearly a quarter of their value.<p>* Steve Savage: As head of Value Line's new mutual fund publication, Savage's mission was to best Morningstar in the lucrative rating business. But Value Line lost momentum after reports that it lifted commentaries verbatim from Morningstar.<p><br>
EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED<p>By Jonathan Butler and Kevin Caliendo<p>It's not always about people. Something--emphasis on thing--could turn the market on its head at any given moment. We asked some pros what inanimate factors could move a market, and they pointed to four areas:<p>* Nature: Never mind hurricanes; how about everyday things like rain and sun? In Chicago, commodities traders hang on every word from Tom Skilling, weatherman for superstation WGN-TV. Not to check the forecast--traders have their own reports--but to know what farmers are being told. When the Mississippi flooded in 1993, says Paul Johnson Jr., senior vice president at ING Derivatives Clearing in Chicago, "Traders would look out the window. When the rain came down, so did bond prices."<p>* The Contract With America: Will Speaker Gingrich's Republican constitution be adopted, adapted, or dumped? The markets have begun guessing, reacting, and worrying. "Wall Street will think that the tax cuts are real but that the spending cuts are phony," predicts Donald Straszheim, chief economist at <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>. A capital-gains tax cut would create "an almost open-ended supply of stock that would effectively put a lid on the equity market," says Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer. "It could create massive selling," agrees Todd Ehret, portfolio manager at Money Growth Institute in New York.<p>* Program Trading: Nearly every firm has a program that calculates the difference in value between the S&P 500 Index futures and the S&P 500 itself and then buys or sells accordingly, an arbitrage bet that can ravage the Dow in the final minutes of trading. Investors sometimes panic. "When clients see the market fell 42 points, they think 1987' and want to get out." says Ken South, a Smith Barney broker in Costa Mesa, California. Great, say Wall Street vets. "We can make a profit when a move is computer driven," says Sam Marchese, CEO of SIFE Trust Fund. "It'll correct itself the next day."<p>* Rumors: Remember hearing that cellular phones caused brain cancer? Nothing to it in the end, but that didn't stop investors from dumping their shares in Motorola and others. Playing a rumor, of course, is all in the timing. "When you buy on a rumor, you're anticipating someone else hearing it," says Metz. "I always figure I'm late and wrong."<br>

Oddly enough, in the world's big financial markets, money buys little influence. The reason is that no fortune, personal or collective, matters much in light of the $2 trillion tide of money that changes hands every day in stocks, bonds, and currencies. But influence can be had, and some wield it mightily. They do so by getting other people to change the way they invest. Market movers can be innovators, investigators, or salesmen. Some have the might of governments behind them. They all command attention--either by example, like Warren Buffett; by offering information, like Peter Lynch or Dan Dorfman; or by exercising the power of their position, like Alan Greenspan. Our top 50 market movers are the men and women who set money in motion. They do so all over the world, but we looked in particular at how their maneuverings ultimately affect American investors. We offer them here as people to watch closely in the coming year. Professional market players make it their business to study them, and no one who hopes to understand or prosper in the markets can afford not to. <p>
1. ALAN GREENSPAN
Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
PROFILE: Greenspan has real power to regulate U.S. interest rates, which in this economy is the name of the game. Some say he bullies the other Fed governors on issues of money and credit; others say he has forged a grudging consensus. Jealously guards low inflation with aggressive interest-rate hikes. Less keen on full employment. Views cheap dollar as dangerously inflationary and pushes Fed to help prop it up. POWER MOVE: Reversed a long downward trend in interest rates with six hikes in short-term Fed rates in 1994. That in turn escalated bank and long-term debt, cost bond traders and bond mutual fund investors billions, spooked the stock market, doomed planned mergers, and offered a costly comeuppance to corporate treasurers who thought they understood exotic derivatives. CAVEAT: Clintonites griped about the Fed's latest and largest rate hike, in November 1994, and Greenspan must please the president to gain reappointment to his post in 1996. If anything's likely to get him interested in full employment, it might be the prospect of job hunting himself.<p>
2. HANS TIETMEYER
President of the Bundesbank, German Central Bank
PROFILE: Central bankers everywhere--and that includes our own Fed chairman--quake before Tietmeyer's power to set interest rates. World bond and currency markets quake, too. Relatively high rates for most of this decade lured investors into deutsche markdenominated assets and away from dollars--the main reason the DM is thumping the dollar. POWER MOVE: In May 1994, Tietmeyer began cutting interest rates. That didn't have the intended effect of halting the dollar's slide, but it did send the world bond markets into tumult. Generally, any time Tietmeyer persuades the Bundesbank council to reduce rates, similar cuts ensue across Europe. CAVEAT: Tietmeyer's power derives partly from his political ties to Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Recently the Bundesbank has been a responsible international citizen, but if Kohl needs his help, Tietmeyer may return the bank to its traditional role as guard dog of the German economy.<p>
3. BILL CLINTON
President of the United States of America
PROFILE: Despite Republican efforts to hobble the president, Clinton is no lame duck yet. He's still boss of all federal bureaucrats, commander in chief (i.e., the only American who can start a war), lord of the treasury, and steward of U.S. foreign and trade policies. He is also the nation's top opponent of supply-side redux and has a veto to prove it. POWER MOVE: Listen, we never said this was only about moving markets up. The specifics of Clinton's impact (such as the yo-yo-ing of health care stocks in reaction to the changing fortunes of the health care proposals) are less important than the fact that financial professionals hate going to work every day with Bill Clinton as their president. Only 1 percent of money pros polled gave his performance high marks, and 1994's lackluster markets reflected their lack of confidence. CAVEAT: Clinton's character isn't a market fundamental. As Wall Street realizes this, and looks with clearer eyes at the economy, the market could gain buoyancy. <p>
4. NEWT GINGRICH
Representative from Georgia; Speaker of the House
PROFILE: For now, the nation's leading Republican, friend of business and investors and enemy of regulation. Every newly elected Republican in the country owes him. So do the old-time GOPers to whom he delivered real power. Gingrich built his victories by lambasting President Clinton, but he also helped hand Clinton legislative wins on NAFTA, GATT, and the crime bill. In the coming two years, Gingrich faces a choice of whether to play politics with key legislation--like tax cuts--while biding time until 1996, or to play statesman and help build a concensus that may have the unwelcome effect of improving Clinton's prospects. POWER MOVE: In three words, Contract With America. It could genuinely change the direction and nature of the economy. CAVEAT: What to make of this Contract? The accounting on Gingrich's tax and spending cuts is more art than science. If taxes drop and the deficit pops back up, higher interest rates could weaken the market.<p>
5. JEFF VINIK
Manager, Fidelity <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Magellan Fund</b></a>
PROFILE: Runs the nation's largest mutual fund--$36 billion in assets and still counting. Since taking control of Magellan in 1992, Vinik has reshaped the fund that Peter Lynch built, spreading three times as much money across half as many stocks. POWER MOVE: Every move is a power move: Vinik cannot walk softly. Individual investors and fund managers watch him, and many piggyback on his choices. Corporations court his interest, and when they get it, they crow. Lately, Vinik is heavily committed to technology stocks; for example, he's tripled Magellan's holdings in Sun Microsystems and now owns 12 percent of the company. CAVEAT: Like we said, every move's a power move. Magellan can't make a quick exit from a company in which it has a huge stake--the fund, the company, and the market will all take hits. Magellan's prestige suffered at least a nick last year, when not only did it end the year in the red, but it also acknowledged an accounting gaffe.<p>
6. YASUO MATSUSHITA
Chairman, Bank of Japan
PROFILE: With Japanese stocks and real estate emerging from their nosedive, the Bank of Japan's new honcho has a relatively easy job for now: managing deflation. The bank also plays the international currency markets, most often in consort with the U.S. Federal Reserve, though Japan devotes billions more to fighting the yen's onerous rise than does the U.S. Matsushita must continue the deregulation of the Japanese securities industry, which should boost the fortunes of foreign stocks listed on the Tokyo exchange. POWER MOVE: Matsushita's term began last December 16. His predecessor showed how powerful the Bank of Japan is when he raised interest rates to bust the 1980s speculative bubble in stock and land prices. It worked, bringing crashes in both, a three-year recession, a sky-high yen, and a massive withdrawal of Japanese assets from U.S. markets. CAVEAT: Matsushita hails from the inner ranks of the politically powerful ministry of finance, a tie that may indicate a tendency to veer away from central bank independence and weaken his resolve for securities deregulation. <p>
7. WARREN BUFFETT
Chairman and CEO, <a name="NYSE:BRK.A"></a><b>Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.</b>
PROFILE: Not your average multibillionaire. Investors love Buffett because he amassed his $9 billion fortune by picking the right stocks, unlike those speculators whose fortunes stem from "percentage of profits" deals. Buffett's investment vehicle since 1969 has been Berkshire Hathaway, whose book value has grown at 23.3 percent a year and whose shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange at--gulp--about $20,000 a share. Two recent books on Buffett's strategies (neither by the master himself) have already become must-reads on Wall Street. Buffett details his own investment philosophy in Berkshire annual reports, quotes from which regularly fill analysts' newsletters. POWER MOVE: In December Buffett told a securities analyst that Berkshire Hathaway's $358 million investment in USAir had been a mistake. All major airlines tumbled. CAVEAT: There's still only one Warren Buffett. Analysts warn that he's a statistical anomaly.<p>
8. ROBERT RUBIN
Secretary designee of the U.S. Treasury
PROFILE: The most trusted voice in the Clinton administration on economic policy (true, incidentally, even when Lloyd Bentsen sat in the secretary's chair). Formerly a co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, Rubin champions deficit reduction, free trade, a strong dollar, and helping business do business. He is, however, lukewarm to a capital-gains tax cut and cold to other cuts. He's said to champion the urban poor, not the usual hallmark of a cost-cutter. POWER MOVE: Rubin framed Clinton's deficit-reduction strategy, which at least did the economic expansion no harm. His defining moments, however, will come as he begins work on the economic positions behind the reelection effort. Starting . . . yesterday. CAVEAT: While Rubin gets high marks for drawing parties in the administration together, he has not endeared himself to legislators, left or right. He must develop political skills at Treasury that the administration lost with Bentsen's departure.<p>
9. BARTON BIGGS
Chairman and CEO, <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley Asset Management Co.</b></a>
PROFILE: The biggest reason so much American institutional money goes overseas. Biggs advises Morgan Stanley's giant institutional investors on how to spread out their money; lately he's been suggesting they keep their billions "as far from Bill and Hillary" as possible. POWER MOVE: Biggs's cheerleading for stocks in China, India, and Southeast Asia has fueled a rush into those markets. When Biggs visited China in 1993 with an entourage of money managers, thousands of peasants greeted him in the streets. His report on the trip circulated widely among institutional investors and instigated what some have called the "Barton Biggs effect," a rush of money into a market he recommends. CAVEAT: Large institutional investors move in and out of markets conspicuously, which can be hazardous in the thinly traded markets of developing countries. Emerging markets are the most volatile of all; only investors committed to the long run should get cozy with Biggs.<p>
10. PETER LYNCH
Investor and author
PROFILE: The former manager of the Magellan Fund, and a genuine icon. Lynch is one of a small handful of legendary stock pickers and the only one whose name is well known outside financial circles. Now an oft-quoted source on sector trends and investment fundamentals. POWER MOVE: Any time Lynch mentions a stock, in the pages of Worth or elsewhere, retail brokers hear from their clients. It can get weird: In 1993 Lynch answered questions on the Prodigy online service, and some news services incorrectly interpreted Lynch's comments as indicating broad bearishness. The Dow fell 21 points the next day, and anecdotal evidence suggested that a lot of sellers believed they were just following Lynch. CAVEAT: Investors often miss the point of Lynch's advice. He famously wrote that culling investment ideas from "hanging out at the mall" beats listening to experts. That is no thumbs-up to betting hunches. The real message is, begin with what you know and dig deeper.<p>
11. BILL GATES
Chairman and CEO, <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft Corp.</b></a>
PROFILE: Gates's near hammerlock on the personal-computer industry comes from Microsoft's dominance in operating-system software and applications. Now Gates is tooling up Microsoft to expand into broadcast media and financial services. POWER MOVE: When Microsoft can't compete with an innovative product, it buys its competitor, as it did with Intuit, the maker of Quicken personal-finance software.Gates's clout is best seen in the behavior of others: The rest of the computer software industry continues to consolidate in order to defend itself from and do battle with Microsoft. Last year, Novell acquired WordPerfect, and Apple, IBM, and Motorola dragged one another into a pact to prevent Microsoft from dominating the industry completely. Microsoft is the main reason many once high-flying software stocks, like Lotus, have faltered. CAVEAT: The Justice Department recently settled an antitrust case with Microsoft on cushy terms, but that doesn't mean it isn't watching the company's moves closely. A new inquiry stalled the Intuit deal.<p>
12. CHARLES S. SANFORD JR.
Chief executive officer, Bankers Trust New York Corp.
PROFILE: Heads and molds the most aggressive proprietary bank trading operation in the world--one with a $54 billion war chest. Most top U.S. banks allocate 1 percent of total assets to their own trading; Bankers Trust, the nation's seventh-largest bank, devotes 50 percent and has been called the world's largest hedge fund. Bankers Trust is most famous, of course, as the cutting-edge house for derivatives, the No. 1 dirty word for 1994. POWER MOVE: Bankers' derivatives have changed the face of high finance. And no, Sanford isn't going to stop creating and pushing derivatives just because Bankers has taken heat for increasing market volatility. The firm has 300 derivatives specialists. CAVEAT: Last year, Gibson Greetings and Procter & Gamble claimed Bankers Trust didn't disclose derivatives risks that cost them some $180 million. The bad experience, together with government charges and lawsuits, have dampened the appetites of derivatives users. For now.<p>
13. GEORGE SOROS
Chief executive officer, Soros Fund Management
PROFILE: With $10 billion in assets--including the $3.7 billion Quantum Fund, the biggest and baddest of hedge funds--Soros is able to borrow and bet $100 million in markets ranging from gold to stocks to, most notoriously, currencies. POWER MOVE: Surely you remember 1992, when Soros pushed the fund's limits selling British pounds and Italian lira. The play netted Quantum $2 billion and sent tremors through European central banks. The British central bank devoted $15 billion, or half its foreign-currency reserves, to fighting Soros's gambit. More recently, news that Soros would acquire British real estate caused a rally on the London stock market. CAVEAT: Win big, lose big. Twice last year Quantum lost at least $400 million in the debt markets, wagering incorrectly that the dollar would rise against the yen. Soros bets so much money that Quantum can play only the biggest markets, currencies and bonds. Lately these markets have humbled even him.<p>
14. JOHN NEFF
Manager, <a name="FUND:VWNDX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VWNDX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vanguard/Windsor Fund</b></a>
PROFILE: The only member of the triumvirate of legendary money managers (Peter Lynch and Sir John Templeton are the others) still running a fund on a day-to-day basis. For his Windsor Fund he favors what he calls "woebegone, misunderstood, and overlooked" issues. Over the last 30 years, his returns have doubled those of the yardstick S&P index. Neff is distinctly contrarian: He buys stocks on their way down and sells into rallies. His reputation and an $11 billion kitty give him clout. Neff invests in few stocks, but he buys big. Last year Windsor held a scant 72 stocks. POWER MOVE: Neff made Seagate Technology a darling among tech investors when he identified the company as a stellar performer in the cutthroat computer-parts business. Neff got in at $16; last year the stock rose to $28. CAVEAT: Neff has announced that he'll retire at the end of 1995. His successor will be Charles Freeman, who has spent 25 years with Neff and promises not to alter the course of the fund.<p>
15. MARK HOLOWESKO
Director of Global Equity Research
Templeton Worldwide, Inc.
PROFILE: Former apprentice, now heir, to the legendary Sir John Templeton, the 81-year-old mutual fund pioneer and market seer. Holowesko, 35, took over top duties at three Templeton funds in 1987, and today directly manages $16 billion worth of Templeton money dedicated to international investing. Templeton funds outshine most other international funds, and they do so, according to Morningstar, with less risk. Their success invites imitators. Holowesko didn't lead the charge into international investing; Templeton did. But Holowesko does seem to have absorbed all his master's wisdom. POWER MOVE: Holowesko anticipated the troubles that beset many international markets last year and quietly pulled back. He thus spared his shareholders the rout other international funds experienced. CAVEAT: The Holowesko/Templeton approach invests for the long end of the long run. Shorter-sighted investors ought to look elsewhere.<p>
16. JOHN MERIWETHER
Partner, Long Term Capital Management
PROFILE: Meriwether emerged as a formidable trader while running the bond desk at Salomon Brothers. There he assembled a brain trust that applied cutting-edge mathematical modeling to bond arbitrage. When he left Salomon in 1991 to start his own hedge-fund firm (taking some of his best people with him), he found backers who put $1.25 billion worth of faith in him. Meriwether's team is  finally kicking into gear (it entered the fray last February), and it may be even brainier than the one at Solly. Wall Street has a keen interest in Meriwether's fortunes. POWER MOVE: Meriwether is missed by Salomon, whose trading operations lost big in the first half of 1994. Meriwether's company, on the other hand, was reportedly up 15 percent in its first six months. CAVEAT: Firm traders who strike out on their own often learn they need the information and financial resources of a big firm to succeed. Meriwether may miss Salomon's fearsome reputation, as well as its capital. And Solly's bond desk could come to crowd him: It's headed by a former Meriwether disciple.<p>
17. JAMES BURTON
Chief executive officer, California Public Employees' Retirement System
PROFILE: Since October, the head of the nation's largest pension fund, with more than $80 billion in assets and more than a million members. CalPERS, more than any other pension fund, has made itself heard and feared by corporate boards. The fund is also the lead voice in the activist Council of Institutional Investors, which together represents $800 billion of uppity money. POWER MOVE: In recent years the fund has been instrumental in giving the boot to CEOs at Westinghouse Electric, Eastman Kodak, and IBM and has also pushed other Fortune 500s for more board accountability. You could do worse, by the way, than to put your money where CalPERS's is: A recent study showed that shares of companies that came under strong pressure from CalPERS have done more than twice as well as the S&P 500 since 1990. CAVEAT: Some CalPERS trustees want Burton to be less aggressive on corporate governance and spend more time on administration of the fund.<p>
18. KING FAHD
King of Saudi Arabia
PROFILE: Sits atop one quarter of the world's proven oil reserves, which gives him the most clout in OPEC. Saudi oil production is a key factor in the price of all the world's energy sources. Oil demand is expected to rise by 1.5 million barrels a day in 1995, while production holds about steady. That should send prices steadily upward. OPEC wants to raise oil prices gradually to $21 a barrel (the price is currently stagnant at about $17), and only Saudi Arabia has the will and the might to rein in production. POWER MOVE: Saudi Arabia spearheaded the November 1994 agreement to freeze OPEC output, the announcement of which immediately sent oil prices and energy stocks up. CAVEAT: OPEC agreements usually fail. Not only do cash-strapped member states cheat, non-OPEC-member oil producers are happy to rush into the breach. Cheap oil and Gulf War bills have left the Saudis cash strapped, and only a rise in price will restore their full clout.<p>
19. DAVID KESSLER
Commissioner, U.S. Food and Drug Administration
PROFILE: Some call him Lord of the Label. As Kessler himself points out, the FDA's jurisdiction covers "25 cents on every consumer dollar." Under Kessler, FDA injunctions have tripled and prosecutions have doubled. POWER MOVE: Approval of drugs and medical devices--and even such things as recommended changes in the national diet--can send stocks soaring. Approval denials or warnings of dangers in drugs and food can spell disaster. An arthritis medication from a hot, small company called Greenwich Pharmaceuticals failed review by the agency in September 1993, and shares in Greenwich now trade at less than a penny. In December 1994, U.S. Bioscience shares dropped 60 percent on news that the company's chemotherapy drug Ethyol didn't pass muster with the FDA. CAVEAT: Kessler was a Bush appointee, but Republicans are calling for his head. They bewail FDA overregulation and overreaching and have already moved to block new FDA regulations.<p>
20. DON PHILLIPS
Publisher, Morningstar Mutual Funds
PROFILE: Publisher of the most widely read and quoted mutual fund guide--the bible of financial planners and the publication most hotly in demand at public libraries. Morningstar's 60,000 subscribers hang their fund selection on its five-star rating system. Fund managers make pilgrimages to Morningstar's Chicago office to plead their case. In nearly 100 speeches a year, Phillips thrills investors and financial planners with mutual fund advice, and you can bet they act on it. Phillips is also the press's favorite source; a quote from him is found in virtually every mutual fund story. POWER MOVE: A critical word in Phillips's own Morningstar commentary can send a fund running for cover. Just ask the folks at the troubled Pilgrim Group. They sued (and lost) and later sold off most of their funds. CAVEAT: Five-star ratings don't predict the future, and the Morningstar system can't foresee which sectors are about to explode. It missed big swings in emerging-market funds.<p>
21. JESSE HELMS
Senator from North Carolina; chairman of Senate Foreign Relations Committee
PROFILE: Helms's new chairmanship makes him not just the most prominent politician to publicly menace the president, but also the most powerful American on foreign policy outside the executive branch. The markets are bound to be a little nervous about this. Resolve in foreign policy is one of their favorite measures of American stability, and if Helms keeps fussing with Clinton, it may give the impression the U.S. is a house hopelessly divided. An isolationist, a hawk, and a loner even among Republicans, Helms will keep on dividing even if the GOP gains the White House in '96. POWER MOVE: Following the midterm Republican victories, Helms declared to Secretary of State Warren Christopher that the U.S. must adjust the "broad focus of [its] foreign policies." CAVEAT: Helms is going to be Helms, but Richard Lugar, the last Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a believer in bipartisanship, now ranks second on the committee. He may welcome dialogue with the Clinton administration and diffuse Helms's railing.<p>
22. JAMES DUGAN
Chief executive officer, Swiss Bank Corporation
PROFILE: Architect of one of the most sophisticated, well-rounded proprietary trading organizations in the world, a powerhouse in foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives. In 1992, Dugan merged his firm O'Connor & Associates, the most technologically adept player in Chicago's futures and options exchanges, into the huge Swiss Bank Corp. That brought the best of American trading culture to the staid but deep-pocketed banking giant. POWER MOVE: After acquiring O'Connor, Swiss Bank rose from tenth-largest among currency and option traders worldwide to first. (You were wondering who made the most money rendering pointless the Fed's latest attempt to prop up the dollar?) Says a competitor, "We only see a third of what Swiss Bank does. Even that makes us nervous." CAVEAT: The Swiss Bank/O'Connor union started a rush on Chicago-based trading firms. S.G. Warburg and NationsBank have acquired top-flight firms to compete.<p>
23. HERBERT ALLEN
Partner, Allen & Company
PROFILE: Investment banker to the stars, or at least to the star makers. Allen has helped orchestrate a great number of large media deals, including ones involving Sony, Time Warner, and Matsushita. Investment bankers don't usually play well in Hollywood, but Allen, once the head of Columbia Pictures, knows L.A.'s deal makers. Now his Rolodex is expanding with the rise in interest in multimedia. POWER MOVE: Allen throws an annual party/retreat for corporate leaders; last year's attracted the likes of Warren Buffett, Rupert Murdoch, and Bill Gates. Allen can assemble a giant or take it apart: He advised QVC in its failed bid for Paramount in 1993 and today is helping Viacom, which won the Paramount deal, shed Madison Square Garden and the New York Rangers and Knicks. CAVEAT: Watching the media sector is easy, because the media are self-obsessed. Don't rush in just because an entertainment deal makes the front page.<p>
24. CHARLES I. CLOUGH JR.
Chief investment strategist, <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.</b></a>
PROFILE: Twelve thousand Merrill Lynch retail brokers hear from him first thing every morning--just before they call you. Clough digests the best thinking of Merrill's army of analysts for the nation's biggest network of brokers. His insights come to Merrill's brokers--the firm calls them financial consultants, by the way--via frequent computer bulletins, bullhorn announcements, weekly newsletters, and Prism, Merrill's internal television network, which is broadcast directly to 500 offices in 31 countries. If you sell for Merrill, you know the man's face. POWER MOVE: Merrill Lynch holds $536 billion in client assets (about $20 billion more than the GNP of Canada), and Clough helps move a lot of it. Last year, he was keen on so-called deep cyclicals, such as stocks that rise with commodity prices. The sector performed well. CAVEAT: Clough's tips travel through the firm's large and diverse retail network; it might be old news by the time it gets to you. <p>
25. JIANG ZEMIN
President, People's Republic of China
PROFILE: Since March, Jiang has been the official leader of the world's most populous country and of an economy growing at warp speed. Though Jiang has more official titles than any Chinese official since Mao, he won't ascend to real power unless he can consolidate the powers now held by China's supreme ruler, the blind and aging Deng Xiaoping. So far, Jiang is the odds-on favorite to follow Deng. China's place as rising star in the world economy has been built on its prowess as a cheap manufacturer for export and as a magnet for foreign capital: China is currently a favorite destination for emerging-market mutual funds, whose managers expect the country to dominate the 21st century. POWER MOVE: Jiang has consolidated his power by placing allies in high government and party posts. CAVEAT: China's recent history has been tumultuous and brutal. An Institute of Strategic Studies report concluded that if Deng dies soon, the country could deteriorate into "warlordism." ------------------

						November 1994 <p>Worth magazine/Feature  <p> THE BEAR <p>His intellectual and literary gifts are the envy of Wall Street.His track record is another story. Will the markets ever seethe world the way James Grant does?  <p> By Donald Katz  <p> At 6:36 on a midsummer morning, James Grant aims his donnishhalf-smile in the direction of the hosts of CNN's Business Morningshow. Each week the 48-year-old financial prognosticator andeditor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer arrives at the CNN studioswith every intention of adorning the morning's price quotes witha bit of the intellectual dazzle he thinks the study of marketsdeserves. But somehow the drill always turns out to be the same. <p> "Do you think long-term interest rates are going higher?" aCNN inquisitor with a British accent asks Grant when the redlight goes on.  <p> "I do," says Grant, who has said precisely this for all buta few weeks of a nearly 14-year decline in global interest rates. <p> "By how much?" the Brit bores in.  <p> "Yes," Grant says, trying to wrap his friendliest smile aroundhis long nose.  <p> Grant appears on CNN each Thursday, and each Wednesday a youngCNN producer will phone him at his Wall Street office. Grantwill suggest questions for the hosts to lob his way. Perhapsthey could ask him to expand on the larger meaning of surgingLondon futures prices for Baltic Freight Index contracts. Theycould ask about those Swedish government-debt instruments thatare so technically and morally corrupt that even Swedish CEOsrefuse to buy them. Or how about that American institution whoseleaders have so hollowed out the financial corpus that the companynow resembles some cavernous fiscal bedsore?  <p> Invariably, though, the on-air talk is reduced to Grant's viewson prices and money rates per se -- not about how these ratesand prices reflect as-yet-unidentified trends or offer a runningcalibration of the human folly that has characterized financialevents since the days of President Grover Cleveland, a memberof James Grant's short and quirky list of American heroes.  <p> Over 3,800 well-placed readers of the twice-monthly Grant'sInterest Rate Observer pay an annual $495 for access to JamesGrant's bloody-minded opinions, his particular view of history,his fluent prose, and for predictions about the direction ofprices and rates that have often -- quite often, in fact -- beenwrong. Grant is the quintessential bear of these times and financialmarkets.  <p> "My question, Mr. Grant, is this," said a man who approachedhim after an investment conference last year. "Have you everin your life been right about anything?"  <p> But Grant is that rare Wall Street presence whose appeal greatlytranscends his track record. His financial history, Money ofthe Mind: Borrowing and Lending in America From the Civil Warto Michael Milken, was reviewed by a Nobel laureate in economics.He is written about in contexts shared by Ivy League economists,World Bank leaders, and investment pros like Warren Buffett.Whenever "Who's the smartest guy on Wall Street?" discussionscommence, Grant's name is on the short list -- with an asterisktethered to a note about what a different sort of Wall Streetcharacter he is.  <p> There is currently a bull market in Grant's notoriety and inthe power of his opinions. Constantly rising interest rates during1994 and a bond market posting the worst total returns sincethe late 1960s have helped Grant -- however belatedly -- appearremarkably prescient of late. Grant turned bullish on the coffee-beanmarket in January, when the price hovered below 75 cents a pound,and by September coffee had touched $2.70 a pound. He similarlypredicted the escalation in wheat prices, and he suggested buyingsilver at $4 an ounce just before it moved to $5. The model portfolioGrant constructed for Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser (Grant'slist was full of short sales, stocks he was betting would declinein price) is outperforming those of the pack comprising the show'smany stellar guests.  <p> And yet, to the members of the virtual private club that surroundshim -- Wall Street intellectuals, fiscal curmudgeons, bearishromantics, dedicated short-sellers, and other "financial typeswith attitudes," as Grant describes the members of his circle-- it is only his crusade that truly matters.  <p> The work requires steadfast vigilance. In the pages of his "journalfor the age of monetary upset and volatility," as Grant calledthe Interest Rate Observer when he introduced it in 1983, helabors to uncover documents that indicate the presence of "overfedand overpampered" Wall Streeters who "think of themselves notas mere mortals, but as the people of . . . Morgan Stanley."On behalf of avid readers who inhabit the senior stations atinstitutions such as Morgan Stanley, he habitually smokes outmembers of "the banking classes" who would think themselves bettercapitalists than they truly are. ("Bankers Trust," Grant oncequipped, "is an oxymoron.") It was Grant who pointed out thatfinancial professionals of the late 1980s sent credit cards topet shar-pei puppies in Virginia and extended easy credit to11-year-old schoolboys in Maryland. He railed on elegantly aboutyoung "children of the bull market" on Wall Street whose absenceof memory allowed them to believe that the fat times would neverend, and he has persistently criticized federal governments hailingback to the Depression for subsidizing or "socializing" the risksinherent in lending money.  <p> In conversation, formal speeches, television interviews, andin print, Grant rarely fails to mention his favorite thesis:that over the course of a half century, an ever-expanding seaof easily accessed credit has undermined the financial superstructureof the economy, while more lately creating a genre of cowboycapitalist devoid of restraint or any hint of the honorable sobrietythat characterized the sorts of long-dead financiers Grant admires.The cowboys and the government have conspired to obscure financialjustice for years, Grant says, though this has never stoppedhim from predicting that law and order would eventually return,and that interest rates and the price of hard assets ("stuff,"as he puts it) would finally rise as the value of financial assetswould finally fall.  <p> Now Grant is on a roll, proclaiming in print and on the airthat the financial prosperity of the past dozen years is "notover, but is certainly in the process of being interrupted."He believes rates will continue to go up because of old-fashionedinflation, which he sees weighing heavily on the economy by theend of 1994 or in 1995.  <p> During his CNN appearance, Grant affably steers the conversationtoward recent developments that appear to support his generaltheme. The "pleasurable rhythms of the bull market" are now fadingaway, he observes. No longer is it axiomatic that interest rateswill go down and stocks will go up.  <p> "There's been a great financial epiphany," Grant tells the hosts."Everyone saw that rates would forever fall. Now those peopleare reappraising things. Aluminum is more expensive; copper,too. Look at the price of crude oil. The world is reflexively-- "  <p> "You actually watch these kinds of things," the British interviewercuts in. "I mean you watch aluminum. You even watch . . . what?. . . the market in paperboard . . . cah-tons!"  <p> "Well, yes," says Grant, who had indeed devoted the front pageof a recent Grant's Interest Rate Observer to a weirdly interestingpiece about the price of linerboard and pharmaceutical blisterpackaging. "Everyone has to do something."  <p> At this, the show's two presenters begin to guffaw.  <p> "There is news," Grant continues, "that does not fit into thestandard analytical grooves of Wall Street."  <p>   <p> In the spirit of skepticism of the "lumpen consensus opinionof the moment," as he once put it in his newsletter, Grant wrotein early 1984 that the future junk-bond king Michael Milken andthe whole financial junkyard of Drexel Burnham Lambert, Milken'semployer, were responsible for entertaining but very bad investmentproducts. Grant reiterated this supposition in no fewer than65 subsequent pieces of anti-Drexel investigative journalismand acerbic commentary over the next six years, supplementinghis lonely crusade with appearances on the MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour and Nightline whenever he could wangle an invitation. Grantrode the wicked witch of Drexel like some sermonizing insecton the firm's mighty back, until the witch finally died.  <p> Grant turned out to be right about Drexel and about many ofthe company's junk bonds, but being right six years early inmoney and markets is very much like being wrong. And one of theabiding ironies of James Grant's life in light of his chosencalling and penchant for orthodoxy is that he can only barelystand being wrong. "If it all works out and I'm right, there'sa quiet sense of gratification," Grant admits after the CNN show."But the feeling is wholly out of proportion to the monstrous,gnawing feelings of inadequacy that go along with getting itwrong."  <p> Only Grant's colleagues at his newsletter and a few membersof Grant's inner circle of brilliant financial friends know thattheir otherwise jocular and easily self-effacing friend willsit alone in the middle of the night if he turns out to be wrong,twisting the proverbial knife himself. "You could not have morecomplex case material than Jim Grant," a senior Morgan Bank bondtrader says of his friend as Grant listens in on an extensionone afternoon in New York. "This is a man capable of seeing allthings from all sides at the time and yet doesn't have the wisdomto pronounce things that way."  <p> "It's true," Grant says softly, grinning away, the receivercovered by his fist. "This is true."  <p> Now and again, when he wrote the "Current Yield" column forBarron's in the late '70s and early '80s, Grant was notably rightabout securities that were unworthy of the term. He warned readersabout the quality of Washington Public Power Supply System municipalbonds -- the infamous "Whoops" bonds of the early 1980s -- before$2.25 billion worth of the issues went into default. Later, Grantwas right about the rolling real estate recessions that spreadfrom Texas in 1985 to Arizona in 1988 to New England in 1989and most recently to California. He was also right about DonaldTrump and the Reichmanns of Olympia & York -- though, as withMilken, he was early on those calls.  <p> Grant has also been right in innumerable microeconomic analysesof specific markets, companies, and securities. But none of thiswill erase the fact that his bearish predictions were systematicallytrampled under the hooves of the bulls for much of a decade.He augured inflation and the "low estate" of paper assets asthe rest of the world reveled in a lucrative frenzy of ever-lowerinterest rates and increasingly valuable paper. He has so oftensaid that the price of gold and interest rates are going up thatinterviewers like Rukeyser tend to chortle affectionately whenthey hear it. In 1991, after a year Grant calls his "genius phase"-- when all of the things he'd been predicting about economicgrowth, interest rates, and falling equity prices finally cameto pass -- he was whipsawed by a countervailing "moron phase,"a "predictive Waterloo" that ended up costing him a tremendousamount of his own money.  <p> Two years earlier, Grant had sold the home in Brooklyn thathoused his young family -- a wife and four children. He tookthe proceeds and in 1990 began to sell short some of the stocksthat he had been criticizing. He sold short International LeaseFinance Corp., an airplane-leasing firm built on financial air.He also shorted Chemical Bank, Citibank, First Executive Bank,and Columbia Savings (always being careful to disclose his personalfinancial moves to readers). And then he waited for his geniusperiod to set in.  <p> Just as Grant had forecast, the stock market went into verticaldecline. Television crews crowded into his office seeking furthernuggets of brilliant prophecy, and the Grant family, he recalls,"happily adjusted to a new level of liquidity."  <p> For much of a year Grant wrote essays that proved with technicalcertainty that the stock market could not go back up. The lastof them appeared just days before a six-week spike in the summerof 1991 that erased all his personal profits from the short positionsand the profits from the sale of his house, too.   <p> Grant says he entered a period of psychological decline thatincluded weeks of dedicated sulking broken by bouts of more severeself-immolation over having been wrong. His newsletter's subscriptiongrowth suddenly ceased, and there ensued a "great tailing offof returned phone calls from contacts and the diminished presenceof television crews waiting at the bottom of the elevator." <p> Throughout his moron phase and the bull run in 1992 and 1993,Grant tried to detail his analytical failings. It was evidenceof another characteristic of his that is unusual among thosein the business of understanding markets: He prefers to admithis mistakes.  <p> During the midsummer of 1991, the depths of the moron phase,Grant was considering desperate moves -- he thought about becominga money manager.  <p>   <p> Before getting to know Grant, I had long marveled from afarat the antique bearing of the man. With his red tie decoratedwith little bears, the hair invariably askew so that wisps surgeforward across his temple -- and with the stems of his glassesriding high above his ears -- Grant often looks like one of thoseOxbridge twits named Nigel or Jeremy who haunt the eating clubsof British academe. Six feet five, lean, and with an aquilineface, Grant has at other times reminded me of a Dickensian chinafigurine in some old curiosity shop.   <p> The physical aspect, the older and elegant prose, the seemingintellectual imprisonment in an economic world formed by orthodoxiesforgotten by everyone else but him -- all of it had caused meto wonder if the whole persona wasn't somewhat contrived.  <p> Grant's heroes are men like George F. Baker, the hidebound turn-of-the-centurybanker who always got his loans repaid, and Grover Cleveland,champion of a minimalist government that suits Grant's own libertarianleanings. It was Cleveland who brought back the gold standard-- that most noble of monetary systems, according to Grant --and brought it back long enough to cause a harrowing recessionin 1893. Grant's paramount literary hero is the great WalterBagehot, the writer and editor of The Economist more than 100years ago, who believed that aspects of "mind and character"were just as essential as numbers to understanding business andfinance.   <p> "People don't cultivate memory because, by and large, it hasbeen proven unprofitable," Grant says. "I think that John Reedof Citibank would have been a much happier person in 1990 and1991 [when the bank lost a billion dollars, largely as a resultof ill-advised loans] if he had a clue what had gone on in Dallasreal estate as recently as 1985. And yet the fact is, if youare running a Wall Street trading desk during a bull market,you want traders who are young enough not to be intimidated overthe losses of 1974. Nineteen-year-olds, after all, make muchbetter infantrymen than soldiers who are 35."  <p> The Grant's Interest Rate Observer offices are located at 30Wall Street, a building that until recently housed a branch officeof the Chase Manhattan Bank. The street-level windows were filledwith signs: "Borrow at Prime ... Home Equity Line of Credit ...No Credit History? No Problem." Officers of the Chase branchonce asked Grant to deliver one of his provocative speeches atan executive conference, but the Chase head-office guys foundout they were about to issue an honorarium to a man who has consistentlypointed out that bankers who borrow money at 2 or 3 percent andinvest it at 4 percent are not necessarily talented or even halfsmart. The invitation was withdrawn.  <p> Grant and the publisher of his journal, Jeremy Diamond, sometimestake their mitts and a ball and descend six floors to Wall Street,there to play catch beneath the flags and austere cornices aspassersby look on with either curiosity or annoyance. Grant usedto box for exercise at a nearby gym. "It wasn't yet in vogueon Wall Street when I started," he says. "I eventually gave itup because it hurt." But he still works out every morning, andup close an aura of easy athleticism and high energy mutes thepotted-plant-from-Oxfordshire courtliness conjured by his mossbackpronouncements. ("Every debt is ultimately paid," begins oneoft-repeated axiom, "if not by the debtor, then eventually bythe creditor.")  <p> Copies of the Milwaukee Business Journal, Automotive News, SupermarketNews, Oil & Gas Journal, Journal of Commerce, French economicjournals, and dozens of other periodicals cover almost everysurface not occupied by a computer or a laser printer insideGrant's offices. Books about how to quantify risk, about bonds,about foreign banks, about central banks, about baseball, arestrewn everywhere. Near Grant's own desk in the back corner ofthe main room hangs a picture of the writer E.B. White and anotherphotograph of a racehorse that the ever-bearish investor SethKlarman named Money of the Mind, after Grant's book. On the floorin the main room sits a three-foot-high stuffed bear.  <p> Grant composes and incessantly recomposes and polishes all ofthe 7,000 words in a typical issue of his magazine (newsletterbeing a term proscribed inside the company as indicative of "theHulbert crowd" of stock pickers and market timers). He regularlywrites through entire weekends.   <p> "Paid-up subscribers," as Grant constantly refers to his favoritecontacts, are forever faxing Grant underlined prospectuses withnotes that say, "Have you seen this one?" or "Can you believethis?" They will call him up: "Listen to what this dumb kid onthe trading desk said to me today."   <p> Though the Grant's subscription list includes just about everyhedge-fund jockey in the race, most of the chief traders insideevery money house, and nearly every speculator described as an"investor" in newspaper articles -- from the Tisches to PaulTudor Jones to the Soros gang to Grant's first subscriber, theshort-seller and pundit Jim Rogers -- Grant draws a great dealof intellectual sustenance from individuals who are somewhatless well-known. He is always ascribing to his readers the mostskeptical and prescient views: "When Jack A. Sullivan, a paid-upsubscriber in San Francisco, mentioned that he was accumulatinga short position in some of the Eurobonds of the Reichmanns'flagship company, Olympia & York Developments Ltd, we pausedto reflect on the state of the world."  <p> Grant also enhances the clubby sensibility by occasionally writingprofiles of some of his favorite Wall Street rogues and geniuses.Early on, he wrote a piece about the late financial journalistMaxwell Newton, son of an Australian plumber, a Cambridge grad,and the dispenser of brilliant opinions even more tendentiousthan Grant's from the unlikely pulpit of the business sectionof the New York Post. Newton hated his Wall Street enemies. Grantwrote lovingly that Newton "calls the markets as he sees them."Newton was a Grant's kind of guy.  <p> Grant often writes about Joe Rosenberg, portfolio manager forthe Tisch family, who for years has tried to teach Grant to,as Grant interprets, "have opinions at extremes and wait forextreme moments." Rosenberg and Grant regularly talk on the phoneabout the state of the markets and the world.   <p> Grant schmoozes frequently with the "intellectual spectacle"that is Paul J. Isaac, formerly chief economist at Mabon Securities,a man who somehow reads $45,000 worth of financial periodicalsand newspaper subscriptions. Like many in Grant's circle, Isaacis a closet hyperintellectual and a dedicated dilettante. Grantwill send over a document like a legal firm's internal briefingon changes in bankruptcy law. Then they get on the phone to chortletogether at laws that skew the symmetry of financial processesand undermine economic justice.   <p> A tone of commiseration marks many of Grant's conversationsduring a day. The bears for whom Grant serves as den intellectualmoan about lofty markets. The kingpin nerds and in-house professorsof markets speak to him of absurdities only they are smart enoughto discern. And the paid-up subscribers phone in with news ladenwith irony: "Did you see that guy [Michael] Vranos, the Kiddermortgage-bond group chief quoted in the Journal? 'We're not tryingto outsmart the smart guys,' he said. 'We're trying to sell bondsto the dumb guys!'" And Grant, as he does so many times duringhis long workdays, will start to laugh.  <p> Grant used to walk down to the graveyard of Trinity Church atthe corner of Broadway and Wall to sit with the young Yalie short-sellerJim Chanos, or one of the other bears, wondering for hours whatwas holding the market up. One day he and Chanos wandered overto the office of Ed Levy, a wise money manager and paid-up subscriber."When will it go down, Ed?" they asked.  <p> "When you stop asking," came Levy's reply.  <p> "That the financial markets will ever stop going up is thismagazine's leading unfulfilled prophecy," Grant wrote as thebull market continued to explode. "But we live in hope."  <p> Ed Yardeni, chief economist at C.J. Lawrence/Deutsche Bank Securities.and an early Grant's subscriber, once noted to InstitutionalInvestor that Grant was possessed of "a tremendous sense of history,and he's done good work reminding us of historical precedence... . But there's zealotry in him too. In a world created by JimGrant, there would be no financial intermediaries, no debt." <p> "If there were financial intermediaries," Grant responds quicklyupon being reminded of the characterization, "they wouldn't hireMr. Ed Yardeni.... But then Ed's been right a lot more than I'vebeen right. He's been bullish for ten years. 'Buy stocks andbonds. Buy stocks and bonds. Buy stocks and bonds.' Way to gothere, Ed."  <p> Before he grabs his gym bag and baseball mitt and heads towardWall Street, the subway, and his home in Brooklyn Heights, Iask Grant if a certain loathing of those financial types whohave backed into success since the early 1980s serves to inspirehis crusades -- if his inspiration is, at heart, less cerebralthan emotional, the most prominent emotion perhaps being envy. <p> "I don't know if it's envy," Grant says without defensiveness."But whatever it is, I do feel the adrenaline stir when I reada Morgan Stanley prospectus. Unlike most people who take dealsapart on Wall Street, I am not beholden to them. In fact, I believeit is incumbent upon the Grant's organization to deny MorganStanley the benefit of the doubt precisely because they are MorganStanley. So they do get extra scrutiny. We expect more of them,and -- more or less -- they always fail to deliver.  <p> "Most of the work of Wall Street is simply getting business,"Grant continues. "The people in the research end and the thinkingand explaining end of the trade are subordinated to the underwritingand sales effort. They are out writing about companies that thehouse hopes to enlist for a future equity offer. It's not a conflictof interest at all. It's a unity of interest. There's no conflict.They all do the same thing. The Street is in the business oftrying to sell you something." With that, Grant grins and boundstoward the elevator and down to Wall Street.  <p>   <p> The son and grandson of musicians, Jim Grant was a particularlygifted French horn player as a young boy in suburban Long Island.In high school he was invited to play classical pieces with collegestudents, but issues having to do with competition, authority,and the hierarchies of middle-class suburban life led Grant toquit school and his music after only a semester at Ithaca College.  <p> Grant left his eyeglasses on long enough to memorize the visionchart before it was his turn at the navy induction center, andsoon he was a gunner's mate on the carrier Hornet. He spent 1964watching "LBGBs" ("Little bitty gook boats. . . You have to rememberwhat year it was") off the coast of Vietnam. Grant was not amalleable and, therefore, not a particularly successful sailor.The experience seems to have helped form Grant's determinationto swim against the tide.  <p> Grant went to Indiana University after his discharge, one ofthe best places for an accomplished young musician returningto his horn. But he discovered 20 other brilliant French hornplayers there who hadn't taken two years off from practicingthree hours a day. So he studied economics and went on to furtherwork in the social sciences at Columbia University in New Yorkinstead.  <p> Grant became a reporter at the Baltimore Sun after that, atfirst writing obits and police news. Eventually, drawing uponvocabulary learned as a clerk at a New York brokerage house beforecollege, he joined the business section.   <p> In 1975, Grant was hired by the arch-conservative Barron's editorialistRobert Bleiberg, who wanted someone to write his column whenhe was away. Bleiberg, now retired, recalls that it was not easyto find a man of Grant's age who agreed with his own reactionarypolitical views in 1975, but Grant had lately chosen to becomea traveler of the radical right wing as an antistatist libertarian-- "if not for intellectual reasons," he now says, "then forthose glandular and hormonal reasons that cause the need to mortifyone's parents." Grant recalls a few months when he was a liberalDemocrat -- he even voted for Eugene McCarthy in 1968 -- butsoon thereafter he "moved off into the counterrevolution."  <p> Grant eventually edited the Barron's Capital Markets section,which included the "Current Yield" column. He quit the weeklyamid an editorial schism that saw Alan Abelson emerge as thetop dog instead of Bleiberg in 1983, and he invested a portionof the $75,000 in his Dow Jones profit-sharing plan in the launchof the Interest Rate Observer.   <p> A few months later the $75,000 was gone. "And nobody calledme back either," Grant recalls. "I was no longer Grant of Barron's.I was just Grant." His first book, a biography of Bernard Baruch,the early 20th-century financier and friend-to-the-powerful,appeared and disappeared like "the figurative brick in a lake."Grant, already a vociferous critic of easy credit, was soon runninghis business on his Visa card.  <p> As Grant's prose became sharper and more entertaining by themonth, he brilliantly seized the tips of innumerable financialicebergs, often impaling himself in the process. He saw earlierthan almost everyone else the folly in the new junk bonds floatedby companies that admitted they couldn't pay interest unlessassets were sold off. But he didn't realize that the assets inquestion had often been priced and sales had been arranged beforehand."This is the top," Grant crowed after reading the prospectusfor one junk-bond flotation.   <p> But the top was years away.   <p> Several times in the late 1980s, Grant appeared on the MacNeil/LehrerNews Hour. He was ever erudite and charming, but he was therein some part because nobody else would publicly say that MikeMilken was selling bad goods, or that any minute the "tide ofdebt would go out," that inflation would return, and that thestock market tumble. Conservative though his politics were, Grantalso blasted away at Ronald Reagan and supply-siders who wouldbelieve, as Grant expressed it, that "human behavior is governedby the marginal tax rate."  <p> Twenty-five calls for interviews came in the day in 1990 thatDrexel finally fell. Trump faltered that same year. The geniusperiod was on. Institutional Investor called him the "interest-rateguru." Subscription orders poured in.   <p> Patricia Kavanagh, Grant's wife, began to notice frosty interchangeswith the spouses of the financial workers who populate BrooklynHeights. She was sure she saw a Drexel executive's wife avoidher one day by crossing to the other side of the street. Kavanaghwas the fashion editor at the Baltimore Sun when she met thevery tall guy from the business section. Since then, she hasbeen an investment banker at Lehman Brothers, the publisher ofher husband's newsletter, a full-time mother, and a pre-med student."And I'm married to someone who actually has a life's work --the study of markets," she says. "Not many people have a life'swork these days."  <p> During the brief genius phase, a man showed up at Grant's officeand said he was a detective with the NYPD. He showed Grant aphoto of a murder victim and reported that Grant's name had beenfound in the dead man's pocket. When Grant later tried to phonethe detective, he was told that no such cop served on the force,leaving Grant to wonder if this was meant as some kind of threator as a comment upon his Cassandra-like point of view.  <p> As a student of financial history, Grant understood that everycycle has its genius. He knew the stories of Henry "Dr. Doom"Kaufman, famous in the '70s as the foreseer of hyperinflationbut fallen from grace by the '80s ("He know the rate," the wagsat Salomon Brothers used to say. "But he don't know the date").He could tell you about Bob Prector, the now out-of-fashion technicalguru of the '80s. He knew all about forgotten seers like ColonelAyers, prognosticator for Cleveland Trust in the 1920s.   <p> And Grant knew about the hubris that can infect those who turnout to be correct about markets. Yet he was still blindsidedwhen his turn came. Shares in Citicorp, which he had denigratedbecause the institution was all but insolvent, levitated fromunder $10 in early 1991 to $17.50 later in the year -- and toover $40 in 1993. Grant's net worth took a mighty hit in theprocess.  <p> Now Grant is writing a book that is essentially an analysisof the bond- and equity-market surge of 1991 to 1993. He writeslate into many nights to find out how it was that the bankerswon. He writes in search of the key to a recession that shouldhave been longer and heavier than it was. The answer, he believes,lies in the intervention of the Fed and in government policiesthat deemed certain institutions too big to fail.   <p> The romantic side of James Grant believes banks should act asthe banks of the days before protective mechanisms muted theirrisk. The capitalist shareholders of banks in pre-Depressiondays were personally responsible to depositors for their losses."There was a certain nobility there," Grant will muse. "And thoseof a romantic temperament want a similar justice today. ShouldCiticorp go from 8 to 40 because the Fed, in conjunction withwhatever fates are operating, gave us a lushly sloped yield curvethat allowed the bank to reliquefy?"  <p> When discussing the democratization of credit, Grant shiftsto something of a high Tory tone. He knows that easy credit hasa great deal to do with the rising standard of living enjoyedby Americans during the middle of the 20th century, and thatcredit extended to working people had a great deal to do withthe rise of the middle class, too. That same democratizationof borrowing led to a popularization of investment opportunitiesduring the 1970s, when previously elite instruments like large-denominationmoney-market instruments were broken down as dollar-a-share moneyfunds for the average investor. And yet he incessantly railsagainst the money pros who created these financial opportunities. <p> "I stand guilty of that," Grant acknowledges. "In part I reactto the trifle of 'democratization.' These latter-day democratizingcapitalists were not like the early people who believed the workingman should get a fair shake with credit. The modern guys crossedthe line of basic prudence. The result was the real estate crack-up.They often landed in the soup, and the taxpayer had to bail themout."  <p> Grant thinks Bill Clinton is a "collectivist" out of envy ofthe rich, and he recently wrote that "unlike greed, which promotesstriving, envy thwarts hard work and is bad for the stomach lining." <p> I ask Grant for a second time if he isn't himself susceptibleto envy -- in particular of his close friends. It's clear thatalmost every member of the Grant's club is much better off thantheir favorite intellectual.  <p> "Well," says Grant considering the idea uncomfortably, "oneis most vulnerable to envy when one is illiquid and needy. Myown low ebb, the summer of 1991, when the liquidity I'd builtfor myself in the sky vanished. . . well. . . "   <p> But the energy returns. "Other than then," he says, "I tendto think the fact that most of the people I associate with havea lot more money is fine. I've made my choice. Being of the well-to-domiddle class means you haven't solved the economic problem. Peopleon Wall Street have solved the economic problem, but I'm notsure they're happier for it. They can't walk into a library andshow their children what they've done."  <p>   <p> Finding someone in the professional world of money who knowsbut does not like and respect James Grant is all but impossible.Noting my frustration with the quest, Grant offered several namesof individuals who might just "hate me or at least think I'man asshole," but they all failed to pan out.   <p> Since Grant's close friends universally hate the way Louis Rukeyserreduces his smartest guest to the role of dancing bear duringGrant's half-dozen annual appearances on Wall Street Week, Ithought the compulsively bullish Rukeyser would offer some jibes."And here he is, Jim Grant," Rukeyser will say with a wink. "Hereto tell you why the world is finally about to come to its sensesand go straight down the tube. Jim, can we at least survive tillFather's Day?"  <p> But Rukeyser likes Grant quite a lot. "Jim has one of the rarestof gifts on Wall Street," he says, "the gift of literacy. Beyondthat, he is a genuine scholar, and beyond that he is a very,very good guy. I would like him just as much if he turned bullish.It would be such a striking event that we would have to declarea half holiday and celebrate."  <p> "There exists a market for bearishness," Grant said one Sundayevening after finishing his day's work. "At times I'm afraidI've filled that niche. As a writer you can get into a rut, andyou can get into a rut of foreboding. It's easy to fall into,and once you've mastered it, it's hard to shake. The truth is,I love blizzards. When promised hurricanes don't materialize,I am very disappointed. I hate ordeals by sunshine, and I preferstorms. I love 95 percent humidity in the summer time, verdantsprings and deep autumns and all sorts of other romantic impulses-- and I don't like it when they take the risk out the marketplace,because that's like living in Florida."  <p> "You're like the German Expressionist of market-watching," Iventured.  <p> "Guess so."  <p> Grant sometimes wakes up in the dead of night to engage in one-manacts of contrition. At 4:15 on a recent morning, he allowed himselfan hour of castigating reflection upon how much more productiveof good prose he must be. He was well into his fourth book aboutfinance, and he was still knocking out his many hundreds of wordsper day. But nevertheless, he sat alone in the predawn quietof his Brooklyn brownstone, pondering the twin tortures of writingfluent prose every day and trying to accurately "recognize change." <p> "There are many ways to be wrong," Grant said. "And one is toimpute one's own idea of rationality into an arena in which theheart and glands have more to say about the outcome than thehead."  <p> Though I once wondered if the provocative presence struck byGrant was an act, it becomes clear up close that the complexpackage of the man is much less the result of an act than ofa set of overpowering impulses connected to ideas and the past.Grant would undoubtedly thrive via a bit more of an act and abit less of the passionately thundering real thing. This is ironic,because though he is a bear and a doubter and a Main Street mistrusterof Wall Street ways, Grant has also brought four children intothe world. He owns a house in New York, the city "of life's finalists,"as he puts it. He tortures himself in the act of writing gorgeoussentences because he believes, in the long run, such things matter.He sits up stewing at night because he thinks that but for abit more concentration and hard work, he will get it absolutelyright.  <p> "What I do think I understand now is that the most powerfulforce in markets is paradox," Grant claimed in triumphant tones."The last shall be first and the first shall be last. Last year'swinners will be this year's losers. The genius shall be the moron.What is seemingly obvious is in fact misunderstood, and whatis hopelessly obscure and improbable will be the next idea thatreally works."   <p> Then he paused. "I also know," he said, "that it's simply notgood enough to be the perennial Jeremiah.

For these eight people, the money came out of nowhere. Now what?<p>By Carla Koehl<p>Easy money. Pennies from heaven. A free lunch. Dumb luck.<p>Whatever you call it, the lure of the windfall is undeniable: A windfall is the stuff of daydreams -- a winning lottery ticket, a flukey business success, a fantastically large legal settlement. It's unearned but, we'd like to think, not undeserved. It's the unexpected payoff for the task of simply being ourselves. <p>Money that is earned, or even desired too strongly, seems scuffed with moral grass stains. We can thank our Puritan heritage for that. Found money, on the other hand, is clean. Consider the word itself. Windfall. It implies a gift from above, brought to earth as if by nature. <p>But money doesn't operate quite the same way in the real world as in the ideal one. What follow are the stories of a nun who won a million dollars and gave it away; a 17-year-old who suddenly finds herself set for life; a couple who say they don't want their $950,000 and never will; and five more. In all, eight portraits of outrageous, improbable, and sometimes confounding good fortune. <p><p>C. JACK DOWDEN, San Diego
Windfall: $21 million<p>In 1991, Dowden, a sales manager for MetWest medical labs, blew the whistle on MetWest; its owner, MetPath; and National Health Laboratories, claiming the labs were charging Medicare and Medicaid millions for unneeded blood tests. When the labs settled with the federal government for $140 million, he got 15 percent.<p>Dowden: "There are a lot of people who'd like to see me gone, out of town. So if I join, like, a country club, I don't like my name to go down on the new members list. And if I make a donation, I do it anonymously. I'm not living my life in order to brag or show off or anything. But I'm definitely living a good life. No, I don't see why I should have any hang-ups about the money. We beat 'em fair and square. <p>"When I first went to the president of the company with this information, he told my boss to make me shut up and do my job. Then I was demoted, and then I quit. I was making around $70,000 a year. Then I made $18,000 a year selling cars for two years. We nearly went broke seeing this thing through. <p>"Now things are a little different: $21 million will do that. I still get up early every morning -- only now, it's to go fishing. I've bought myself a $100,000 fishing boat. I have bought a house that's four times the size of the old one. My wife and I have given most of our clothes and furniture to Goodwill. We're buying all new things. Every time a broker says, 'Why don't you buy $100,000 of this stock?' I say, 'Why? Give me one good reason. Like I need to make more money?' "<p><p>VERONICA BLUME, Barcelona, Spain
Windfall: $275,000<p>Blume, 17, was the 1993 winner of the Ford Models annual Supermodel of the World search. She entered the contest after answering a magazine ad and won a three-year contract with Ford. Since then, she's appeared in Cosmopolitan, Allure, Sports Illustrated's 1994 swimsuit issue, and on the cover of Spanish Elle.<p>Blume: "I used to be monobrow. Monobrow, monobrow. No more monobrow for me. I've been plucked! Totally plucked. But I like it this way. You like it? I like it. My mother is from Uruguay, and she's very dark. People see me with my whole family, they think I'm adopted. Really.<p>"Sometimes, I feel like I'm living in a dream. I'm living with Eileen Ford whenever I'm in New York. She reminds me to sit straight and which fork to use. I open the fridge at her house, and every day there's chicken with no skin and gallons and gallons of water. There are cakes too. That's strange to see, but they're there. You order orange juice at a restaurant, and she says -- very nicely -- 'No, I think you want water.' <p>"The work that I'm doing now -- it doesn't have to take on such a high importance. I mean, I don't have to worry so much about money or the future as a lot of other models do because, I hope, this is just the beginning for me. And it's a great way to begin. Most models finish their careers without ever getting a contract like this, and they don't have much money. <p>"When I was at home, I was always out of money. But now it's different. Now I like running out of money, because I know there's more."<p><p>MARVIN & MATTIE ADAY, Ellis County, Texas
Windfall: $950,000<p>In 1989, Congress designated nearly 17,000 acres of Ellis County, Texas, as the site for the $8.3 billion superconducting supercollider. The Adays were among 166 families forced to relocate. They had to sell nearly half their 750-acre farm to the Department of Energy. The supercollider was canceled last fall.<p>The Adays: "We didn't want the money, we just wanted to keep our home. What do we want with money? Got no grandchildren. Our daughters are full grown. We just wanted to spend the rest of our lives on our farm. <p>"You got to understand. That's my home. I built it, I farmed it, and I raised a family on it. We were very frugal. We had good food, a good house. Mattie, she never had to go out in the field to work or nothing. She kept the house. And now? Now the place is just half torn down. All the bricks is torn off, and the thing is standing out there like a skeleton. I wish they'd just tear it all down. Driving by, it's almost like going past a graveyard. <p>"That land's been in our family more than 100 years, from my grandfather to my father to me. The first 40 acres I bought myself was just $75 an acre. Two years later I bought 50 acres right by it. After World War II, I came back and bought more. You can't go and build a lab on that kind of history ... And look, they didn't after all.<p>"We was mad as H when it happened. I cussed and I prayed and I cussed some more. Now we got the money, we're still mad. Mad and tired. And we still don't want the money."<p><p>SISTER JOSEPHINE CONTRIS, Santa Maria, California
Windfall: $1 million<p>Sister Josephine took the Franciscan Order's vows of poverty when she was 17. In 1992, at age 72, she won the California State Lottery's "Big Spin" game.<p>Contris: "So many people said, 'Why don't you take the money and run?' I said, 'What do I want to run for? For that matter, where would I run to?'<p>"I became a nun more than 50 years ago. That means money, possessions, everything belongs to the community. So that's where the lottery winnings went. I turned the money over to our superior. <p>"You think I'm crazy. But I'm not. I learned that the money from people buying lottery tickets went to help the school system, so I thought, great, I can do that. Have a little fun gambling and have it go to a good cause: the schools. <p>"We were very poor growing up. During the Depression we were nine children. My father and my oldest brother worked in a lumber mill. We didn't have anything. We barely had full meals. Then, I would have been happy to get some money. But now that I've got it, all I want to do is give it away. I wouldn't know what to do with it for myself ... Well, I did always want to go on a cruise before I die. I got to go, too, and it was wonderful: Cabo San Lucas, Puerto Vallarta, and Mazatlan. These people who keep hounding me, wondering when I'm going to run off and join the circus now that I've won all this money, well ... They just don't get it, do they? Some never do."<p><p>DON CALHOUN, Bloomington, Illinois
Windfall: $1 million<p>In April 1993, as he entered Chicago Stadium for a Bulls game, Calhoun, a 24-year-old office-supplies salesman, was randomly chosen for a promotional contest. To win $1 million, he had to sink a 75-foot shot. Calhoun made the shot. He is now a Harlem Globetrotter. The contest was discontinued.<p>Calhoun: "I was always good with throwing paper in the garbage across the room in school. It's instinct as much as intensity. That night at the Bulls game? The basket looked close. I just let it go. And it went. <p>"Since then I haven't even taken a vacation. I haven't bought a plane ticket on my own yet. I don't feel like I can afford a vacation right now -- like, now is a very important time, and if I blow it, I blow a lot more than a career. <p>"Suddenly having $50,000 a year is kind of strange. I mean, I rent an apartment for $340 a month. I've got some government bonds and CDs, and I've been learning the stock market, but I don't understand it yet, and I'm not in a hurry. Before this happened, I was kind of going along, doing my thing -- my life was taking me more places than I was taking it.<p>"To me, this is an opportunity to do my short-story writing, play pro ball, and give something to kids who grew up the way I did. The Million Dollar Man Basketball Clinic I've started for underprivileged kids is real important to me. I wanted to play ball so bad when I was a kid, and these kids want the same thing. Now I have a whole lot to give that in my former life I wasn't in a position to give."<p><p>DOV JACOBSON, Atlanta
Windfall: $1.2 million<p>During the '80s, Jacobson worked at Time Inc. and spent nights creating software tools for computer animators. In 1987, he and his partner sold their company, West End Film, for $6 million. Jacobson is now creative director at Turner Interactive, a software division of Turner Broadcasting System.<p>Jacobson: "I've been lucky enough to make some really good decisions about my work -- because I didn't give a damn about money. <p>"Here I was, back in the late '70s, almost 30, stone broke, bringing my pregnant bride back from a $600 trip around the world to live at my parents' house in New Jersey -- and working nights on an experimental software project at Time magazine: Their art department let me use their equipment to teach myself computer animation. Then Time hired me in 1981 and gave me $29,000 a year. It was an incredible amount of money to me at the time. <p>"Seven years later, I was handed a check for $1.2 million -- one check with two commas on it. My share of the company. Really. I held the check, and still I couldn't believe it. Like they'd gotten the wrong guy. <p>"What the money's given us is the ability to say 'screw you' to everybody -- and especially to bogus computer jobs. I mean, if I lose this job tomorrow at Turner, it's really okay. I don't want to leave, but I have the freedom to. That's the greatest kind of wealth. That and the fact that my wife, if she's losing money on our investments, she's not telling me about it. So at least I have the illusion that we're rich."<p><p>ERIN MERCER, Jackson, Tennessee
Windfall: $10,000<p>Last spring Nickelodeon, "the cable channel just for kids," held a contest. The child whose postcard was chosen at random would win the grand prize: a $10,000 bedroom redecoration. Out of 250,000 entries, the winner was Mercer, now a seventh grader at Jackson Middle School.<p>Mercer: "I can't even believe it -- they're sending an interior decorator. They just told us. I can't believe it. <p>"My teachers are trying to give me hints on what to do. The worst idea I've heard so far is a boy in my homeroom class told me to get a whole bunch of motor scooters and line them up against the wall. So dumb. All different color motor scooters. Boys can be so dumb.<p>"Right now the only color I can think of is blue or pink. It all has to match. And I want some wallpaper and paint and posters and stuff. And a stereo with a CD player. And a VCR and Sega and lots of electronic stuff. I mean, I don't really need all this stuff, so it feels weird to want it now. But this is sort of like a fantasy thing, this Nickelodeon room I get. My room is sort of like a lemon yellow paint. I've got yellow curtains and a yellow bedspread. As long as I can remember, it's looked like this. Pretty much since I was born. But I don't remember that. Yeah, yellow is fine, I guess.<p>"When Nickelodeon called, my mom answered the phone. She told me, and I think I screamed. In a good way, though. It's the first time I've ever sent in to a contest in my whole life. <p>"Twelve years is a long time with just one color."<p><p>BOB CASTLEBERRY, Denton, Texas
Windfall: $10 million<p>In 1989, Castleberry won $10 million in the Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes. Nine months later, he retired from his job as an account executive of a business-forms company and ran for mayor of his hometown, Denton, Texas. He's now in his third term. The job pays no salary.<p>Castleberry: "I can't say I've had any direct marriage proposals, but let me tell you something: Women sure can drop some big hints.<p>"I mean, I'm the kinda guy who's got a dozen pair of cowboy boots and around 150 ties. I just counted, so I'm not pullin' this outta thin air. First thing I did when I won, I promised myself I wouldn't do anything with the money for two months. Two months later to the day, I picked up the phone and bought myself a brand-new Cadillac. I mean, I negotiated for it like I always would, but I didn't even have to leave my chair. What a great, great country. Red leather interior. <p>"Pretty quick, though, I learned how to say no. If you don't, you can get in real trouble. Especially with all those people who write you all those mournful requests for money. I got to the point where I could detect which ones were real. And most of 'em -- I don't need to tell you -- most of 'em weren't. I made up my mind I wasn't going to loan anybody any money, either. If you're good for it, a bank'll help you. <p>"Yes, I know how lucky I am. I mean, I don't know too many other folks who've got a white Rolls Royce. Or any Rolls Royce, for that matter. Not any who still get elected mayor. Nope. Don't think I don't know it: Around here, every day is Christmas. I'm living everyone's dream."

Reach into your pocket and reward people for helping you, says James Redfield, author of "The Celestine Prophecy."  It will make you rich.<p>By Jesse Kornbluth<p>Those who shun new age best-sellers may not quite understand all the fuss over 44-year-old James Redfield, author of "The Celestine Prophecy", a slim volume that has been described as a combination of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Jonathan Livingston Seagull."<p>But forget for a moment the flaky story, a spiritual adventure that takes an unnamed American narrator to the mountains of Peru, where he finds an endangered manuscript containing nine insights that could transform the world. Instead, consider the insights themselves -- for it's clearly Redfield's ideas, not his prose, that have sold more than a million copies of this book.<p>Here, at no extra charge, are a few of the biggies: Restlessness is a sign you're hungry for meaning in your life. Pay attention to coincidences and explore their possibilities. Stop fighting others for energy. Make eye contact with strangers and talk to them; they have messages for you.<p>Okay -- so far, so harmless. It's the final insight that stops many readers cold. Redfield predicts a time when automation will do most of our work. Our incomes will remain stable, however, because people will voluntarily pay us for the advice we give them. And we'll do the same for them, allowing everyone to do well by doing good. A spacey pipe dream or a radical vision? Jesse Kornbluth called Redfield at his Alabama home to learn more.<p>
Q: It amazes me that your endorsement of voluntarily giving money away has found any resonance in a society obsessed with accumulating wealth.<p>A: Our view of money is evolving. Money is only energy, a tool for creativity. The more you see money as a scarce resource and hold on to it tightly, the more you're locked into scarcity. No matter how tight money is for you, if you don't open your hand and make it available, it'll be harder for you to get more. When you give, you create a void that is filled again. And you always receive much more. Sounds too easy -- you give, you get -- but test it out.<p>Q: The huge success of your book shows that a lot of people are open to your ideas. But why should we believe your economic theories? Until recently, you were a therapist who worked with disturbed adolescents and their parents -- hardly a profession that spawns new ideas about money. Where does this stuff come from?<p>A: It's partly intuitive, and partly based on my investigation of many different religious offshoots, like theosophy and Religious Science, that promote tithing. These groups didn't talk about tithing just as charitable giving, but as something you do to achieve prosperity: Whatever you do, it comes back many times over. John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie were strong believers in giving money away. By the time I wrote the book, I'd been practicing it for three or four years.<p>Q: Practicing what, exactly? You're not talking about giving to churches and charity, which is what Rockefeller and Carnegie did. <p>A: People often happen to show up with information I've been waiting for. On those occasions I've given money, from a budget of roughly 10 percent of my income. People would say "What for?" I'd tell them, "It's a gift because you helped."<p>Q: You'd actually put cash in their hands?<p>A: Yes. They didn't understand, and I didn't try to explain. But what happened is that my income began to rise dramatically. I'd get a new opportunity, and things would work out. Once I began the process, for instance, I got several offers to leave the public agency where I was working and join an established therapeutic practice.<p>Q: You originally published "Celestine Prophecy" yourself. Did you also see that as a chance to test your theory about money?<p>A: Absolutely. I invested $15,000 and printed 3,000 copies. Then I phased out my therapy practice, and my wife, Salle, and I spent a few months crisscrossing the Southeast, giving the book away.<p>Q: Just giving it away?<p>A: Well, we left most of the copies at bookstores, mailed a few hundred, and handed the rest to people we met by chance. People embraced the book, sent it to friends, and orders started coming in. After three months we didn't have to do anything. We ended up selling 150,000 copies that way before we made a deal with Warner Books.<p>Q: Now that you're more solvent, are you any less willing to open your wallet?<p>A: I didn't write the book so I could become a philanthropist, but I've continued to give money away. The only thing that's different now is that I've set up a foundation.<p>Q: How about just reaching into your pocket and handing money to a person?<p>A: I still do that. Just recently, for example, I had a bunch of movie offers for the book, and I was feeling very unqualified to assess all the deals. A person came along and introduced me to an attorney who could help me understand my alternatives. I responded.<p>Q: And when you gave that person money, how did the two of you agree on the value of his advice?<p>A: As I see it, the value is entirely in the hands of the giver.<p>Q: Why not mutually agree on a dollar amount?<p>A: For one thing, if you have a sign on the door that says a service costs $20, that limits the high end of the scale. But more than that, to talk about what a personal service is worth is to create a caricature of the existing economy. We're talking about spiritual economics here.<p>Q: Still, you've got 5,000 subscribers to the "Celestine Journal," a newsletter that costs a fixed $29.95 a year. And you've sold 2,000 copies of an audiotape that you market at a fixed $30. How does that work? Should buyers who find value send you a gift as well?<p>A: Not at all. Tithing is about unexpected giving, not about being paid for a service. I don't want anyone sending me tithes.<p>Q: On the flip side of that, do people ask you for money now? Once you start paying folks unexpectedly, word must get around.<p>A: I'm careful how I talk about this, so people don't see me as someone who just gives cash away. That circumvents the principle.<p>Q: Speaking of circumventing a principle, one reviewer recently criticized you for identifying spirituality in terms of money. She said this could be "vastly misunderstood."<p>A: She's worried about charlatans who seek money by posing as spiritual teachers. She seems to miss the fact that "Celestine Prophecy" precisely deals with how to avoid being controlled by others. It's an anticult book.<p>Q: No danger, then, that you'll become just another spiritual leader asking us for money?<p>A: None. If this book continues to sell, I'll be harder and harder to find. In fact, here's a warning: People will take the ideas in the book and do strange things. There will be pyramid schemes based on tithing. There will be "Celestine Prophecy" study groups led by people more interested in money than in study. The buyer should beware.<p>Q: Would you feel vindicated if some big academic or economist endorsed your vision of economics?<p>A: Academics will be the last to get it. They gain their power from describing old information, and they don't want to lose that power. I wish I could say that my ideas are based on those of some great economist. But spiritual economics won't play out that way. If this vision is to happen, it has to be a grassroots phenomenon. The shift has to be made by individuals interpreting these ideas -- and then coming up with their own.<p><p><p>

The real winners with these guarantees are the insurers.<p>By Alan Lavine<p>Sales of variable annuities hit a record $43 billion last year, and juiced-up death-benefit guarantees have emerged as one of their hottest draws. Here's how they work: A lump-sum or regular investment placed in a variable annuity earns a variable rate of return that is tax-deferred. The insurance company underwriting the annuity guarantees to pay your heirs the principal or the market value of your investment -- whichever is greater -- when you die.<p>Most of the top 25 companies selling variable annuities offer enhanced death-benefit guarantees. Some reset the amount they will guarantee every seven years, based on the policy's accumulated value. Others pay guaranteed rates of 4 percent to 7 percent and up to twice the principal upon the death of the annuitant if he or she dies before a certain age -- typically 80 or 90. <p>The death-benefit guarantee is a source of comfort to older investors who roll their maturing federally insured CDs into variable annuities. But an analysis of the numbers shows that this feature may in fact benefit the insurance company more than the annuitant.<p>"The death-benefit guarantee encourages people to take more risk and invest in more funds," says Roger Blease, a life- and health-insurance analyst at A.M. Best, an insurance-rating concern. "That generates more profits [to the insurer]. The death-benefit guarantee also keeps people from cashing out their annuities." <p>Death-benefit guarantees don't come cheap. For starters, annuitants are charged 1.25 percent of their investment annually in so-called mortality and expense fees. Tack on additional charges to help pay agent commissions and other expenses, and you get annual expenses as high as 1.77 percent, according to the Morningstar Variable Annuity/Life Performance Report.<p>John Snyder, an actuary with Milliman & Robertson in Milwaukee, says the cost to insurers of offering death-benefit guarantees runs between 0.03 percent and 0.08 percent of the variable annuity's assets annually. The lion's share of the fee -- 0.8 percent of total annuity assets -- represents the insurance company's profit. The reason for these enviable profits, Snyder says, is that the probability of exercising a claim is small -- on the order of 1 to 3 out of 1,000 deaths. <p>One potential risk to annuity holders is that the insurance company may fail. Fourteen states have life and health guaranty associations that cover the principal value of an insurer's death-benefit guarantee for company retirement plans, which are called unallocated annuity contracts. Individuals who buy annuities outside of their company plan are not covered at all. Even in those states that do provide coverage, combined benefits for the company that owns the contract are typically limited to less than $5 million. <p>The states with guaranty associations are Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, Oklahoma, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, and Washington.<p>John Del Campo, counsel for the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations, a Virginia-based organization that represents state insurance funds, says state insurance funds would decide on a case-by-case basis whether they would cover nonqualified variable-annuity death-benefit guarantees. And even with coverage, state laws generally set a limit of up to $100,000 in annuity principal and up to $300,000 for all insurance benefits combined per policyholder. "It's a gray area whether the coverage is eligible," says Del Campo. "People are putting a large amount of money into these products, but they don't know if the guaranty associations will cover it."<p>Life and health guaranty associations are pools created by state law to cover insurance policies, including annuities. Guaranty associations are funded by insurance companies that pay 1 percent to 4 percent of premiums annually in the states in which they do business. Associations limit protection to residents of their states, but it doesn't matter where annuitants' beneficiaries live.<p>A top-selling variable annuity, Franklin Value Mark, which sports a death-benefit guarantee, pulled in $3.13 billion sales in 1993. The death-benefit guarantee is based on a 5 percent annual compound rate up to age 80; if the annuitant dies before that, the benefit received is the greater of the contract's cash surrender value or the amount invested multiplied by 5 percent for every year the contract has been in force.<p>Golden American Life Insurance's GoldenSelect policy guarantees a 7 percent rate and up to twice the principal when the annuitant dies. Merrill Lynch Fund's Retirement Plus annuity pays 5 percent until the annuitant's death. <p>Insurers contend that investors are willing to pay for a death-benefit guarantee even though it may never apply to them. "It's been a chief selling point for us," says Bob Langel, executive vice president at Golden American Life Insurance in New York City. "People know they can take on more risk and invest in stock funds without having to worry about their principal." Once in, policyholders are apt to stay with a variable annuity for the security it provides.<p>In fact, in stable markets few insurers ever have to pay on their guarantees. Brian Kroll, an annuity-product officer with Sun Life's MFS Regatta Gold in Wellesley, Massachusetts, says that since 1990, Sun Life has paid out an average of 10 to 15 claims per year in which the minimum death-benefit guarantee has exceeded the account value, each averaging $40,000. "Death-benefit claims are far and few between," says Kroll. "We set aside $500,000 a year on the Regatta product to pay for potential claims." <p>Jennifer Strickland, editor of the Morningstar Variable Annuity/Life Performance Report, says a death-benefit guarantee is similar to fire insurance -- you may never use it, but it may be good to have. However, Strickland advises investors to shop around and compare annuity expenses. "Many people don't realize they have to die to collect the death-benefit guarantee," Strickland says. "They think they can earn a 5 percent annual rate on a stock fund and won't lose any money. They may not use it, and the high cost of the insurance charges can eat into your total return." <p>If you think a variable annuity is for you, read the policy's prospectus carefully to determine if the insurance company is indeed reserving for its death-benefit claims. In general, experts advise that investors buy from companies rated A or better by A.M. Best and B+ by Weiss Research. Claims-paying ratings should be at least AA by Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Duff & Phelps. If your insurer is using another insurance company to cover the claims, it is a good idea to check the safety ratings of both companies.<p><p>

						Can you be an insider without knowing it? Robert Sacks thought he was just getting a little free advice. Instead he got caught in the government's broadest insider-trading case ever.<p>By Ted C. Fishman<p>Robert Sacks enjoyed talking to other parents at his son's soccer games. Chatting with neighbors came naturally to him, but friendliness was also something of a professional responsibility: As the property manager for two residential developments in Calabasas, California, a well-to-do suburb on the northern rim of Los Angeles County, it was his job to know everyone around town. In the spring of 1990, Sacks was a regular at the Saturday-afternoon games. He would come out to root for his five-year-old son, Brandon, and to catch up on local gossip. He was well-liked -- "a helluva guy," in the words of one homeowner -- and he always seemed to have time for people. Sacks also got a kick out of watching the kids charge around on the grassy field. Too young to know how to play positions, they would swarm around the ball in a pack as they tried to boot it toward the opposing goal. <p>It was during these games that Sacks got to know another parent, Michael Newman. Newman was a speculator who played the stock, commodity, and rare-coin markets -- apparently with great success. "He drove a Mercedes and had a beautiful house with a tennis court," Sacks says. "Color me impressed." <p>The two new friends started talking about the market, and Newman suggested a pair of stocks he thought Sacks should buy. Sacks took the advice, but both of the investments wound up losers. Still, they remained friendly. Their children attended the same preschool classes at the local synagogue. Sacks regarded Newman as a well-meaning person who was "always very friendly." The two exchanged hellos at children's birthday parties and holiday carnivals. Newman, a friendly and gregarious schmoozer, took to calling Sacks "boychick," a Yiddish term of endearment.<p>In early June of 1990, Newman gave Sacks another tip. This time, he urged him to buy shares of Motel 6, the budget-motel chain. Apologizing for the performance of his other two recommendations, Newman practically guaranteed a winner. "This one looks real good," Sacks recalls Newman saying. "I think (the company) is going to get acquired." Despite the earlier losses, Sacks felt he still had every reason to trust his new friend, whose manner and lifestyle suggested a knack for hitting it big in the market. Plus, there was something else -- an air of certainty he heard in Newman's voice. Excited, Sacks decided that rather than purchasing Motel 6 common shares, he would buy call options. Because of greater leverage, the options would give Sacks a bigger score if the stock moved upward. He bought 70, giving him control of 7,000 shares of the stock.<p>To this day, Sacks maintains that he never knew the tip Newman gave him was anything more than just that: a friendly piece of advice, one he assumed was intended to make up for the two previous flops. Sacks also swears that he had no idea where Newman got the information -- or that Newman was in contact with a group of people who were illegally peddling inside information about Motel 6.<p>Yet that is exactly what the government would later charge. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the stock tip Sacks traded on had made its way through a complicated and disorganized web that started with a Motel 6 executive in Texas. It stretched through a chain of California tanning salons and even included an actor who, ironically, had had a bit part in the movie Wall Street, Oliver Stone's morality tale about insider trading. (See sidebar "Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Listen" following the end of this story.)<p>The investigation of the Motel 6 insider-trading case became the broadest of its kind ever mounted by the U.S. government. To date, the SEC, working in tandem with the U.S. Justice Department, has targeted at least 23 defendants, including people four or five steps removed from the Motel 6 executive implicated as the source of the original leak -- and others may yet be named. This is the first time the government has ever pursued people so far down the information ladder in an insider-trading investigation. The case is so complex that when SEC lawyers discuss it, they draw themselves pictures in the air just to see where everyone fits.<p>The Motel 6 probe "is a classic insider-trading case involving the breach of fiduciary duty of a high-level corporate insider," says Richard Walker, the regional administrator of the SEC in New York. If the case is a classic, though, it is also the sort of classic that pushes the boundaries of the work that preceded it. Walker isn't shy about the example he hopes the Motel 6 case will set. He wants to send a message to the public that the agency will go after anyone if "they yield to the temptation of trading on insider information." <p>Robert Sacks didn't find out the SEC was looking at his trades until more than a year after he took Newman's advice. The news arrived when a Justice Department investigator knocked on his door. It was just an informal interview, the agent said. He asked Sacks a few questions and left. A few weeks later, in November 1991, another knock on Sacks's door brought a formal subpoena and summons to New York for questioning by the SEC. <p>Even now, Sacks says he cannot comprehend why he was singled out. "I don't know what the SEC was after," he says. Though he has for the most part kept his troubles to himself, he agreed to speak to Worth, even though his friends and attorney advised him to remain silent. "The truth is the truth," he says. "I did nothing wrong." <p><p>On the New York Stock Exchange, where Motel 6 was listed, some 280 million shares change hands daily. People and institutions trade stock for any number of reasons, but a general principle underlying public securities trading is that in order for the trading to be fair, investors should all have access to the same information. <p>Theoretically, no one has an edge. But of course, everyone wants an angle. Information the general public does not have access to is the stuff that makes hot tips glow and sends those that have it -- like the Motel 6 insiders -- aggressively into the market. To enforce the law, the SEC routinely monitors trading on the nation's securities exchanges. When companies make major announcements that affect the price of their stock, the agency often will look back at the activity in the period preceding the public dissemination of the news. Most major events will trigger a commission inquiry of some kind. "We have computers that can sort massive amounts of data in a nanosecond," says Walker, describing the agency's first line of defense against inside trading. <p>The computers look for aberrations in a stock's trading volume and price movement. They also search for overheated activity in options, the instrument insiders often use to maximize returns. An analysis of Motel 6 trading on July 12, 1990, would have left the commission's computers smoking. That was the day Accor S.A., a French-owned hotel concern, announced it would pay $1.3 billion, or $22.50 a share, for Motel 6. Even though the deal wasn't made public until after the market had closed, trading activity in the stock had been furious all day. In the previous month, between 50,000 and 100,000 shares of Motel 6 stock traded daily. On July 12, 1.5 million shares changed hands. Option volume had a similar bump. The traders who jumped the gun were easy marks.<p>Once the SEC's computers have flagged suspicious activity, the commission works backward to root out its quarry, looking for possible connections between people who bought and sold stock. If any connections are found, a fusillade of subpoenas comes next. These could be sent to lawyers, bankers, investment bankers, accountants, public relations people, even spouses, sons, daughters, friends, or neighbors. "If we're told the information was disseminated at a party, we get the guest list," says Henry Klehm, the assistant director for enforcement in the SEC's New York office. "We turn (suspects) upside-down and shake them."<p>Accor's 1990 takeover of Motel 6 came in the midst of a broad crackdown on Wall Street insiders. Investors were on notice: It was open season on cheaters. In fiscal 1991, the SEC filed 34 insider-trading complaints. Only months before, Michael Milken had paid the U.S. government $600 million and pleaded guilty to six felonies, and Ivan Boesky had been forced to pay $100 million. In both cases, the SEC linked forces with the Department of Justice, and both men received prison terms.<p>Due to the sheer volume of trading that takes place on the nation's stock exchanges, however, the SEC must be selective. It can't possibly run down every suspicious trade. This, however, doesn't mean that it pursues only big money. The agency wants the small-timers to think it is keeping an eye on them as well.<p>"The SEC is trying to create the illusion it is everywhere, and that if someone trades on inside information, the odds are strong of getting caught," says Harvey Pitt, a former general counsel to the SEC who, as a private attorney, defended Boesky. Pitt asserts that because of this strategy, more and more cases involve "people who are not stealing, bribing and cheating, but who just don't get the law, make mistakes, or who have a differing view on the law."<p>According to Walker, the SEC's new tack is working. "One indication that people are more aware of our enforcement," he says, "is that in current deals and transactions there is less of a tendency to see run-ups in advance of important announcements."<p><p>In 1990, at the age of 41, Robert Sacks had already seen his financial fortunes rise and fall. Money, however, was something he was usually able to keep in perspective. In 1983, he and his brother had sold a business they jointly owned -- a computerized billing service for dentists -- and Sacks invested his share in local real estate. He lived comfortably in a large home in the hills of Calabasas. In 1986, when a near tragedy struck his family, he was able to step away from his business and devote the next two and a half years to a public-service project. <p>His son Brandon, then two years old, had stuck a nail in an electric socket and almost died. In the aftermath, Sacks started an organization called the National Institute of Children's Environments. Among other things, he convinced a local builder to erect custom child-safe homes. NICE's work garnered press nationwide and was recognized in a personal letter from then-first lady Barbara Bush. "If God were to ask me what good I had done with my life, I would say this," Sacks says. NICE eventually was absorbed by the National Child Safety Council in Jackson, Michigan. <p>In the wake of the stock market crash in 1987, California real estate prices crashed, too. Over the next few years, Sacks's properties lost 40 percent of their value. This landed him in a reduced -- though still comfortable -- financial situation. On a brokerage application in 1990, he listed his net worth at $3 million. By the time the SEC deposed him in 1991, he pegged his net worth at $1.5 million. "The real estate market just killed me," he says. <p>Seeing his net worth fall by half scared Sacks. But he still had a steady income, earned as a manager for two private communities -- overseeing landscaping, coordinating street repair, and managing the private police force hired to protect the homeowners. During earthquakes, mud slides, and fires he never left the phone. He managed maintenance budgets so well that he never had to ask residents to pay extra for repairs in the wake of L.A.'s many disasters, something he's frequently thanked for. "He gives a damn about the community," says Joel Smulson, president of the Calabasas Park Estates residents association. "More than you'd expect."<p>Sacks also liked to play the stock market, and after his heavy real estate losses, he was eager to turn his fortunes around. When he first started talking to Newman about stocks in early 1990, he found his new friend more vocal than prescient. Newman suggested two stocks he thought were worth buying and sent Sacks to Ira Gorman, a friend of Newman's who ran a bare-bones discount brokerage. The two stocks declined in price after Sacks bought them. One of the picks, Caesars World, a casino operator, lost a third of its value. Sacks didn't blame Newman, but he was unhappy with Gorman. "I'm used to calling a stockbroker who'd give me the time of day," he told the SEC. "(Gorman) was very abrasive, uncaring." Newman promised to make up for these losses. His first gesture was to introduce Sacks to another broker, Rami Yahalom, of First Affiliated Securities in Encino, California, who insisted on meeting Sacks in person before taking the account. This put Sacks at ease immediately.<p>Then, Newman suggested a third stock: Motel 6. Sacks's hopes soared. "I probably was a little bit more excited about this one," he later told SEC lawyers during a deposition, "because I was a little bit more vulnerable.... I wanted to believe more than anything else that I could recover some of my losses (in real estate) by making some money in the stock market."<p>Had Sacks been on more solid financial ground, he might have scrutinized Newman's recommendation more closely. His one attempt at due diligence later became a critical point in his dealings with the SEC. Upon hearing the Motel 6 tip, he asked Newman, "How do you know this?" <p>Sacks later told the SEC in a deposition that Newman responded to this question by putting him off. Sacks quoted Newman as saying, "Boychick, don't worry. Don't ask, boychick." He also told the SEC that he quizzed Newman several more times, but Newman never offered more information. Sacks says it crossed his mind that Newman may have known more than he was admitting, but he had no way of knowing one way or the other. "For all I knew, he read it in The Wall Street Journal," Sacks says. (In fact, there had been speculation in the press about Motel 6 as a potential takeover candidate.)<p>In his deposition with the SEC, Sacks recalled that Newman also said, "Don't go telling anybody." This was advice Sacks didn't follow. He told at least two people, including a family member and a coworker. "There isn't a day that goes by that (I don't talk to) people," he told the SEC. "I don't keep anything I do confidential."<p>Sacks initially bought the Motel 6 call options through Yahalom, who he thought was "very sharp," and with whom he had begun speaking almost every day. Nevertheless, in the weeks that followed, the Motel 6 investment began looking like yet another lousy lead, just like Caesars World. Sacks called Newman several times at home to follow up on the progress of Motel 6. Each time, Newman apologized for the losses but said again he thought something would happen soon. (Newman would not comment for this story. Repeated attempts to reach him by phone and in person proved unsuccessful.)<p>Then, on June 20, Newman called Sacks to tell him the Motel 6 deal had fallen through and that he should get out of his options. Sacks took the advice. He liquidated the Motel 6 position. Sacks says he can't remember if he made or lost money: All he remembers is that it wasn't a "windfall." His faith in Newman plummeted. He thought Newman "didn't know what the heck he was talking about." Later, he told the SEC that at the time he thought Newman was a "schmuck." He resolved not to take any more tips from Newman. <p>"I called Rami," Sacks remembers of the time he was told the deal had collapsed, "and said that Newman was probably a flake." At this point, Sacks had dumped his position in Motel 6. But he had one other request for Yahalom: Would he continue to keep an eye on Motel 6's stock? The broker promised that he would.<p><p>In the meantime, the unseemly and fiendishly complicated tale of the Motel 6 insider-trading case had been unfolding in a vastly different world from Robert Sacks's comfortable suburb -- a world of Beverly Hills nightclubs and posh tanning salons.<p>In a 43-page complaint the SEC filed on March 4, 1993, the agency portrays a scheme that grew into a morass of intrigue, greed, and petty chiseling. Paradoxically, the man the SEC has tagged the insider at the top of the ladder, Hugh Thrasher, then executive vice-president of marketing at Motel 6, never made a dime from the information. Thrasher was a family man from Dallas who had joined Motel 6 in 1986, shortly after the chain was acquired by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co., the leveraged-buyout powerhouse most famous for its 1989 purchase of R.J. Reynolds. <p>Without Thrasher, Motel 6 might never have been such an attractive takeover target (Accor's acquisition price worked out to $37,000 per room). He inaugurated the first ad campaign in Motel 6 history. The ads, still going strong, feature Tom Bodett, the wryly homespun radio commentator from Homer, Alaska, who concludes the spots with the instantly recognizable tag line "We'll leave the light on for you." <p>Thrasher appears to have been rewarded for his efforts on behalf of Motel 6. He traveled frequently and had a home in Dallas, a yacht moored in Boca Raton, Florida, and a habit of giving expensive gifts. <p>According to the SEC's complaint, Thrasher had a "very close friendship" with a man named Carl Harris. Though unemployed, Harris lived in Beverly Hills with two roommates. The SEC says Thrasher bought Harris clothes and jewelry valued at more than $75,000. He also helped Harris buy a BMW convertible by arranging a $26,600 loan from a trust fund that belonged to Thrasher's children. The SEC says Thrasher also helped pay for Harris's rapidly mounting medical bills; Harris had AIDS.<p>In January 1990, when KKR and Motel 6 executives began to discuss a buyout with representatives of Accor, Thrasher was an active participant. His role put him a position to know intimate details about the confidential negotiations -- information that would obviously have a significant impact on the price of Motel 6 stock once it was publicly known.<p>Though the SEC never accused Thrasher of trading on this information for his own financial gain, its complaint does assert that he shared the news with Harris. The agency describes this action as "a gift of illegal profits." It also maintains that Thrasher himself "benefited directly" because the profits from his tip were "a means of providing Harris with additional financial support."<p>The details of how Harris acquired the takeover tip from Thrasher may remain forever unknown. Because he was gravely ill when the legal proceeding started, Harris's lawyer kept his client from being deposed. Harris died in April 1992. <p>Motel 6 suspended Hugh Thrasher when the government's insider-trading investigation came to light. Eventually, he was fired. His case is awaiting trial in New York State's Southern District. Thrasher's lawyer, Charles Stillman, who gained national attention for defending former Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford in the BCCI case, says he intends to fight the SEC's version of Thrasher's role in the Motel 6 case. Most likely, he says, Thrasher's defense will be that Harris somehow stole or misappropriated the information. <p>However Harris found out about the pending acquisition of Motel 6, he knew exactly what he wanted to do with the tip: sell the information to others and use the proceeds to buy options on the stock. To carry this scheme out, he first consulted one of his friends, William Gomez. Gomez, in turn, introduced Harris to Gregg Shawzin, who owned Future-Link, a brokerage firm in Beverly Hills. Shawzin also owned a share of a company called Lads and Lions, which operated a chain of tanning salons. As the information spread, its actual source was concealed. Either to protect Thrasher or to make his own story more credible, Harris said the tip came from his father, whom he said was on the Motel 6 board of directors. Of course, a call to the company switchboard would have revealed that Harris was lying.<p>At this level, according to the SEC, a classic insider-trading case took shape. For his part, Shawzin bought enough stock and call options to control 181,500 shares of Motel 6 (and would later split a $566,000 profit three ways, then pay Harris a $30,000 fee for the information). According to the SEC, Shawzin's friends also made side deals they didn't tell each other about.<p>Meanwhile, the Motel 6 tip spread far and wide. Tippers were demanding cuts of their tippees' profits, and tippees were striking deals to recoup their fees by selling the information yet again. The SEC believes that Michael Newman was brought into the ring by Shawzin. The two had a business relationship -- Newman had a desk at Future-Link, where he traded commodities -- and a social one too; Shawzin played tennis at Newman's house. <p>Shawzin turned to Newman as a way of helping Harris get money to invest in Motel 6, according to a deposition given to the SEC by Ronald Kuznetsky, one of Newman's closest friends (and, at Newman's urging, a Motel 6 investor). Harris had a gold jewelry box brimming with expensive items that he was willing to put up as collateral on a loan. The box had an amethyst on its face and contained a one-and-a-half-carat emerald and two wristwatches, one a gold Rolex. Newman, according to Kuznetsky's deposition, agreed to lend Harris $5,000. Despite the loan Newman made to Harris, Shawzin almost immediately regretted bringing him into the web. The problem, says the SEC, was that Newman started to peddle the tip too freely. Shawzin got nervous and tried to cut Newman out of the deal, calling him on June 20 to tell him that the takeover talks had collapsed. <p>Newman quickly liquidated the Motel 6 options he'd bought for himself. He also called his tippees and told them to unload their Motel 6 positions. One of the people to get such a call from Newman was Robert Sacks. Though Shawzin's lie cast Michael Newman out of the deal, Harris later reeled him back in. Three weeks later, on July 11, Harris ran an end-around on Shawzin and called Newman at home to tell him he had news about Motel 6. According to Kuznetsky's deposition, Harris told Newman he wanted 20 percent of his take. When Newman agreed, Harris told him the buyout would be announced the next day. Kuznetsky told the SEC that Newman planned to use the money he collected from his tippees, Sacks included, to pay Harris for the information. Newman assumed that Sacks was wealthy. He was going to ask for 25 percent of Sacks's take.<p><p>Robert Sacks starts his day at 6:15 each morning, so he was wide awake at 7:05 on the morning of July 12, 1990, when the telephone rang. It was Rami Yahalom, sounding excited. Yahalom had continued to keep an eye on Motel 6 stock, just as Sacks had asked, and guess what: That morning, trading in Motel 6 had opened on the NYSE with a frenzy of activity.<p>"I went crazy," Sacks says, his eyes widening, "I got stock fever. I bought and bought." In the course of the day, he placed some 30 telephone calls to Yahalom and poured about $80,000 into a combination of Motel 6 common stock and options. By his own account, he also discussed his moves with friends and relatives. (Some of them traded, he says, but the SEC didn't cite them as insider traders.) By the end of the day, Motel 6's common shares had closed at $19.25, up about $3. After the close, the news got even better. Accor S.A. announced it would take over the whole company at $22.50 a share. Sacks was $40,000 richer.<p>Newman had also telephoned Sacks that morning, this time to advise him that the Motel 6 deal was back on. Sacks said thank you, but he had already made his move to bet on the stock. In his deposition to the SEC, Sacks repeatedly insisted that his decision to get back into Motel 6 was based on the telephone call from Yahalom and not on the later call from Newman. Yahalom's testimony to the SEC corroborated Sacks's contention.<p>Two days later, Newman phoned Sacks again to congratulate him. But he also had something else on his mind. According to Sacks' deposition, Newman asked, "Well, boychick, how'd you do? How much money did you make?" When Sacks told him, Newman said, "I'm happy for you." Then Newman requested a 25 percent cut of Sacks's profits -- some $10,000 -- in cash. In his deposition, Sacks remembers Newman saying he had "expenses" to cover; the demand was made in a very friendly, matter-of-fact way. Nevertheless, Sacks says, he was shocked. "Wait a minute, let me get this straight," Sacks asked. "You expect me to pay this kind of money?" <p>"Yes, that's the way it is" was the reply, according to Sacks.<p>Later that day, Sacks brought a check for $2,000 to Newman's house. Newman again asked for cash but ended up taking the check, and asked Sacks to write "Art" on the bottom. He also told Sacks he wanted more money. "I believe I gave him another six to eight hundred," Sacks later told the SEC.<p>Though Sacks says he was taken aback by all this, he told the SEC that even before Newman asked him for money, he planned to give him "a little something" if the stock turned out to be a winner. At one point, before Newman ever demanded payment, Sacks recalls asking Newman, "Why are you doing this for me? What do you want?" <p>"Don't worry boychick, we'll work it out," Newman had replied lightly. <p>In the eyes of the SEC, Sacks's payment to Newman was highly incriminating -- an admission he had received information so valuable that he was willing to cough up serious money for it. Sacks, however, contends that just because he was grateful to Newman for putting him on to Motel 6 in the first place, that doesn't prove he ever knew that he was the recipient of inside information.<p>At first, when the Justice Department agent knocked on his door in late 1991, Sacks didn't imagine he was in trouble. "The Justice Department people were very nice," he remembers. "They treated me like a witness and told me what it was all about. I sat and had a very nice conversation." Shortly afterward, the SEC subpoena arrived, along with notification that Sacks would be named in the suit. <p>"I became a basket case," Sacks says. "They told me I had 24 hours to send them all my records. My attorney called for an extension, and it was denied. I didn't even have time to copy all of them. I sent them originals." Deeply rattled by the suddenness with which he'd become embroiled in the case, Sacks called Newman, who refused to talk. He then called Newman's friend Kuznetsky. "Would you please talk to me, no one wants to talk to me about this," Kuznetsky remembered Sacks pleading. <p>Sacks told Kuznetsky he was planning to testify that Rami Yahalom had recommended the stock, which was true. But this worried Kuznetsky. According to his deposition, he was not aware that Sacks had a different version of the story. Kuznetsky worried that Sacks's account might sound like a cover-up plot. He called Newman.<p>Newman then decided to call Sacks back. He urged Sacks to tell what Newman considered the truth; that is, that Sacks had bought the stock on Newman's tip. Sacks, however, says he found this advice strange and suspected Newman might be setting him up for something. "I said, 'Why are you calling me?'" Sacks told the SEC. "'Are you recording this call? What's going on here?'" <p>Newman said he wasn't recording the call. "I'm concerned for you," Sacks remembers him answering. "I'm concerned for my friends." <p>"You can't discuss it, I can't discuss it -- why are you calling me?" Sacks asked again. Newman apologized for putting him in a difficult situation but stressed that he should tell investigators he had traded on the information given him by Newman. By the end of the conversation, Newman too was emotional. Sacks remembers that Newman seemed on the verge of tears.<p>But Sacks wasn't going to change his story. He says he was not aware that Newman had offered the tip to anyone else. (The SEC fingered Newman for tipping four people in all.) Newman's call did little to ease his mind. In his deposition, he told the SEC he was "paranoid" about it. "I assumed the worst," he said. He remembers telling a family friend that getting subpoenaed was "one of the most frightening experiences that I've ever been through." <p>By this time, news of the case had spread throughout Calabasas. Sacks told a fellow congregant at the synagogue not to expect to see him at a soccer practice. "I'm going to New York for an investigation," he said, hinting at the matter. "Oh, is this the Newman thing?" the congregant answered. Sacks feared it was all over the temple.<p>Sacks flew to New York for the deposition, deciding not to bring an attorney with him. "I couldn't justify paying a lawyer $350 an hour for two full days," he says. "I thought I'd tell them what I knew, and they'd let me off the hook." Sacks says he did discuss his decision to go alone with his lawyer, who suggested that it would be better to go represented but felt there was little risk if Sacks stuck to the truth. (Many of the other figures in the case, Newman and Shawzin among them, refused to give depositions, exercising their Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination.)<p>At the SEC offices in lower Manhattan, Sacks was ushered into a room with three attorneys and a battery of microphones. "I got nervous because they were so accusatory," he says, "and I never thought in a million years it would end up like that." <p>Sacks was interviewed for a full day. In retrospect, he has few complaints about the way his interrogators treated him, except that he felt badgered by having to answer the same questions over and over. The transcript of his testimony shows that the government lawyers, led by Audrey Weintrob, a SEC staff attorney, pressed him hard, asking him to recall not just the facts of his case but also his mental state at every stage, his impressions of the people he talked to, of himself, of his doubts and hopes and suspicions.<p>When the interviewers started probing into Sacks's personal life, he had the sickening realization that he was in trouble for keeps: "They asked me every detail of my relationship with Newman, about the other people in the soccer league, about Newman's other tippees, his world." Nevertheless, he says, he stuck to his version of the events. The transcripts show Weintrob was especially interested in why Sacks had paid Newman money, which to them looked like a kickback. "The SEC made a big deal of that," he says of how the transaction is portrayed in the court papers, "but if I felt I was doing something wrong, I would have paid him in cash. I felt indebted."<p>Sacks relaxed once over the course of his interrogation, at lunchtime, when he approached one of the SEC attorneys. "Am I in trouble?" Sacks asked. "An Ivan Boesky you're not," the lawyer answered. <p>By itself, evidence that Sacks paid Newman only linked Sacks to the scheme, but it didn't prove that he had acted on inside information. To make a case against him stick, the SEC needed to show that Sacks at least suspected that he possessed material nonpublic information, an inside tip. <p>So the investigators zeroed in on what they regarded as the most vulnerable part of Sacks's testimony -- his acknowledgment that he had asked Newman, "How do you know this?"  During the interview, the following exchange took place:<p>Sacks: (Newman) basically said (Motel 6) was a good candidate for an acquisition, he liked the stock, he thought there was going to be a buyout. I had asked him repeatedly, "Where are you getting your information?" and he would repeatedly answer me, "Don't ask me." Those kinds of questions. I never knew, and I was impressed.<p>SEC investigator: What do you mean, you were impressed?<p>Sacks: I was impressed with his demeanor. I was impressed by the fact that he was obviously very successful and that he could make a living dealing in the stock market, and I guess my human nature was, I want to believe that he was giving me a tip.<p>SEC: What do you mean, giving you a tip?<p>Sacks: Just what I said. Giving me a tip like maybe a thousand other tips you get in life.<p>SEC: Did this appear to you like any other tip you've ever gotten?<p>Sacks: Absolutely.<p>SEC: What other tips have you gotten from what other people, for example?<p>Sacks: I am not going to sit here and go back on my life and remember a thousand tips, you know. Don't fly in airplanes, what stocks to buy. I hear it all the time.<p>To the SEC, the mere fact that Sacks had thought to ask Newman the source of his information demonstrated that he was aware of Newman's being privy to something inside and hot. And Newman's refusal to say where the recommendation came from offered Sacks no quarter. "As soon as you ask, it shows you are thinking about it," says the SEC's Henry Klehm. "Even if someone says, 'I don't want to know,' it shows a conscious avoidance of knowledge."<p><p>Insider-trading investigations usually conjure images of financiers, arbitrageurs, brokers, and lawyers -- the sharks in expensive suits who get early wind of big deals -- not small-timers in the suburbs. Among the 23 people the SEC has so far named in its suits, the government estimates total illegal profits of somewhere around $10 million. This is a substantial amount of money, but it is a pittance compared to the other classic securities-fraud cases. Dennis Levine, one of the inside traders who came to symbolize the 1980s, confessed to receiving $12.6 million in illegal profits. One of the individuals the SEC caught in its Motel 6 dragnet was Julian Schor, a corporate headhunter and one of Michael Newman's other tippees, for a $11,125 profit.<p>In the Motel 6 case, the SEC investigation unfolded with few obstructions. Thanks to the relative lack of sophistication of those involved, the commission was able to uncover reams of two of the most sought-after kinds of evidence: that tippees said to other people, "I have a hot confidential tip," and that those who traded on the information kicked back money to those higher on the chain.<p>When the SEC can prove strong links between tiers in a scheme, tippers can be held liable to pay for all the trading gains and penalties -- usually equal to the trading profits -- of anyone on the tiers below them. Sacks's settlement with the SEC totaled $469,000, which covered his profits and penalties as well as the profits and penalties of the people Sacks encouraged to trade in Motel 6, plus interest. "I could have fought on principle and put up $300,000 to $400,000 in attorneys' fees, or settled and gotten on with my life," Sacks says.<p>Was Robert Sacks unfairly persecuted? The crime of insider trading exists only within the arcana of SEC regulations and some narrowly defined court rulings. In Sacks's case, the SEC reached beyond even these gauzy definitions of the crime. Going after an insider four times removed from the source of the information has never been tested in court. <p>So far, Sacks has not been charged by the Justice Department. The chances that he will be charged are somewhat diminished by the demands in a criminal proceeding that guilt be established beyond a reasonable doubt; in SEC investigations, only a preponderance of evidence is necessary. But even if the government has closed the book on Sacks, he's not off the hook. A class-action lawsuit brought last July by four law firms in New York and Chicago threatens to churn up new troubles. The suit, drafted almost directly from the SEC court complaint, apes nearly every aspect of the SEC action except that it seeks to return money to private investors who lost as a result of the insider trading. <p>Sacks says he went through a period of deep bitterness. "At first I blamed Newman for everything, but later I thought it was unfair to make him the source of my anger," he says. "He had no ill will or intentions to do me harm. He did what he did because he has a big heart and is a very caring person." Sacks is also at peace about his settlement, feeling it helped him refocus on what is important. This year he and his wife and three children are leaving Calabasas to make a new start in Utah. The insider case was the final factor that made up their minds. "What are the three dirtiest letters in the stock market today?" he asks. "T-I-P. Yet that is just what everyone asks their brokers for every time they call."

---------------<p>SIDEBAR: 
Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Listen <p>If the case of Bob Sacks warns investors not to ask "What's hot?," the case of Darrell Sandy Marsh warns that you're probably better off not even listening. Like Sacks, Marsh was four steps removed from the alleged source of information, but he was also following Motel 6 stock on his own, well before he was tipped off.<p>Marsh was drawn into the web by John Anderson -- a busy  tipper and later a cooperative government witness. He and Marsh know each other from the tanning-salon business. Marsh, Anderson, and Gregg and Mark Shawzin were all associated with the Sun Days chain of tanning salons operated by Lads and Lions. Marsh is also a former movie actor, having appeared in bit parts in the movies Wall Street, Road House, and the remake of The Blob.<p>Before his acting career, Marsh, who graduated with honors with a degree in finance from Boston University, made a living trading stock options. He and his 74-year-old father, Jack, regularly trolled the market for takeover candidates. Marsh says brokerage statements even show that his father put in an unsuccessful bid for Motel 6 stock in April 1990; the elder Marsh reasoned that owner Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company might sell the chain to help retire the massive debt it carried from its acquisition of R.J. Reynolds. Jack Marsh held over $100,000 in Reynolds bonds and so had been watching KKR's plans for Motel 6 closely. He wasn't alone. Dan Dorfman had reported takeover rumors in three separate USA Today columns, beginning in August 1989. In April, three months before the announcement, both Reuters and Investor's Daily reported on speculation that a "Japanese or French concern" was interested in the company. (Accor S.A., the hotel conglomerate that eventually purchased the chain, is French.)<p>When, as the SEC alleges, Anderson offered Marsh the tip, Marsh considered it cautiously and weighed the information against what he already knew about the stock. When he entered the market in early June, he did so gingerly, putting on hedged options positions, a strategy that let him bet the direction of the stock without betting the farm. Because he claims he was nervous about the information, he was in and out of Motel 6 securities numerous times in the month before the takeover. All along, he discussed the deal with his father, who was also holding a sizable position.<p>According to the SEC, Marsh made $152,000 on the Motel 6 takeover; his father made twice that. In his initial answer to the SEC's charges, Marsh maintained that he never relied on Anderson's tip. The SEC didn't buy it. The fact that the Marshes were already closely following Motel 6 stock did not help their defense. To regulators, Anderson's tip, even if it weighed minimally in their investing, was still the most important information they received. As long as inside information played any role at all in their decisions, the SEC said, the investors were insiders. That view has been supported by federal courts, which, in insider cases, have refused to play mind reader and divine which parts of an investment were made based on public and which on nonpublic information.<p>Marsh, who now runs a tanning salon in Los Angeles, is also named in a class-action suit. He will most likely be charged with securities fraud by the Justice Department.

Michael Hammer is the best-selling author behind much of the job cutting in corporate America. Watch out: He's not finished yet, as this conversation with Jesse Kornbluth indicates.<p>By Jesse Kornbluth<p>Only yesterday, it seems, reengineering wasn't even a word. Now it's fodder for anxious cocktail-party chatter everywhere -- a sign that Michael Hammer, prophet of reengineering, is far more than just another best-selling author. He's the business guru responsible for a wrenching new doctrine that has even successful companies slashing jobs. Hammer burst onto the scene with a 1990 Harvard Business Review piece that blasted ossified U.S. corporations. His prescription? Businesses should obliterate old structures and start over from the ground up -- reengineer, in his terminology.<p>A onetime professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Hammer recommended using computers to replace outdated processes. Figure out what needs to be done, he said, then arm a professional with the technology to do it. The result would be reduced costs, nimbler companies, and empowered employees. Last year, Hammer and James Champy expanded this argument in Reengineering the Corporation, which stayed on the New York Times best-seller list for 36 weeks.<p>As the paperback version now climbs the charts, Hammer is giving pricey seminars and working on a follow-up, Beyond Reengineering. His thoughts are parroted by corporate titans; observers compare him to a televangelist. Yet the 46-year-old Hammer insists he's not satisfied. Few people have heard his message whole, he says. Companies say they've reengineered when all they've done is dispense pink slips. Such half-measures, he fears, may doom reengineering to becoming little more than the latest buzzword.<p>In a characteristically blunt talk with Jesse Kornbluth, Hammer reaches as high as the White House to chastise the weakhearted.<p>
Q: Americans like their sermons upbeat and poster-simple. In that kind of culture, can you really be surprised that your hard words haven't sunk in?<p>A: One of the biggest challenges for me in the past year has been that the term reengineering is so accessible. People who have no clue actually think they're doing it -- reengineering has become a generic term for good. At every company I know, management goes off for a week and comes back with high-sounding platitudes printed on laminated cards. They're all the same. They're all pompous drivel.<p>Q: That's not shocking; you're asking us to take a huge leap of faith. Reinventing a business from scratch often costs jobs and always causes pain.<p>A: I don't say "reengineer or die" because I think it's interesting or attractive or fun or because I like hype. American companies are living in a fantasy world. We've survived this long only because the post-World War II period was a unique time -- the rest of the world was either undeveloped or destroyed. American companies thought they were smart; in fact, they were lucky. Now the world has changed, and the old way isn't nearly good enough.<p>Q: And the new way? After a brutal reengineering, survivors are somehow supposed to work together better than ever. I can see why people might be grateful to have jobs, but I can't imagine they'd have enough trust left to buy into team play.<p>A: It's a real conundrum. Reengineering produces an environment of autonomous professionals. But the experience itself is top-down authoritarian. It's like the Bible: You have to go through the desert to get to the promised land.<p>Q: It's interesting to hear you mention the Bible. You were raised in a traditional Jewish family and attended a yeshiva -- your training was to cherish values that last. Does the Bible support your new position as the apostle of radical change?<p>A: I say this with a straight face: The story of the Exodus is one of the most insightful examples of change management I've ever encountered. What's required for change? A wedge and a magnet: A wedge to get you off your chair, a magnet to lure you somewhere else. The wedge was the pharaoh and his army; the magnet was Moses and his vision.<p>Q: Any other lessons?<p>A: The leader can't take his eye off the ball. As soon as Moses goes up Mount Sinai to get the Ten Commandments, orgy and debauchery begin in the base camp. And look at how the Israelites change their view of manna. At first, they're thrilled that God has given them this food. Later they tell Moses, "We're tired of manna. We remember the fleshpots of Egypt, the fish, the cabbage, the onions. We want to go back." People focus on the pain of the present and the joy of the past. They forget about the pain of the past and the joy of the present.<p>Q: But I have trouble locating the joy in the present -- or at the end -- for many people touched by reengineering. What middle manager wants to lead the way to a promised land he won't reach himself?<p>A:This is where the analogy breaks down. Reengineering is a revolution of the top and bottom against the middle. Those who lose are administrators who no longer have professional skills or the talent to be leaders.<p>Q: And what do you say to such people, who will be vaporized by reengineering?<p>A: Get back in touch with the work you did that got you promoted. Or become an entrepreneur, although managers have abysmal records as entrepreneurs.<p>Q: So much of this depends on technology. Is anything coming that'll speed reengineering even more?<p>A: The most important technology has been around for a while -- electronic data interchange. EDI allows data to flow in an organized way from one computer system to another. Procter & Gamble can dial up Wal-Mart, for example, see what's been sold, and adjust production accordingly.<p>Q: That's a vision based on a profoundly un-American idea: sharing.<p>A: Sharing and trust are absolutely required. But I'm preaching enlightened self-interest -- not affection and mutual regard.<p>Q: Speaking of mutual regard, or lack of it, what induced the Clinton people to call you? The number-one priority in Washington is job preservation.<p>A: I was asked to give some input to Al Gore on the "reinventing government" effort last year. I spent some time with his staff, and spoke at a summit last year where they were talking about reengineering the U.S. government. It was ... an interesting experience.<p>Q: That's usually a euphemism.<p>A: Yes and no. I suspect a lot of people at the summit were looking for jobs with the administration, which made them very sycophantic. I could be more blunt: I told the Gore people that following through on their initiative was the single most important thing they could do on the domestic front.<p>Q: How so?<p>A: The president doesn't really create jobs; Alan Greenspan has a lot more say there. But if a president could improve the government's performance it would cause a ripple effect -- private-sector companies are often constrained by the complexity of dealing with the government. And a reengineered government could reconnect to the culture. Americans treat government as a joke. But if government were seen as efficient, it would reduce our cynicism.<p>Q: So what's happened since that speech?<p>A: At the time I said the real test would be if the Gore initiative were still in the papers in six months. Well, six months have passed and it isn't. And that's troubling. This requires so much energy. I see some commitment, but it really must be pushed from the top.<p>Q: Some people would say you advocate violating the social contract between management and labor. In Europe, you gave a talk so blistering that some listeners described you as a terrorist bent on kneecapping workers. Given your increasingly high profile, do you ever worry that someone who's been reengineered out of a job will come looking for you?<p>A: My wife does. I don't. Look, I didn't invent reengineering. It was already happening. All I did was clarify and accelerate it.<p><p><p>

						<p>By Manjeet Kripalani<p>Virginia Kamsky is one of the original Western entrepreneurs in China. Now 40, she's been running her own consulting company from Beijing and New York since 1980. Curious, then, that pioneer Kamsky is advising caution just as other investors pile into China -- and just as she launches her own China fund this summer.<p>But Kamsky's new venture, a joint effort with Oppenheimer and Odyssey Partners, isn't like most of the 60-plus funds playing this fashionable market. Big Zhonghua Investment Management Partners -- it'll likely have raised over $200 million by year-end -- will invest directly in the nonpublic Chinese companies that dominate China's infant consumer-products industry. For instance, ZIM already has a controlling interest in a Shanghai ink factory that has a 25 percent market share in China.<p>The soft-spoken Kamsky says she's wary of the publicly traded Chinese and Hong Kong companies favored by other China funds: She believes that market is still too hot, despite a recent 33 percent drop in many issues. Direct investment, she hopes, will more reliably match the stellar past returns of funds that are now hurting.<p>Does Kamsky, who stuck it out in China through the horrors of Tiananmen Square, feel vindicated by the recent flood of Western money into the country? Well, partly. But mostly it makes her nervous. "Investors are not looking at the underlying economics," she says. "They want to be in China at any cost."<p>Kamsky says her goal is to stay in China long term, "not expatriate out dollars on a short-term basis." It's an aim for which she has the perfect resume. At 26, Kamsky started to sell advice on China to U.S. companies. Kamsky Associates was among the first U.S. companies to open shop in China. During the Tiananmen Square crisis, her office stayed open round the clock -- but she saw Western money retreat anyway.<p>And return. "Until 18 months ago, the planes flying in and out of Beijing were virtually empty," says Kamsky. "Today, you can't get a ticket." So what's her pick for the next great opportunity in China? "A chocolate company. The Chinese are crazy about chocolate."<p><p>

						Michael Prozumenshikov was known as the Mad Russian - nothing would stand in the way of the success he dreamed about. Then he met a madder Russian.<p>By Jeffrey Taylor<p>If his murderer's account can be trusted, Michael Prozumenshikov, a top-producing stockbroker for Prudential-Bache Securities, died at night on the frozen surface of Lake Minnetonka, his screams muffled by howling northern winds. The cause of death, police suspect, was a gunshot wound to the head, though it was impossible to establish this conclusively. Prozumenshikov's head and hands were never found. The rest of his body was discovered at a Christmas-tree dump in the Minnesota countryside, hacked to pieces. <p>It was a brutal and unlikely end to an equally improbable career. Prozumenshikov had bootstrapped himself up from a destitute childhood in Russia to the pinnacle of the U.S. securities business. He was one of Prudential's top 90 brokers nationwide and a key man in the firm's expansion into the affluent bedroom communities west of Minneapolis. Before joining Prudential, he had distinguished himself at Merrill Lynch and Drexel Burnham Lambert. His client list contained nearly 500 names, including wealthy Minneapolis businessmen and such local celebrities as Minnesota Vikings stars Scott Studwell and Tommy Kramer.<p>But there was a dark side to his success. Known to many of his colleagues as the Mad Russian, a nickname he loathed, Prozumenshikov harbored an almost pathological drive to get rich. Nothing stood in his way - especially not ethics. Though he generated huge commissions throughout his career, he also gained a reputation for playing fast and loose: He churned accounts, traded on inside information, and pushed even elderly investors into risky, highly leveraged trades. He soon gained a reputation in the tightly knit Russian community as someone who would take advantage of his fellow immigrants if it meant getting ahead. <p>Prozumenshikov shrugged off the criticism; he'd say his old friends were jealous of his lavish lifestyle. He drove a Mercedes-Benz, regularly ate at expensive restaurants, and lived in a palatial home in one of Minneapolis's poshest suburbs. He seemed incapable of self-doubt. If he liked a stock at all, for instance, he loved it unconditionally - even if circumstances called for something less than unqualified endorsement. "Clients are looking for someone who is forceful, who is convincing and has strong opinions," says Dean Hutton, one of Prozumenshikov's early bosses. "That's the way Michael was. He was absolutely sure of everything."<p><p>The drive that made Michael Prozumenshikov a star resulted from a childhood of deprivation in Leningrad that his bosses could scarcely comprehend. In Russia, the Prozumenshikov family shared a six-bedroom apartment with 28 other people. Everyone used a single bathroom and prepared meals in the same small kitchen. There was no hot water, and the cold water that ran out of the taps looked like tea. Until he was 17, Michael, an only child, slept in the same bedroom as his parents.<p>In school, he was a hard worker. He also excelled at sports, and though he'd shown little aptitude for science, his athletic skills helped him win admission to the First Leningrad Medical Institute - the city's best - where he studied to become a dentist. After earning his degree, he took a position in a Leningrad clinic. In 1977, he and his wife, Ellen, whom he'd met at dental school, decided to leave for the U.S.; this was made possible by the Helsinki Accords, which liberalized emigration policies for Soviet Jews. The couple decided to settle in Minneapolis, near Ellen's older brother.<p>For seven years Prozumenshikov tried to win accreditation as a dentist in the U.S. while Ellen worked as a dental hygienist. By 1984, he quit in frustration and, at the urging of a friend, began to teach himself about the stock market. In 1984, he landed a job at a small local brokerage firm and, within a few months, parlayed that position into a job at <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>, the nation's biggest brokerage firm. "One thing was obvious," says Dennis Kellner, the Merrill Lynch sales manager who hired him. "This was a guy who needed to succeed - a guy who had been successful in obtaining some goals while in Russia but had to give that up and really had a burning need to regain what he had lost." <p>Prozumenshikov had all the makings of a good broker. He was a natural salesman and a hard worker. Most importantly, the tough streets of Leningrad had fitted him with not only a strong belief in his own personal superiority, but also an intense desire to prove it every day. "This business beats you up so bad that if you have low self-esteem, you internalize it," says John Kelly, another sales manager for Merrill Lynch. "Once you internalize it, it eats up your gut and you start thinking it's your fault. People with high self-esteem let it bounce off. They'll just say: 'It's too bad. That guy's not going to have a chance to work with me.'"<p>No account was too small for Prozumenshikov. He networked tirelessly among the Russian community, but he didn't content himself with merely being a broker to his countrymen. His dream was to fill his client list with rich Americans. Despite his limited command of English, he wasn't afraid to phone prospective clients, whose names he got from lists of known stock market investors, internal corporate directories, or just out of the phone book. "Other brokers would say, 'Gee, I couldn't call that guy. He's the chairman of <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a>,'" a former colleague says. "But it didn't bother Michael." <p>Prozumenshikov routinely worked weekends, when he could reach prospects at home. Another method was waiting until 5 p.m. to call a businessman at his office; by then the secretary would be gone and the man was likely to pick up the phone himself. Prozumenshikov's pitch when cold calling was simple and direct. "Hello," he would say. "This is Michael Prozumenshikov of the investment firm Merrill Lynch" - or, as he pronounced it, May-rill Leench - "I'm calling because I'd appreciate the opportunity to make more money for you." Few people flatly refused the offer.<p>When he made a sale, he told his friends, he felt an exhilaration like nothing he could name, a wave of wonder and excitement that he, a Russian, was becoming a successful capitalist. His ambition drove him toward a single, overriding goal: He wanted to be rich. He grossed $200,000 in commissions during his first full year at Merrill Lynch, taking for himself about $75,000 of that total. Midway through his second year, he was already among the top ranks of Merrill's brokers nationally. But his boss, Kellner, was growing worried. Most new brokers at Merrill Lynch generated annual commissions worth about 1.5 percent of the total assets their clients invested at the firm. In a broker's second year, the pace of trading was expected to slow. Prozumenshikov, by contrast, brought in commissions worth 5 percent of assets during his first year and continued to generate far more than the norm in his second year. He once told another broker that it was his habit to do $2,000 worth of stock transactions every morning, whether market conditions justified them or not. Merrill had computer programs that culled trading records and spit out warnings when a broker's trading became too active; to Kellner's dismay, Prozumenshikov was lighting up the warning system like a pinball machine.<p>Among his colleagues, Prozumenshikov's sales exploits inspired both admiration and envy; it was at Merrill that he was first nicknamed the Mad Russian. Some colleagues sniffed at his raw aggression, suggesting that his approach might be better suited to the used-car business. But Prozumenshikov's formidable sales skills were in high demand. In 1986, he received a generous offer from Drexel Burnham Lambert. Drexel, flush with profits from Michael Milken's junk-bond operation, was looking to put together a brokerage network to rival national firms such as Merrill Lynch. Drexel paid him a $100,000 signing bonus and a 50 percent cut of the gross commissions he brought in during his first year at the firm (35 percent to 40 percent is the norm).<p>The three years that Prozumenshikov spent at Drexel Burnham Lambert made his career. They coincided with the greatest bull market in Wall Street's history, a happy accident that would help Prozumenshikov reap material rewards beyond the wildest fantasies of his youth.<p><p>Zachary Persitz, one of Michael Prozumenshikov's many Russian clients, had always known that his heart held many secrets he couldn't share with others. Julia, his wife, understood, and she accepted it. "He would have this calm time sometimes, when he would be very quiet," she says. "It was his way." It was, perhaps, a purging process that relieved Persitz's daily pain and salved the many wounds left over from his unhappy childhood in Russia.<p>Many parallels ran between the Persitz and Prozumenshikov families. Both families had emigrated from Leningrad to Minneapolis in the late '70s. Both had two sons, and the eldest in each family was named Daniel. The two Daniels were best friends. Daniel Persitz, who was tall for his age, became known as Danny Big, and Daniel Prozumenshikov, thinner and shorter, was Danny Little.<p>When it came to finances, the parallels ended. As Prozumenshikov reaped a six-figure income, Zachary Persitz held a modestly paying state job as a hydroelectrical engineer. Prozumenshikov used the couples' friendship, and their affinity as fellow Russians, to persuade Persitz to turn over his family's savings. As Persitz remembers it, Prozumenshikov promised to make the Persitz family's money grow at a rate of 18 percent a year without any risk - a guarantee that, if it was offered, violated both Drexel's rules and Minnesota's fraud statute.<p>Before he turned over his savings to Prozumenshikov, his wife says, Persitz had never cared much about money. But he was a compulsive organizer and list maker. When he bought a dog for his kids, he spent weeks studying different breeds. On family vacations, he would carefully map out each day's schedule in advance. And so, once he turned over his family money to his friend, Prozumenshikov became the primary target of Persitz's obsessive streak. He had an annoying habit of phoning Mica Duncan, Prozumenshikov's sales assistant at Drexel Burnham, and demanding that she calculate the balance of his account to the penny. Although she was busy, Duncan would dutifully perform the necessary calculations and phone Persitz back. "Pretty close," he would say. "You're only off by three bucks."<p>Persitz invested $100,000 with Prozumenshikov - most of it from a legal settlement his wife won after a car crash, the rest his mother's money. Prozumenshikov sank $48,000 of it into stock in Texas Air, airline executive Frank Lorenzo's then-vibrant company. Almost immediately after Persitz bought it, the stock's price sank. Unperturbed, Prozumenshikov, who said he was acting on insider information, put $21,000 more of the Persitz family's money into Texas Air, a commitment that made Zachary Persitz uneasy. "I knew from the newspapers that Texas Air was experiencing problems between the owner, Frank Lorenzo, and the unions," Persitz says. "I told Michael I don't particularly like this kind of investment because I don't think it's conservative. He told me that it is conservative and that he has some kind of inside information that this stock would do real well soon."<p>Persitz began to hear stories about his friend that only added to his anxieties. There was talk that Prozumenshikov promised returns he couldn't deliver. It was being said that he had bilked elderly people out of their retirement savings. From time to time, Persitz asked Prozumenshikov about the rumors he was hearing from other immigrants. Prozumenshikov dismissed the talk as nonsense. "Don't worry," he would say. "These people don't understand the market." Rather than calm Persitz down, the airy disclaimers only made him worry that Prozumenshikov was as indifferent to the Persitz account as he seemed to be about the earnings of his other clients.<p>For his part, Prozumenshikov thought Persitz's obsessiveness was just an extreme example of a trait common among his Russian clients. Many of them, he concluded, naively believed that the stock market was a one-way elevator to riches. They wanted only gains, he groused to his colleagues, and they were too bitter about the losses. Then came Black Monday, the stock market crash of 1987. Persitz suffered huge losses. But it wasn't just the money that bothered him. When Persitz tried to reach his broker that day, Prozumenshikov was on the phone with someone else and waved off the call. The snub roused Persitz's suspicions. Busy indeed, Persitz thought - probably busy protecting his own stock holdings while allowing Persitz and other clients to hang.<p>After the crash, the already strained friendship between the two men effectively ended. Persitz's account, heavily leveraged because he had withdrawn cash to pay for a new house and car, was devastated. His $69,000 Texas Air investment was now worth only $22,500. And in a period of four months, Persitz would receive margin calls demanding $10,000, $8,900, $6,300, and $4,000 to avoid forced sales of Texas Air and other devalued stocks from his account.<p>Because of the close bond between their wives and sons, the two men couldn't simply wash their hands of each other. Nonetheless, their relationship was hardly cordial. They could be outwardly pleasant to each other, but as the months passed and Texas Air failed to rebound, Persitz's anger only deepened. Persitz constantly phoned the broker to challenge his judgment, to provoke and rebuke him, to hiss at him about his failings. "Their conversations," says Mica Duncan, "would get very hostile. Michael would get off the phone and say, 'Zachary is so irrational.' He constantly wanted an accounting of what was going on, because Texas Air was down."<p>At social events with the Prozumenshikovs, Persitz was uncommunicative. He brooded through dinners, hoping to make Prozumenshikov feel uncomfortable. Sometimes Prozumenshikov caught Persitz glaring at him as their wives talked. Prozumenshikov, not a man to be intimidated, was unimpressed. Indeed, he went out of his way to tease Persitz, as on the occasion he noted that Persitz's constant worrying was giving him gray hair. Persitz just glared until his wife stepped into the awkward lull, smiled at her husband, and said, "I like gray-haired men." Later that same night, in the driveway outside the Prozumenshikov home, Prozumenshikov jibed Persitz again: "That car is a piece of shit," he said cheerfully, gesturing toward Persitz's beat-up old Mazda. "Why don't you buy a new one?"<p>Persitz stared at Prozumenshikov in disbelief. He and Julia were swimming in debt as it was. Prozumenshikov had to know they couldn't afford a new car. "You're right," Persitz said, not wanting to give Prozumenshikov the pleasure of seeing him rise to the taunt. "I guess I should."<p>"You son of a bitch," he said under his breath.<p><p>Brokerage firms are always looking for established brokers with big client lists to boost their commission earnings. By the same token, many good brokers are always looking around for a better deal. So by 1989, Prozumenshikov was ready to leave Drexel. The company, which had once symbolized the optimism of the Reagan boom, was now on the ropes - debt-ridden and vilified by a federal investigation of insider trading. In April of that year, Prudential-Bache offered Prozumenshikov a $240,000 bonus to help the company in its plan to expand into Minneapolis's well-heeled western suburbs.<p>Under the leadership of its chairman, George L. Ball - a man known for quirky, rambling memos, including one comparing his daughter's acne to troubles in investment banking - Pru-Bache had embarked on a sweeping program to lure top investment bankers, analysts, and stockbrokers. Ball had spent the '80s attempting to revolutionize the brokerage business. In 1981, when Prudential Insurance bought the Bache Halsey Stuart Shields brokerage group for $385 million, it created the nation's first "financial supermarket," a huge operation that brought together stock and bond brokerage with insurance and other financial services. By the time Michael Prozumenshikov signed on, Pru-Bache had become the nation's fourth-largest brokerage firm, with more than 7,000 stockbrokers and 17,000 employees overall.<p>Despite the steady growth, Pru-Bache had lost money in two of the past three years. What's more, Pru-Bache didn't always seem capable of controlling its brokers. In 1986, the firm had reached a landmark settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a case involving improper trading and fraud at two of its branch offices. The SEC, concluding that the abuses demonstrated "deficiencies in Prudential-Bache's supervisory procedures," ordered the firm to scrap its method of overseeing its 300 branch offices and come up with a new one. Despite this cleanup operation, newspapers continued to chronicle troubling examples of abuses by brokers at the firm. Among other things, Prudential's clients lost about $1 billion investing in ill-conceived oil and gas partnerships, which the firm marketed during the height of the 1980s oil-price bust. After the biggest multistate investigation of securities fraud in Wall Street's history, Prudential agreed to pay $371 million in restitution and fines in 1993.<p>Not surprisingly, Prozumenshikov shrugged off his new company's problems. In letters to his clients, Prozumenshikov was upbeat: "Prudential-Bache is part of the Prudential network, $185 billion strong in assets," he wrote. "You will want to be associated with this rock solid, market wise firm as our valued customer."<p>Prozumenshikov's Pru-Bache signing bonus became the down payment on his largely self-designed dream home, an ultramodern mansion nestled in a suburban enclave that had once been a forest. This palace in the woods was a 15-minute drive along country roads to the Prudential-Bache office in the suburb of Wayzata. The branch occupied the ground floor of a three-story building of red brick and black granite and commanded a sweeping view of Lake Minnetonka.<p>Wayzata is a town full of mansions and old money; the executives of Minneapolis's biggest companies - Pillsbury, General Mills, Honeywell, Northwest Airlines, 3M, and others - live in the area. The local grocery store is called the Country Club Market. Amid this opulence, Prozumenshikov was hardly shy about showing off the symbols of his own success. A 24-karat gold bracelet dangled from his right wrist. On the left one, he wore a Rolex. On one plump finger, a large diamond glittered in a gold setting.<p>when the letter from prozumenshikov arrived asking Zachary Persitz to acquiesce in the transfer of his family's depleted brokerage accounts to Prudential-Bache Securities, Persitz was incredulous. "Thank you for your continued support," Prozumenshikov's letter said, "and most of all, thank you for your confidence." <p>But by now, Persitz had lost all confidence in his broker. The bulk of Persitz's remaining money was tied up in his 1,500-share stake of Texas Air. As he examined the business section of his newspaper on New Year's Day, 1990, Persitz noted that the stock had sunk further still. Texas Air was now trading for a pitiful $11.75 a share, and Persitz's original $69,000 investment was worth $17,625.<p>The two men still saw each other occasionally - their wives remained close - but among most of the Russian community, Prozumenshikov was persona non grata. At parties Persitz attended, other immigrants stung by the stock market crash called Prozumenshikov Michael the Ripper and openly discussed their hope that he would meet with an accident of some kind. Once, someone asked Persitz why he remained friends with "that bastard." Having long anticipated the question, Persitz had his answer ready. It was impossible to avoid Prozumenshikov, he said. The two families lived near one another, and their children were friends.<p>But Persitz had other motives. Maintaining relations with Prozumenshikov was part of a secret strategy for recovering his lost savings.  Persitz decided that Prozumenshikov was consciously misleading Russian investors. In the old country, a man trusted his friends, and most immigrants, in Persitz's view, had brought that bias with them - they assumed that other Russians would look out for their interests. When Prozumenshikov lost their money, Persitz felt, they couldn't just shrug it off. Friends didn't treat one another that way. In 1988, four Russian investors had unsuccessfully sued Prozumenshikov for restitution of trading losses. Persitz believed that lack of documentation defeated the complaint; all he had to do was get Prozumenshikov to sign an agreement verifying his verbal pledge to produce 18 percent yearly returns on Persitz's account. Then he could sue his onetime friend. He believed he was owed $200,000. <p>The plan was naive, to be sure, but Persitz clung to it, even as he was consumed with anger toward Prozumenshikov. Persitz began to see Prozumenshikov as a demonic presence, "bleeding me like a leech... holding me by the throat like I was dangling and all he needed to do was to let me go." <p>Prozumenshikov, for his part, was exasperated with Persitz. Old agreements, to Prozumenshikov's way of thinking, were irrelevant in the post-crash world. Investors had weathered the worst market cataclysm in history. Prozumenshikov had done what he could to minimize the damage in the Persitz account and position it advantageously for the future. Now he wished Persitz would leave him alone.<p>Through the spring of 1990, Persitz's physical condition began to mirror his mental deterioration. He dropped 20 pounds and suffered from abdominal pains. Never a sound sleeper, he was plagued with chronic insomnia. Many nights Julia found him downstairs, reading or simply staring into space as dawn approached, his hand resting on the family dog for comfort.<p>Whenever Persitz visited the Prozumenshikovs, he noted that Michael entertained with conspicuous extravagance. Original art, including a Miro print, lined the wall of his new house. A live-in nanny took care of the children. Meanwhile, the Persitzes could hardly pay the bills. Zachary brought home about $550 a week, Julia about $200. Their mortgage payment was $1,500, plus roughly $400 a month in property taxes. And soon the payment on the adjustable-rate mortgage would rise by $200 a month. They were using credit cards to pay the family's bills. Unlike Prozumenshikov, with his company-sponsored perk trips to posh resorts, the Persitzes hadn't been able to afford even a modest vacation for the past two years. When people asked why they didn't take holidays, Persitz lied, saying his work schedule didn't allow it.<p>Persitz's self-image as a capable and devoted family man was in tatters. He felt like a failure, he says, "as a parent, as a spouse, and as a son." Lately, he had even taken to refusing to answer the phone when he was home alone; it might be his mother, asking for some of her money. For this, he said later, "I hated myself." To his eternal shame, he had even taken $1,000 from the money his elder son was saving to buy a computer. "It was getting real bad," he says. "I just didn't know what to do." With his family income likely to remain more or less constant until he and Julia retired, there seemed to be no prospect that things would ever improve.<p>In January of 1991, Zachary and Julia attended a birthday party at Prozumenshikov's house for his younger son, Ariel. The party was really for the adults, who celebrated the birthdays of their children together as a matter of Russian custom. Persitz watched as Prozumenshikov circulated among the guests. When he saw the chance, he drew Prozumenshikov aside. For what seemed like the hundredth time, he asked Prozumenshikov for an agreement formalizing his financial commitment to the Persitz family. "I said, 'Let's go to your office so that you can write it and give it to me. It will take us five minutes,'" Persitz says. "He said, 'No, I can't. I'm with my guests. I'll mail it to you in a couple of days.'"<p>At work the following week, Persitz did everything he could to avoid leaving his office, anticipating that Prozumenshikov might call about the agreement. Each day at 5 p.m., he hurried home to check his mail. By Friday, no agreement had arrived, and Persitz knew at last what he had to do. Cool reason replaced the confusion in his brain.<p>The following Monday, January 28, was gloomy and cold. A light snow fell all day. At the end of the day, Persitz drove to Wayzata and parked outside the Prudential-Bache office. He sat in his car until he saw Prozumenshikov's black Mercedes glide out of the underground parking lot at 6:30 p.m. He opened his car door and stepped out. With one foot in the car and one in the snow of the street, he hailed Prozumenshikov with a wave of his hand. Prozumenshikov stopped his car and rolled down his window. Persitz hollered out to him, asking whether they could talk. "Sure," Prozumenshikov said, looking a little confused.<p>Persitz climbed back into his car and drove across the street to a parking lot abutting the frozen surface of Lake Minnetonka. Prozumenshikov followed, parked his car there, and stepped into Persitz's beat-up Mazda, leaving his wallet in a briefcase on the front seat of his own car.<p><p>On each day of the murder trial of Zachary Persitz, the Prozumenshikov and Persitz families arrayed themselves on opposite sides of the spectators' gallery. To impartial observers, they resembled guests at a wedding, bride's side to the left and groom's side to the right. But despite the awkward intimacy of the 36-seat gallery, the two sides never spoke. And neither Ellen Prozumenshikov nor Julia Persitz so much as nodded at each other. Once the best of friends, they hadn't spoken to one another since Persitz was arrested over two years before.<p>Each day at 9:30 a.m., the jury of nine women and three men filed into the courtroom, followed by Judge Robert Schiefelbein. When everyone was settled, two guards led Persitz himself into the courtroom through a rear door to the table he shared with his defense attorneys, Joe Friedberg and Paul Engh.<p>Persitz was charged with the premeditated murder of Michael Prozumenshikov. The first week of the four-week trial featured a devastating presentation of the state's evidence against Persitz. For starters, three employees of a car wash in St. Paul had identified Persitz as having hired them to clean blood out of his car trunk on the morning after Prozumenshikov's murder. In Persitz's house, police had found records attesting to the sorry state of his family finances at the time of the murder. They also found a receipt for a pair of handcuffs, purchased a month before the murder at a police-supply store. Scrawled in the margins of  Persitz's appointment calendar were a number of notations about handguns.<p>Persitz's lawyers tried to get the charges against their client reduced to manslaughter. They put him on the stand and had him confess to the killing. Persitz claimed that he had never planned to kill Prozumenshikov. All he wanted was to force Prozumenshikov to sign the agreement pledging to repay the Persitz family's losses.<p>Persitz admitted driving Prozumenshikov onto the frozen surface of Lake Minnetonka and forcing him to put on a pair of handcuffs. The real trouble, Persitz said, began after Prozumenshikov asked to have the handcuffs removed because he couldn't sign an agreement while wearing them. And at that point, rather than signing the agreement Persitz had prepared, Prozumenshikov declared that he had to "take a piss," Persitz testified.<p>The two of them climbed out of the car and urinated, not far from one another, on the frozen lake, Persitz said. Suddenly, Persitz said, Prozumenshikov began walking quickly toward his car, which was parked on the shore, about 300 yards away. Persitz jumped back into his own car and wheeled around to intercept Prozumenshikov. Prozumenshikov couldn't run in his flat-soled leather shoes. "He was like a duck on the ice," Persitz said in a dull monotone.<p>Standing only a few yards apart, the two men began shouting at one another, Persitz went on. "I was calling him a crook, different names," he said. "He was calling me a dirty Russian immigrant, you know, the same like everybody else, something like that. And he was shouting at me that I am just jealous of his success and stuff. And I told him that this is all bullshit because I never was jealous of him, I never would want to work like him, to do to people what he does. Anyway, the arguments were getting hotter and hotter. I sent him to hell; he sent me to hell."<p>As Persitz spoke, the weeping of Michael Prozumenshikov's mother, Ida, became audible from the spectators' gallery. <p>"We were shouting for another few minutes," Persitz continued, "and then at the very end he shout at me in Russian. He shouted at me - " Here Persitz broke off his testimony and, much louder, spoke a phrase in Russian. "It means," he continued in English, "I fuck you and fuck your family.<p>"And then what happened is that I was looking at him, I saw his lips moving and he was close, but I couldn't hear what he was saying. Everything was very quiet around me, and then I was feeling that my head hurts from the cold.<p>"I looked around me, and I didn't see Michael. I looked down and he was laying on the snow. And I had gun in my right hand, so I couldn't believe it. I bent down on my knees, and his body was all limp. He didn't breathe."<p>To the horror of everyone in the courtroom, Persitz even described using a hatchet to dismember Prozumenshikov's dead body - because, he said, he was afraid Prozumenshikov's ghost would return to haunt him. Persitz threw the broker's head and hands into a river, he said, in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent identification of the body. He told of the days that followed the killing, of disbelief, of weeping when Prozumenshikov's son Daniel came to stay at his house after the killing.<p>The jury found Zachary Persitz guilty of first-degree murder. After a second, shorter stage of the trial, in which psychiatrists for the state and the defense presented contradictory accounts of Persitz's mental health, the jury found Persitz accountable for his actions despite a plea of insanity. Judge Schiefelbein sentenced him to life in prison. <p>In July 1993, Persitz entered Stillwater Prison on the St. Croix River, five miles from where he dismembered Michael Prozumenshikov's body. From there he was transferred to Oak Park Heights, a maximum-security prison built into a hillside in rural Minnesota. Authorities use the facility to house the most violent of all criminals as well as those who are considered escape or suicide risks. <br>

Leave loved ones more than ever with Cristofani trusts<p>By Donald Jay Korn<p>Most people hate the notion that when they die, Uncle Sam may take more than half of the assets they leave behind. One of the best strategies for people to avoid draconian estate taxes (which can run as high as 55 percent) is to give assets to their heirs while they're alive. Taxpayers, however, are allowed to give away only $10,000 of assets per year to any one person. (Married couples can give away $20,000.) Above those limits gift taxes kick in, which can be as high as estate taxes.<p>In 1984, Maria Cristofani found a way to legally exceed the limits by more than 300 percent and pay no taxes. But taxpayers who want to use her strategy should act as soon as possible--the loophole probably won't stay open forever.<p>Cristofani, a widow with two children, Frank and Lillian, established a trust. She transferred real estate valued at $70,000 into it in 1984 and again in 1985. She did not file any gift-tax returns. The trust was set up with her children as the prime beneficiaries. At her death, the assets were to be split between the two children, who were twins. <p>Then Cristofani died. Her estate contended that there were seven trust beneficiaries--Frank, Lillian, and five grandchildren. The grandchildren, aged 2 through 11, were named secondary beneficiaries. If either Frank or Lillian failed to outlive Maria by 120 days, that child's children would split his or her share. Therefore, Maria was entitled to give $10,000 per year to each of them, and the $70,000 gifts incurred no gift tax.<p>The IRS demanded back taxes, arguing that the grandchildren were not bona fide gift recipients because their right to the trust fund was too contingent to be recognized. The IRS said that $20,000 could be excluded but the other $50,000 per year was subject to gift tax. <p>The tax court shot down the IRS argument. The court ruled that the grandchildren did have an interest in the trust; after each contribution, the trustees (Frank and Lillian) were required to give written notice to the beneficiaries (Frank, Lillian, and the five grandchildren). Then, each beneficiary had a 15-day period in which to withdraw up to $10,000 (called a Crummey power, after a landmark case). Thus, Maria Cristofani had been entitled to the $10,000 gift-tax exclusion for each grandchild and effectively transferred $140,000 in assets to her two children in two years, without owing gift tax.<p>This means that multiple-beneficiary trusts now can be used to expand the gift-tax exclusion. "Follow Cristofani as closely as possible," says David Rhine, tax partner and national director of estate planning for the accounting firm BDO Seidman. The key is that trust beneficiaries must have a real interest in the trust. "In Cristofani, there was a slim chance that the grandchildren could inherit the entire trust proceeds," says Rhine, "so there was a reason they would not exercise their Crummey power." <p>Future laws may limit use of the gift-tax exclusion or abolish Crummey powers. But gifts made before such a law is proposed or passed likely will be grandfathered.. So act soon if you want to make large, estate-reducing gifts. "The IRS has announced that it doesn't like the decision, but it won't appeal," says Gerald Morlitz, director of advanced estate planning for Cowan Financial Group in New York. "I use this technique to the greatest extent I can."<p><p>

Postnuptial agreements can help resolve disputes<p>By Mary Rowland<p>It's hardly a secret that money differences are a frequent source of conflict between married couples. But even worse than fights over money are the consequences when partners fail to openly address or deal with the issues involved. Long-simmering resentments can build up and undermine the foundation of a relationship.<p>Resolving disputes can be painful, but better to do so before they cripple a relationship --or lead to the even more painful process of a messy divorce. That's one of the concepts behind postnuptial agreements. At their best, these legal pacts between husband and wife can relieve tension and improve a marriage. If the marriage does end, they can make divorce less painful. In contrast to prenuptial agreements, postnuptial agreements also offer the opportunity to negotiate at a more mature stage in a relationship, when a couple's understanding of each other is probably more realistic than it is prior to marriage.<p>Experts who handle such agreements say that the same people who consider the idea a waste of time are often the ones who feel unfairly dealt with in a divorce. Divorce courts look at all the property acquired by the couple. Often assets one spouse thought were his or hers become marital property and get handed over to the other partner. "The divorce laws work if you perceive that each of you contributed equally to the marriage," says Helene Brezinsky, a partner at the New York law firm of Rosenman & Colin. "But if you have a festering issue that you have not made equal contributions, a postnuptial agreement is the only way to deal with it." <p>Here are some situations that might merit a postnuptial agreement: <p>--One partner comes into a large amount of money from his or her family. "I've seen so many occasions where the wife inherits some money and the husband thinks it should be his, too," Brezinsky says. "It becomes a constant area of dispute unless it is settled in writing." <p>--The family of one spouse is reluctant to include that person in a business because they fear the other spouse could then lay claim to some of the assets. "We have a case in our office where the husband's family runs a small accounting firm," Brezinsky says. "They want to make the husband a partner, but they first want an agreement that the wife will never be able to look at the company." <p>--Money conflicts sap the energy of both partners, and neither can focus on the other aspects of the relationship. "If money is your principal area of dispute, an agreement can be quite constructive," Brezinsky says. "I have drawn up agreements for couples who could not continue in the marriage unless they resolved the money issue. Usually one is a spender and one is a saver, and the saver cannot sit and watch the partner dissipate everything he or she has saved." One of Brezinsky's clients was a serious art collector who poured much time and energy into her collection. She wanted an agreement detailing the artwork that she had collected and stating that it belonged to her. "It was her passion, and she was killing herself to acquire it," Brezinsky says. "She couldn't feel comfortable until she had this piece of paper acknowledging that it was hers." <p>--The relationship is poor--or over--but divorce is not the right solution at the moment. For example, Violet Woodhouse, a divorce lawyer and financial planner in Costa Mesa, California, represents a retired man in his 60s who is separated from his 40-year-old wife. They have a 10-year-old son. He came in for a divorce. But the potential financial impact caused them to reconsider. She earns $75,000; he earns $16,000 in pension income. She relies on his excellent medical plan. If they divorced, she would be forced to pay alimony. And she would lose access to the health plan. The two decided on a postnuptial agreement that retitled their rental properties so each controlled a portion of them, allow the wife to remain on her husband's insurance plan, and made financial arrangements for their son's college education.<p>--One or both partners have mixed assets together--or "commingled" them--when that was not their intention. "If you have separate property and you keep it separate and the spouse has no involvement in it, that's fine," says Renee Schwartz, a partner at Kronish, Lieb, Weiner & Hellman in New York. "But if you invest it in a condo with your spouse, without an agreement, that probably will turn it into joint property." Consider the case of a financial planner in California who received a large inheritance from her grandmother. She happily used a big chunk of it to make a down payment on the family home, assuming that her husband knew that "it was really my money." As she began to specialize in divorce work, she learned that money that is commingled becomes marital property. Assets that one spouse brings into the marriage--inheritances, family property, a home, apartment, or investments--may be deemed marital property and split in half at divorce. The key is whether the assets remained totally separate property, in a separate account, or were jointly owned. In this planner's case, it was clear that she had mingled her inheritance with her husband's money. The planner bit the bullet and told her husband she wanted a postnuptial agreement. "It wasn't easy, and I won't say that he was thrilled," she said. "We had been married for 15 years already. It was a difficult process." But they eventually transferred ownership of the house so that they held it as tenants in common. <p>The rules for writing a postnuptial agreement are much the same as those for a prenup. It should be prepared well in advance of signing; each partner must disclose all assets and liabilities; each should be represented by an attorney; the agreement should detail the property to be transferred; and the agreement should be notarized. "You have to make sure there is no coercion or duress and that it is not unconscionable," Brezinsky says. "You must have a fair document, not something scribbed on a napkin at midnight." <p><p>

To the city's social elite, Teresa Rodriguez seemed to talk sense. Did she also talk them out of $30 million?<p>By Curtis Lang<p>Houston didn't invent the idea of making a killing at somebody else's expense. It's more like the idea invented Houston. The place was founded by 19th-century real estate promoters who touted its Calcutta-like climate to distant investors as "salubrious."In illustrations attendant on the pitch, Houston's endless flatlands became rolling hills, its murky bayou a rival to sweet Afton. Afterward came a long history of speculation in cotton, lumber, beef, and oil; later generations discovered the wonders of modern government as a source of capital and insurance. "It's almost like there is a unique brand of swamp gas rising from the Houston marshes that takes over the mind," says Houston historian Joe Feagin, "and makes you think if you can outfox somebody, you've got a right to do it."<p>To investors in this tradition, Maria Teresa Ramirez Rodriguez, a.k.a. the Toad Queen, seemed as shrewd a businesswoman as they come. Had a Barneys-suited banker from Wall Street appeared among the local gentry to pitch an opportunity for huge profits at no risk, the reaction would have been appropriate and sensible: Run the damn Yankee out of town. But Rodriguez was one of their own, a Texas farm girl with a barnyard vocabulary and impressive entrepreneurial credentials as proprietor of an large employment-contracting firm. When she meant excrement, she didn't say doo-doo, and in the macho world of Texas business she seemed to hold her own. Even her Wharton degree was down-home; it came from Wharton Junior College in Brazoria County, just south of Houston.<p>Best of all, she seemed to have a private pipeline to the most user-friendly financial institution around, the United States Treasury. When at benefit balls and parties she promised investors a return of 10 percent to 20 percent a month in money from government giveaways, her listeners listened. This was shrewd business for smart money, she explained, and more than that, it was payback: It seized on the opportunities that a spendthrift liberal Congress, with taxes extorted from the well-to-do, made available to minority-group contractors. She claimed to be one of those contractors, and to see it from the inside. <p>The rise and fall of the Toad Queen, an affectionate epithet Rodriguez owed to the precious gems she wore in frog-shaped settings, took less than two years. In that brief time, Rodriguez financed and promoted her own belated but highly visible debut into Houston society, persuading "several hundred" of its sturdiest pillars to entrust her with $50 million to $80 million secured by a promise and handshake. From the beginning, a single telephone call by any of the investors could have discredited Rodriguez's pitch. But no one made that call until the damage began to show. Today $30 million or more of investors' money is unaccounted for. The hunt for it involves lawyers, computers, and the murky territory of offshore banking. A federal grand jury is investigating the affair. Rodriguez is no longer talking to reporters. Her lawyer, Joel Androphy, says she is innocent of any charges that may be brought and will prevail in court, if it comes to that.<p>Teresa Rodriguez, the seventh of nine children, grew up on a farm near the hamlet of Danevang, Texas, some 70 miles southwest of Houston. By her own account, which relatives deny, her father was abusive. "I had a very cruel childhood," she told a reporter last year. "I tend to block it out now." She married in college and had two sons by the time she graduated. If Houston were another kind of place, she might never have found her way into the social circles where she did her best work. But Houston society rarely stoops to deny its rural and bourgeois origin; outside a tiny aristocracy, pedigrees are for stud horses and standing bulls. Rodriguez struggled hard to earn money and acceptance, and when she approached wealthy Houstonians with her investment proposal, she did so as a social equal. It didn't hurt that her second marriage, in 1991, was to a Houston police officer. He was Captain Dale Brown, latest in a long line of local society cops, the man to see about hiring off-duty officers to escort and guard important weddings, receptions, funerals, parties, and other occasions. She met him at a benefit ball.<p>Betty Shindler and her husband, Jim, were particularly sympathetic to Rodriguez's struggle to find a place among Houston's upper crust. Jim Shindler worked hard for his money in 30 years as a real estate broker and developer; Betty grew up middle class in Crockett, in the piney woods of East Texas. In Houston, she devoted remarkable energy to volunteer work for the ballet, the Mental Health Association, the March of Dimes, and others. <p>In 1991, Betty became president of the Textiles and Costume Institute, a division of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts. Part of the job was fund-raising, and while soliciting major-gift prospects, Betty phoned Teresa Rodriguez, whom she knew by reputation as a successful businesswoman but had never met. Rodriguez responded immediately with a $2,500 check.<p>That fall, at a black-tie opening of a new Costume and Textile Institute exhibit, Betty sought out Rodriguez to thank her for the gift. Short, stocky, in her mid-40s, Rodriguez relied on her jewelry to exude a visual aura, and it worked. She was "swimming in jewelry," Shindler says approvingly. The two women hit it off. "She is so personable, very warm," Betty says. "Very funny, a little bawdy.... You just kind of disregard the four-letter words, or you laugh. She's one of the few women I thought could get away with it."<p>Shindler's and Rodriguez's paths crossed again in the spring of 1992. Shindler, chairwoman of the Women of Distinction Winter Ball sponsored by the Houston Post, sold her first $10,000 table to Rodriguez. Later, she invited Rodriguez to lunch at the River Oaks Country Club, second only to the venerable Houston Country Club in local social standing. At lunch, Rodriguez made the pitch.<p>This is Rodriguez's story as Shindler tells it. (Through her lawyer, Rodriguez declined repeated interview requests from Worth.) Because of its status as a minority-owned business, Rodriguez said, her employment-contracting firm was able to exploit Small Business Administration pork barrel. The SBA set aside money for contracts with minority-owned businesses. But qualified businesses often couldn't be found, and in other cases the businesses that landed the contracts couldn't handle the work. So, Rodriguez said, her company was able to step in, via an anonymous friend in Washington, and accept the jobs at tremendously inflated rates. She was landing these contracts as fast as she could expand her businesses to do the work, she said, and the contracts were so profitable that she could afford to pay investors 10 to 20 percent monthly to finance her business expansions.<p>Given the difficulties facing the real estate business since the latest Texas bust, Betty was receptive to fresh investment ideas. She brought Jim along to the next meeting with Rodriguez, a dinner at the club. Jim wondered why the lush program and Rodriguez's success in it had gone unnoticed by the press. Rodriguez said it had all been kept hush-hush since 1959 to avoid attracting unfavorable attention.<p>Rodriguez also dropped names, mentioning several well-known Houstonians who had invested and her friendships with Elyse Lanier, wife of Houston's well-connected mayor, and Charlie and Kittsie Thomas, then owners of the Houston Rockets basketball team. To the Shindlers, Rodriguez was clearly in the right loop. In December 1992, they claim in a civil suit, they gave her two checks for $100,000 each on a promise of a 15 percent monthly return, and in February 1993 a third $100,000 check. On the first $200,000 invested, Rodriguez paid the Shindlers $30,000 in January, February, and March of 1993. On their final $100,000 investment, the Shindlers got a payment of $15,000 in March. They did receive a check in April, but it bounced.<p>Still, Rodriguez was pulling in money elsewhere. She had made contact with Joanne King Herring Davis, a friend of the families of George Bush and of former Secretary of State James Baker III. The same month the Shindlers' checks bounced, Davis claims in her own suit, she gave Rodriguez $400,000.<p>The unusually attractive terms Rodriguez was offering made Davis uneasy. So did the fact that Rodriguez asked her not to indicate a payee on her check. But she went ahead. "I should have known that the Lord doesn't approve of things like this," Davis says. Yet it was the Lord's work that Davis was pursuing by investing with Rodriguez. Davis's family is assembling land for historic preservation projects on her ranch in Simonton, Texas, and Davis wanted to finance, among other things, the renovation and preservation of a 155-year-old Methodist church that she had acquired and moved to the ranch.<p>The church is a plain wood structure. The ranch house is less understated. Confederate flags adorn the wall, and gilded mirrors reflect crystal chandeliers and old masters. Davis, an honorary consul general of Pakistan, has an interest in the Middle East; a rocket launcher, a land mine, and automatic weapons--souvenirs of the Afghanistan war--decorate the den. Novelty extends to a bathroom where a visitor, to expose the commode, must know enough to lift the padding on what appears to be a Spanish throne.<p>"This friend of mine had been telling me about Teresa," Davis says. "She said she made something like $20,000 a month--a month!" Davis never received an interest payment, and her money has vanished.<p>Melba Held never moved in the same social circles as the Shindlers and Davis and didn't have the kind of money they did. But Held, a retired hairdresser in the blue-collar Houston suburb of Seabrook, did have friends, and together six of them raised $650,000 to invest with Rodriguez.<p>Though lower on the social scale than Houston's richest neighborhoods, Seabrook shares some of the same attitudes toward enterprise, government, and taxes. That made it receptive to Rodriguez's pitch. Held met Rodriguez through a man who seemed to be an agent of hers, Alvin Bebar, the friend of a friend Held knew from the Seabrook New Age Christian community. Bebar represented himself as a specialist in tax avoidance and offshore banking. (Later, the IRS would identify him as a member of the Pilot Connection Society, an antitax protest group whose founder has asserted that the IRS is a for-profit corporation and predicted two years ago that in October 1992 an insane George Bush would stage a military coup to keep power in the hands of "the 12 families who control the world.") Bebar invited Held and her friends to meet Rodriguez and hear her pitch at lunch in a fancy Houston restaurant. Bebar arrived with his wife in a limo. Rodriguez arrived in a chauffeured Mercedes with a bodyguard. Held was impressed. "She's got on a million in jewelry!" Held recalls thinking.<p>Held claims that her own piece of the investment pool amounted to $61,000, which she raised by selling her second home, her jewelry, and her beauty salon. At Bebar's request, Held says, she sent the money to the Royal Trust Bank on the Isle of Man. She says Bebar told her she could reclaim her money any time she needed it. Soon enough she did need it--her doctor advised knee surgery, and her insurance had lapsed. So she told Bebar that she needed her capital. She never got it; to get the operation she had to wait two months until she was old enough to qualify for Medicare.<p><p>Perhaps it would have made a difference to her investors to know that Teresa Rodriguez owed the Internal Revenue Service more than a million dollars.<p>Rodriguez got her start in business in the early 1980s as an executive secretary at a petroleum geology firm in Houston. Her boss there, a socially prominent man named William Laws, helped Rodriguez start her own business, T.R. Financial Services U.S.A., which offered computerized accounting to small-business clients. Laws directed some of Rodriguez's first clients to her.<p>In 1985, one of Rodriguez's clients offered her a partnership in StaffAll, an employment "leasing" company. StaffAll hired away clients' employees, taking on the accounting and administrative burdens of employing them, and then leased their services back to the clients for a fixed fee. In the economic turmoil of Texas in the late 1980s, StaffAll expanded rapidly and spun off companies involved in small-business computer systems, telemarketing, and temporary-employment services. Eventually, Rodriguez controlled some 60 companies under the name of TR Network Cos. The organization eventually claimed 650 clients and 52 employees of its own. In 1989, the local Hispanic Chamber of Commerce named Rodriguez Houston's Hispanic businesswoman of the year.<p>The next year, however, she landed in trouble with the IRS over nonpayment of payroll withholding taxes. The unpaid taxes alone totaled at least $1.2 million, and in early 1991 the IRS case officer recommended that some of the TR Network companies be liquidated to raise the cash.<p>But then the IRS set the matter aside. In March of 1991, the agency closed the case, stating in documents only that the money was "currently not collectable based on hardship," according to IRS documents. Teresa Rodriguez was still in business.<p>And she still was later that year, when Hispanic Business magazine, published in California, sent her a questionnaire about her company. Notwithstanding the IRS's recent finding about the financial status of TR Network, Rodriguez claimed annual revenues of $46.28 million for her company. The magazine didn't look into the numbers and ranked the business 43rd in its list of the top 500 Hispanic-owned businesses in the United States.<p>Her credibility was on the rise, and so, apparently, were her political connections. The magazine listing resulted in an invitation for Rodriguez to a large White House luncheon and reception for Hispanic businesspeople in July 1992. After the dinner, according to federal records, Rodriguez contributed $16,000 to George Bush's campaign, qualifying her for membership in the Eagle Club of major contributors.<p>Despite her business and political connections, a telephone call to the Small Business Administration in Washington would have revealed that no one named Teresa Rodriguez was registered as a minority contractor. No one named Teresa Rodriguez had ever received any SBA contracts.<p>The man who finally made the call was Ed Pankau, a colorful, locally famous private investigator who specializes in financial wheeling and dealing. When Rodriguez's check to the Shindlers bounced in April 1993, the Shindlers called on Pankau. Within 30 minutes, he says, a computer check of electronic databases turned up a number of red flags regarding Rodriguez: the IRS's tax liens, a bank's claim that it had made her a loan that turned bad, and several lawsuits.<p>The clincher came when Pankau called the Small Business Administration in Washington. The SBA had never heard of Rodriguez; neither she nor any of her business names were registered as minority contractors, and she had never received any contracts from the SBA. Pankau reported all this to the Shindlers and to an FBI man he had worked with previously.<p>In short order, Pankau says, a senior FBI special agent appeared in his office to ask "the Leona Helmsley questions: Did she knowingly do it, and did she flaunt it--that's the bottom line." Pankau's response: "The woman made Leona Helmsley look like a piker."<p><p>On April 23 1993, just two weeks after Joanne Davis's $400,000 expression of faith in Rodriguez, 13 IRS agents swarmed into Rodriguez's brand-new pseudo-French cum Federal-style townhouse. Rodriguez wasn't a hardship case anymore, according to what the IRS was hearing from Ed Pankau, and they were searching for auctionable assets. The agents found plenty to auction. The cataloging of it traces three generations of the French monarchy. The parlor suite was Louis XIV, other armchairs and sofas Louis XV and XVI. A 1920s Steinway grand dominated the grand salon, and an Aubusson lay on the floor.<p>Genteel shabby wasn't exactly the effect intended by faux-marble pilasters, moldings, baseboards, and door surrounds; Regency-style sconces; and an $11,000 crystal chandelier. Lest the point be missed, gold-leaf trim reiterated it. Items inside pantries and closets bore labels such as Waterford, Baccarat, Orrefors, Dom Perignon, Christofle, Wedgwood, Limoges, and Royal Albert. The spirit of Imelda Marcos presided in the wardrobes, with more than 100 pairs of shoes in felt-lined holders, 56 Judith Leiber handbags worth as much as $8,000 apiece, the usual mink and cashmere. Hundreds of pieces of jewelry with a total value of $2 million were found in wall safes. A single necklace contained 596 gems. Among the jewelry were Rodriguez's signature frogs. The IRS trucked all of it to a warehouse to await auction in early 1994.<p>Meanwhile, FBI agents raided Rodriguez's office, seizing her computers and 62 boxes of files. The complaint later filed with a federal grand jury in Houston would accuse her of operating a scam often known as a Ponzi scheme, named for an early 20th-century American swindler who attracted investors by paying big, fast returns to some investors with money taken from others. The FBI agents told her to go home. She did, only to encounter the IRS agents stripping her townhouse. Rodriguez was wearing an $18,000 bracelet. The agents took it.<p><p>Between april and december of 1992, the federal complaint says, Rodriguez had deposited $30 million in Houston bank accounts. That money remains missing, so far as can be determined. Ed Pankau believes the total she took from investors was much larger. Rodriguez's trustee in bankruptcy (she was placed in involuntary bankruptcy at the request of a number of her investors) declines to discuss the case. Pankau has offered to search for the money in return for 10 percent of what he recovers.<p>Houston gossip columnists continue to spill ink by the tankerful on the case. The auction of the Toad Queen's personal property promises to be the biggest social-financial event since John Connally's bankruptcy. Some investors could even try to recoup a modicum of their losses by bidding on bargains. Others might reflect along the lines suggested by Joanne Davis: "This was a nefarious scheme," she says, sitting in the living room of her ranch house, "and deep in my heart I knew it was. I knew it just wasn't right."<p>Curtis Lang wrote about investments in interactive technology in the September 1993 issue of Worth.

But unwed-partner plans come with complications<p>By Mary Rowland<p>Although the plans remain controversial, at least 100 employers now offer some form of "domestic partner" benefit plan for unmarried employees. Such plans have an obvious appeal for nontraditional families that wouldn't otherwise receive health insurance and other benefits under their employer's plan. They also appeal to employers who advocate liberal human-rights policies.<p>Yet for those who sign up, there are important tax and legal consequences to consider. Often, these create complications that are serious enough to stop potential participants from enrolling. Employers have also taken flak for instituting the plans in the first place. In December, a Texas county effectively blocked <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple Computer</b></a> from building an $80 million office complex. The reason: County residents objected to the morality of Apple's unwed-partner benefits plan. <p>Some companies offer benefits to both heterosexual and homosexual partners, while others include only homosexuals. "Employers who offer only same-sex coverage take the view that opposite-sex partners could get married if they chose," says Mark Wagoner, author of The Domestic Partner Sourcebook. <p>Employers normally require that partners show evidence that they have a permanent or ongoing relationship. A lease agreement, mortgage, or deed that the partners have cosigned might serve this purpose. So might auto- or life-insurance policies. "It might be as simple as having a joint checking or savings account," says Wagoner. Many employers also require domestic partners to sign an affidavit affirming the nature of their relationship. <p>Before enrolling, however, employees need to know two things. First, the benefits are taxable income to the employee because the Internal Revenue Service doesn't recognize such partners as dependents. Second, and perhaps more important, the signing of partnership affidavits that some employers require may have legal consequences, including giving partners rights to each other's property in the event the relationship ends. "One thing that has kept enrollments lower than anticipated is that once the partner has a signed affidavit in hand, he or she would have legal recourse if the relationship broke up," says Michael Bross, a consultant at the Wyatt Co., a benefits and compensation consulting firm. <p>How great are the risks? Each case should be decided on its own merits. Couples should assume that if they end the relationship, one partner may file a suit against the other, claiming a share of community assets. Some employees undoubtedly also worry about letting employers into their private lives, despite the fact that personnel information is required to be kept strictly confidential and discrimination is illegal, at least at larger companies.<p>Many employees who might qualify often decide not to participate. The University of Iowa has over 15,000 employees, but when it expanded benefits to cover nontraditional families, only 18 signed up. Of 3,300 U.S.-based workers at Lotus, only 15 or so have signed up. <p>A couple of domestic-partner plans have been in place since the early 1980s. But it wasn't until Lotus implemented such a plan in 1991, followed by Levi Strauss in 1992, that they began to receive serious attention. Today, a large percentage of domestic-partner benefit programs are at universities, city governments, and high-tech companies. Roughly half extend benefits only to gay partners; the other half include both gays and unmarried heterosexual partners.

						Darrell Zimmerman had a brilliant plan to beat the world's largest bond pit. It was a wild shot, and it worked...<p>
By Ted C. Fishman<p>
The ninth time Darrell Zimmerman went broke trading futures, he decided not to tell his wife. Lisa never took such news well. Once, she knocked him to the ground and pummeled his chest with her fists--right in front of other traders. Lisa also had been tense lately, ever since they'd had to sell their car to pay the rent. So Darrell was relieved that she'd been out that night and hadn't heard anything about his kamikaze trading. The next day, on his way to get the newspaper, he figured he'd just pull out the business section and maybe Lisa would never have to know. But there was his story on the front page, below a headline that bellowed: wild bond spree jolts chicago board of trade. <p>
That made two plans that week that didn't turn out the way Zimmerman had hoped. <p>
On October 22, 1992, he had walked onto the floor of the world's largest futures exchange with an incredibly bold plan, one he had spent most of the summer concocting. With only a bad check for $50,000 in his trading account, he would execute a rapid-fire series of trades in hopes of controlling the action in the huge Treasury-bond pit. His goal was to orchestrate a panic. But it was supposed to be a controlled panic. If the other traders played into his hands, he would become a very rich man. He needed only about 15 minutes.<p>
Zimmerman launched his attack at 7:25 a.m. For the first few minutes, the market went crazy, and just as he predicted, the momentum in the pit swung in his favor. At one point, he controlled enough contracts to leverage $3.6 billion in bonds. His profit climbed toward $5 million.<p>
But Zimmerman did not get rich that day. Instead, he lost control. By 7:40 a.m. security guards were hauling him off the trading floor, leaving mass confusion behind. By the time order returned to the pits, Zimmerman's actions had ruined an old-line trading firm, Lee B. Stern & Co., raised serious doubts about the Board of Trade's markets, and changed forever the way business at the nation's securities exchanges is done. The episode remains one of the most controversial--and least understood--to take place on the floor of a major U.S. exchange.<p>
Darrell Zimmerman is now on the lam. I found him in Vancouver, British Columbia, beyond the reach of the federal authorities who indicted him last summer. He still doesn't quite understand why the Board of Trade, the press, and the FBI made such a fuss over his trading. As he sees it, he was just doing what everyone in the pits dreams about--taking as much money from the next guy as possible. <p>
Every trader fantasizes about taking a wild shot and retiring. In Chicago, the dream is called the "O'Hare spread." The idea is to put on an insanely large position and head to the airport. If at the end of the day the position makes money, you head to Hawaii; if it loses, it's off to South America. Zimmerman's plan didn't work out quite that way.<p>
For seven years he shuttled back and forth between Chicago's two big trading floors--the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange--convincing people to stake him and then losing ever-larger sums. One of his former bosses still has what he calls "Darrell Zimmerman nightmares." Yet, because trading firms do not have to pass information about their former traders to competitors, he was repeatedly able to resurface on the trading floors.<p>
Zimmerman had a gift for talking people into giving him money. He exuded the enthusiasm many salesmen spend lifetimes trying to perfect. He seemed manic and easygoing at the same time. Asked why so many people had a hard time saying no to her husband, Lisa says it's "because he's so good looking. That smile and those eyes had an effect on them." I traded against Zimmerman in the pits of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for five years. He was a fascinating combination of skill, guts, and whim, a lightning-quick trader who refused to let the markets discipline him, a guy other traders bad-mouthed and envied. <p>
"I did in the bond pit what every trader dreams about," Zimmerman says. "You spend half of every day thinking about what would happen if you could trade large enough to move a market by yourself, to play like the big firms and banks do. I had everyone in the pit coming to me. I was the market. The exchanges just don't want to admit the market can be controlled by one guy, especially by someone like me, but I proved it can. Almost."<p>
The chicago board of trade is housed in a grand limestone building that sits like a huge armchair at the dead end of LaSalle Street, the epicenter of Chicago's financial district. The first contracts traded on the exchange 130 years ago allowed farmers, grain processors, and merchants to establish prices for commodities months in advance of their actual shipment, helping to insulate producers and commercial users from the risk of price swings and transferring much of that risk to professional speculators.<p>
In the 1970s, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange--the Board of Trade's longtime rival--began trading futures on foreign currencies. That stimulated an explosion in contracts on stock indexes, bonds, and other financial instruments. A decade later, the transformation was complete: Financial pits outnumbered agricultural pits in Chicago. For a few years inefficiencies in the markets made trading lucrative and not terribly difficult. Chicago became a magnet for traders, most of them young men, just out of school, accustomed to minimum-wage jobs. With a few thousand dollars anyone could leverage millions in the pits. Some became very wealthy; others arrived with big bank accounts and ran them dry.<p>
The lure of easy riches is what attracted Darrell Zimmerman. When he arrived in Chicago from Vancouver, where he grew up, Zimmerman was wearing the only suit he owned. He carried a change of clothes in his small bag and had $200 in his pocket. He'd moved to Chicago on the vague promise of a job from the CCJ Group, a retail trading firm with offices in the Board of Trade. Zimmerman thought a firm with a fancy-sounding name like that must be important, so he was dismayed when he actually visited CCJ's shabby, overcrowded offices. "I was greeted by one of the brokers, Jeff Sherman," Zimmerman says. "He cracked up. Me, my bag in hand, straight from the airport, was the funniest thing he'd ever seen." There was no job, but Sherman took pity on the greenhorn trader and invited Zimmerman to stay with him for a while.<p>
Sherman lived in DePaul, a recently gentrified neighborhood on Chicago's North Side. He was only 23, and Zimmerman, who had never been able to afford his own place, was awestruck. Sherman had all new furniture, a giant-screen TV, and a huge stereo. "He told me what he had was nothing compared to some of his friends with condos on the lake and sports cars," says Zimmerman. "I thought I died and went to heaven." <p>
Zimmerman stayed on Sherman's couch for two weeks before moving into a flophouse to make room for his host's girlfriend. But he had made inroads into the Chicago Board of Trade, landing there as a clerk, a mostly menial job that is most traders' entree to the floor. Zimmerman's clerkship lasted only two weeks. One night he met a young trader who was also a recruiter for a rapidly emerging firm, the Singer-Wenger Trading Co. He told Zimmerman to come by the next day to meet the boss. <p>
Norm Singer was closer to what Zimmerman had in mind when he thought of the romance of the trading floors. Singer, in his early 40s, was tall and tan, tailored, manicured, and pomaded. He wore a jeweled Rolex watch and ran his company from a large, marble-appointed office.<p>
Singer's success depended on keeping the expanding numbers of trading pits populated with his own people. He favored athletes. "He wanted people with stamina and an in-your-face attitude to make it in the pits," says Mitch Joseph, who started out at the firm when Zimmerman did and later became his best friend there. "Darrell was very good at tennis, skiing, and whatever else he tried. And he was very competitive."<p>
Singer told Zimmerman he would need $100,000 to trade on his own and then pledged to back him. All Zimmerman had to do first was perform well in the firm's mock-trading sessions. Up until then, Darrell Zimmerman had probably never struck anyone as particularly bright. He rarely sat still long enough to make an analysis of anything. That changed at the Singer-Wenger practice trading sessions, where he competed against others for fictitious trades and a job. The prices at the Board of Trade are quoted fractionally like stocks, and novices frequently bollix the fractional math. But Zimmerman could add, subtract, and multiply the fractions with unusual speed. He was hired to trade at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, known in the business as the Merc.<p>
"It was like Darrell was destined to trade," Joseph says.<p>
But Zimmerman was as much a born hustler as a born trader. For five years, he had worked the shady edges of the Vancouver futures business, but he concealed this fact from his new employers: Norm Singer liked his recruits to be green, figuring that people with trading experience would be resistant to his highly disciplined system. <p>
Singer-Wenger assigned Zimmerman to the enormous Standard and Poor's 500 Stock Price Index futures pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The S&P contract is one of the world's most actively traded. It allows speculators and hedgers to take large positions on the stock market without actually buying common stock. Zimmerman was one of 300 traders wedged into a steep circle of stairs. In his novel Ghost Waves, James McManus describes such a pit as looking like "a brawl in a gumball machine, just one manic orgy of moxie." Brokers and speculators traded tens of billions of dollars' worth of contracts daily, but Singer-Wenger limited its newer traders to two contracts at a time. "Usually the small traders in a pit are invisible," says Mitch Joseph, "but somehow Darrell soon had a reputation as being a little off the wall, a little bit on edge." Zimmerman mouthed off to bigger traders and picked fights over small trades. He also had problems staying within the firm's trading limits. "We'd have group meetings where Darrell was told the firm needed him to scale back," Joseph says. "He'd agree, but then he would double up his position. He was always getting stuck with bigger positions and lots of risk." <p>
Zimmerman managed to do well enough for Singer-Wenger to keep him on. After a while, the firm moved him to one of the Merc's slower pits: live-cattle futures options. He was instructed to stay in the pit at all times and to update prices by continually calling them out to the pit. Like other Singer-Wenger traders, he had to carry pages and pages of computer "cheat sheets," printouts that priced all the options in a pit. The firm's idea was to enforce a kind of disciplined stupidity that would prevent traders from making their own calls on the markets. Other traders referred to them as "sheet monkeys." That was not the respect Zimmerman hoped for from a trading career.<p>
Zimmerman was increasingly driven by the intensity of life in the pits. He thrived on the competition, especially in the cattle-options pit, which tends to attract less-capitalized traders, many dependent on every trade for survival. Tensions were always high, bickering and name-calling common. On slow days tirades could erupt over $10 transactions. One trader in the pit described his fantasy of a great day as "showing up and finding that all the other traders had died and I got their money."<p>
A frequent distraction for Zimmerman was his future wife, Lisa Tatkus, a broker's clerk in the S&P pit. Smitten by his good looks and energetic charm, Tatkus quickly became Zimmerman's constant companion off the floor. Reflecting back on the first years of their relationship, neither Zimmerman nor Tatkus recalls discussing any significant issues with each other, and they rarely talked trading. "All Darrell ever wanted was to have fun, and he was very good at it." Tatkus says. They got married after a trip to Canada in June of 1987. They hadn't exactly planned on it, but when U.S. border officials refused to let Zimmerman back into the States because he didn't have a work permit, he asked Lisa to marry him. "I realize now," she said recently, "he married me so he could trade."<p>
The couple had a violent fight before work on October 19, 1987, Black Monday, the stock market crash.  Lisa says she was angry at her husband because she thought his highly leveraged positions were too risky. For most of the morning, the cattle pits were calm as Zimmerman watched the quote boards on the exchange's walls flashing huge losses in the equity markets. Finally the crash spilled onto every market--the meats, the currencies, and the bonds joined the frenzy. Bets that the markets would drop in the form of put orders flooded the pit, as hedgers scrambled to protect themselves against a meltdown. In the middle of the panic, Lisa walked by and gave him the finger. Between his quarrel with Lisa and the terror sweeping the pits, Zimmerman could stay still no longer. Too much money was changing hands without him. Impulsively--partly to spite his wife, partly to show he wasn't afraid--Zimmerman sold 250 puts. Not only was this trade more than ten times larger than his firm allowed on a normal day, but it represented a bet that the market would go up. He lost $60,000 and his job. Lisa got fired, too. And yet Darrell remembers feeling an odd sense of calm. He may have lost big, but didn't that prove he was a big trader?<p>
The course of Zimmerman's career at Singer-Wenger would play itself out again and again at different firms over the next five years. He would convince someone to stake him in exchange for a share of his trading profits. He would begin by trading well--sometimes very well--for a period of time and then accumulate a position that either lost money or carried so much risk that Zimmerman was turned out. "We led a very uncertain life," says Tatkus. "We were always moving in and out of different apartments. I just never knew what was going to happen." One of Zimmerman's backers, who asked to be spared attribution "because Zimmerman's name is poison,offered a reason why traders like Zimmerman do well, then fail. "Going through the markets is like going through psychoanalysis," he said. "If you have any self-destructive tendencies, the market is going to find them and hit you with them." <p>
By 1988, trading the newer futures and options instruments was considerably more difficult than it had been just three years before when Zimmerman came to Chicago. Traders and customers were more sophisticated, inefficiencies were more easily spotted, and making money required much more risk. The lone-wolf traders, those who traded their own money for their own accounts, became scarce. Trading now required the latest and fastest computer analyses, sophisticated risk management, and an organization that could simultaneously work related markets on different exchanges. Many of the lone wolves joined broker groups to share the expertise and expenses needed to survive the markets. For Zimmerman, who hated the hard work of analyzing positions, trading groups made business increasingly difficult and less fun.<p>
He eventually landed with Steve Klee. Klee still cannot fathom why he didn't fire Zimmerman a lot sooner than he did. He thinks it has something to do with pity, or maybe that, against all his instincts, he just liked Zimmerman. "I felt so sorry for this guy, and I really wanted to help him," Klee told Board of Trade investigators. "I kept making agreements, and he'd sign these things: 'I will never do this,' 'I will never do that,' 'I will always do this.'" At one point, Klee even sent Zimmerman for a psychiatric evaluation.<p>
In April of 1989, Zimmerman, tired of Klee's parameters, decided to get out. Before he left, though, Zimmerman decided to make one last big play with Klee's money. "Darrell was supposed to be trading 50 [contracts at a time]  but he sold 900 calls, something we just never, ever, ever do," says Klee. "He kept 300 of them a secret. I remember being left with the feeling that not only had he completely violated the trading and risk parameters that we established   but that he had committed fraud of a sort." Fearing the fate of his firm hung in the balance, Klee liquidated Zimmerman's position himself and lost $50,000. Yet he still felt sorry for Zimmerman when he fired him. Klee invited Zimmerman to visit his office with Lisa so he could explain. "In the middle of the conversation, his wife got up out of her chair and beat the living hell out of him," Klee says. "He obviously told her a story that bore no resemblance to the facts."<p>
Zimmerman's reckless trading with his various bosses' money provided a semiregular source of income--and a regular source of jokes--for the other traders in the cattle-options pit. "We loved it," says a trader who made money off of Zimmerman's fumbles. The other traders began to refer to such episodes as a Darrell Day.<p>
Zimmerman's next partnership was with a trader named Paul Leventhal. It was lucrative at first. In 1989 Zimmerman's account made $250,000. He bought two cars--including a Mercedes--and lived in a deluxe duplex in the DePaul neighborhood. But the firm responsible for guaranteeing Zimmerman's trades, called a clearing corporation, was not confident his fortunes would last.<p>
A clearing corporation is a trader's lifeline to the pits. It performs the banking and bookkeeping necessary for traders to conduct their business. A clearing firm also guarantees the trades of all its trader clients. In return, it collects commissions on trades and interest on the money it lends traders for margin. "The biggest red flag for that risk is when a trader sells high numbers of puts and calls," says an officer of Hammer Trading, the firm that cleared for Leventhal and Zimmerman. "And he sold way more than we allow. We told him to go, but I still have Darrell Zimmerman nightmares." <p>
Hammer, which had a long-term clearing relationship with Leventhal, told him to lose Zimmerman or find another clearing firm, On his own again, Zimmerman moved to First Commercial Financial Group and opened an account with his own money. It was his inaugural outing as an independent trader. For the first year and a half, Zimmerman traded well. By December 1990, First Commercial put enough faith in the relationship to lend Zimmerman $65,000, half the cost of an options membership, or seat, at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Zimmerman paid the other half in cash. "I always measured my success by the dollar value of my account listed on my daily statement," Zimmerman says. "When I took the money out to buy my seat, it felt like I lost it."So Zimmerman began to trade even more furiously, accumulating large options positions. Shortly afterward, the gulf war hit, the commodity markets became volatile, and prices exploded upward.<p>
First Commercial watched Zimmerman's position swell against him and, deciding he was putting the firm on the line, forced him to liquidate on thousands of contracts, leaving a $150,000 loss. Selling his seat just 20 days after he bought it, Zimmerman owed the firm $70,000 and was barred from trading at the Merc.<p>
Paul Leventhal also lost big during the gulf war, but he still had enough cash to begin again in the options pits of the Board of Trade, where it cost less to trade. He asked Zimmerman to rejoin him. Although the Board of Trade is within blocks of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, no one bothered calling the Merc to check either Zimmerman or Leventhal out. Their new clearing firm paid for its inattention. Leventhal lost $400,000 when soybean options exploded on drought fears. He was finished as a trader. Unless Zimmerman found a new backer, he was kaput too.<p>
Desperate, Zimmerman convinced his father to take a $20,000 second mortgage and lost half that in a week. First Commercial, aware that Zimmerman was trading again and still owed $70,000, put a lien on the rest. Zimmerman was shut down. He and Lisa moved to a smaller apartment tucked between a large bakery and an expressway far from the trader hangouts. In July 1992, Darrell stopped payments on Lisa's Chevy Blazer with only two installments left. At the end of the month, Zimmerman reported<p>
this okay way to say it--that he reported it stolen? funny thing, i have a friend in chicago who was a trader and reported his mercedes stolen for similar reasons. he went to jail for six months. the Blazer stolen. <p>
While he shopped for new backers, Zimmerman killed time at the International Trading Institute, a training school for firm and institutional traders. ITI's lead instructor, Charles Cottle, thought Zimmerman could make better use of his talents and offered Zimmerman a deal. He'd take him "apart piece by piece, like a car, and build him back up again" with better habits. In return, Zimmerman could earn some money teaching beginner classes. ITI pushed strategies that required hard analytical work. The successful traders and promising prospects filing through ITI reminded Zimmerman how much he missed trading and how hard it would be to build up again. He began to fray. To the ITI staff, he seemed like an odd addition. <p>
The grunt work at ITI was done by six months of work without pay in exchange for the chance to take ITI's full $15,000 trading course. One day while Zimmerman was in the office, twolab techs lab techs, Mark Mason and Anthony Catalfo, asked why he wasn't trading. Both were East Coast rich kids in Chicago to turn small fortunes into big ones. Zimmerman figured that maybe he'd found his new backers. "We made a good fit," Zimmerman says, "I had experience and awareness of the floor, but I didn't have money. These guys were looking for experience and someone to teach them, and money was no problem for them." Zimmerman was back in business, this time with carte blanche to trade any way he pleased. <p>
Mason and Catalfo found the work at ITI demeaning and the instruction too conservative. While Mason did his job, Catalfo caused problems. In one class, Catalfo, assigned to show slides, left the projection booth to call the instructor an idiot. Like Zimmerman, Catalfo had no use for ITI's structured approach. He had his own scheme for making money on the floor. He spent most of his time at ITI testing it on the institute's computer simulator, Trade$tar. His idea was to take a large position in futures, either long or short, and load up on options in the same direction. A big enough position, he believed, would cause a market panic and make him a killing. "He got on Trade$tar<p>
Callendo Kshould we put that little R thing here as well "registered"/i don't know, i don't think so NO/ml. the first day and said he made a million dollars," Mason recalls, "but it was all just fooling around with the machine." ITI staffers told Catalfo to quit his experiments before the paying students got the wrong impression that the institute sanctioned that kind of trading. When Shelly Brown, an ITI instructor, heard Catalfo's scheme, he\ warned him, "They'll carry you out, either on a stretcher or in handcuffs."<p>
Zimmerman had been contemplating a similar play since he lost his father's money. Catalfo and Mason backed Zimmerman with $30,000, enough to get him back on the floor and trading. Zimmerman persuaded yet another firm, TransMarket Group, to clear for him and promised to limit his trading to ten contracts at a time. On his first day of trading soybean options, Zimmerman lost track of his inventory of contracts, a mistake that happened to net $6,000 in profit from Darrell?. His young backers were impressed. Zimmerman suggested they move to the U.S. Treasury bond pit, where the big traders were.<p>
The Board of Trade's bond futures are the most actively traded contracts in the world. The pit is the most grueling in the industry. Trading firms send their quickest and toughest traders there. The bond-options pit, a few feet away, is not much calmer. Zimmerman lost $25,000 on his first trade. "We pissed away most of our money until we were down to ten grand," Zimmerman says. TransMarket vice president Ken Bosgraf warned him to scale back: "I talked to him because there was too much risk in his position. He seemed very cooperative [when I asked him to] reduce his position, [but] in fact he increased his position.  I told him to find somewhere else to place his trades."<p>
Catalfo suggested they take one more shot before Bosgraf shut them down. They sold 3,000 calls just before the release of the monthly government statistics on unemployment, gambling that the figure would send the bond market down. "The number came out and it was in our faces," Zimmerman recalls. "We lost 40 grand immediately." Catalfo panicked. Zimmerman, with nothing of his own to lose, said he didn't believe the number. He persuaded Catalfo to join him for breakfast at a nearby deli. Throughout the meal, Catalfo muttered glumly about getting his family to cover the loss. "When we got back to the board, the market had reversed; our loss was now a $75,000 winner," Zimmerman says. He rushed into the pit and took the profit. Catalfo thought Zimmerman was a genius. <p>
TransMarket immediately closed Zimmerman's account  Bosgraf also informed Mason and Catalfo that Zimmerman still owed $70,000 at the Merc. Mason, afraid that his earnings would be seized to cover Zimmerman's debt, exited the partnership. For Catalfo, however, it just raised Zimmerman's stock further.<p>
"Darrell had some kind of control over Tony," says Mason. "I don't know why. Anytime Darrell asked for anything, Tony gave it to him. He even talked Tony into renting a car for him for two months."<p>
Around this time, Zimmerman and Catalfo began plotting for "something really big." Catalfo applied for membership to the board, easily rented a seat, and opened an account for $30,000 at another clearing firm. Zimmerman also had no difficulty finding a seat or another clearing firm, Lee B. Stern & Co. Stern was a company whose traders worked the board's sleepier agricultural pits. Though Stern itself took surprisingly little initiative to check Zimmerman out, it did receive two unsolicited phone calls from Hammer officials at the Merc, both of whom warned that clearing Zimmerman could be disastrous. "Their response to us," says one of those who called, "was they could handle it. They had better risk management than we did." <p>
The stage was set for Zimmerman, aided by Catalfo, to make his biggest play yet. "Our game plan," says Zimmerman, "was to have a really aggressive opinion about the market and take as big a position as we could and freak out all the people who make their livelihoods down there." The best way to do that, he thought, was to buy options. This was a turnaround; Zimmerman's trading strategies usually revolved around selling options. <p>
Options are either puts or calls. A call is an option to buy a security at a given price by a determined date. A put, similarly, is an option to sell a security. People who buy put options are either hoping for or hedging against a market drop. Put-option sellers, on the other hand, bet that the market will not drop. As a put buyer, Zimmerman would get others to sell him options. In fact, he would get them to sell him far more puts than they actually owned, luring them into large "short put" positions and making the pit vulnerable to a massive short squeeze. Themselves hoping the market will rise; options sellers, on the other hand, bet that it will drop. As an option buyer, Zimmerman would force others to sell options to him or maybe even go short, that is, sell options they didn't own. Zimmerman planned to buy very big.     <p>
All options have a price--what an investor must pay to buy them--and a strike price, the price at which the option can be used to leverage the underlying security. Someone buying a call option on a $25 bond future, might buy an option with a strike price of $30. If, before the option expires, the underlying security rises to a point that exceeds the strike price of the option, it is said to be trading "in the money." An option trading "in the money" trades differently from one that is not, moving more closely in tandem with the underlying security it becomes more volatile, shows bigger price jumps, and rises. Immediately before expiration, "in the money" options move virtually dollar for dollar with the underlying security. When this happens, an option and the security are for all practical purposes the same.<p>
Zimmerman's plan was to make his fellow traders think bond futures were headed lower by flooding the futures market with sell orders and the put market with buy orders. Eventually, traders, panicked to get on board the trend, would push down the prices of the underlying securities--in this case, bond futures contracts. As the futures dropped in value, Zimmerman's put options would become more and more valuable. Zimmerman's heavy option buying would create a stampede pushing both bond and put prices his way. "Our plan," he said "was to load up the pit so much with short positions that the options would blow up in everyone's faces."<p>
The date that Zimmerman was to execute his plan was important too. Near an options expiration date, a big move in futures can make options prices explode."Darrell figured out how to cause a real panic by turning the options into futures," says Joseph, "and making people go to the futures market to hedge them." In effect, he bought options from everyone and caused the markets to go nuts himself. "In many ways, the plan was brilliant," says Joseph.<p>
"I saw the play as a way to plan my retirement, so it had to work just right," Zimmerman says. "Tony and I took the summer off, mostly on the golf course, plotting what we would do. First we thought about it in terms of trading maybe ten or a hundred times bigger than before. But then we thought, let's do it a thousand times bigger. Well, we couldn't spend months on the floor trading ten and twenty lots and then all of a sudden trade thousands. No one would believe us. We had to schmooze people. So we made appearances on the floor. We said we had some big positions off the floor and that we were working with our people in New York and overseas setting up this big trading thing.  Well, the big trading thing was all in our minds."<p>
Zimmerman figured his plan could only work if the traders thought the market movement was a general market panic. So he enlisted brokers to make trades for him from different parts of the bond pits. Most of the big, established brokers refused his business, but some smaller ones snapped it up. "All we would tell them was we 'had a situation.' People said we misled them, but 'a situation' can mean anything. They never even asked us what our situation was. They just wanted the business." <p>
Catalfo was approved for trading on October 19,1992, the fifth anniversary of the crash, the Monday before the Friday when bond options expired. On Wednesday, Zimmerman gave Lee B. Stern & Co., a check for $50,000 to get him on the floor. (It later bounced.) That night, Zimmerman and Catalfo were at Zimmerman's apartment. "Tony said, 'Let's do it tomorrow instead of Friday,'" Zimmerman says. "Thursday was better anyway; an unemployment number was coming out, and we could play off that." Catalfo had his own reason for changing the date: His little brother and a friend were coming to town. Says Zimmerman: "We were going to take down the world financial system, and the guy wants his brother there to see it."<p>
At 6:00 a.m. Thursday, Zimmerman and Catalfo took the guests to breakfast before the market opened. "We didn't tell them, 'Watch us--we're going to take this market by the balls.' We just said we were excited the market was going down and that we were pretty heavily invested in it," says Zimmerman. To explain options, he drew a simple graph on a napkin. Later in the day, the FBI seized that napkin.<p>
All four walked onto the floor early to get good spots, Zimmerman and Catalfo in the options pit, their guests just outside. Though it had not occurred to them, to other traders it appeared that Zimmerman and Catalfo had brought the backers they had been talking up. This wasn't implausible, because some of the biggest movers and shakers on the floor do, in fact, look like college kids at a frat party.<p>
When the markets opened at 7:25, Zimmerman and Catalfo started buying every put offered in the pit, 25,000 of them. Put prices soared, and the traders who sold scrambled to hedge by selling futures in the bond pit. Zimmerman, however, beat them to it. He was sending huge sell orders to nine different brokers in the pit, driving the bond prices down. At 7:30, the unemployment number came out, and it was bearish. The market got another kick downward. Catalfo liquidated his position, netting $1.5 million. <p>
Zimmerman looked at the trades in his hand, and saw between $3 million and $5 million in profits. He had built the whole pyramid in 15 minutes. "I knew by then that Tony was at least a millionaire, so no matter what happened I would have half of that," Zimmerman says. "I started to buy in a hundred here and a thousand there. It was pandemonium all over. People were coming up to me and saying, 'Excuse me sir, who are you doing these trades for?' People who saw me on the floor for two years and never gave me the time of day. I thought then, 'I'm a multimillionaire. I control the market now. How many times is that going to happen in your life?' I started selling again to bury everyone." In all, Zimmerman controlled 36,000 contracts, leveraging $3.6 billion in bonds. <p>
Two things happened that slowed his momentum. Word that he was behind the wild action in the bond pit reached the Stern office, which sent the firm's officials racing to the floor. They had no idea what Zimmerman's positions were, but they did know they were ludicrously beyond what his margin (represented by the $50,000 check) would support. Stern's word was all Board of Trade officials needed to yank him from the floor. The second factor was Zimmerman himself. He lost count of his contracts and stepped out of the pit to tally them. That allowed Board of Trade security guards to reach him. When the other traders realized what was happening, the market reversed with a vengeance. Stern employees wrestled Zimmerman's trading cards from him and started a frantic attempt to learn his position. The scuffle blew the charade. Soon everyone in the futures and options pits smelled blood. Zimmerman's positions, they knew, would be liquidated. Lee B. Stern & Co. was swallowed whole. The firm lost $8.5 million, $2 million more than its net worth. It was the biggest Darrell Day ever.<p>
The feeding frenzy continued even after Zimmerman was pulled from the floor. Because Stern did virtually no business in the financial markets, no one from the firm knew how to deal with the catastrophe. It took two hours before its officers had a handle on Zimmerman's position and could round up the brokers who could liquidate it. If they had acted faster or more discreetly, many floor traders believe, Stern could have reversed Zimmerman's trades with minor losses, perhaps even for a profit.<p>
Instead, the Board of Trade forced Lee B. Stern & Co. to cover Zimmerman's loss. Though Lee Stern, the retired founder of the firm, eventually covered the entire amount, his company lost its status as a clearing member of the Board of Trade, where it had done business for 25 years. Twenty employees lost their jobs<p>
The next day, when Anthony Catalfo asked for a check for the full $1.5 million, he was told that his funds had been frozen pending an exchange investigation. When Zimmerman tried to reach him, Catalfo refused to talk. The two have not spoken since. Mark Mason called Catalfo three days later: "Tony said, 'Oh, God, it was a horror show. I got suckered.'" The money Catalfo made was eventually ceded to Stern to cover Zimmerman's losses. He subsequently filed for bankruptcy. <p>
When Zimmerman was shut down, Lisa, who started trading on a seat the month before, was also forced from the floor. "The clearing firms told me I was barred because of guilt by association," she says bitterly. "I worked on the exchanges for seven years before I finally got a chance to trade, and when I did, I just did low-risk trading. That, though, was my dream."<p>
 In the months that followed, Zimmerman plied the halls of the shabbier buildings on the fringe of the financial district looking for a job. And despite continuing news reports of the CBOT debacle and imminent indictments, Zimmerman was able to land three jobs selling and recruiting for small brokerage firms in Chicago. Once at work, though, he was often in a daze. He lost each job in a matter of weeks. He bought a pair of Rollerblades and often skated through the night, rethinking how his plan went wrong. He did manage to open a few stock trading accounts over the phone, racking up $10,000 in losses at one firm.<p>
At the end of June 1993 he left a note for Lisa saying he was taking a vacation. He took money out of her piggy bank and bought a bus ticket to Canada. She has not begun divorce preceeding and will not testify against him because she is afraid of the catalfos (this is off the record. She is planning on getting a divorce but cannot aford one right now. "Darrell ruined the lives of lots of people," she says bitterly, "because he never thought of anyone but himself. He put money before humans." "He put money before humans." --Lisa <p>
Mitch Joseph has another theory about him: "I don't think there was ever anything really malicious in Darrell's trading.  He just did what he always wanted: He went big, and he went home."<p>
Over the last year, all the Chicago exchanges have instituted rules and penalties against trading over margin limits. One, unofficially labeled the Darrell Zimmerman Rule, entitles clearing firms to keep any profits traders make on positions that cannot be supported with margins.<p>
On July 21, a grand jury indicted Darrell Zimmerman and Anthony Catalfo on six counts of wire fraud, charges that carry maximum prison terms of 30 years and $16 million in fines. The indictment charges that both traders lied to their clearing firms about the limits they would place on their trades. No laws specifically forbid trading beyond one's margin (largely because the exchanges have long insisted on policing themselves), and the wire-fraud charges rely mainly on the fact that the bond prices Zimmerman and Catalfo traded at were quoted across state lines over financial-news services and they used phone lines to call New York from Chicago. That allows the FBI to get involved. Prosecutors may have difficulty convincing a jury that was a crime. Catalfo, through his court appointed lawyer, has pleaded not guilty <p>
Zimmerman, taking his chances on extradition is now selling penny gold stocks. "The funny thing," he says now, "is that no one I know said, 'Darrrell, you're an asshole.' They all say, 'Why the hell couldn't you tell me you were going to do that, so I could have done at least a five lot?'"<p>

There are sixteen million reasons why Bud Post's life has become a nightmare.  He won them all playing Pensylvania's Super Seven Game.<p>By John Marchese<p>In a late-February night in 1988, a night with snow coming in off Lake Erie, William J. Post III, whom nearly everyone calls Bud, sat in the front bedroom of his $250-a-month furnished apartment waiting for his luck to change.<p>It was a few minutes before seven, and Bud Post just had been awakened from a nap by Ann Karpik, his landlady and (she would later tell a judge) his girlfriend. Ann didn't want to stay long; she was on her way to play bingo. But she did have some business with Bud. That night was the weekly drawing for the Super 7 game of the Pennsylvania Lottery, and she held 20 tickets. Bud himself held 40; earlier that day he'd pawned his gold ring to buy them. The week before, he'd cleaned the last $100 out of his bank account to buy 100 Super 7 tickets.<p>Ann Karpik's house on 13th Street was in a decaying residential neighborhood on the east side of downtown Erie, Pennsylvania. It was really nothing more than a tenement with a backyard, and Post lived there on a $340-a-month Social Security disability pension.He didn't have much, but he always kept several televisions around. To see the lottery drawing tonight, he watched the one in his bedroom. Karpik watched in the kitchen.<p>Bud Post was confident that the white numbered Ping-Pong balls bouncing around in the clear plastic container would soon change his life. For the last three days and nights, he had been studying the winning numbers in past drawings, and he had come up with what he thought was a flawless probability theory. He couldn't lose. And so, just after 6:58 p.m., he puffed on a Pall Mall and waited calmly as each ball slid to its assigned slot. <p>The next thing you know, old Bud's a millionaire.<p>But if ever there is a cautionary case to be made about riches leading to ruin, it is the story of Bud Post. Since that wonderful night of February 24, 1988, when he won $16,183,487.84--became the "$16 Million Man," as he says now, bitterly--he has lost just about all of his friends. He did briefly reconcile with his three estranged siblings, but the accord quickly disintegrated into bizarre and intense feuding. This fall, his younger brother, Jeffrey, will be tried on charges of hiring a hit man to kill Bud Post and his postlottery wife, Connie. Meanwhile, his other brother, Ed, and his sister, Patty, have brought libel and slander suits against Bud. And Connie, who married Bud five months after he received his first big check, is soon to be his ex-wife. Over the last few years Bud Post has been arrested and sued enough to make up a whole season's worth of L.A. Law. <p>What's more, he has squandered more than $2.5 million, and is now as broke as he was on February 23, 1988. And he has bought for himself the kinds of problems he never could have afforded on $340 a month. <p>Bud Post now has a working title for his life story: The Nightmare.<p>Before the nightmare commenced five years ago, Bud Post's life had been at best a fitful dream, filled with the kind of bad luck and hardscrabble deprivations that drive a man to drink. At least it did with Bud. By the time he returned to Erie, his hometown, in 1986, he'd had five wives, ten children, numerous stepchildren, and more than two dozen grandchildren, but little else. <p>He had first left Erie as a kid, shipped out of town to live in a series of rural foster homes after his mother died and his father, a used-car dealer, decided he couldn't take care of three sons and a daughter. Though the Posts were reunited when their father remarried, all four kids would face big hurdles in life. Bud, in particular, seemed unable to clear them. He ran off to the army before he was 16 but then was discharged in Korea after drinking enough wood alcohol to nearly kill himself. With his dreams of a career in army intelligence dashed, Bud Post came home and worked at a variety of dead-end jobs--circus cook, carnival roustabout, truck driver. His last stint of steady employment was in 1987, when he worked spray painting aluminum siding. But that ended when complications from a hernia operation put him on a disability pension. <p>He wasn't even 50, but in many ways he already seemed like an old and broken man. His fourth wife had died recently. His social life was limited to a tight circle that extended to Wally's Bar, a few blocks from his apartment (where he drank), and to the nearby church-run soup kitchen called the Food Hamper (where he often ate). Sometimes Bud and his landlady, Ann Karpik, would play bingo at the local churches. Occasionally they played the lottery together. If they won at either, they'd share the pot--an arrangement that a judge would later decide was as good as contractual. But they never won much, and as their friendship grew, Ann Karpik would often let Post miss a rent payment. "He was basically living off of me," she says. "Before he got all the money, we got along pretty good."<p>Then he found out his small disability payment was being challenged. He got mad and decided to find a lawyer. But first he needed a way to pay for it. Years ago, when one of his wives sent him to a mental institution for evaluation, he'd been told by doctors that he had an IQ of 157. So maybe it was one of those mad leaps of borderline genius that led him to devise a way to get money to sue for his $340-a-month payment: He'd win the lottery.<p>Instant money has become America's postmodern Lourdes, a miracle cure for the ailing lower middle class (who, with the poor, buy most of the lottery tickets) and a long-term treatment for anemic state treasuries. Since 1964, when New Hampshire introduced its lottery, 35 states and the District of Columbia have come up with some kind of state-run numbers game. In all, citizens now spend nearly $12 billion a year on lottery tickets. "Lotteries are selling hope," says Eugene Christiansen, president of Christiansen/ Cummings, a consulting firm that works with lotteries. "It's the poor who hope the most."<p>Bud Post was poor and hopeful. years of struggle have marked him: a trim man, medium height, with scars crisscrossing his body from dozens of operations. He has thin hair and a lined face, sunken around the mouth because he rarely wears his false teeth. They worsen the headaches that have plagued him for years. <p>"I worked two jobs to feed my family," he says. "I had ten kids--how many people could make it today with ten kids?" (He did not feed them consistently; one of the first liens on Bud Post's new fortune came from Erie County child-welfare officials, to make up long-overdue child-support payments.) "I even wrote some bad checks once to buy groceries. And I went to jail for it," he says.<p>So you would think that becoming the $16 Million Man would have made him happy. "Nah," Post says. "Right from the beginning, I knew. Look at the photos they took of me when I was in Harrisburg," the state capital, where he officially claimed his prize. "Do you see me smiling? I knew the money would cause me a lot of problems."<p>But people who were around him in the first hours after he won say Bud Post spent at least a little time celebrating. Ann Karpik remembers him coming to her house at three o'clock that night after the drawing and banging on the door until he was let in. "I told you I was going to win," she says Bud told her. "You're going to have a new house and new cars." One of the first things Post did was get out of Karpik's low-rent apartment. He charged a hotel room for the two of them (onKarpik's credit card) at the Quality Inn in downtown Erie. <p>A few days later, Post hired a Cadillac limousine to bring him and Karpik to Harrisburg to meet with lottery officials. Post's brothers, Ed and Jeffrey, flew to Harrisburg from their homes in Florida. His sister, Patty, drove in from Erie. One of Bud's children showed up. The year before, no one had called or sent him a card on Father's Day. "His family never even answered his phone calls before," says Ann Karpik. "Now there they were."<p>Bud Post's fortune wouldn't arrive all at once. To lessen the winner's tax liabilities and to mitigate the danger of ruinous, heedless spending--and to save money itself--state lotteries don't pay their big winners directly.Instead, they buy them annuities; Bud's provided him $622,441.84 each year for 25 years. Under Pennsylvania law, no state or local taxes would be levied on the winnings, but 20 percent was withheld for federal income taxes, leaving Post's yearly take at $497,953.47.<p>"I spent about $10,000 that weekend just on hotel bills and food for everybody," Post remembers. He sent Ann Karpik on a clothes shopping spree. He bought her a used Cadillac and wrote her a $10,000 check for back rent and damages to her apartment. But he didn't do what she'd been hoping he'd do: share his winnings equally with her.<p>"I told him," Karpik says, "Bud, if you don't do what's right with this money, you're just going to have bad luck with it."<p>By late summer of 1990, Bud Post's brief good luck was starting to turn bad again. It was barely a year and a half since he'd become a millionaire, and Post was already short on funds, so he decided to hold a gigantic fire sale on the grounds of one of the two farms he'd bought in OilCity, Pennsylvania, about an hour southeast of Erie. <p>"He told me he was pressed for money and wanted to sell all his toys," says Charles Baker, an auctioneer in the area. "I wouldn't say he described them as toys--I described them as toys.<p>"We sold backhoes, limousines, motorcycles, bicycles, horse trailers," Baker says. "I could just go on and on."<p>The official auction notice did go on and on. Besides selling one of the farms, Post put on the block items that ranged from the limousines to an ultralight aircraft, from complete bathrooms (shower enclosures, sinks, and commodes) to living-room furniture, from an oak-barrel bumper-pool game table to stereo systems, an electronic organ, antique suits of armor, and train sets. Post had even thought of selling the 1,200 pairs of men's polyester pants he'd somehow acquired. "The pants are a long story," says Baker.<p>The short explanation is supplied by Bud Post himself: "I'd just collected too much stuff," he says. "Most of it was inexpensive stuff. The whole auction didn't get me more than $110,000. I just wanted to get rid of it because I couldn't even keep track of the stuff. How much stuff can you watch at one time?" <p>The auctioneer had never seen a larger turnout in his 33 years in business. "People came out just to see this guy who'd won $16 million," says Baker. "Around here that's like meeting Donald Trump."<p>He was no Donald Trump, but bud post had installed himself as chairman of Post Enterprises Inc., a Florida corporation whose officers included his two brothers, his sister, and his wife, Connie. He'd met Connie years before he won the money, when he was being treated in the psychiatric division of Northwest Medical Center in Oil City. Post says he proposed to Connie then, but she turned him down. Soon after he won the lottery, he looked her up again.<p>"At the time," Post says, "her boyfriend had just gone to jail." So he bought a house in Oil City to be near her. "I treated her like a queen," he says. "Anything she wanted. I mean, she's got clothes like you wouldn't believe. She's got jewelry, $1,300 and $1,400 dresses." To make sure she had plenty of time to wear those dresses, Post called Connie's employer and told him she didn't need a job anymore. <p>After they were married, Bud and Connie moved into a big brick house on Shady Oak Lane, an accurately named street near the top of a hill that rises out of downtown Oil City. Built by a man who made a fortune opening the first McDonald's franchises in the area, the house was lavish, even gaudy, by Oil City standards. Bud Post bought it for about $250,000 and decided to make it even more ostentatious.<p>"He obviously wanted a castle," says his banker, Robert Bablak Jr., assistant vice president at the local Northwest Savings Bank. "He just wanted to be somebody significant, and he was going to make himself significant with this money."<p>Post bought an old coat of arms at a thrift shop, painted it and hung it over the front door. He bought suits of armor and life-size religious statues, which he placed in the front yard. He hired the local Sears to put a mansard roof on the house and hired a contractor to build turrets. "We wish that house would disappear," said one of his neighbors recently. Another neighbor was the CEO of Quaker State Petroleum, Jack Corn. When Bud Post heard that Corn was ready to retire and move to Florida, he boasted to his nephew that he was going to buy Corn's quarter-million-dollar house, too.<p>"Why?" his nephew asked.<p>"Storage," Post said smugly.<p>While he built his Oil City Xanadu, Post Enterprises went into a variety of businesses. Bud Post says now that he only wanted the business to take care of his long-estranged siblings and "keep them away from me." His brothers and sister say he promised them money and then took it back. Connie Post believes that "when Bud won the money, he tried buying their love back." (He didn't try so hard with his children. Post's wife reports that when one daughter called and asked to borrow money for a new wooden leg, Bud hung up on her.)<p>So Bud bought his siblings a restaurant and bar near the Sarasota, Florida, airport called City Limits, which would be run by Jeffrey Post and Patty Post. Bud's older brother, Ed, would run a car dealership that would buy cars cheaply in the economically distressed regions around Erie and sell them high in booming Florida. For a short time, Bud Post, who had the urge to fly airplanes, had a scheme to ship Maine lobsters to Florida and shrimp back to Maine. Though he didn't have a pilot's license, he bought a small used Beechcraft twin-engine plane.<p>"I wanted to fly," Bud Post says. "And I figured if I live in Pennsylvania and I have a corporation in Florida, wouldn't it be nice to have an airplane to fly down and smoke in. You can't smoke on commercial airlines. That really pissed me off. So I bought myself an airplane. Why not? The corporation should have been making money. I should have been able to afford a $70,000 plane out of $16 million."<p>Why Post Enterprises never made money is a subject of dispute. Bud Post says his siblings took money meant for the business and spent it on lavish living. He had originally agreed to pay them $50,000 a year, and there was a less formal agreement that as the business prospered, so would the family.<p>Ed, Jeffrey, and Patty blame the company's problems on their brother's erratic behavior--characterized by such acts as depositing money into the company account and then quickly taking most of it back.<p>"It's really kind of simple," says Jeffrey Post. "After our mother passed away and we were sent to different places to live, Bud felt he got the short end of the deal. Somewhere along the line he decided to destroy his family."<p>Before their brother became a millionaire, the Posts never had much money, but they all owned homes and held down jobs and, for the most part, did what they could for their troubled middle brother. But they only had so much tolerance for Bud's drinking and his unreliability. In the years before February 24, 1988, Jeffrey had washed his hands of Bud. He wouldn't let his brother into his house. Ed sometimes gave Bud a place to sleep in Florida, but only on his office floor. Only Patty was unable to refuse Bud. For a time in the early '80s, she had let him live in a trailer behind the Oil City restaurant she ran with her husband.<p>"They sure took money from the black sheep," says Bud Post now. "They came to me. I didn't go to them. They thought they were going to become millionaires. My brothers and sister are just plain pure jealous.<p>"Generally, when money comes into a family," he continues, "it causes greed and revenge. In this case I believe greed was the seed that grew revenge."<p>Revenge against Bud Post would take many forms. Most extreme and self-defeating was the course followed by Jeffrey Post. According to the police in Sarasota, Jeffrey wanted to drown his brother on a boating trip. When that scheme failed, he allegedly sent a hit man up to Pennsylvania in the spring of 1993. Jeffrey will not talk about the murder plots, but Ed and Patty say that if Jeffrey planned to kill Bud, he did it for revenge, not greed. In any case, revenge would come first for Ann Karpik. <p>Karpik was less impetuous in her antagonism than Jeffrey.Rather than resort to violence to get what she thought should be hers, she hired legal counsel. Just about the time he was having his auction, Karpik sued Bud Post in Erie County, claiming that she was entitled to half his winnings. Her lawyers, a former Erie County judge and two partners at one of Erie's top firms, argued that the bingo partnership Ann and Bud had developed constituted a contract, which Post had violated by not sharing his winnings.<p>The case came to trial in August 1991 and took an unusual form. Erie County President Judge Jess Jiuliante would decide the case, though there would be an advisory jury that would vote on matters of fact. The matters of fact were hotly disputed.<p>Karpik claimed that she and Post had been lovers. Post denied it. Karpik claimed they'd gambled together often and always shared the winnings. Post said that wasn't really the case. Karpik claimed that on the night of the drawing Post hid the winning ticket from her. He said that was a lie. Karpik's attorneys said that because Bud Post had often treated her violently in the past, she was afraid to speak up before lottery officials to claim her share of the prize. Post's lawyers said the fact that Ann Karpik ran her own bar for years in a tough Erie neighborhood proved that she couldn't have been afraid of Bud. <p>Karpik's lawyers produced a prelottery handwritten will leaving everything to Karpik (which Post claimed was a forgery) and the testimony of Carl Smith, another of Karpik's tenants and, according to Karpik, Bud's rival for her affections. Smith testified that while hiding in a closet in Karpik's house in the early-morning hours of February 25, 1988, he'd heard Post promise Ann a half-share of his winnings.<p>In the end, Judge Jiuliante ruled for Karpik, though he thought she only deserved one third of the prize (the judge explained recently that he based the one-third award on the fact that on February 24, 1988, Bud had bought 40 tickets and Ann only 20). Jiuliante ordered Bud Post to pay Ann Karpik $5,333,333.33 (plus back interest) and to immediately sign over to her $300,000 from his 1992 annuity check. Post refused and was found in contempt of court. When it came time for the 1993 payment, Bud didn't even get a chance to refuse. Jiuliante ordered the money put straight into escrow. Post has appealed the decision to the state superior court, which has yet to hear the case. <p>By early 1993, Post's life officially became a nightmare, and no one had even tried to kill him yet. In one affidavit filed with the Erie court, he said, "I have incurred substantial indebtedness to various creditors in various amounts." In another filing, his lawyers said, "The defendant's long-standing and acutely exacerbated health problems, the stress attributable to the underlying controversy  as well as worsening domestic difficulties involving the defendant's wife and third parties" were impairing their client. <p>"Yes, I had wife troubles," Bud Post says now. In July of 1990, Connie filed for divorce, after a number of fights that were settled only when the cops were called in. Later that year, Connie obtained a protection order in Venango County Court.She told the judge that Bud was firing guns inside the house, had once shot her car, and had threatened to kill her if she ever tried to take his money. Despite the turmoil, she always came back to him. <p>Go to visit Bud Post for the first time in late August, not long after police in Sarasota have arrested his brother and charged him with hiring a hit man to kill Bud and his wife and make it look like a murder-suicide. It is dusk. The pile that had become Bud's castle, had held his dreams of significance, sits on the top of a steep lawn looking empty and forlorn. The turrets that Bud wants built are half-finished, covered in tar paper. An Oil City police dispatcher who gives me directions to Bud's place says, "I wouldn't tell him you were talking to us."  His neighbor, who is taking a walk, asks warily, "Does he know you're coming?" He doesn't. "I'll keep an eye on you," she says.<p>I ring the doorbell and wait. In the muggy summer heat bugs are making a racket. Bud Post comes to the door after a couple rings, looking worn out. He is 53 now and seems ten years older. He's wearing only jeans and white dress socks--he'd been sleeping--and as he talks for the next six hours he won't bother putting on a shirt or shoes. "You know what I've had as a sleeping companion?" Post asks at one point. "An M1 carbine with a banana clip in it." He pauses: "You're not nervous, are you?"<p>Bud Post has enough nerves for both of us. When he sits, he pumps his leg almost continuously. Often, he jumps up and paces the room, and he smokes one Pall Mall after another. Within 20 minutes of letting me into his house--where whole rooms are devoid of furniture and fixtures have been pulled from walls ("They stole my curtains," Bud says, never identifying "they")--he takes me into his bedroom so he can play a tune on his electronic piano.<p>The bedroom is dark but for a huge television image soundlessly projected onto the back wall. Two other small televisions on either side of his bed play the same movie (Outrageous Fortune, starring Bette Midler and Shelley Long), also with no sound. Another television glows near the heavily curtained window, which is barred and has been smashed. That television--a security monitor--holds a static image of Bud's driveway. When Bud Post stops talking for a moment, the sound of bugs and wind rustling leaves fills the room. He also has a listening device set up outside. "I could see you and hear you before you rang the bell," he says.<p>Then Bud Post drops to his knees on the floor and starts to play his piano. He pages through a book of simplified sheet music, with notes as big as quarters, and picks "I Fall to Pieces." The performance is so inept it is touching. Assured that he plays beautifully, Bud plays "Release Me" as an encore. "My wife loves this one," he says, staring hard at the big notes.<p>Had he only listened, Bud Post might have avoided this nightmare. The Pennsylvania Lottery Commission gives an information packet to its big winners that emphasizes two points: "Don't make any hasty decisions regarding your prize money," and "If you do not have professional legal and financial advisors, you should consider seeking such help." After that: "We believe they're adults and leave it up to them," says a lottery spokesman.<p>There was a crucial moment soon after he won the money when Bud Post could have let someone else run his affairs. His lawyer at the time, Robert McCullough, says he arranged for a banker to devise a financial plan for the new millionaire. "But Bud couldn't stand to have anyone tell him what to do," McCullough says. "He just won't let people help him."<p>"The banks wanted to deal with me like I was a little kid," says Bud Post. "I was going to control my own money.<p>"The problem was, I wasn't expecting them all to come for it at once. I knew Ann Karpik would, because of the way she was talking. But everybody I ever knew or talked to wanted money. I'm not the keeper of the world because I won the lottery."<p>Connie Post says that her husband has only come to this posture of world-weary philosophizing now that he's looking for sympathy. Before things got sour, she remembers him saying, "I've got more power than God."<p>Bud Post has not received a penny since February 1992. His siblings, he says, were out to get him from the beginning; he contends that the Erie County court system has systematically deprived him of his rights. These allegations sound like the ravings of a paranoid, except for the fact that the Sarasota police say that a man hired by Jeffrey Post did indeed stalk Bud at his castle last May. Months before, Jeffrey tried to get Bud to Florida for a sailing trip, where he allegedly planned to kill him and make it look like a suicide. Bud thinks his brother was after the money--the three Post siblings were listed as beneficiaries with the Pennsylvania Lottery Commission. Of course, Bud has changed that now. His most recent beneficiary statement leaves 90 percent of the money to his church, 10 percent to Connie.<p>"He blames everybody but himself," says Jeffrey Post, who is free on bail awaiting trial and who is dying of AIDS. "It should have been the greatest thing that ever happened. He could have retired his brothers and sister, handed each of us $50,000 a year, and there still would have been an awful lot of money. But the money just made everything miserable instead of wonderful."<p>It is tempting to think that Bud Post was simply unequipped to handle any amount of money, let alone a multimillion-dollar lottery jackpot. But there are so many horror stories attached to sudden wealth that his dilemma seems almost predictable. As he told his tale and as everyone around him complained of the damage the money had done, I kept thinking, could I have handled it any better? "I know I wouldn't trade places with him," says Post's banker, Robert Bablak. "His goals in life might have been different from yours or mine. But I really think he meant well." <p>I asked Bud Post if he didn't often wish his luck were different on that cold February night with snow in the air. He hadn't been sleeping much recently, and there were big, dark pouches under his eyes. He looked at me for a while.<p>"Do you ever think, 'I wish I hadn't been born?'" he asked. "What's the difference? I'm a survivor, and I'm still holding things together--as little as it may look. This is war, and when you have war you have damages.<p>"I'm still alive," Post said. "I don't know if that's lucky or not." <p>John Marchese has written for the New York Times, Esquire, GQ, and Philadelphia.<p><p>

Is an income of $100,000 a year enough to buy the American Dream?<p>By Ilyce Glink<p>Earlier this year, when the federal government was busy trying to decide whom to hit up for higher taxes, the Senate Finance Committee, headed by Democratic Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine, offered a proposal: Boost rates for all households earning six-figure incomes or higher. The committee asserted that this was the cutoff for the middle class.<p>By the time Congress finally passed the Clinton budget package this summer, however, its authors had set the tax-hike threshold even higher. The new cutoff was $140,000--$40,000 more than the finance committee had recommended. In so doing, Washington acknowledged something that more and more Americans are gradually coming to realize:An income of $100,000 no longer can be considered rich.<p>Public perception has not fully caught up to this development. Most folks still accept $100,000 as a token of the good life, a magic number promising access to personal security and material well-being. Even with inflation, which has reduced the value of the dollar 41 percent since 1980, $100,000 is far more than most people earn in a year. Or even dream of earning. Only 4.3 percent of U.S. households pull down $100,000 or more annually. Last year, when pollsters at the Roper Organization asked people how large a household income they'd need to satisfy all of their wishes, the typical response averaged out to $82,100.<p>The people who actually make $100,000 or more, however, tell a different story. Many don't consider themselves anywhere close to being well-off, let alone wealthy. To them, rich is something that happens at a far higher income level--like $500,000 a year or $1 million. Between taxes, mortgage and tuition payments, and the general expenses of maintaining a household in the cities where high-income jobs are located, money sweeps out as fast as it comes in.<p>Easy Come, Easy Go
Jim Abeles is an executive with the magazine-publishing division of the Chicago Sun-Times; he makes about $80,000 a year. His wife, Jennifer, works part-time for Crate & Barrel, a furniture retailer, in Chicago. The money she brings in pushes them near six figures. They live in a brick colonial home covered with ivy in Highland Park, Illinois. They own two cars, a Saab and a Jeep Grand Cherokee. Money from Jim's family helped them buy the house, but they don't have anything left. And they worry about their finances.<p>"If I thought about how much we're spending relative to how much we're making, I wouldn't sleep well," says Jennifer. "We've been dipping into things that have always been earmarked for emergencies to pay the grocery and Visa bills." When she describes their life, it doesn't sound extravagant. With a newborn son, the Abeleses have cut out most of their indulgences--Jennifer says she used to spend $1,000 a month on herself, and Jim bought computer equipment, upgrading all the time--but life with a newborn is still expensive. When they go out to dinner now, it's usually to <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a>. Even so, she says: "We're living well beyond our means."<p>In fact, statistics show that the typical six-figure household is considerably less wealthy today than it was ten years ago--despite all of the talk about the go-go 1980s. According to a survey conducted by Payment Systems Inc., the average net worth of households with annual incomes between $100,000 and $200,000 declined 58 percent between 1983 and 1992, adjusted for inflation. Factoring out real estate values doesn't significantly alter the amount of the erosion. So it's likely that much of the drop is related to the arrival of more and more two-income couples to the group, with comparatively high earnings but little in the way of accumulated assets.<p>Peter Roth and Jennifer Freeman live in New York City and earn $100,000 between them, he as a manager of new business development for a small cable-TV company, she as a project supervisor for a construction company. After three years of marriage and with a baby on the way, they're finding that at a time when they expected to be getting ahead, they are still just trying to get a foothold. "We're not suffering at all in our lifestyle," Roth says. "But we're being forced to make some choices we didn't expect to be making at this point in our lives." <p>Recently Roth and Freeman went shopping for a home in the suburbs. And what they learned was that they couldn't afford one--at least not the kind of place they envision for themselves. So they'll keep their one-bedroom apartment in the city, and the baby's crib will go in the corner next to their bed. "It's kind of unbelievable that this kind of money--think about it: $100,000--doesn't go very far, or that we're even having this discussion," says Roth. He says they now know that when they do finally buy their first dream house, it's going to be "even less dreamy than our lowest expectations."<p>How It's Supposed to Work
It would be easy to dismiss such complaints as examples of the old proverb that riches enlarge rather than satisfy the appetite. Or they could be shrugged off as the whining of spoiled brats, a great temptation at a time when class tensions simmer just below the surface of society. Public sentiment, in fact, is so strong on this score that many people who make six-figure salaries feel that they are not entitled to their anxiety. A number of those interviewed for this story refused to disclose their names.<p>This doesn't mean we should all start feeling sorry for people who make six-figure incomes. That's not the point. What is important is that this isn't the way things are supposed to work. People in the upper 4 percent income bracket of a wealthy nation are not supposed to feel like they are under a lot of financial stress. They are supposed to be comfortable. And their success is supposed to reassure everyone else that, by applying themselves, they too can reach this level of comfort. It's the incentive that drives our economy.<p>So it's painful to admit that $100,000 isn't rich anymore, because it seems to put so much out of reach. And it's perplexing and frustrating for those who have arrived at that level only to discover that they still have further to go. Many feel as though they upheld their end of the bargain--studied hard in school, put in long hours at work, and climbed the ladder--only to discover that the payoff has been reduced. <p>Some refuse to accept it. According to Kathleen Gurney, founder of the Financial Psychology Corp. in Cincinnati, many people who make six-figure salaries spend themselves into debt simply because they want to believe they are rich. "I'm seeing more anxiety than usual," she says. "You see people getting themselves into trouble because they are saying to themselves, 'How could I possibly be in trouble if I'm earning $100,000 a year?'"<p>Moreover, technology and marketing whizzes are forever expanding the temptations offered in the marketplace. This constantly expands the gap between what society offers and what people can afford--leaving everyone feeling more deprived. Part of what concerns Jennifer Abeles and her husband is that they want their son to have everything they had as children. "Having a baby is expensive, even though everyone says it's not for the first year," Jennifer says. "None of our son Will's medical checkups are covered by insurance. And then there are those fun gadgets, marketed in such a spectacular way. It makes you feel your child can't live without that Barney sleeping bag." Susan Mayer, a professor of public policy at the University of Chicago, understands how families like the Abeleses let themselves be stepped on by an imaginary dinosaur. "One reason people feel pinched is that they're buying a whole lot more," she says. "They save less, spend more, and feel worse."<p>Location and Wealth
To be sure, not all households earning $100,000 a year are suffering. It makes a difference where people live, what they own, what they owe, whom they have to take care of, and how healthy they are. A six-figure income stretches pretty far in Manhattan, Kansas. Manhattan, New York, is another story. If there are no medical bills to pay, no alimony checks to sign, and no sick relatives to take care of, $100,000 also looks better. If the mortgage is already paid off, a $100,000 household might even start to feel rich.<p>On the other hand, the vast majority of $100,000 households do not live in small farm towns, and still have plenty of payments left on their mortgages. Four of ten, in fact, reside in just five U.S. cities: the New York, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles metropolitan areas,where prices are a space shot higher than in rural America. So is the cost of living in Boston, Minneapolis, Seattle, and a host of other places. In New York City, an income of $100,000--after federal, state, and city taxes are extracted--means a couple would practically have to forgo food altogether to buy anything bigger than a one-bedroom apartment to live in. And even then, it could be difficult. "You have to have a certain amount of money to be accepted by a co-op board," says Patricia Burnham, president of P.S. Burnham, a Manhattan real estate brokerage firm. Burnham suggests that a $100,000 couple accept the fact that they'll have to rent. Two thousand dollars a month should get them a nice one-bedroom place in a good neighborhood.<p>A lot of six-figure earners also feel poor because they don't have much in the way of assets, which is the true measure of wealth and the way it is accumulated over the long term. According to one study of affluent households, couples who earned between $100,000 and $150,000 a year but were less than 50 years old averaged a net worth of under $40,000, not including their residence. This describes about a third of the households who earn more than $100,000. Many also have watched their total net worth decline because of the collapse of the housing markets on both coasts. It's difficult to accumulate assets when you're living paycheck to paycheck. Says Susan Mayer: "If you look at the statistics, you can see that even in the highest decile, people spend most of their income." <p>It's no wonder, then, that bankruptcy lawyers and credit counselors report an upsurge in the number of six-figure households getting into financial trouble. "I don't know if a person making $100,000 is a high earner anymore," says David Askanase, a Houston bankruptcy attorney who has had several clients in that income range. Adds Catherine Williams, director of education for Consumer Credit Counseling Services in Chicago: "There are plenty of people who earn $100,000 a year who are truly a paycheck away from disaster. When you hear the credit balances, it will make your hair curl. One gentleman has a debt load of $183,000, but he only bought about $140,000 worth of stuff. It's the accumulating-interest snowball theory."<p>Dan and Chrissy Barr, who live in Loveland, Ohio, about 20 miles from Cincinnati, are certainly nowhere near that kind of trouble. They are both 34 years old and earn a combined $130,000. Their biggest expense is the $2,000 a month they pay for the mortgage on their red brick home. Their second biggest expense is the $7,000 tuition they pay to send their six-year-old son, Andy, to a private school.<p>Partly because the cost of living isn't astronomical in Loveland, they say they live a comfortable life. On the weekends, he plays tennis and she goes for two-hour bike rides. The private school is a luxury, but they both felt it was important after Andy scored extremely well on standardized tests.<p>Neither Dan nor Chrissy, however, feels anywhere near the brink of luxury. In fact, it is primarily for financial reasons that they've decided not to have any more children. "We wouldn't want to compromise the education factor," Chrissy says. In other words, they plan on keeping their family limited to one child so they don't ever have to skimp. "Andy's school clothes alone were $350 at <a name="NYSE:GPS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11469"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gap</b></a> Kids the other day--for some turtlenecks, pants, and sweaters," says Chrissy. "The money just goes."<p>Indeed, the most common complaint of people who earn $100,000 is how restricted their life choices are. For Mike and Cathy Marchesano, that means sacrificing Mike's time with the family. To be able to afford a nice suburban home, they chose to live in Nassau County, New York, about 50 miles away from Manhattan, where Mike works as a publishing executive. Their cedar-shingled Dutch colonial home is more than comfortable, with a large deck and beautiful landscaping. Yet Mike spends nearly three hours a day commuting on the Long Island Railroad. He rarely gets to see the house in the daylight. More important, he barely gets to see his two daughters except on weekends, and he often has to work Saturdays. "I think I have a very good life," he says. "But I wish I could spend more time with my children." <p>$2,368 for Harvard
One reason members of the $100,000 group may feel let down by what their income can buy is that perceptions about money rarely keep pace with inflation. It comes as a shock to a lot of people to hear that $100,000 in 1980 dollars is equal to $175,000 of today's dollars. And, of course, the further back in time one goes, the more pathetic the comparisons get.<p>In 1960, $100,000 purchased 42 years at Harvard ($2,368 a year) or 13.5 Eldorado Seville Biarritz Cadillacs ($7,401 each) or an 8,000-square-foot condo at one of Chicago's best Gold Coast addresses. Today, it will barely buy one four-year education at Harvard ($24,000 a year) or three 1993 Cadillac Sevilles ($33,200 each) or a small one-bedroom condo in Chicago.<p>But the psychology of inflation doesn't account for all of the disappointment. "These people legitimately feel like they are just scraping by," says Nobel-prize-winning economist Gary S. Becker. "They are just meeting their monthly bills and mortgage payments.. . .  Their complaints aren't just whining. They are real...even though others making $30,000 won't have much sympathy for them."<p>Social critic Barbara Ehrenreich writes in her book Fear of Falling: The Inner Life of the Middle Class, "It is hardly greed that impels a man to want the best education for his children or a comfortable home for them to grow up in.... Something is indeed 'terribly wrong,' when the once-modest expectations of the middle class can be met only with what is a far from middling income." David Drucker, a financial planner in Bethesda, Maryland, echoes her sentiment:"I don't think it's impossible for a $100,000 family to send a kid through private school and Harvard," he says. "But they would have to live a pretty meager lifestyle."<p>As evidence of the nation's wealth, many economists point to the rise in households earning more than $100,000 a year--which has occurred even in real dollars. Yet the largest percentage of this increase is accounted for by the jump in two-income households. And a two-income household making a combined $100,000 doesn't net nearly as much as a home with one breadwinner making $100,000. Taxes are one reason for that, since both husband and wife must pay Social Security, doubling the family contribution. The Social Security rate itself has also gone up. In 1980, two wage earners making $50,000 each would have paid $3,175.34 in Social Security taxes. Today, their bill would be $7,650, a 240 percent increase.<p>A two-income couple also may need to pay all of the expenses for two cars, instead of one. If the family has children, they'll need to foot the bill for day care. With two jobs, they also  buy more business clothes and are more likely to eat out or consume expensive prepared foods, since there's little time for cooking.<p>Other costs have risen for everyone, making it harder to live well at any income level. New York economist Ed Hyman's New Misery Index shows that in 1980 the average American spent about 37 percent of personal income on four things: taxes, health insurance, Social Security, and debt service. Today, we spend more than 44 percent on the same things. To a $100,000 family, that 7 percentage point rise is $7,000 spent for no gain. The average total tax bill--federal, state, and local--for a two-earner family with two children and a total income of $100,000 is about $25,000, according to Phil Ravid, a partner in Ravid & Bernstein, a general accounting practice in Chicago. He says: "I started accounting in 1964. People spend more today, but I get the impression that the ones making a buck back then were able to accumulate more wealth. Today, it seems tougher."<p>Although the Clinton tax plan appears to acknowledge the problems of the six-figure household, if only slightly, a lot of people think that the threshold for middle class should have been set even higher than $140,000. "Someone living on $140,000 a year in New York City is certainly not rich," says Paul Craig Roberts, a political economist with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Clinton's definitions of income are very arbitrary because most people with high incomes are living in densely populated cities." One result: Concerns and complaints of this group are largely ignored. They aren't poor enough to attract sympathy. And they aren't rich enough to fund powerful lobbies in Washington.<p>No One Else's Fault
Of course, there's a lot of self-inflicted pain, too. The breakup of a marriage is a far worse financial disaster than a tax increase or even a stock-market crash. And about 50 percent of marriages end in divorce. Clint Johnson, who works for an insurance company in Boston, brings home a little over $100,000 a year. But he's divorced, and child support siphons off about 25 percent of his take-home pay. On top of that, his two daughters live in Chicago: He spends an additional $500 per month flying there to see them.<p>Judith and Frank, who live in New England and asked that their last name not be used, say they at least don't feel alone in their struggles. "I know a lot of people who are poor on $100,000 a year," says Judith. "Our house has problems, and we don't have the cash to fix it up. We're carrying a mortgage that's too much for us. We're trying to get ready to sell. We thought we'd be able to meet the bills and be comfortable and take a vacation once a year, and we can't do it. We thought we'd be able to send our daughter to college and be comfortable. We had hoped for a modicum of comfort and spending power, and we have not even achieved that." Their problems stem from the loss of her job in the pharmaceutical industry. Even though he makes $150,000 a year working in the computer industry, it isn't enough to pay their bills. Recently, they found a way to save $92 a month: They canceled their eight-year-old daughter's piano lessons.<p>Increasing angst about job security is another reason why a lot of $100,000 households feel less than well-off. They know that income could disappear. Says Judith Lansky, president of Lansky Career Consultants: "An awful lot of people earning $100,000 a year spend every penny of it. Unfortunately, when you lose your $100,000-a-year job, it could easily take you more than a year to find another one. And if you are the sole support of a family with children, it's going to be a long year."<p>"It's a convergence of forces," says Kevin Phillips, a political analyst and author. "Not only has their income been undermined but also their jobs, pensions, and the whole sense of the American safe-living standard, which for people who wore white collars and graduated from college was bankable into the 1980s. After the crash of 1987, you began to see bank crises and employment slipping. The American Dream wasn't out there for Mr. and Mrs. Jones anymore. Politicians could tell them they were rich, but the voters couldn't feel it."<p>Bob and Kim Witwer of Phoenix describe earning $100,000 as a disappointment. Says Bob, who works as an engineering supervisor: "It's more of a general disappointment, because you have a gradual rise in income and a gradual decline in what you can do with it because your expenses are greater. We don't really look at ourselves as people who put an excess emphasis on material stuff. But it's surprising with having kids, both of us working, and all of the other things you pay for. There's a lot of people running around with $40,000 thinking if they made $100,000, they'd be living high on the hog. But they would be surprised."<p>As for Jim and Jennifer Abeles, they say they are mainly focused on adjusting to parenthood. Recently, however, Jim has been experimenting with a new financial strategy he hopes will finally end their worries: He's buying Illinois lottery tickets every couple of weeks.<p>

A newlywed's take on the best eat-in gas station, the swingingest bank, and the most relaxing rifle range<p>By Carla Koehl<p>Texas has bred some of the oddest people. But none is less likely than Lyle Lovett, the Houston native who thinks country music sounds better with a horn section. <p>At 35, Lovett has four albums under his 29-inch belt and a new one coming out next year. The summer concert tour he's just wrapped up to promote "Joshua Judges Ruth" ("my gospel/death album") was his biggest ever, and his mid-tour marriage to Julia Roberts bumped up his visibility a notch or two. He's also got a slightly twisted role in Robert Altman's upcoming Shortcuts, and he's still fending off agents who saw him in The Player. <p>If national attention has fazed him, it's impossible to tell. Lovett's still happily rooted in Texas, living on a piece of land that's been in his family since the 1840s. "Getting off the plane in the Houston heat, I don't mind that the back of my shirt is completely soaked through by the time I get to the car," he says. "I'm home."<p>Where To Stay: "One of my favorite hotels is the Wyndham Warwick [5701 Main Street]. When you look out the windows, oak trees are lining both sides of Main Street." <p>Favorite mexican restaurant: "Doneraki [2836 Fulton Street] is an old service station disguised as a restaurant. The tables are where the gas pumps used to be, and the restrooms are out around the outside of the building. They've got a mariachi band every night, and the best chicken fajitas and carne asada anywhere, plus menudo on weekends." <p>Where to buy a Western hat: "The Hat Store [5587 Richmond Avenue]. It's where my Dad bought his hats, and where I buy mine."<p>Favorite Nightspot: "My musical home is Anderson Fair Retail Restaurant [2007 Grant Street], the first place I ever played my own songs. Rockefeller's [3620 Washington Avenue] in the Heights neighborhood is also great. It used to be an old state bank, so of course the dressing room is in the vault." <p>Favorite All-Night Haunt: "Andy's Home Cafe [1115 East 11th Street]. They haven't got a liquor license, but they've got the best huevos rancheros at 2 a.m. It's the kind of place police go at night__which is great, because someone's car or tires or battery always seem to be getting stolen while you're inside. They make this warm mild salsa, and this green chile salsa that's so hot it'll bring tears to your eyes."<p>On a Free Afternoon: "Go to the Astrodome [Loop 610 at Kirby Drive], the eighth wonder of the world. They finished it in 1964, when I was a kid, and I remember it had one of the first fantastic scoreboards. It would light up like a fireworks display." <p>Where To Relax: "I hit Carter's Country gun range [6231 Treschwig Road]. I don't play golf, but shooting skeet with a 12- or 20-gauge seems to me the same kind of thing__concentrating so hard on one thing that your mind doesn't allow anything else in."<p> <p><p><p>

At 37, Jack Clark should be moving into the twilight of his career as a great home run hitter, a millionaire many times over. Instead he's bankrupt, out of baseball, and barely hanging on to a rented condo in California. Here's his story, Chapter 11 and verse.<p>By John Strahinich<p>From Ty Cobb to Yogi Berra, professional baseball players have long been known as tightwads. Berra, for one, would eat at the ballpark after games rather than risk getting stuck with the check at a restaurant. The advent of the million-dollar contract did little to change the image. Sportswriters joke that ballplayers are the cheapest millionaires on earth. <p>But Jack Clark was a different story. He had earned the nickname Jack the Ripper early in his big-league career as a power-hitting outfielder with the San Francisco Giants. Off the field, he acquired another name: Jack the Tipper. Clark would think nothing of handing a batboy a $100 bill for a sandwich and some odds and ends and telling the kid to keep the change. As he carried his high-priced bat from the Giants to the St. Louis Cardinals, the New York Yankees, the San Diego Padres, and, finally, the Boston Red Sox, he became known for his unfailing generosity with clubhouse managers, front-office secretaries, and public-relations flacks. In 1991, Clark was listed among the ten most generous ballplayers in a Sports Illustrated survey. When he signed his first million-dollar contract in 1982, one of the first things he did was buy his parents a house.<p>But there was a dark side to his largesse. Clark was spending much more than he was making. And he was making a lot. In the middle of the most lucrative contract of his career__a three-year, $8.7 million deal signed with the Red Sox in 1990__he was still nearly $7 million in debt. <p>Late in the 1992 season, Clark found himself in the training room at Yankee Stadium, trying to explain his predicament to a small group of baseball writers. It was hours before game time, and Clark was in no hurry to rejoin his Boston teammates in the locker room. The Red Sox, destined for their worst finish in 60 years, weren't going anywhere anyway. And Clark, the team's designated hitter, was slogging through the worst season of his 18-year professional career. <p>A few weeks earlier Clark had hinted to the Boston Globe that his shabby performance had something to do with off-the-field distractions: his mother's deteriorating health and some financial problems of his own. But he hadn't gone into much detail. Away from the hometown press, he was hoping that the story he was about to tell might be downplayed. With a pack of Marlboros rolled up in his sleeve '50s-style, he chain-smoked and talked about his financial woes. At the age of 36, he told the reporters, he was finally ready to kick his spending habit and open a new chapter in his life.<p>Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, to be exact.<p>
Going broke is supposed to be easy. Since the bankruptcy codes were revised 15 years ago, the United States has had the most liberal bankruptcy rules in the world. Consequently, in 1992 more than 900,000 bankruptcies were registered in federal courts across the country__the eighth straight year of record filings. But while the mechanics of the bankruptcy process have been streamlined, a typical filing is still fraught with angst, uncertainty, and humiliation. <p>Jack Clark thought filing would be painless, but he sooned learned otherwise. "Basically I had been ready for a lifestyle change," he says. "I got overextended, and the bills all kind of cropped up at the same time. And I never caught a break."<p>The full extent of Clark's compulsive spending was evident in the court papers he filed in Orange County, California, where he still lives. He listed assets of $4,781,780 and liabilities of $11,459,305.97. But, as in baseball, the numbers tell only part of the story. <p>Just before the filing, he had bought three top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benzes, bringing his fleet of luxury automobiles to 18, not including the four cars he was leasing for his family. He had bought a new $2.4 million house built near a golf course in a posh suburb of Oakland. He and his family would never move into that house, because Clark ordered $1 million worth of interior decorating changes once construction was complete. Credit cards had also proved a irresistible temptation. He owed <a name="NYSE:AXP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10085"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Express</b></a> $55,955.17, Nordstrom's $37,000, and Visa $19,820.78. Finally, there was the drag-racing team he had underwritten__it had drained another $1 million.<p>
Cars were always a great temptation to Jack Clark. Perhaps that was because some of his fondest childhood memories were of going with his father to the drag races in Pomona, a small city in suburban Los Angeles, not far from Asuza, where Clark grew up. Car racing was one of the few interests the elder Clark shared with his son. Most nights Ralph Clark would come home nauseated from inhaling fumes during a long day at the paint factory where he worked, eat dinner, and go straight to bed.<p>The younger Clark was determined to avoid such a fate. He raced hot rods in high school, but soon grew too big to consider doing it professionally. Fortunately, Clark was a gifted athlete. His six-foot-three-inch, 200-pound frame proved perfectly suited for smashing baseballs. He was scouted by the major leagues his senior year, during which he batted a staggering .517 at Gladstone High, and he signed with the Giants after graduating in 1973. Three years later, he was in the big leagues. His timing couldn't have been better. The modern era of free agency and million-dollar contracts had just begun.<p>Clark averaged 20 home runs and 80 runs batted in during his eight full seasons with the Giants. He regularly made the All-Star team, and in 1982 he struck pay dirt, signing a five-year pact worth $5.3 million. But he was often injured and criticized for spending too much time on the disabled list. He was constantly compared with the other great Giants sluggers, Hall of Famers Willie Mays and Willie McCovey. Jack the Ripper soon became Jack the Ripped, vilified by the fans, the press, even management. He responded in kind, taking his rips at the fans, the Giants' frigid ballpark, the press, and his coaches.<p>Off the field, Clark was faring better. He bought a house for his parents in Danville, California. He married, too, and started a family. In 1980, his wife Tamara gave birth to the first of their four children.<p>As Clark started making more money, he also attracted swarms of financial advisors who were eager to help a new millionaire handle his wealth. "Baseball players get approached by so many people, with so many ideas, from Arabian horses to restaurants," he says. "And we don't have the time to focus. And most of us aren't wizards to begin with."<p>Clark recalls getting burned by two such advisors. They had him investing in oil-and-gas leases in the Sunbelt, over-leveraged real estate in Atlantic City, and lithographs by unknown artists. When the IRS cracked down on tax shelters in the mid-'80s, Clark was hit with hefty penalties and forced to pay interest accrued on back taxes. As for the advisors, "One guy left the country, and the other guy ended up in jail," Clark says.<p>Clark decided that he'd had enough with financial advisors. He hired his father to keep his books and pay his bills. That left him free to concentrate on baseball, and in 1985 he led his new team, the St. Louis Cardinals, to the National League pennant.<p>
Buoyed by his play for the Cardinals, Clark drifted back to his first love__cars. He started collecting them as a hobby. His first acquisitions were '50s muscle cars__a $15,000 1957 Bel Air, an $80,000 '57 Thunderbird, a $42,000 '55 <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford</b></a> Crown Victoria, a $36,000 '57 Plymouth Fury, a $39,000 '57 Lincoln Coupe, and a $63,000 '57 Lincoln Premiere convertible. <p>In 1988 he signed a two-year, $3 million deal with the New York Yankees. But the home runs didn't come, and after one season he was traded to the San Diego Padres, who agreed to pay the increasingly unproductive slugger $2 million per year. By this time, Clark's appetite for expensive automobiles had expanded. He was now buying Ferraris.<p>The market for Ferraris had traditionally been made up of rich collectors who were content to watch the value of their cars rise a steady 10 percent per year. But after Enzo Ferrari died in August 1988, the cars he'd designed started appreciating 10 percent a month, which attracted speculators and forced prices up even further. In 1989, Clark paid nearly $200,000 for a Ferrari Mondial. In 1990, he spent $717,000 on one of the 180 Ferrari F-40's shipped to the United States that year. Within months, the car's value shot up to more than $1.2 million. But the value fell just as fast. By the fall of 1990, Clark's Ferraris were worth less than half of what he had paid for them.<p>Clark remained oblivious. "Jack is a car guy," says Brandon Lawrence, sales manager at Walnut Creek Ferrari, in Walnut Creek, California, where Clark was a customer. "He never bought cars to make money on them. He just happened to buy when everything was going down."<p>Clark's "auto frenzy," as he calls it, was soon the talk of the major leagues. Stories circulated. One afternoon, according to one such story, Clark and San Diego teammate Mike Pagliarulo made plans to take their kids to the movies. Clark decided to run some errands during the film, and left his kids with Pagliarulo. When the movie let out, Clark drove up in another new Ferrari that he had just purchased. Another time, Clark grew tired of one of his BMWs a few days after buying it, and sold it to Pagliarulo for a fraction of the original price.<p>When the 1990 season ended, so did Clark's two-year, $4-million contract with the Padres. Clark was a free agent once again, and the market for sluggers, unlike that for Ferraris, was still rising. He caught on with the Red Sox, signing the three-year, $8.7 million deal. And, feeling flush, he decided that it was time to go from collecting cars to racing them. That fall he started the Jack Clark Racing Team, equipping the new venture with a high-priced dragster and driver. <p>It seemed like a good idea at the time. There was money to be made in racing and Clark wasn't going it alone. He had found a cosponsor, <a name="NYSE:MBL"></a><b>Mobil</b> One motor oil. But some people saw that he was on shaky ground. "Jack Clark," says one sports attorney, "was a train wreck waiting to happen."<p>
Clark's first inkling that he was in financial trouble came in early 1991, just before he joined the Red Sox. He was making more than ever, but beyond his rapidly depreciating auto collection, he had little to show for his millions.<p>Clark decided that what he needed was someone who could put him on a budget. Enter Mark Gillam, a 30-year-old financial manager with offices near Sacramento, California, who counts among his clients Clark's former Yankees teammate Steve Sax. Gillam's advice was simple. Forget real estate. Stop collecting cars. Invest conservatively, in blue-chip stocks, tax-free municipal bonds, and T-bills.<p>Clark's father had long argued along the same lines. But Clark found his father old-fashioned, out of step with the times, even embarrassing. Ralph was always expecting the worst, even in the best of times. "His dad is a put-your-money-in-the-mattress kind of guy," says Gillam. "You can listen to your folks, but when you're independent like Jack is, it doesn't always have an effect."<p>Gillam drew up a financial road map, and for a while Clark followed it. For a short while. In June of 1991 the ballplayer reverted to form, laying out close to $400,000 for a share in a seafood restaurant in San Ramon, California__an illiquid investment if ever there was one.<p>Clark can't really explain why he discounted Gillam's advice. "I wasn't trusting anybody 100 percent like I had before," he says. Gillam tries to remain philosophical about Clark's detour from the plan: "You can only give people road maps," he says. "Getting them there is a very different science that you have very little control over."<p>The racing team wasn't working out either. In the fall of 1991, Mobil One withdrew. Mobil's contribution had never been large, but now Clark was forced to pay all of the hefty expenses of keeping a dragster running. By the following spring, he was forced to fold__$1 million poorer. The experience with racing hardly chastened him, though; he kept on spending. Having just bought the new home in Danville, a rambling mission-style affair, he laid out $1 million for the post-construction redesign. ("Jack loves tiles," says Gillam by way of explanation.) <p>And he kept collecting cars. He'd given up on Ferraris. Instead, he bought Mercedes-Benzes. In 1992 he paid more than $100,000 each for a black 500SL coupe and a white 500SL sedan, and more than $140,000 for a black 600SL sedan. <p>Gillam was alarmed by his client's spending, but he was hardly surprised. He had seen the same pattern of reckless spending in other successful athletes. "Baseball is a surrealistic occupation," he says. "It's hard for players to come to terms with the fact that money isn't readily available in a neverending stream." <p>In the spring of 1992 Clark started falling behind on his car loans, mortgage payments, and interior-design bills. The banks and his other creditors started turning on the pressure. Clark was hounded by phone calls at home, on the road, even in the clubhouse at Fenway Park. Gillam met with the creditors throughout the summer, but they were unwilling to extend Clark's credit. They knew what the slugger was making__news of his contract had been in all the papers. They wanted their money. <p>In June, Clark's mother, Jennie, suffered a viral infection of the aorta and required open-heart surgery. After the operation she returned home, but her medical and nursing bills ran as high as $14,000 a month. He could hardly afford another obligation. He had already asked the Red Sox to alter his payment schedule to help him fend off his creditors, and he owed the IRS another $400,000 in taxes. When the Red Sox declined to help him out with a loan, Clark turned to his financial manager for help. This time, Gillam had a new map to show him__a bankruptcy filing.<p>Overnight, Clark became the symbol of the millionaire athlete run amok. "When some athlete asks to have his contract renegotiated because 'I have to do what's best for my family,' is he saying that his family is being forced to survive on a mere 15 or 16 sets of wheels?" wrote Sports Illustrated's Leigh Montville shortly afterward. <p>It seemed the only people offering any understanding were other ballplayers. "It's got to be very tough for him, this happening in a very public game like this," says Minnesota Twins designated hitter Dave Winfield, a former teammate of Clark's. "He's a rich baseball player, and people don't have much sympathy for someone in his situation." Even Tony Gwynn, the Padres star with whom Clark had a highly publicized feud during the 1990 season when the two were teammates, empathizes. Gwynn too has been through bankruptcy, and those memories cut deeper than his animosity toward Clark. "I feel sorry for him," Gwynn said.<p>
Chronic shoulder injuries ended Clark's 1992 season early. In late August he cleaned out his locker at Fenway Park for what would be the last time and joined his wife and children in the family's newly rented condominium in Newport Beach, California. Bankruptcy didn't seem so bad. He was hoping to put the whole mess behind him by spring training, and to find a way to protect the $2.4 million that the Red Sox owed him for the 1993 season. <p>That same month, he refiled his petition under Chapter 11 of the bankrutpcy code, in large part so that he could retain control of his remaining assets and future income. Under Chapter 7, he would have had to liquidate all of those assets in order to pay his debts. With the Chapter 11 filing he would be able to hold on to those assets, assuming he could come up with a reorganization plan to pay off his creditors.<p>The following month Clark's hopes for a clean getaway were dashed. His creditors accused him of hiding some of his assets, among them his '57 Bel Air. The U.S. bankruptcy trustee agreed with Clark's creditors and filed a motion to have Clark's reorganization plan seized__a highly unusual move in Chapter 11 proceedings. The court granted the motion. Clark and Gillam insist that they had been operating in good faith all along. "Some debtors don't want to pay back debts," Gillam says. "That wasn't Jack Clark's case. His intention was always to pay back his debts." But the creditors wouldn't cut him any slack. "I firmly believe that if Jack was Joe Jones," says Gillam, "they would been a lot more understanding. But because he was Jack Clark, the baseball player, they had no sympathy."<p>The court's decision meant that Clark had to surrender control of his finances to an independent trustee, Charles Daff, who had handled Clark's original Chapter 7 filing. Daff hired Rus, Miliband, Williams & Smith, a law firm based in Irvine, California, to take charge of Clark's money while a reorganization plan was drafted. Clark finally had a keeper. He was also broke.<p>To Clark, bankruptcy was both a blessing and a curse. "When you file," he says, "you get a tremendous amount of protection, but now you've got a trustee who's calling all the shots in your life. And if you cross him, watch out. He's like the IRS ... or God."<p>The following December brought more bad news for Clark. His creditors got wind of the estimated $1.6 million owed him as a result of a 1987 court suit brought by the players' union against the major-league owners for colluding to keep baseball salaries down by hindering the movement of free agents. None of the players were expected to collect on the settlement until 1994 at the earliest. But that didn't stop his creditors from filing a motion with the trustee. <p>Clark's attorneys tried to block the motion, arguing that his collusion money ought to be protected in much the same way that endowments and annuities are. Once again the court ruled against Clark. And once again he was left to wonder whether Chapter 11 offered any protection. "One day they were going after expensive pieces of steel," he says. "The next day they're going after money that isn't even there. It's a cold, cold deal."<p>In February 1993 Clark reported to the Red Sox training camp 20 pounds overweight and hobbled by a hip injury that had flared up during the off-season. Consumed by his financial woes, he was on the horn with Gillam and his attorneys every chance he could get. For the Red Sox, who were purging their problem players, Clark had become dead weight. He was released during the first week of training camp.<p>By March, Clark's outlook brightened, albeit briefly. He was back on the dragster circuit, thanks to Taco Bell, which put up $1 million in backing. A few weeks later, he was back in baseball as well, signed by the Montreal Expos, a pennant contender greatly in need of a right-handed slugger. Still overweight and still distracted, he joined the Expos in Florida, but his late start and lack of conditioning had put him too far behind the other players. When the team broke camp and traveled north for the new season, Clark agreed to stay in West Palm Beach and continue working out with the Expos' single-A team in the Florida State League, the lowest rung of the minor leagues.<p>April would be the cruelest month of Clark's financial ordeal. For the first time in 17 years, he wasn't in the dugout on opening day. Instead, he was in West Palm Beach, broke, alone, and still waiting for the first paycheck under the new budget plan that Gillam was negotiating with Rus, Miliband. He tried to concentrate on baseball, but he was too distracted. One night, his distraught wife called to tell him that the landlord was threatening to evict her and the kids from their condo. A few nights later, she called to tell him that the power had been turned off. Then his attorneys called, summoning him back to California: Four of his bank creditors had filed civil suits, seeking further protection in case the reorganization somehow went awry.<p>In the last week of April, Rus, Miliband finally submitted Clark's reorganization plan to the creditors for a vote. The plan called for 100 percent payback of all of Clark's unsecured debts over the next 12 months. That came to a little more than $2 million, a far cry from the original $11.5 million Clark had appeared to owe, but most of those claims had been canceled out when the various assets__his house, his cars, and so on__were returned to the secured creditors.<p>Clark had to agree to sell his parents' house. He would have to live on $23,700 a month during the baseball season and half that amount during the off-season__a large cut in pay from the $400,000 a month he had been pulling down at the time his bankruptcy was filed. As Gillam said to one of the Rus, Miliband lawyers, however, "This may be the best thing to happen to Jack. He's finally on a budget."<p>In a year's time, Clark's creditors would be collecting 100 cents on every dollar they had lent him__a payback that was virtually unheard of in Chapter 11 reorganizations. Clark, on the other hand, would be walking away with about $450,000 in total assets, which worked out to about a nickel on every dollar of the estimated $20 million he had earned in the big leagues.<p>That closed the books on Jack Clark the bankrupt. Jack Clark the ballplayer was cut by Montreal last June, but he still hopes to make a comeback next season. He's been spending the 1993 baseball season taking in his son's Little League games, catching his daughters' plays, and trying to enjoy his first summer off in two decades.<p>The worst of the ordeal is over, and though Clark clearly seems committed to reforming his reckless ways, it's not clear what he's learned. In one instant, he says, "Bankruptcy is like a big chess game that nobody wins." In the next: "It's not as bad as it seems." And a moment later: "It was a lot tougher than people think."<p>In the end, though, Jack Clark betrays a bitter wisdom: "There's no way to really understand this unless you go through it. You just have to be ready for a clusterf__ day in and day out until it's over."<p>

						 <p>By Carla Koehl<p>Ah, those Chicagoans. When they aren't slogging through another murder case, they're sitting back, slugging down beer in some Polish bar under the El tracks. As the lawyer-turned-novelist Scott Turow tells it, that's how things work in his brilliantly decaying fictional version of the Windy City. <p>Turow has set his newest murder-mystery, Pleading Guilty, against the relentlessly gray skies of a fictional Kindle County, a place that bears more than a passing resemblance to Turow's native Cook County. After witnessing Presumed Innocent and Burden of Proof unfold under the same somber skies, it's reassuring to find the author's own Chicago isn't the least bit grim.<p>Best business lunch: "The Berghoff [17 West Adams] is a great old Chicago institution where you never get a bad meal. Let's just call the service brusque and efficient__no one lingers trying to make you feel like they're your pal."<p>How to pass for a native: "If you do nothing else, pronounce the city right: It's 'Chicawwlgo.' Otherwise, you ain't from here. Also, you can't look too chi-chi here, or everyone'll think you're one of those film directors who's been swarming around lately. Right now, the definitive Chicago apparel has some kind of tie to the Bulls. Even Bears apparel, if worn elegantly, is very in__like maybe a $400 leather jacket with the Bears logo on it....Speak reverently of Michael Jordan; speak mournfully of the Cubs."<p>Where to stay: "The Four Seasons [120 East Delaware] is reliably exquisite, and the level of everything there is the best, including the food."<p>Best breakfast:"You've got to experience Lou Mitchell's [565 West Jackson]. What you love about Lou Mitchell's is Lou. He hands out Milk Duds at the door. I went in there once with Tillie Olsen, who's beautiful, and he regaled her with Milk Duds."<p>Best barber: "The classic spot is The Barber Shop at the Drake Hotel [140 E. Walton] complete with straight-razor shave." <p>If you have only one day in town: "Get seats right behind the Cubs dugout at Wrigley Field [1060 West Addison]....If you like contemporary art, take a look at the Jan Cicero Gallery [221 West Erie] and the Cortland Leyten Galleries [815 North Milwaukee]."<p>If you have only one night in town: "Go to the Green Mill on a Thursday night [4802 North Broadway]. It's rumored to be an old Al Capone hangout, with an escape hatch under the piano....Also, the theater is outstanding here__much less shtick than going in New York."<p>Where to sweat: "Without question, the Division Street Russian Baths [1916 West Division]." Writes Turow in Pleading Guilty, "'Seedy' is not the word for the Russian Bath; better 'prehistoric.'...Time would wear it down, but ne'er destroy it: the sort of atmosphere that the Irish perpetuate in every bar."<p> <p>

						 <p>
By John Loring<p>
In 1988, having apprenticed with couturiers Geoffrey Beene, Mary McFadden, and Todd Oldham, and having organized his own ready-to-wear clothing company, 24-year-old John Innes gave up the rag trade to study textiles. <p>
He describes his education at New York's Fashion Institute of Technology and London's Middlesex Polytechnic Institute as a rough mix: half Ballets Russes and half Bauhaus. "It was handy in my case," he says. "Textile design is one part Scheherazade to one part Walter Gropius."<p>
Everything in Innes's life is strictly by design. His Dalmatian has only a few stylishly placed black spots. A massive Corinthian column is strategically placed in his Manhattan penthouse. Overscaled friezes and moldings give his deep madder-colored living room more the look of an upper floor flat in London's Eaton Square than that of an Upper East Side apartment. Even the flowers in his roof garden have a color scheme: red one season, blue the next. <p>
Two years ago, Innes purchased an aggressively patterned 1920s ceramic lamp at New York's Sixth Avenue Flea Market and began collecting the highly designed art deco ceramics of Charles Catteau. Since then, a phalanx of Catteau vases and bowls has invaded practically every bookshelf, tabletop, and counter of his living room.<p>
Catteau's stylized plants, animals, and flowers made him a star of art deco and won him a first prize at the great Paris Exposition des Arts Decoratifs of 1925, the legendary show that influenced 20th century design.<p>
Innes loves the ceramicist's extreme, almost cartoon-like forms and Catteau's spirit of populism. "We're both for high-style design," he says, "with broad enough appeal that it can be mass produced. Catteau's best work was done for distribution through three Paris department stores: the Printemps, the Bon Marche, and the Galeries Lafayette."<p>
Good news for the collector: Catteau's work shows up all over. Innes has found vases at major dealers in London, Paris, and New York, but they also turn up in improbable places. "Recently I discovered a favorite at a summer antiques show at the Allegan County Fairgrounds in central Michigan." The find turned out to be an early Catteau, Innes recalls. The highly stylized red and yellow flowers and blue ribbons draped down the vase's sides "divide the piece into panels, or patterns, almost like fashion patterns. <p>
"Catteau's preferred way to design patterns was to study plants and flowers 'sandwiched' between two parallel mirrors, kaleidoscope fashion. Beyond that, I can see that he was just crazy about the old-fashioned, basic beauty of nature that he saw everywhere. And so am I."<p>

						The Wealth of Kings
Stephen King and his wife, Tabitha, are obviously well-grounded individuals who do not need all the materialistic trappings to lead a happy and fulfilled life (<a HREF="http://www.worth.com/articles/Z9701F02.html">King of Bangor</A>"," December/January). How refreshing it is to finally read about a successful couple who are giving something back by making their community a better place in which to live and by helping the less fortunate. Bill Gates and his ilk should take lessons from the Kings.

Right Angles?
Andrew Tobias seems quite taken by his "Amazing Math: Wine by the Case" ("<a HREF="http://www.worth.com/articles/Z9701U04.html">Money Angles</A>," December/January), but his analysis is just silly. While buying anything at a discount (when one would buy it anyhow) yields a saving, to call that saving a return on investment is a distortion of what investing entails. And Tobias doesn't consider the loss of interest on the money "borrowed" to buy a case, because one either draws on savings or actually takes a loan to make up the weekly cost of buying a single bottle. Using his view of investing, I propose a more lucrative scheme: Every day, do not buy several cases of wine. Then one would save nine dollars for each bottle not bought, yielding a huge return on investment. Since the cost of the investment is zero, the percent gain is infinite.
Gerald K. Schoenfeld

Anyone who takes Andrew Tobias's advice on buying airline tickets is in for an unpleasant surprise. True, tickets can be changed for a $50 fee, but only at the fare in effect at the time of the change. The cost is $50 plus the difference between the new fare and the original fare. Travelers would be well advised to consult a travel agent rather than a money manager when planning a trip.

Index We Trust
From your recommendations in "Our Favorite Equity Funds" ("<Mutual Fund Laboratory," December/January), I picked out for special attention the five large-company growth funds and the best-performing of the small-company growth funds. I compared the one-year performance of these six funds to the Vanguard Index Total Stock Market Portfolio. It turns out that only two of the six outperformed the index fund and that, on average, they underperformed by more than three percentage points. Do any of the four underperformers qualify as what you announce will be "consistent top performer[s], achieving superior returns"? For that matter, how much would you bet that the two superior performers will continue to beat the market? It's an old story but a true one: Expenses persist and performance does not. Most managed funds -- including many a favorite -- underperform the market. So why not go to an indexed fund? And if the case for this option makes sense, why not add to your selection a 21st fund: Vanguard Total Stock Market?

The Drive to Excel
"<a HREF="http://www.worth.com/articles/Z9701F02.html">Selling the Dream</A>" (December/January) must have been written by Excel to help sell costlier long-distance service. Last year, an acquaintance asked me if I would like to save 30 to 50 percent on my long-distance telephone bill. I replied that I was looking for better rates, but that I already spent only 13.4 cents a minute, 24 hours a day, seven days a week with LDDS. He would not tell me his (Excel's) rates; he just wanted to tell me about this get-rich-quick scheme. His only interest was in signing me up, not saving me money. He never did give me his rates. I went around him and directly contacted Excel, which quoted a business rate of 17 cents a minute, 27 percent higher than what I was paying then and 56 percent higher than my current 10.9 cents a minute with Destiny Telecom International.

The Planning Business
The 11,000 members of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners are disappointed with contributing editor William P. Barrett's assessment of our professional association as a "marketing organization" in your October 1996 issue. If, by marketing, Barrett means that the institute vigorously promotes and represents the interests of its members, who have met the highest examination and education standards in the profession of financial planning; that the institute actively works to enhance public understanding of the importance of personal financial planning; and that the institute develops advanced-level educational programs to ensure that its members hone their knowledge and skills to better serve their clients, then this is an appropriate interpretation of our mission as an association.

Follow-up
Isis Pharmaceuticals, our pick as the "<a HREF="http://www.worth.com/articles/Z9606C.html">Next Microsoft</A>" (June 1996), took a few steps toward achieving that goal in late November and early December, when the biotechnology company picked up another 11 patents, bringing its total to more than 80. Perhaps more important for investors, on December 3, German pharmaceutical maker Boehringer Ingelheim made a $10 million milestone payment to Isis to mark the completion of Phase IIa clinical trials for one of the company's antisense inhibitors used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Isis, which had traded as high as $24.75 a share and as low as $10.38 in the previous 52 weeks, was at $18.75 in mid-December.<p>

						World Series broadcasts move into a computer age<p>
In the old days, people sneaked transistor radios into work to listen to the World Series. But in the days of personal CD players, who even has a transistor anymore? In the modern age, the way to sneak in some Series action is to tune in via computer.<p>
For the first time, this year's Series will be broadcast via baseball's site on the World Wide Web (<A HREF="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com">http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com</A>). The site will also have downloadable photos and stories available while games are in progress, as well as 3-D virtual tours of the ballparks of the Series competitors.<p>
Fans will need a computer with multimedia capabilities and a modem with 14,400 baud speed to listen to the broadcast. The AudioNet home page (<A HREF="http://www.audionet.com">http://www.audionet.com</A>) provides software for downloading, as well as a schedule of other sporting events to tune in to, so fans can make a trial run.<p>
Of course, all the games this year will be at night, so even West Coasters won't be distracted during the heart of the workday. But these days, who's going home before 8 p.m. anyway?<p>

						Doubt him if you wish. Hate him if you must. Get rich off him if you can. The world's best virologist doesn't give a damn about anything except curing AIDS.<p>By Vincent Coppola<p>Robert Gallo leans forward across the table, intense and staring. "Now, be fair," he says without a trace of humility. "Who would you go to if you wanted to form a great institute of virology?"<p>The question floats, rhetorical, in the quiet restaurant. Then Gallo whacks resoundingly at the near-silence.<p>"Me!"<p>Gallo catches himself, shrugging at his naked need for attention. This, he knows, is what has cost him endless grief and agita, probably even the Nobel Prize. "No," he says more quietly. "I can't say that." But Gallo has spoken the truth, and this time, he is betting, the truth will redeem him.<p>More than anyone, Robert Gallo is the embodiment of AIDS research in the United States. He was the man who proved that the virus now known as HIV, for human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS; he was the man who developed the test that safeguards the world's blood supply against the disease. He holds or shares 79 patents, and his discoveries have generated more than $1 billion in private-sector revenues.<p>Gallo, 59, is also a figure of immense controversy, pilloried by AIDS activists and suspected -- and later cleared -- by his peers of stealing a competitor's work. He was pointedly snubbed for a Nobel Prize, which, in retrospect, he probably deserved. In the 1980s, Soviet-bloc commentators even accused him of creating AIDS as a biological weapon.<p>His own pronouncements haven't helped: He has dismissed some HIV-positive critics, for example, as muddled because of the virus's effect on their brains. He charges that activists are deflecting research away from an AIDS vaccine because they have the disease already.<p>In short, whatever Gallo does attracts enormous attention. So it was big news when, in 1995, he abandoned his 30-year career at the National Institutes of Health to head his own research center, the Institute of Human Virology in Baltimore. After 15 years on the trail of an AIDS cure, years of triumph and howling frustration, Gallo now believes enough machinery is in place to allow capitalism to take over. "I have a strong feeling the government can't solve the problem," he says. "It's more solvable from the private side."<p>And more lucrative. In 1981, AIDS was an obscure illness that in the U.S. afflicted mostly an unpopular subculture. Today it is a multibillion-dollar industry employing thousands and serving an ever expanding market. Seventeen million people worldwide are infected with HIV. That number, coupled with the immense profit AIDS therapies can generate, has drawn scores of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies into the hunt. Sales for Glaxo-Wellcome's AZT, a drug that slows the disease, topped $317 million last year.<p>Gallo's plunge into the private sector -- his institute contains a for-profit arm -- makes the trend official: AIDS is no longer just a public-health issue; it is big business, and from now on the fight against it will be conducted accordingly. Says Reijer Lenstra, a securities analyst for Smith Barney: "People are counting on him -- to make money."<p>As head of the Institute of Human Virology, Gallo will draw on $12 million in seed money from the state of Maryland and the city of Baltimore. And he has carte blanche to speed his discoveries to market through a private company, Omega Biotherapies, of which he is a founder and part owner.<p>Yet money doesn't completely explain Gallo's zeal to defeat AIDS (which sets him apart from many of the huge drug companies with which he'll compete). He's expending his effort on a vaccine, for example, though AIDS treatments are more profitable. Friends say he seems almost obsessed with AIDS -- an aging Ahab chasing the whale. "We do what our neuroses make us do," Gallo says. "It's a chemical reaction of some kind. I have no choice."<p>This operatic attitude is fundamental to Gallo. Even with strangers, his conversation veers wildly -- by turns flamboyant, melancholic, introspective. One minute he's describing arcane viral proteins, the next a grocer who sells him buffalo-milk mozzarella. Leonardo da Vinci, Salieri, the angel Gabriel, Lucifer -- all make appearances at Gallo's table, usually as self-references. Inflamed by such self-drama, Gallo is setting out to lead the biotechnology industry and its investors -- not to mention himself -- to their greatest, most profitable victory.<p>His turbulent life story, meanwhile, reveals another level to the fight. In his most private moments, one suspects, Gallo sees AIDS as the final showdown between himself and the God who let him down.<p>As a teenager, Robert Gallo lived in a house without music or Christmas. He was just 11 years old when his younger sister, Judith, was stricken with leukemia, sending a close-knit family spinning into chaos.<p>Gallo's father, Francis, had built a successful metallurgy company in Waterbury, Connecticut. The dour son of a northern-Italian immigrant, Francis Gallo was a workaholic who spent his evenings poring over trade journals, an agnostic who had shed the rituals of Catholicism. Gallo's mother, Louise, was just the opposite, a happily religious woman and part of a big southern-Italian family. <p>The young Gallo gravitated to his mother's side of the family -- all the grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins made him feel like he was at the center of things. He enjoyed the fun, the food, the argument and debate. Tall and rangy, he also developed a love for basketball. "In winter," he says, "we'd put rugs over the ice and keep playing."<p>When Judith grew sick, however, the family changed. Gallo spent weeks with relatives while his parents traveled to different hospitals. When he saw Judith for the last time, Gallo later told The Washington Post, she was "a ghost, a concentration camp victim." Her death settled over the family like a shroud.<p>Francis Gallo returned to the church, donating money, chanting rosaries, attending mass daily. "My father went to Judith's grave twice a day," Gallo says. "He made the rounds of every room where he had a picture of her, holding and kissing it." Celebration and happiness were banned; Robert was permanently displaced as a focus of love and attention.<p>Gallo blamed God for stealing his childhood. At 14, he began to abandon his family for the poolrooms and glass-strewn parks of Waterbury. He got drunk on cheap gin and lime rickeys. At a memorial service six years after Judith's death, a tormented Gallo stood up and shouted at his father, "When will this end?"<p>Gallo grew into a guaglione, a street-corner wise guy ready to challenge or shout down anyone who dared to get close to him. The streetwise bullying carried over into his adulthood: Even as a 50-year-old man, Gallo was famous for throwing elbows in pickup basketball games.<p>But other forces were stirring, too. As a child, he admired the scientific curiosity of an uncle who was a zoologist. His sister's illness provided him with another role model: Judith's pathologist. "My father wanted to kill him for not curing her," says Gallo, "but Marcus Cox was smart as a whip and critical of all other doctors." Cox lured Gallo off the basketball courts. Medicine became adventure, chemistry a challenge. "I got very focused," Gallo says. "And then consumed."<p>At Thomas Jefferson University School of Medicine in Philadelphia, Gallo discovered he couldn't bear to be around sick people -- a holdover, perhaps, from his sister's death. But microbiology, biochemistry, enzymes, genes, viruses -- these excited his passion. In 1965, after a residency at the University of Chicago, Gallo applied to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. "I went there to learn research," he says. "But I found myself in the childhood leukemia ward. A lot of kids died. This was too much."
He escaped once more to the lab, this time decisively. Research was like basketball; he would go one-on-one with God.<p>At the NIH, buildings are named after politicians who deliver funding -- Lowell Weicker, Claude Pepper, Sylvio Conti -- rarely after scientists who deliver breakthroughs. "When researchers leave," Gallo says, "they don't even name a toilet after you."<p>To some people, an honorary toilet might seem a fitting memorial to Bob Gallo's time at the facility, where he was as famous for his fulminating ego as for his genius. But Gallo's track record at the NIH -- and the money he generated for the U.S. government as a result -- would be astounding even if he'd never been drawn to AIDS research.<p>Rising to become chief of the National Cancer Institute's Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, Gallo discovered the first human leukemia virus (an entity many scientists refused to believe existed) and a number of oncogenes, cancer-causing time bombs buried in human cells. With interleukin-2, a compound that mobilizes white blood cells to fight tumors, he added a potent weapon to the anti-cancer arsenal.<p>Outside the lab, Gallo sparked both intense loyalty and furious animosity. "Bob will run you over," says Anthony Fauci, an old friend and colleague who is now director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "He has this 'Screw you -- I'm the best and you're full of crap' attitude. He doesn't give a good goddamn who he pushes around -- or pushes aside. But then he'll say, 'I'm sorry, I love you.'"<p>Indeed, there was an unexpected vulnerability to the man. He poured out intimate details of his personal life, his troubled marriage, to colleagues and strangers alike. He emptied his pockets to street people and wore rumpled clothes. Yet he traveled like a lord and held good Italian food to be sacramental. "You never know if the guy wants to cure AIDS or go eat veal," says James Curran, dean of Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health.<p>Always pushing, always challenging, always pissing people off -- this was Robert Gallo at the NIH. "I get my stimulation out of trouble," he says with a wink. "The ferment gets me somewhere. But deep down I know I'm soft. I have no real enemies except myself." <p>That may have been true once, but it changed forever on April 23, 1984. That day, Gallo stood beaming alongside then U.S. health and human services secretary Margaret Heckler, facing a crowd of reporters and TV crews as he and Heckler announced to the world that "the probable cause of AIDS has been found." A blood test had been developed, Heckler said, and an AIDS vaccine would be available in a few years.<p>Along with this hopeful news, another message beamed out from the podium: This great triumph belonged to Robert Gallo.<p>The catfight that followed has been well hashed out, most notably in Randy Shilts's best-selling book And the Band Played On and in the subsequent TV movie, in which Alan Alda played Gallo like Rasputin, sealing Gallo's image as an unethical grandstander -- an image that persists to this day.<p>The immediate charge was that Gallo had stolen credit for the discovery of the AIDS virus from French researcher Luc Montagnier. Indeed, a year earlier Montagnier and his colleagues at the Pasteur Institute had isolated a virus (which they named LAV) from the lymph nodes of an AIDS patient -- a fact that was lost in the tumult of the Heckler press conference.<p>But the French scientists couldn't grow their virus or prove that it caused AIDS, things Gallo had done definitively. By all accounts, if Gallo had simply acknowledged Montagnier's contributions, he would have won the Nobel Prize for medicine. But he didn't and was condemned to wait years for a phone call that never came.<p>In part, Gallo was being slapped down for his hubris. But when it came out that he'd used a strain of the French virus -- the result, Gallo insists, of a laboratory contamination -- in developing his breakthrough blood test, Gallo found himself in a maelstrom. Now his fellow scientists didn't just brand him a boor; they sued him and called him a cheat.<p>Gallo eventually cleared his name when he proved he'd isolated the virus on his own. In 1993, the U.S. Office of Research Integrity dropped a bumbling, four-year investigation. Congressional investigators also backed off. Yet Gallo's reputation had been tarnished, perhaps forever. "Every time I think about it I grind my teeth," he says.<p>Had the flap been a street fight, the guaglione might have won. But Gallo's combative attitude didn't play well in the media spotlight. When Dani Bolognesi, director of the Center for AIDS Research at Duke University and a close friend of Gallo's, brought in media trainers to teach Gallo to handle the press better, he reacted, Bolognesi recalls with a laugh, "by practically throwing a punch at me."<p>Compounding these woes was Gallo's disastrous family life. In science, Gallo's voracious appetites have generally served him well; in personal relationships, they have driven him to the edge. Like his father, Gallo is a workaholic who has spent too many years straying from his wife and family. "Life was intense," he says, trying to explain.<p>Even before the discovery of the AIDS virus, Gallo's coups gave him the sort of sex appeal associated with stars in other fields: politicians, top executives, musicians. Wherever he went, he attracted eager graduate students, post-docs, nurses. And he traveled constantly. "I didn't have the discipline, fortitude, character, whatever it takes," Gallo says of those years. <p>His wife, Mary Jane -- Gallo's college sweetheart -- grew increasingly depressed. And the helix of advancement Gallo had cherished as a grandchild of immigrants was broken with their two sons, neither of whom finished college. "It's partially my fault," Gallo says. "I had a lot of marital problems."<p>Gallo insists his marriage is on the upswing. But he doesn't downplay the despair he helped bring to his family. "People wonder how I got through those horrible years," Gallo says, speaking of the AIDS controversies. "I got through them partly because I had worse problems at home."<p>The world changed during the years Gallo spent submerged in battles of his own making. As early as the Heckler press conference, money had begun to edge out science as the engine of AIDS research. Virologist M. G. Sarngadharan remembers a team of lawyers corralling members of Gallo's lab in the weeks before the historic announcement.<p>"Several of us had to work nights and weekends preparing patent applications," Sarngadharan says. The resulting forms -- which would generate hundreds of millions of dollars in blood-test revenue for the federal government -- were submitted a few hours before Heckler took the podium.<p>And that was just a start. The enormous sales of AZT, the first relatively effective AIDS treatment, brought a previously unmoved Wall Street rushing into the fight against HIV. A health crisis and scientific puzzle became what Smith Barney analyst Reijer Lenstra calls "a tremendous race for the next generation of therapies."<p>HIV is a chronic infection that requires lifelong medication. The annual cost of treating and caring for those with HIV in this country is an estimated $15 billion and rising. This is both a tragedy and a huge opportunity. "We're talking millions of infected people," says James Curran, who headed the original AIDS team at the Centers for Disease Control. "Millions of insured infected people. You come up with a drug that extends lives for just six months and everybody will want it."<p>Small wonder that HoffmannLa Roche, <a name="NYSE:MRK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merck</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:ABT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10030"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Abbott Laboratories</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:BMY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10232"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bristol-Myers Squibb</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:GLX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41781"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Glaxo-Wellcome</b></a> are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into AIDS research. "It's hard to find a major drug company that doesn't have at least one AIDS-related project in its portfolio," says Lenstra.<p>The boom extends to biotechnology, where a successful AIDS therapy is the Holy Grail for many smaller companies. Companies involved in AIDS research now make up roughly 10 percent of the field. Biotech stocks were up 80 percent in 1995, outperforming even the booming technology sector.  AIDS plays were "very hot," according to Bear Stearns's David Molowa. "They started hitting the milestones and delivering on promises they'd made years ago," Molowa says.<p>It is into this high-stakes ring that Gallo throws his hat. As soon as he was vindicated in the French virus mix-up, he stopped being an unacceptable risk for investors. Offers came quickly. Not the Harvard Medical School chair he might once have dreamed of, but solid opportunities in industry and academe. States saw Gallo as a magnet that would attract other investments: Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and the Carolinas, all eager to build their own biotech industries, each offered to construct an institute around him.<p>In the end, Maryland governor Parris Glendening (whose brother had died of AIDS) made the best bid. Maryland gave Gallo $9 million, while the city of Baltimore kicked in another $3 million. Gallo's research would be done under the auspices of the new institute at the University of Maryland at Baltimore, but his private company would be free to commercialize the results.<p>Gallo brings more than his reputation. He already has several promising projects on the fast track. Last fall, he identified what he called chemokines -- naturally occurring molecules that suppress HIV in vitro. These could prove a powerful treatment for AIDS. He's following up on the vaccine research of Jonas Salk and Daniel Zagury, and trying to develop a "vector vaccine," one that uses the smallpox virus to deliver particles that might trigger an immune response against HIV. He's developing a treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma, the deadly skin cancer seen in many AIDS patients.<p>Any of these paths could lead to a blockbuster product. "AIDS will soon drive the whole biotechnology field," Gallo predicts. "It will be worth ten times ten our efforts here."<p>Gallo's working style is best described as casually intense. At a recent seminar, his staff members, an elite drawn from the best medical and research centers in the world, loll around like bums: unkempt hair, beards, no socks, sweatshirts. Gallo himself slouches at the head of a conference table as a young Ph.D. named Raphael Mannino prepares to discuss what he calls "an intra-cellular cytoplasmic delivery system," a mechanism that might help deliver HIV-defeating genes to cells in the bone marrow.<p>Mannino's system uses liposome, fat, and protein envelopes he calls cochleates to deliver DNA into a target cell. Typically, Gallo decides these cochleates look like Italian pastry shells. "Why don'tcha call 'em cannoli?" he asks the young scientist. Flustered, Mannino launches into a background discussion that bores Gallo.<p>Gallo: "How much longer you gonna take?"<p>Mannino (missing the point): "An hour, but I can take longer."<p>Gallo (straight-faced): "Every minute over, your honorarium goes down."<p>Mannino: "I wasn't planning on an honorarium."<p>Gallo: "That's good."<p>Actually, Gallo is very interested in Mannino's theories. It's just that, even pushing 60, he's most comfortable in the argot of Waterbury's street corners. After the meeting, he takes Mannino aside and praises him.<p>"I'm glib," he explains later. "I do like to one-up people. I love debate, but never to screw someone. This is the way I grew up. Everybody teased me, and I teased them. That's the way it is."<p>A hundred rsums are piled in his office from top-drawer researchers eager to cast their lot with him. Almost half his NIH lab staff hopes to follow Gallo to Baltimore. Robert Redfield, former chief of retroviral research at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, will run Gallo's clinic. William Blattner, former chief of viral epidemiology at the National Cancer Institute, is heading up the epidemiology division. The reason is clear: Gallo continues to execute and inspire brilliant research efforts. "Bob has this uncanny ability to make connections that are off the wall and be right," says Edmund Tramont, director of the Medical Biotechnology Center at the University of Maryland at Baltimore. "That's his gift. He's a Michelangelo in that regard, a da Vinci -- a Cal Ripken."<p>In Gallo's new home, that's quite a compliment.<p>AIDS is a lifetime and, thus far, fatal disease. The blood-borne virus called HIV, spread by sexual contact, by transfusion, by intravenous injection, or in utero, targets a white blood cell called CD4. This cell normally orchestrates the body's defenses against an array of disease-causing agents.<p>Once infected, CD4 cells become factories that pump out millions of copies of HIV. Infected cells are destroyed as this viral stream bursts through membranes to infect other cells. As CD4 cells become depleted, the immune system breaks down, leaving patients vulnerable to opportunistic infections and rare cancers, a situation collectively known as AIDS.<p>Viruses are difficult to eradicate. "They use the human machinery to replicate," says Don Francis, a hero of And the Band Played On and head of the HIV vaccine program for Genentech, a biotech company. "If you poison the virus, you poison the human."<p>As a result, many researchers believe it makes sense simply to limit viral infections. Reduce the virus's bad effects or its ability to reproduce, the theory goes, and you stave off full-blown disease. In the case of HIV, a reasonable therapy might turn AIDS from a terminal disease into a merely chronic one.<p>A vaccine would do even more, of course. It would prevent HIV infection. But in the past few years, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, <a name="NYSE:GNE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10628"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Genentech</b></a>, and a number of smaller biotech companies have slashed AIDS-vaccine research. Genentech was the industry's highest-profile flop: In 1994 it was left with 300,000 doses of vaccine when a government panel refused (for scientific reasons) to fund further trials. Other companies, already worried they'd be forced to sell their vaccines for peanuts in the third world, were chilled by the wasted millions. Many accelerated the move toward safer bets -- which mean therapies, not vaccines. "People will pay a lot to save themselves from something they have," explains James Curran. "With a vaccine, you're trying to sell something to people with nothing."<p>This isn't all bad. Coming on line is a new generation of reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (reverse transcriptase is the enzyme crucial to viral reproduction) that at this point appear to be more effective and less toxic than AZT, the best-known treatment in this category. In recent months drugs called protease inhibitors have generated a tremendous amount of interest and excitement. Taken as a pharmaceutical cocktail, different combinations of these drugs and AZT seem to reduce the concentration of HIV in the body by as much as 85 percent. That's the most dramatic news in AIDS research in a decade.<p>Unfortunately, there's no proof yet that any drug on the market makes AIDS less fatal. What's more, HIV is a hard virus to pin down: It replicates very rapidly and has an extraordinary potential for mutation -- which means it develops resistance to drugs, as it 
is already resisting AZT.<p>The drug-cocktail approach finesses this problem: The odds are that the virus won't become resistant to several drugs at once. But it raises questions about expense -- the new therapies will cost as much as $7,000 a year -- and the toxicity of multiple drugs. Says Don Francis: "The only time-tested approach to clearing an epidemic is with a vaccine -- and few are interested in it."<p>Yet a vaccine is perhaps Gallo's biggest goal -- and this makes his push into the private sector all the more timely.<p>At the infamous press conference in 1984, Margaret Heckler speculated that an AIDS vaccine would be available in a few years. Twelve years later, the world is still waiting for the perfect sugar cube that will stop the pandemic. According to epidemiologists, the much-publicized AIDS-prevention campaign is losing impact. In the U.S. alone, an estimated 40,000 people will become newly infected this year.<p>To some extent, Gallo takes this responsibility on his shoulders. "What is needed of me?" he asks rhetorically. "To solve the problem cheap, third world, forever. Imagine, one little shot and it's over." It's melodramatic, to be sure. But with Bob Gallo, melodrama is a spur. An AIDS vaccine -- what a comeback! What a slap to the Nobel committee!<p>Of course, Gallo has plenty of other goals, including developing AIDS therapies that rely on his identification last year (German researcher Reinhard Kurth made a concurrent discovery) of  chemokines. And the vaccine hunt will have obstacles; no opera would be complete without them. Researchers have learned to be cautious about touting "breakthroughs" in a disease as relentless as AIDS. Success, thus far, has been measured by a few more months of life. Ultimately, Gallo believes, the best answer may be to genetically engineer human blood so that its cells are invulnerable to HIV.<p>"We have a gene therapy that I believe could solve the AIDS problem," he says. "What we will do is put a gene in the papa cells of the bone marrow that allows those cells never to be infected by HIV. They produce all the blood cells and all the T cells. They've got a selective advantage to survive because they can't be infected. Is it doable? Yes! We've done it in our lab for years. Soon we'll do it in vivo."
But will it work as well as he hopes? Gallo won't express certainty. Even a guaglione eventually learns humility.<p>In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed a bill permitting federal employees a limited profit on their discoveries. Gallo's share of the largesse since then: $100,000 a year for 17 years, on top of his salary. "Money's not driving Bob," says Anthony Fauci. "He's earned bupkes! He wants the big-bang discovery."<p>And indeed, though Gallo lives grandly, money doesn't seem to be one of his driving appetites. Would Ahab have turned Moby Dick into perfume? No, Gallo seems to be interested in the private sector mostly because capitalism promises him funding -- not wealth.<p>Gallo's Institute of Human Virology, just a few blocks from the Camden Yards baseball field, isn't fully staffed and won't be officially opened until November. Yet already Wall Street and the venture capitalists have come calling. From California, Lew Wasserman, former chairman of Universal Studios, and junk-bond king Michael Milken, who is battling metastatic prostate cancer, have approached Gallo.<p>Slowly, surely, Gallo is becoming the center of attention again. He's always been comfortable there: For the past 20 years, a thousand scientists from all over the world have flocked to Gallo's lab for a week of seminars and Lucullan feasting every summer. In India, Gallo was showered with flower petals. For a while, Francis Ford Coppola even followed him around trying to come up with "Gallo: The Movie."<p>To this heady mix, Gallo feels compelled to add more melodrama. "I have this insecurity," he whispers. "I don't know when I've done enough. Leonardo da Vinci didn't feel he contributed." <p>The comparison is pure Gallo, a clumsy mix of confession and hubris -- charming and irritating in equal measure. For a time, perhaps, he lost sight of his purpose. But things are clear now. Robert Gallo is again fighting AIDS, and AIDS, a worthy foe, is fighting Robert Gallo. <p><p><p><p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> ALL WORK, NO ETHIC <p>A short history of the work ethic, from John Calvin to Cal Ripken, and why it has become one of the most popular and degrading cliches of our time.  <p> By Richard Todd  <p> I am a student of cliches--a dubious field of inquiry, I know.You, in your wisdom, reader, you doubtless just tune out when you hear somebody talking about the "work ethic"--which is the cliche currently inhabiting my ear. I am trying to figure out why suddenly people have seized on this phrase.  <p> Jesse Jackson, not Colin Powell's best friend, says that what the two men have in common is a "strong work ethic."  <p> Cal Ripken Jr. plays in 2,131 consecutive games, the stadium goes wild, and the President of the United States, in the stands, praises Ripken's "discipline, determination, and constancy. "Chris Wallace, the ABC interviewer, sums it all up: "He's a paragon of the work ethic."  <p> Newt Gingrich, in his book To Renew America, laments "pauperism, a condition of passive dependency in which the work ethic has been completely lost."  <p> Pete Du Pont, a man who could have eased his way through life without activating his work ethic, writes in the National Review that "[t]he work ethic is at the core of a healthy society, and the individual responsibility of doing a job, earning a living, and striving for improvement is crucial to restoring opportunity and self-respect to underclass Americans."  <p> Republicans love the work ethic, but so do Democrats. The president, an early champion of "workfare," has spoken of it often, and the White House Conference on Character Building for a Democratic, Civil Society, convened last year, puts "work ethic" on the listof those traits that need national encouragement.  <p> A survey of Colorado manufacturers concludes "poor employee work ethic" is the No. 1 problem facing businesses.  <p> If it sometimes seems we are developing the first culture in history united by the fact that it shares no beliefs, consider these voices. To listen to them, you might think that the one thing Americans will agree to defend in public is the sanctity of work. Of course, that's too simple a conclusion: All we know for sure is that for some reason it seems to give people a lot of pleasure to use the words. Since the first of the year, the phrase "work ethic" has appeared on average once every otherday in The New York Times. It seems a work ethic is something you want to have whether you're a political leader, a businessman, a sports hero, or a rock star. Did I hear Kato Kaelin murmur about his work ethic earlier in the year?  <p> Where is all this coming from? What people mean by the work ethic seems never to be specified--that's a nice thing about speaking in cliches; you don't have to explain what you mean. But the whole usage seems to be tinged with a not unpleasant sense of loss: Once we had the ethic and now it's ebbing away. To believe in it is to believe in a better past.  <p> It is indeed a phrase with a history, though not as ancient as some might think. It derives from Max Weber's great book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, published in 1904. ("Protestant ethic" became known as "Protestant work ethic," and finally euphemized into its present form.) I say in conscience that this is a "great book," because I have recently read it, though it slipped by me in my great-book days. It is in fact a beautiful piece of work--an odd way to describe a sociological study, perhaps, but true. The beauty comes from the book's imaginative power, the act of penetrating the mind of another era.  <p> Weber set out to explain how two seemingly opposite forces in Western history--one might say the forces in Western history, Christianity and capitalism--managed to reconcile their differences. He identified the 16th-century Protestant Reformation as the crucial event and the Calvinist vision of God as the crucial doctrine. Calvinism made it possible for Christians to continue their tradition of self-abnegation while succeeding in the material world.  <p> The old Catholic Church, Weber argued, thought the world an insubstantial place and held that the purpose of life was to achieve heaven. It imagined a God who could be propitiated through sacraments, prayer, confession, and self-denial. Calvin swept all that away: One could not curry favor with God; one could only labor in service of his plan. According to the Calvinist doctrine of predestination, one's eternal fate was sealed--you were either one of the elect, living in a state of grace, or you were damned, destined for hell. There was nothing you could do about it.   <p> At the same time, it was all important to demonstrate to yourself and others that you were probably among the elect, and this was done through work. "[I]t is held to be an absolute duty to consider oneself chosen, and to combat all doubts as temptations of the devil, since lack of self-confidence is the result of insufficient faith, hence of imperfect grace ... in order to attain that self-confidence intense worldly activity is recommended," Weber wrote.   <p> To Calvinists, work was an emblem of faith, and so ultimately was wealth--just as long as one acquired it but did not enjoy it. Here was a spiritual recipe for the accumulation of capital, the tradition of Christian abnegation made into a worldly virtue: "Not leisure and enjoyment, but only activity serves to increase the glory of God."  <p> The capitalist spirit Weber described was born in melancholy and fear. He evoked the distance people felt from God: "a feeling of unprecedented inner loneliness of the single individual. In what was for the man of the age of the Reformation the most important thing in life [salvation], he was forced to follow his path alone to meet a destiny which had been decreed for him from eternity. No one could help him." This was the desolation that drove people to toil and the accumulation of wealth.  <p> One might well ask: And this is what we're suddenly nostalgic for?   <p> Of course, the Protestant ethic is a theory, a construct. It never existed, not in pure form. And the point the new priests of the work ethic might remember: It was a diagnosis, not a prescription. It was Weber's attempt to describe a social phenomenon, and (some might argue) a rather neurotic phenomenon at that.  <p> Weber was inspired by the vestiges of a society he saw on a trip to the United States--the 19th-century economy created by descendants of America's Calvinists, the New England Puritans. But already their values were eroding, and the 20th century mounted a full-scale assault on the work ethic. The labor movement, Henry Ford's perception that workers had to spend as well as toil, and the New Deal's pump-priming all contributed to the development of an "ethic of consumption." Americans were enjoined as a matter of public policy to spend, enjoy, and fuel the economy. A lesson we learned well.   <p> Why then this fit of longing for the imagined puritanical past? It would be nice to think that the nostalgia is a matter of rigorous self-questioning, a rededication to a life of principle. But the thrust of most talk about the work ethic is hardly self-critical. On the contrary, even more important than having a work ethic of your own, it seems an excellent thing to be able to accuse other people of not having one.   <p> A man named Du Pont, no matter what he might think in private, could not, until very recently, say in public that the American poor needed to revive the work ethic. The ethic of simple politeness--there cognition of the gulf between a huge inherited fortune and the straitened circumstances of a welfare mother--would have prevented him.  <p> I don't know the answer to the "welfare mess" (if it is a mess) or what besides money would improve the morale of the underclass. But I don't think solving those problems is the point when our political leaders talk about the "work ethic." They may be talking about the poor, but they are talking to the rest of us. And they have found a language that tastes as good to them as a mouthful of Pomerol.  <p> Here is the argument for listening to cliches: not for their literal content, which tends, by the time they reach cliche status, to be nonexistent, but for what they say about the people whouse them, what they say about their era. A generation ago, people used to love a sentence that began "If we can put a man on the moon, then we can..." You could finish the sentence as you chose, but the nobler and more humanitarian the goal, the better: "...send our children to decent schools, eliminate poverty," etc. These formulaic constructions were enough to drive you crazy, but if you listened you got the idea, which was, unwittingly, the opposite of what was being said. We were just waking up to the realization--and simultaneously denying it--that technological achievement was easy compared to the more mundane, social work of society.  <p> Do we not hear a similar effort at sweet denial when the work ethic is invoked? I think those who would attempt to sway minds with this work-ethic talk are wittingly or unwittingly playing to certain apprehensions, even fears now abroad in our society.  <p> The past few months have seemed a strange time for our economy, if you were just a guy sort of listening to the news. Let's imagine such a fellow on the early train, 6:51 out of South Norwalk, Connecticut, commuting to his job and reading the paper. He's a middle-ranking financial officer at an international company with headquarters in Manhattan; his wife has a similar job in White Plains, New York, and they have a household income of about $230,000 (making him, what, among the best-off 2 or 3 percent of the country?).  <p> Over the space of a couple of weeks, while he's at work on asection of next year's corporate budget (a painful one since the way to make the numbers work is to fire 125 people), he has read of Michael Ovitz, a name he'd been dimly aware of, who has been hired to be president of <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Disney</b></a>. Salary undisclosed, but presumably a good one, since his previous asking price was about $300 million. The Disney takeover of Capital Cities/ABC was also of interest. That was the one in which Warren Buffett made $402 million on the afternoon's increase in his Capital Cities stock. <p> Here's another interesting item, about some people our friend happens to know: <a name="NYSE:CMB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10322"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chase Manhattan</b></a> and <a name="NASD:CHFC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12961"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chemical</b></a> banks are to merge, with the result that some 12,000 jobs will be lost, or saved, depending on where you sit. Then comes a front-page story in The New York Times, not hard news, just a trend suddenly articulated: Skilled Workers Watch Their Jobs Migrate Overseas. People in the computer business making $70,000 to $100,000 a year are waking up to discover that their jobs are gone--snapped up by engineers and programmers in India for a fraction of the cost. A final item: The year long run-up in <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> stock has added a few billion to Bill Gates's fortune; now he's worth $15 billion. <p> As he looks around him, the prosperous young man on the train has a feeling he can't quite name. He's doing very well, no complaints, really; frankly, he's doing better than he imagined he would. Yet he feels excluded from something important, and he feels vulnerable, as if his life were insubstantial, tenuous. There is a strange chill in his universe. Is he going to be okay? The answer isn't obvious to him. And if it's not obvious to him, what about the 97 percent of Americans less well off than he? <p> I have been reading a book lately called The End of Work, by Jeremy Rifkin, a Washington economist. Rifkin describes the plight of a displaced sheet-metal worker who, with his wife, now works four part-time jobs and makes less than half what he did before. The worker's assessment of job creation in the Clinton administration: "Sure, we've got four of them, so what?"  <p> Rifkin's argument has an apocalyptic tinge to it; he says that after decades of crying wolf about the dangers of technological unemployment, the crisis is now at hand. By his calculation, given currently foreseeable automation, some 90 million jobs out of a labor force of 124 million are vulnerable to elimination. <p> Of course one immediately musters the comforting rebuttals. The doomsday view of technology is the counterpart of Malthusianism; current trends projected into the future always spell disaster, but somehow disaster never arrives in its predicted form. Something happens, and what happens usually has to do with a phenomenon that can be predicted, though its form cannot--human inventiveness. <p> Still, you don't have to buy into the Rifkin thesis to feel that the pace of change seems to have accelerated noticeably, and with each new merger, each new downsizing, corporate indifference to the effects of change seems to take on the aspect of a new natural law. We suffer from an apprehension that something is terribly wrong: "presentiment" (as Emily Dickinson said) "that long Shadow--on the Lawn-- ... Notice to the startled Grass/That Darkness--is about to pass--."   <p> Our economic lives are supposed to be rational; we cannot prevent the human tragedies of life, but for the basically fortunate among us surely we can, with prudence, govern our economic fate. If we work hard enough, then we should achieve our goals, rise to success. Isn't that what the work ethic, as popularly understood, promises? The source of the anxiety is the suspicion that this article of faith, never entirely true, is in fact increasingly false. Just as a plane can crash or an artery can clog, so too can people who do the right thing with their careers be swept away by some force that is larger than their efforts. Has there ever been a moment in a prosperous, growing economy when so many well-paid people felt such fear for their jobs?  <p> That is one source of our anxiety. Another arises from the nagging relationship between work and reward. In my experience, people with jobs tend to work very hard these days. Yet they feel less certain that work represents a path to success. As Keynes said, nothing so demoralizes a society as to "cut the cord between effort and reward." The apt phrase was used recently in The New Republic by Thomas Geoghegan, who was lamenting the decline in wages for working people. The disparity between work and its financial rewards seems even more vivid if one looks in the other direction.  <p> The growing concentration of wealth at the top of society has been much remarked on lately, and the numbers are dazzling. On one hand, it's not that we think of ourselves as having a class of elite sybarites--people at the top work hard, too. But their money seems to accrete in amounts disproportionate to any conceivable human effort. I am sure Michael Eisner works hard, probably harder than a guard or a technician in the Magic Kingdom, though maybe not harder than a chambermaid in the Ramada Inn. Really, though, how hard should you have to work for a billion dollars? In 1974, the average CEO was paid 35 times more than his lowest-ranking employee; now the average compensation at the top is 150 times the wages on the factory floor.   <p> A recent article in Harper's laments the division of the country into two classes and cites the existence of an "elite" made up of about 20 percent of the citizenry, those blessed with the right education, manners, profession. But 20 percent! I think it is closer to the economic realities of life in the country now to say that one can belong to the top 20, 10, 5, or 2 percent of the country and still feel something of an outsider in the governing forces of the economy--still feel unsafe, insecure, even poor!  <p>    It would be ludicrous to claim much in the way of exalted suffering for these people--but their sentiments are interesting, not least because they are ones you and I are best able to understand. If so, they ought to provide something of a window, an imaginative purchase, on the world of the infinitely less fortunate. How must Ovitz's rejected deal, Gates's fortune, Buffett's stock seem to the famous welfare mother or the fellow who is making $5.75 an hour?  <p> It is at this peculiar moment in our history that the rhetoric of the "work ethic" becomes a part of our discourse.  <p> I sometimes think we give our political leaders too much credit for cynicism. This may be naive of me, but it seems that what they more often have is a kind of instinctual cunning (and we, for our part, have an interest in being misled). What else could explain the rightness of the "work ethic" as the perfect demagogic phrase for this moment in American life? It plays into our deep anxieties about the meaning of work, our work, all work. Whenused against others--the lazy poor--it invites us to deny our own worries.  <p> And yet, and yet... it may be that there is some eerie deeper truth to this language--it may be that the old Puritan impulse that Weber defined does linger on. As I look about, I see a number of people whose spiritual condition seems to answer to Weber'shaunting description of the Reformation man in his solitariness, "forced to follow his path alone to meet a destiny which had been decreed for him from eternity...." In what has recently been called "a winner-take-all society," we imagine in our self-blaming that there truly is an elect, people whose grace is money. And where does membership in the elect start? At the CEO level, about $1.2 million in income a year? At a net worth in impregnable-fortress assets of, say, $3.2 million? Or is the cut even higher than that? And you, reader, are you saved or damned?  <p><p>

						November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Feature  <p> INTERVIEW WITH THE BURGLAR <p>If you're as well rewarded for your work as Jack Dillon is for his, he's definitely interested in you  <p> by Mike Mallowe  <p> "It all starts here."  <p> Testing for heft and size, Jack Dillon works his way along the bins in the screwdriver aisle at my local <a name="NYSE:S"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11338"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sears</b></a>. He taps his index finger on the business end of a shiny slot head and smiles. <p> "You want a big screwdriver," he says. "A solid-steel shaft is best. Don't want that tip breaking off." Dillon holds the Craftsman tool at eye level, squinting like an expert watchmaker. <p> "Then, gloves, of course. Not just for fingerprints--you have to be prepared for some rough work. I've been known to go in through a roof, because the roof is not normally alarmed."  <p> Another aisle now; he's talking almost to himself.  <p> "Have to have a good, large crowbar, too. And a flat bar. That's for sliding up and under things. The flat bar and the big screwdriver I probably use more than anything else. And, let's see--a sledgehammer. Drills and a power source. A good assortment of bits. Chain cutters you need once in a while; maybe a burning bar, too, if you do a lot with metal or aluminum."  <p> He takes just the screwdriver and moves to the checkout. "And you want to pay cash--full price. Nothing that can be traced. You don't want to steal the tools; that's just stupid. Sears is fine. Nobody asks anything."  <p> Not once does Jack Dillon refer to himself as a burglar; the very word seems to him distasteful. He speaks of jobs done and orders filled, always careful to put distance between his work and its consequences. When he breaks into a home, the cops tell me, he immediately turns all the family photos face down--as if by doing so he makes the transaction more impersonal.  <p> Dillon is a very physical specimen, tall and strong. Shake his hand, and the pig-iron grip leaves a vaguely ominous twinge. He parts his hair in the middle, and it's really too long, almost like the shag on a Venice Beach slacker. But Dillon doesn't have the same vacant gaze. Instead he has a predatory, appraising look. It is hard and cold and it scares me.  <p> Some people may have better things to fear than Jack Dillon. Perhaps they live in the city: Urban burglaries often are smash-and-grab invasions born of junkie desperation, far more dangerous than Dillon's suburban jobs. But in small towns and in suburbs like mine, Dillon is the person you'll hear downstairs at 2 a.m.--and that's a frightening prospect. Burglars are white (67 percent) males (90 percent) under 25 years of age (63 percent). That's Dillon--except that, at almost 30, he's been at it for a while now.  <p> His accent has the flavor of New England. And though he's based in Massachusetts, he'll travel to ply his trade in most any Northeastern suburb: He's gotten more entrepreneurial and will even burgle businesses to order. He says he likes working the area near my home, just outside Philadelphia--and for the naked threat this presents to my family, he's unapologetic. It's just business."It's work I know," he says. "You answer to no one. Just seeing if you can get away with it, testing how good you are, that's as important as the money. If you're just in it for the money, you're a fool. But this--this is a challenge. It's a rush. Just you out there in the dark, looking up at this big house. How're you gonna get in? Get away? That's sweet. That's it."  <p> He laughs easily, but with no real mirth. His eyes are deep-set and private; his eyebrows knit and unfurl and sporadically twitch. He doesn't enjoy talking to me; he's just doing a favor for a cop he knows, earning an IOU to be claimed at a later date. His conditions are that I preserve his anonymity and that I forget about any follow-ups. I gladly agree to this one-and-done approach. <p> I don't enjoy talking with Jack Dillon, either. My own home was broken into a few years ago. I felt utterly violated and powerless, humiliated. They took only a camera and some other small stuff and, weirdly, moved the furniture to steal the rugs. But the entire time they were in the house, I never woke up. Neither did my wife. My three-year-old, though, wandered downstairs and ran right into them. I still have nightmares about it. They were in our home.  <p> As far as I know, Dillon had nothing to do with that crime. But in some weird way, I figure that by mastering him--capturing a burglar on paper--I can reclaim my status as family protector. Maybe I'm just kidding myself. Even in a public place like Sears, Dillon's utter detachment from humanity makes me jumpy. As unsuspecting shoppers around us go about their cheerful weekend business, the muscular young man in the Nike shirt and faded Levi's jeans coldly sizes each one up. And if someone lingers just a few beats too long over the home security devices, he zooms in.  <p> "When you see people spending time with locks and such," Dillon says in his broad, vowel-compressing twang, "it can only mean one of two things: They're afraid of something, or they have something to protect. This is where it becomes a challenge. Is there something of value--a family--or is it things, like jewelry or gold or a rare-coin collection? You gotta go by your gut, by the vibes they give off."  <p> He nods toward a middle-aged couple making small talk over the dead bolts. "If I had nothing better to do," he says, "that could be interesting. They're about the right age. No kids with them. You always look for an older couple who can afford to spend it on themselves. There's no trick to it. If you get the right feeling about people, you follow them through the mall, from a safe distance. Once they're outside, you jump in your car and follow them home." <p> It takes a second to hit me: He isn't kidding. This is how he actually finds his targets. In my absence he could easily be stalking this couple. "Casing a house, watching people," he says."It's all an investment. Your time, your gas, your trouble. See what happens. Pick your places in advance and know there's something there worth grabbing."  <p> As he leaves the hardware department, new screwdriver in hand, he looks back lingeringly. "Too bad," he says. "They look like they might be worth a ride." I'm stunned by his off hand menace."Hey, just kidding," he says. And laughs on just the right beat. <p> I am not reassured.  <p> Burglary, maybe more than any other serious crime, is passed down from father to son. "And the better the burglar, the surer you can be that it was learned in the family," says Michael Chitwood, chief of police in Portland, Maine.  <p> Chitwood knows Dillon's story well; his department was the last one to send the burglar to prison. He and his force have developed a peculiar respect for their opponent, regarding him as a scrupulously nonviolent professional with a curious code of honor.  <p> Dillon's father was a well-known burglar in New England. Unlike his son, however, he was often picked up for assault and other crimes. "He was a rough one," says Chitwood. "He was in jail so much he was out of the family picture a lot. I think that's how Jack stepped up." The Dillon household consisted of six kids living in only two bedrooms and a cellar. The family had always taken hard-nosed work in the building and construction trades: carpentry, steam fitting, and contracting. But there wasn't much money to be had in the depressed Northeast factory town. Jack was the second boy.  <p> "He's got very early arrests in here for theft of services," says Chitwood, looking at a nine-page-long "yellow sheet." "I'll tell you what that has to mean. Jack was feeding the younger kids. He probably took them to a restaurant, had a nice meal, knew he didn't have any money to pay, and tried to beat the bill. You're looking at Jack at 12, 13 years old."  <p> Chitwood shakes his head. "His first arrest came when he was age ten--criminal trespass. It sounds like Dad was teaching him the trade back then." For his part, Dillon won't discuss his childhood in any depth, or his family at all. But he traces his criminal history to the day he grabbed his first bundle of newspapers off a street corner at age 13. Later that day, he says, he sold them for dimes and quarters.  <p> "From there," he says, "I'd break into garages, steal powertools if I knew I could sell them, lawn mowers, whatever. Pretty soon, I'm eyeing the cars in the garages. So I start to steal them, just to see how good at it I could be. Then one day I come on all these house keys in a garage. So I walk in and take what I can. That made it burglary, my first solo burglary. I wasn't even 18."  <p> In fact, according to police, Dillon was arrested practically every three months when he was an adolescent--a classic case of a kid who never even imagined living straight. In the 11th grade he was finally sentenced as a repeat delinquent and thrown into a facility for young offenders. It was there he earned his high school equivalency diploma--and celebrated by breaking out to continue his criminal career as an adult.  <p> In my quiet suburb outside Philadelphia, the houses are mostly stone and the nannies are from Ireland and England. My neighbors tend to have two incomes and one Volvo wagon; their cocktail-party chatter is about the capital-gains tax. It is a long way from the down east docks.  <p> "Look at these houses," says Dillon with ill-hid envy. "I really like those old high ceilings. All the room you'd ever need in there. Sometimes, when I'm inside one of those places, I'll just stand there and look around before I touch a thing."  <p> We're casing a street, my street. Call it a controlled experiment, if Dillon can indeed be controlled. So: How does a professional burglar know when to hit a mark--and when to pass it by? Why did those guys choose my home? We park under a shade tree near my house.  <p> "Nobody spends more time checking out a target than I do," says Dillon. "And I've been wrong lots of times too. About all you can do is get to know a house as well as you can. Concentrate on a room or two, ignore everything else. That way when you're in there, in the dark, you'll be able to move around fast. Walk up to the front door and knock. Ask for directions or to use the phone. You want to see what's on the other side of that door. <p> "Your driveway is a definite maybe," says Dillon. "It goes pretty far down, so that's good, and that shrubbery provides a nice screen from the street. But I'd like it better if it curved or formed a semicircle. That's the problem--only one way in and out. A cop pulls up behind me and I lose my car."  <p> He turns a little sheepish. "Your car," he says, as gently as he can, "looks like a nice car. I mean, it's well preserved. But in a neighborhood like this ..." The car is a venerable Oldsmobile, worth about $2,000. "I look at that car and I see your big, old house and I'm thinking to myself, this guy is just about making his mortgage every month.  <p> "I also see kids' toys all over the place. So unless I really know something about you, I probably keep going. Old car; kid expenses; nothing fancy about the outside of the house. You'd never make my first cut. I hate to put it like that. But just on a quick once-over, the benefit may not be there with you. No offense."  <p> We wander down the street and come to a pocket mansion that dwarfs my house. The driveway is semicircular, and there's a new Lexus parked out front. I'm shocked to see three or four unread newspapers scattered in the driveway. "Now, this--this," says Dillon, "shows real promise. Nobody home, or nobody cares. See that little sign?"  <p> It's stuck in the lawn and has the letters ADT printed on it. <p> "That's one of the best burglar-alarm systems on the market," Dillon says. "Good on windows and doors. If you're going to put money into anything, put it into the outside. Because the goal is to keep me out--that's your first line of protection. Once I'm in, not much is going to stop me. The cops will have to be in that house for me to leave empty-handed. And if I've been inside once and I think it's worth it, I'll just lay low and come back in a few weeks. That's why systems like ADT are good--they keep people like me out. There's only one problem: I happen to know that system. I can install it, and I can take it apart. So, with me, it's not going to do much good."  <p> Dillon smiles. "I do like the looks of this setup. I'm sure an older couple lives here, right? You happen to know if they're away on vacation, or what?"  <p> I don't answer, and he shrugs.  <p> "Well, this is okay for a first run-through," he says. "We know enough about the layout of the street and the houses. Next thing we do is get lost and come back here around midnight, just about the time most police departments are changing shifts. Then we can catch a little privacy."  <p> When they first began to track his burglaries in an ever-widening circle around his home base, investigators found that Dillon had learned his trade well. He never ransacked a house or building. He'd break in, neatly and expertly, get what he was after, and leave. Without doing an inventory, you might not even know he had been there.  <p> Yet no matter how slick, every burglar leaves a signature. Not most burglars: Every burglar. In bucolic Bucks County, Pennsylvania, the great housebreaker Angel Calo was recently undone by his habit of using toothpicks to jam front-door locks so he couldn't be disturbed while he worked. He recently pleaded guilty to 17 burglaries--many of which were pinned on him because of the toothpicks. "Common scheme and design," prosecutors call this legal concept. It helps them put burglars away without needing witnesses.  <p> Dillon's trademark is that he can't stand to see his victims' faces. "Every job, he'd turn the pictures facedown," says Michael Chitwood. "He developed that pattern early, and it never varied. The pictures I mean are the family portraits most people have sitting on their mantelpieces or tables. He'd still steal their stuff--he was inside, why not? Jack does have a conscience, but he can turn it off. Still, he couldn't stand to see who he was hurting. In his mind, I don't think he could admit he was hurting anybody. Because physically, he never would."  <p> Indeed, Dillon's aversion to violence--he's never been charged with any gun-related offense--is a point of honor with him, perhaps a way of rejecting his father's violent legacy. "I'd never carry a weapon of any kind," Dillon says. "I'd never want to hurt anyone. The cops know that; I want them to know it. Once, in the middle of a job, I was trapped and the only way I could escape was to go out the front door, where two cops happened to be standing. So I just rammed them. One cop got knocked over, but I didn't do that on purpose. That's the only time.  <p> "On another job, a cop walks in on me and pulls out a gun, points it at my head. That was so uncalled for. Those cops knew me; that whole little town knew me. Fight me, sure, hold me, but don't go for a gun when you know I never carry anything."  <p> Dillon's last major run-in with the law was the Portland arrest in 1988. The Portland cops cleared over 100 burglaries with that single arrest, based partly on Dillon's signature photo-turning. His take for those crimes was estimated at between $300,000 and$400,000. (While in the custody of the Portland cops, Dillon talked at length about his trade. See "Your Home, Through a Burglar's Eyes" on page 95.)  <p> Dillon was sentenced to ten years as a habitual offender and served about four of the ten--an unusually long stretch for a burglar, but just part of the natural ebb and flow of his ingrained recidivism. He was released early for good behavior, and the only trouble he's had since then has been a couple traffic tickets. <p> These days Dillon has a family to take care of. He insists he does this without welfare, handouts, or risk of arrest. "I work now, work hard," he says. "It's better." But he's shy with specifics, and there's no conviction in his voice. The cops don't all believe him, and if you see him on the street, you know instinctively that there's little chance this guy is punching a time clock. <p> Besides, Dillon consistently tells me of his burglary exploits in the present tense, portraying himself as something like an addict of the thrill involved. "I'll hit five houses in one night," he says. "I can have $1,000 in my pocket, and I'll still see if I can break into a house that just looks right. It's about seeing how good I am."  <p> He has few other vices. He doesn't drink or do drugs, though he is a chain-smoker. He loves sports. He drives small, fast cars and lives in a nice apartment. He wears a real Rolex.  <p> "I do not get a good vibe here."  <p> Dillon says it gravely, like a concerned doctor delivering bad news. We've returned to my street, near midnight, to case my house up close. My wife and kids are inside. Dillon immediately tells me they are not safe. I'm grateful for his advisory--at first.  <p> We walk the perimeter of my house in darkness that's relieved only by the moon and my neighbors' lights. Mounting the steps to my back deck, we are completely hidden from the view of the street. We look into the family room, which has glass on everyside. I've always loved seeing the backyard trees through those windows. But in the darkness our television, stereo, and camcorder look absolutely naked.  <p> Dillon is thoughtful; concentration adds years to his looks. "I'm beginning to see why they broke into your place," he says."It's almost indefensible. Everything's open in the back. I punch through one of these little window panes--there must be 60 of'em back here--and I'm in."  <p> This isn't what I want to hear. In fact, all of a sudden, I don't even want to think about this stuff. In the daylight Dillon seemed cold and distant but controllable. Now I realize that bringing a career criminal within feet of my sleeping family wasn't such a good idea.  <p> "In your case," Dillon goes on, "I have free rein on the ground floor. You have wonderful hiding places for me, too, like the lattice work under this deck. I could be there all night, waiting until you and your wife leave for work. Then I could go upstairs, too. By the way, does your bedroom door have a lock?"  <p> I nod numbly: At least I'm on the score-board. I don't tell him that we never lock our bedroom.  <p> "You're really exposed here," Dillon says. "I could be in and out your place in ten minutes. If the rest of your neighbors are anything like you, I could do your whole side of the block in a couple hours."  <p> "What about the cops?" I ask feebly. "They come by pretty regularly." <p> He gives me a withering look. "You ever see them come up on your patio during the night and check your doors and windows? Or do they just drive by? I've had cops shine their searchlights directly in my eyes while I was carrying away a small safe. They waved and I waved back."  <p> Dillon seems a little irritated now, determined to prove he has it over me. He heads for the outside basement door, which is supposed to be kept locked at all times. The handle turns and he walks inside my house.  <p> "If I can't pop a box or a lock with the screwdriver, I move on. With a safe, the first thing you do is try combinations. I've had plenty open for me by just twisting the dial to zero. Alarms? I've done it enough times so I know that once I do trip an alarm, I'll still have three to four minutes before the cops come. If I can't get away, I'll be hiding someplace. Before I take cover, I try to count how many cops show up. Almost everytime, they all come inside--so if I get outside first, they'll never catch me. As soon as I know where they all are, I boogie right out of there. And by that time, I really know the layout of the place. Those cops are in my house, scared to death." <p> I slowly come to realize that all my interviews consist of Jack Dillon trying to warn me, subtly and not so subtly, about himself. He doesn't want me--or you--to trust him, because he is different from us. He can switch off his conscience, and that's when people start getting hurt. Maybe he doesn't want anyone to trust him. This could be why he seldom hooks up with accomplices. "It's best to work alone," he says gruffly. "There's no need to split the money, and there's nobody to give you up."  <p> In this, Dillon may be a little unusual--many suburban burglars work very closely with women. Says Lou Orlando, a private investigator who lives near me: "She might be the hairdresser, the maid, the cook, the woman in the restaurant. Whoever she is, she gets to know when Mrs. So-and-so has on the good jewelry and the not so good. The night she's out wearing the costume stuff, that's the night you hit the house. If she works in some capacity inside the house, it can even be worse. She'll know all the weak spots and all the hiding places."  <p> That's certainly not Dillon's style. He'll tell you plenty off acts, but the crucial information he shares with no one. "I'm even afraid of buying anything on credit," he says. "I know too many people who work in credit bureaus. You buy a new stereo, a new computer, and they have the transaction. You don't know how much money they make selling that information to people like me."  <p> He also avoids fences, the middlemen who buy stolen merchandise and sell it at about 20 cents on the dollar. With the exception of order jobs--where he breaks into businesses to steal specific items for someone else--he tries to fence all his own goods. But that has its risks, too. "You have to use your head about it," he says. "If you go in and the job is under $10,000, you begin to ask yourself is it really worth it?"  <p> We don't linger in my basement. I KNOW Dillon could easily walk upstairs to the kitchen, but I'm not interested in seeing him prove that point. I just want him out of my house.  <p> "No burglar alarms, right?" he asks as we walk back outside. <p> "I've nailed a few windows shut."  <p> Dillon reaches inside his shirt pocket and taps out a cigarette. He lights it and inhales. I see his vigilant eyes following the low roofline of my second story.  <p> "You ever think of moving?" he asks, exhaling. "That might be the best thing you could do."  <p> I feel a rush of tension. Until now, Dillon has never hesitated to look me directly in the eye. But suddenly his eyes are everywhere except on mine. Abruptly he changes the subject.  <p> "Let's go take a ride," he suggests.  <p> "Where?"  <p> "Up to that neighbor's house, where we were earlier. See if anything's open."  <p> I'm shocked and excited at the same time. He has suggested it casually enough, but I sense he's trying to make a real connection with me--to communicate the illicit thrill that drives him so I can be more like him, not a victim whose eyes he can't stand to see. He uncorks a smile at me, a nice one.  <p> Is this what I've been looking for all along? A rush of power that'll erase the impotence I felt when my own home was violated? If so, the price is too high. I make a lame excuse.  <p> Dillon puffs on his cigarette a couple more times. He looks down, leaning against my car in the dark.  <p> "That would be the real thing, you know," he says quietly. "Break and enter. See how it's done." There's that flicker between his eyebrows again.  <p> "Sorry. This'll have to be real enough."  <p> Another puff. Even by moonlight I can see I'm getting the prison-yard once-over. I know I'm not measuring up.  <p> "I think I was right the first time," Dillon says. "You got a real problem with this house. It isn't safe. Maybe you should move."  <p> He moves away from the car and flicks the half-smoked cigarette onto my lawn. It isn't a nice gesture. He could have just as easily aimed for the street. Or crushed it out with his shoe. In that moment, I believe I can see right inside his head. The image will not help me sleep.  <p> Dillon is picking up a photograph of me, and he's turning it face down.  <p>   <p> YOUR HOME, THROUGH A BURGLAR'S EYES  <p> After Jack Dillon's last burglary conviction, the police in Portland, Maine, persuaded him to let them pick his brain. Dillon also walked the cops through a tour of the sites of some of his crimes.  <p> Along the way, Dillon lectured on the best way to break into homes and businesses. "You slide a flat bar, which is like a crow bar only different, under the wood frame, then work it in along the sides where the door is set in. You peel it back like the skin on an orange and the whole door pops...." Detectives furiously scribbled notes as the expert held court.  <p> Much of the burglar's advice was deceptively simple. He recommended better police-car maintenance, for example: Squealing brakes often tip off a house breaker that he has tripped a silent alarm. Dillon claimed he could calculate the number and location of responding police without ever looking out a window.  <p> The Portland police took such observations seriously, and today they respond to burglary calls with far more stealth. They also bring along dogs to sniff out thieves who haven't yet left the house. And they make sure to leave two officers posted strategically outside: Dillon says he can always out run the cops once they enter the house.  <p> Dillon's advice for homeowners was similarly basic. Spend most of your money on preventing a burglar from targeting your house. That means concentrating on the outside of the building. Dillon's rules:   <p> DON'T PLANT SHRUBS that hide your home from the street, especially if you have a long driveway.  <p> KEEP THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOME WELL LIT, particularly in areas that can't be seen from the street.  <p> SECURELY LOCK AND ALARM all your external windows and doors. Use all the stickers and signs that come with your alarm system. <p> AVOID DOORS AND WINDOWS with numerous small, thin panes of glass. They can be broken with a minimum of noise.  <p> MAKE SURE VALUABLES--or anything else indicating wealth--can't be seen through windows.  <p> PLAY DOWN any external shows of age or wealth, such as a Cadillac in the driveway. Play up signs of family life, such as a basketball hoop.  <p> IF YOU'RE GOING ON VACATION, suspend your newspaper delivery and have a neighbor check your house every day.  <p> If you take these steps, a burglar likely won't pick your house. If the unthinkable does happen, your aim should be to send the intruder away quickly and with little of value. Keep the master bedroom locked at all times, Dillon said, even if you have kids. Never try to face down a burglar and never use a gun. Just press a panic button that sets off a cheap, loud siren. Then call the cops.  <p> What about watchdogs? "No big deal," said Dillon, who fears only police dogs. "If you can't handle dogs, you're in the wrong line of work."  <p>  Homeowners are most likely to be hit in December; burglaries are least likely in February. According to the FBI, you can count on losing more than $1,000 if your house is burgled. And even if they take all Dillon's advice, the police will never catch most criminals: Nationwide, only 13 percent of reported burglaries are solved.<p><p>

						October 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> HOW TO SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY <p>First of all, it is worth saving. Second, it's an even bigger mess than most of us think it could go bust as early as 2016. The solution? Take the biggest government program of all private. <p> By Walter Mead  <p> It's time to think the unthinkable and mention the unmentionable. Social Security can't be saved unless we take at least part of the world's largest pool of investment dollars out of the hands of government bureaucrats and let those who will someday retire on these funds invest for themselves.   <p> We really have no other choice.  <p> Everyone knows the politicians are lying and that we are hip deep in the sheep dip.  In today's anything-goes atmosphere in Washington, the two parties compete to slash budgets and put sacred cows on the chopping block, but one subject seems truly taboo: Social Security. The Republican and Democratic leadership in both houses of Congress have sworn an oath of mickle might not to touch one hair on its hallowed head.  <p> Let's hope they were perjuring themselves, because Social Security is in bigger trouble than you think, and the longer Washington leaves it alone, the worse it will get. One scenario says that the system will start running in the red in 2020 and that by 2030 annual deficits will have eaten up the entire current surplus in the trust fund. Frighteningly enough, that's an optimistic view. The pessimists say the system starts running out of money in 2016. And this assessment comes a mere 12 years after the government hiked taxes and raised the retirement age so that the system would remain solvent forever.  <p> Not only did that fix not work, it's also now clear to just about everyone that we can't hike Social Security taxes high enough or cut benefits low enough to prevent a melt down. Ultimately, privatizing the system is the only possible answer and thatwon't be easy.  <p> What exactly would a privatized Social Security system look like? Let's take an example: John and Mary Worth, a couple who match the median demographic profile of this magazine's readers. Their total family income is $118,000 a year. John earns $61,000 and Mary makes $57,000; both turn 45 in 1995.  <p> By the time they retire (in 2016), the Worths will have paid (in constant 1995 dollars) $465,187 into Social Security. Actually, they will have paid twice that. Employers match workers' contributions dollar for dollar (self-employed people pay double). John and Mary's total lifetime contribution to the system will be $931,248, counting both employer and employee contributions.  <p> If John and Mary both reach 65 and then live 15.2 and 19 more years, respectively, as the actuarial tables predict, they can expect to get $480,631 out of the system (monthly payments of$1,416 for John and $1,385 for Mary while both are alive plus additional survivor's benefits for Mary during the years of her widowhood). Assuming the two have other sources of income in retirement, they can expect to be taxed on 85 percent of their Social Security benefits at a rate of 30 percent, reducing their $480,631 in benefits by $122,561. To sum up: They pay in $465,187, their employers ante up another $465,187, and they get, after taxes, benefits of $358,070. (All this in constant 1995 dollars, of course, to negate the effects of inflation.)  <p> But suppose that in 1972, the year John and Mary started working, Social Security had been privatized and replaced by a compulsory individual savings plan. Suppose that instead of paying payroll taxes to Social Security, John and Mary and their employers paid the same amount into a tax-deferred retirement fund that could be invested, as the Worths directed, into approved and regulated mutual funds, stocks, or bonds. If they put that money into a Standard and Poor's 500 Index fund beginning in 1972 and stocks were to provide a total return of 10 percent annually, by 2016 they would have a retirement nest egg of $1,730,227 (in constant1995 dollars, assuming 4 percent inflation). Assuming they turn a little more conservative after retirement and earn an 8 percent return on this money, reinvest half of that to stay even with inflation, and live off the other half (and that they pay taxes at an effective rate of 39.6 percent), they would have an after-tax monthly income of $3,484 about two thirds more than the $2,087 monthly after-tax benefit they'd receive under the current Social Security system. And, of course, John and Mary would also be able to leave their kids a $1.7 million estate (in 1995 dollars). <p> Let's see: On the one hand, $2,087 a month from Social Security; on the other, $3,484 a month plus a $1.7 million estate to leave behind (or spend) under a privatized system. So why is the American Association of Retired People opposed to the idea? And why are many unions and liberal politicians so hesitant to embrace it? To see why getting there from here will be so politically difficult perhaps impossible it's crucial to understand how the current Social Security system works.  <p> Social Security started during the New Deal, but its roots go back much further, to the social-insurance programs German chancellor Prince Otto von Bismarck introduced to keep German workers from voting for the socialists in the 1870s. Bismarck's program wasn't specifically directed at retirement. Instead, he designed a system of nonprofit government insurance for workers against certain life events old age, sickness, disability, unemployment. These programs, and later Social Security, were supposed to be self-funding. Contributions by workers and employers were to cover the costs of annual benefits.  <p> In the United States, Social Security was set up as a pay-as-you-go pool, where contributions from taxes on current workers were supposed to equal the benefits paid to retired workers. Surpluses, when there were any, were "invested" in special government obligations. By law they could not be invested in corporate bonds or in stocks. In effect, this created a giant offbalance sheet pool of savings, the Social Security Trust Fund, that current workers "lend" to the federal government.  <p> As insurance programs go, Social Security is managed relatively efficiently. The total administrative cost for the program last year was $2.7 billion, which represents only 0.8 percent of the benefits paid out. By comparison, a private-sector company suchas Prudential Insurance has an administrative cost of 13.3 percent of its total revenue.  <p> But it's as a political program that Social Security demonstrates its true genius. It is a transfer program that doesn't look like a transfer program. The benefit formulas are calculated to ensure that low-income workers qualify for a minimum benefit that is disproportionate to their earnings. For example, a worker who earned $50,000 would get a retirement benefit only twice as large as a worker who earned $10,000 not a benefit five times as big. Better yet, long periods of unemployment don't cut much in toretirement benefits.  <p> Social Security has never been an attractive investment for upper-income families, but Roosevelt's brain trust gave them something, too: the payment cap. Above a certain income level this year, it's $61,200 a worker no longer has to pay Social Security taxes. This ceiling is particularly hard on dual-income households in which both workers make something close to the cap but it keeps the rich from hating Social Security too much. For someone making $750,000 a year, Social Security benefits don't mean much in retirement, but the annual tax of $3,794 is only 0.05 percent of income, which is not really enough to bother about. <p>In some ways, Social Security works better now than it did when it started in 1936. In an era when many workers switch jobs sooften that traditional private pension programs don't help them, Social Security is portable. It also works for women who take time out of the workforce for their children. Under the current Social Security system, a woman can spend as many as ten years away from the workforce, return to a high-paid professional job, and still retire at 65 with a 1995 maximum monthly benefit of $1,199.  <p> But the financial foundations that support this edifice are giving way. How fast? Well, it's very hard to say. To figure out the financial status of Social Security in, say, 2020, we need to know how many retirees will be alive and what their level of benefits will be. Since benefits depend in large part on income, we need to predict what average incomes will be. That means predicting the rate of real wage increases (or decreases) and the unemployment rate. We need to estimate how long people will live and how many children they will have. With all these variables, the only thing we know is that our projections for Social Security will all be wrong and by how much we don't know.  <p> If the optimists are right, there isn't much of a problem. In this case, the system continues to roll up surpluses until 2070 and continues to pay out benefits as far as the eye can see. Unfortunately, the optimists are few in number.  <p> In the most likely projection, the system stops running surpluses in 2020, and by 2030 the trust fund has evaporated and annual payroll taxes can no longer fund benefits. Under more pessimistic assumptions, the system will be insolvent in just 21 years. Things get worse from there. In 2035: Income $642 billion (in 1995 dollars),expenditures $1.48 trillion, deficit $834 billion. By 2050, total expenditures are projected to hit $673 billion, and the expected deficit will be $1.03 trillion. For reference, the current U.S.gross domestic product is projected at $7.01 trillion for 1995.<p>  <p>We've already made one attempt to fix the problem. In 1983 the country woke up to discover that Social Security was headed for bankruptcy. After much moaning and groaning, a bipartisan commission headed by current Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan came up with "reforms" actually, tax increases and benefit cuts.The retirement age was set to rise gradually from 65 to 67; payroll taxes rose from 10.8 percent to 12.4 percent; many recipients would have to pay income tax on their Social Security benefits; and more income was subject to the Social Security tax. All that was supposed to keep Social Security afloat for 75 years.  <p> It wasn't enough. Just 12 years later, it's time for another big fix. <p>This is, to put it mildly, unsettling. The meltdown of Social Security is speeding up. Three things have gone wrong: Americans are living too long, we are not having enough children, and we are not making enough money.   <p> In 1940, when the first Social Security old-age checks went out, men had an average life expectancy of 61.4 years, and women 65.7 years. With a normal retirement age of 65, it was easy to make the system work. Those who made it to 65 could expect to live longer; still, the average time between retirement and death was 11.9 years for men and 13.4 years for women.  <p> By 1994, life expectancy for men was up to 72.6 years, and for women it rose to 79. Furthermore, the average length of retirement had increased; men retiring at 65 in 1994 can look forward, on the average, to a retirement of 15.2 years, and women have 19 years of cashing their monthly checks.  <p> At the same time that we are living longer, we are also having fewer children. The average family size has dropped from 3.5 children per couple in the 1950s to 2.1 children today, meaning fewer wage earners to pay Social Security taxes in the future. <p> American wage growth collapsed as well. From 1959 to 1972, real wages grew an average of 1.7 percent a year. For reasons economists don't understand very well, from 1973 to 1994 real wages fell at an average rate of 1 percent a year.  <p> To keep the Social Security system in balance in the face of these demographic trends, payroll withholding taxes would have to rise from the current level of 12.4 percent on the first $61,200 of income to 14.7 percent or possibly even 17.3 percent. If Medicare is included with Social Security, by 2030 payroll taxes for those two "benefits" will reach 25.69 percent.  <p> The alternative is to cut benefits. One study suggests that to avoid tax increases, inflation-adjusted benefits to baby boomers would need to fall 40 percent by 2030.  <p> All those who want their payroll taxes doubled please raise their hands. Nobody? Okay. Then all those who want their benefits cut by 40 percent raise their hands. That, in a nutshell, is why politicians don't want to mess with Social Security.  <p> But the terrain is slowly shifting, and a few politicians havenoticed. A lot of retirees who vote like the system just fine as it is and will punish politicians who even hint at changing it, but a powerful coalition favoring change is slowly coming into being. As the Johns and Marys of the world notice that Social Security isn't a good deal for them, as Generation Xers increasingly doubt that Social Security will pay off, and as Social Security taxes inexorably increase, we can look for increasing political pressure for changes in the system.  <p> And don't discount the clout of the financial-services industry in this contest either. Here's a guess: When the politicians finally summon up the courage to take on the Social Security system, the financial-services industry will be there for them. Not long ago, I gave a luncheon talk at New York's "21" Club for pension-fund managers concerning a privatized Social Security system. Their eyes lit up as they fantasized about the effects of trillions of dollars moving into the stock market over the next generation. As they played with the possibilities the Dowat 20,000, billions in management fees it was clear that, from their perspective, this was a Big Idea.  <p> Already proposals for reform are wafting around the think tanks; a few politicians like senators Bob Kerrey and Alan Simpson areurging their colleagues to take a hard look at them. In general the proposals fall into one of two types.  <p> One, favored chiefly by political forces loyal to the old New Deal coalition, can be called the tinker approach. Raise a tax here, cut a benefit there, hike the retirement age, and hope that the system holds together. Better yet, take the current surplus in the system and invest it in equities. At least that way we will get a better rate of return on the money we are setting aside.  <p> The problems are probably too severe to be solved by tinkering,however. A 25 percent payroll tax would wreck the economy, but anything less would result in benefit cuts. Moreover, tinkering will infuriate those who like the current system without enlisting the enthusiasm of those who want a meaningful fix. It's political poison.  <p> More radical proposals calling for wholesale or partial privatization of the system may therefore actually have better political prospects. Conservatives like a system that sets up individually directed retirement accounts because it puts individuals in control of their financial future. Those who are skeptical about the future of Social Security like it because individuals would have legal title to their contributions. The financial-services industry likes it because administering these pension funds would be the source of huge and continuing profits.  <p> Although in general the idea of Social Security privatization remains the property of the political right, the system is too big and affects too many people for it to be reformed without political consensus. That's why glimmerings of support from moderate Democrats like Senator Kerrey and social activists such as Sam Beard are so interesting.  <p> Beard, who got his political start as a staff associate with Senator Robert Kennedy in 1965, is an unexpected voice arguing for privatization. Chairman of the nonprofit National Development Council and a descendant of railroad baron James J. Hill Beard believes that partial privatization of Social Security is a social-justice issue. "Working families in this country," he says, "don't have the chance to accumulate capital. I'd like to see this become a country with 100 million millionaires."  <p> As Beard sees it, by encouraging working families to accumulate capital in a mixed public-private Social Security system, we might be able to address some of the inequality in our society. That is another feature of a mixed Social Security system that could be attractive to liberals. Obviously, government regulation of these pension funds would be necessary.  <p> That's the situation in Chile, where something similar to this plan has actually been adopted. Facing a pension crisis of its own, the Pinochet government set up a privatized program in 1981. Participation in the program was voluntary, and workers were at first suspicious, but with the Chilean stock market soaring, over time virtually all have transferred from the old state system to the private program. In Chile, retirement funds are required to invest 90 percent of their funds in Chilean stocks and bonds. This keeps the money at home and creates new jobs in Chile. <p> There are, however, a few flies in the ointment that nobody, left or right, really wants to talk about. The biggest is what Social Security experts call the "transition problem." In a nutshell: If we abolish Social Security taxes and replace them with a private funding system, who puts in the money to pay the benefits for the people in the current system? Those who have already retired and those who have paid into the system for decades have legitimate moral claims to the benefits they have been promised. At present, Social Security pays out $317 billion in benefits annually. Over a 30-year transition period, we could be talking about $10 trillion to $12 trillion in unfunded pension liabilities. The total current surplus in the trust fund is just $436 billion. Any suggestions? <p> The Chilean example, unfortunately, isn't much help. Since previous governments had nationalized much of Chilean industry, the Pinochet government was able to use the proceeds from privatization to help fund the transition. Furthermore, as private-pension expert Jean de Fougerolles told me, at the time of pension reform, Chile had a significant budget surplus. This, too, could be devoted to filling the holes in the pension system. Finally, the vast inflow of capital from the new pension system transformed Chile's underdeveloped financial markets and ignited a period of rapid economic growth. Tax revenues shot up, and the pension obligations of the old system shrank as a percentage of Chile's gross domestic product. Even so, the transition has been difficult and costly 4 to 5 percent of Chilean GDP was devoted to paying off the old system's pensions for the first ten years.  <p> Beyond the funding problem are questions about how such a vast private pension could be effectively regulated and administered. If private pension funds went broke, the government would clearly be obligated to insure investors against complete destitution. This implies a certain amount of supervision of the management and operation of the licensed investment funds.  <p> A mixed system one that introduced partial privatization while keeping many features of the present system might be a solution to these problems. For example, a bill proposed by senators Kerrey and Simpson would allow individuals to place part of their Social Security contribution 2 percent of wages into private pension plans.   <p> A mixed or gradual plan combined with benefit reductions, extension of retirement age to 70, and other belt-tightening features could keep the present system more or less afloat while giving younger people more assurance that at least some of their contributions will be waiting for them at retirement. Benefits under the old system would gradually drop through the transition, but no age group would suffer disproportionately.  <p> The right mixed system could solve these and other problems but not without major expenditures. Although mixed plans shrink the costs of transition, they don't eliminate them. One study of a mixed plan suggests that without a payroll-tax increase, the cost of transition would be about $2.4 trillion. Raising payroll taxes from 6.4 to 8.4 percent during the transition period would help fill that gap.  <p> A mixed system could still disproportionately hurt some classes of Americans in fact, precisely those classes that the current Social Security system is designed to help. For example, blue-collar workers face falling incomes, making it more difficult for them to save for retirement. At the same time, layoffs and intermittent employment are increasingly common facts of blue-collar life. <p> People who temporarily drop out of the workforce in their 20s would also be hurt. These are the years when most women take time off from work to have children. Thanks to compound interest, missed contributions in the early years are hard to make up. At a 10 percent annual total return until she retires, every $100 a young mother misses contributing at age 21 reduces her retirement nest egg by $8,018. Unemployment has a similar effect.That flaw could be fixed. An insurance program working much like current disability insurance could ensure that contributions would be kept up during parental leave and unemployment.  <p> Low-income workers would take the biggest hit. The present system subsidizes retirement for low-income working people. They cannot afford benefit cuts, nor can they save enough to give them the kind of nest egg John and Mary Worth put away. But this too can be remedied. A government savings match could top up the contributions of low-income workers to the private investment fund. Since these contributions would compound over time, it would actually be cheaper for the government to subsidize the retirement of the working poor with a savings match rather than pay-as-you-go transfer programs.  <p> A mixed public-private Social Security system could work significantly better than the current system is projected to do. But that requires that we do not simply gut the current Social Security program and replace it with a privatized pension plan that works for the rich but for no one else. The present Social Security system protects most of the elderly against poverty. It is a cheap form of term insurance that provides generous benefits for the under-18 children of deceased workers. Unlike almost every other government program, Social Security provides economic recognition for the contribution that homemakers have made, providing women with survivors' benefits after the deaths of their bread winning husbands. <p> But that system looks increasingly unable to perform all the set asks. The delicate balance that has made Social Security work so well has been upset. It's time for a new system that pays attention to the goals of the old plan but that has a better chance of achieving them in a world that is demographically and economically far different than that of the New Deal.   <p><p>

						July/August 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> THE DIS-ORGANIZATION MAN <p>All around you people are saying goodbye to the office  
and setting up at home. You might be thinking of going solo yourself. But beware: The solitary work life is a complicated one financially, emotionally, and electronically.   <p> By Richard Todd  <p> I work at home. Of my old house, exactly 11 percent of the floorspace (as recently calculated for the IRS) devotes itself to business, though that might not be the impression if you walked in through the back door. I charge my fellow taxpayers nothing for my use of my dining room table as a storage area, nor do I take off anything for cordwood on days when the office is too cold to occupy and I move to the kitchen table, nearer to the wood stove. The office in question, though its floor slants and its walls admit the west wind, holds (besides me and my desk) two phones, a fax, a word processor, a computer and modem, anda photocopying machine.  <p> I am sort of a Luddite, as it happens, but one has to concede that this stuff (ridiculously cheap, considering its powers) makes my domesticated enterprise possible or at least plausible to others, which may be the same thing. I can store data. I can generate documents. I can be reached.  <p> And while we're blessing technology, how about a word for the invention that really sustains things around here the hub concept of delivery, used by Federal Express and its brethren?  <p> So thanks to all modern geniuses for this life, which seems in some lights a kind of idyll. Certainly it seemed so when I was office-bound at a magazine and yearning to be free, in anera of Friday night drives to the country, with the children half asleep and Happy Meal boxes on the floor and a cat on one's shoulder. Wouldn't it be better just to live here? Now I do. Field and wood begin outside the door, and though I am not much of a wing shot myself, I can generally flush a grouse on an autumn afternoon and, if accompanied by a better shot, bring it home for dinner.  <p> Fewer people worked at home in the early 1980s when I chose this way of life but wait... Did I choose it? In one of the more interesting confessions in his recent book, Robert McNamara admits that he isn't sure whether he resigned from the Johnson administration to join the World Bank or whether the World Bank hired him so Johnson didn't have to fire him. This should give one pause. I don't mean that any such thoughtful conspiracy was at work in my case, only that it's usually wise to be suspicious of freewill, especially when you find yourself participating in what turns out to be a trend.  <p> Around here, everyone I now see in the evening has just put in a hard day at the home office. I live in one of those places that was ripe for this, a long territory in western New England stretching from Litchfield County, Connecticut, to Burlington, Vermont, a region where until recently (no more, alas) de Lavalmilking equipment out sold Compaq computers. Plenty of such places all across the country are filling up with lone entrepreneurs and telecommuters.  <p> Whether we are pioneers or refugees makes a nice question. Yet the sun shines today on my little community. I have just come back from seeing my friends on the hill, newsletter publishers. They have the coveted <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a> combination printer-copier-fax. Also a scanner that somehow receives documents and sets them directly into type, so that the next thing they see after the phone rings is a page proof. Outside, a well-tilled garden awaits its seeds.  <p> So all's well here, and more of you are coming to join us, aren't you? I can't stop you, don't want to stop you surely you're doing the right thing. But I have stared out the same window for sometime now, and I have some darkish thoughts about this life. The first concerns Time. Time remains the great promise of the work-at-home life, time that expands in every direction. There is something to this. <p> I have a time guru, my friend and sometime colleague Robert Grudin. He's a Shakespearean scholar by trade, but he has also written a truly wonderful book in what might be called the higher self-help genre, Time and the Art of Living. At a conference earlier this year, Grudin suggested that a cash value could be assigned to time not spent doing some of the noxious business involved in organizational life, notably commuting. Even a lower income might justify itself on the balance sheet: "These dollar losses are in fact capital investments in the long-term prosperity we call quality of life," he said. We're dealing here with that kind of interesting and not unappealing money that economists like to write about; its only deficiency is that you can't spend it. In any case, Grudin is surely on to something.  <p> The favorite time for home-office workers immediately becomes 7 to 9 a.m., or whatever hours were once wasted getting to work. To tumble downstairs and go directly to your desk is to have a leg up on the whole of the conventional world. Norman Mailer speaks of the special access to your unconscious that you enjoy on first awakening, and though this may matter more to Mailer than to you, you know your creative powers are little enhanced by putting on a starched shirt and heading for a train station in the first light. A time of similar value appears at the other end of the day (particularly if you have napped), but it maybe complicated by Little League practice or some other thing you're now able to do because you have "more time for your family."<p><p><p>

						July/August 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Cover  <p> DIE BROKE <p>We are all being held hostage by a national obsession with inheritance. When will we realize that a good life beats a good death?  <p> By Stephen M. Pollan and Mark Levine  <p> Ever since 1993, when two Cornell University economists primed U.S. baby boomers to expect the largest collective inheritance in world history around $10 trillion Americans of every stripe have been infected by patrimony fever. The landmark study, by Robert Avery and Michael Rendall, told boomers to look forward to 115 million bequests with a mean value of more than $90,000. This avalanche of gifts, said the academics, would reach far deeper into society than any previous transfer of wealth. Once a prerequisite of high birth, inheritance was going middle class. <p> Until this study appeared, Americans had a far less grandiose vision of their patrimony. In a survey by Louis Harris & Associates, conducted the very same year, only 42 percent of people with living parents said they expected to be left anything at all. And only 24 percent of those thought they'd get more than $50,000. Still, Avery and Rendall's numbers were seized upon by trend-hungry media pundits, and soon it became common wisdom that a massive windfall was about to be passed from generation to generation. Financial-services companies started jockeying for a piece of the unprecedented transaction.  <p> Two years later, talk of inheritance is everywhere. Estate planning once an upper-crust business is being touted as something for the common man. Brokerage firms have launched or expanded trust subsidiaries that target the broad middle class: <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>'s unit now operates in 38 states. Mutual fund companies such as Fidelity Investments, which owns Worth's parent company, also are moving strongly into the trust business to meet the needs of boomers and their folks.  <p> Meanwhile, insurance companies are selling more policies designed to shelter estates. Purchases of secondtodie policies which pay off any estate taxes after the death of a spouse, among other benefits exploded in the late 1980s and are still climbing. Equitable Life's product in this category, for example, saw a 57 percent jump in sales last year. And well over 3 million Americans now hold long-term-care insurance, a number that has been rising an average of 27 percent a year since 1987, according to the Health Insurance Association of America.  <p> Rather morbidly, many of these products and services are being marketed to the likely recipients of bequests not to the givers. Financial advisors fashion themselves "inheritance counselors" and offer wisdom to boomers whose parents are about to die. Experts suggest taking a more active role in a parent's financial life to maximize a legacy. And attorneys tell people how to impoverish their parents artificially by taking legal ownership of their homes, for example so the oldsters will qualify for federal aid instead of squandering their kids' inheritance in a nursing home. <p> "I knew the whole thing had gotten out of hand," says investment advisor Gary Ambrose, "when a new client came into my office and I took a look at his net-worth statement. There was a line in the asset column titled 'Inheritance.' When I offered my condolences, he said, 'Oh, my parents aren't dead yet. That's just an estimate.'"  <p> It's understandable that baby boomers would grasp at inheritance as a cure-all. After all, they've felt squeezed for years by rising living costs, stagnant wages, college tuition, and the specter of huge health care expenses in old age. A Lotto-sized bequest from Mom and Dad seems like the magic bullet they fantasized about as they lay awake wondering how they'd ever afford to retire. But while millions are being encouraged to act as if such a bonanza is their due, we should keep a couple of important facts in mind. First, no one is entitled to his or her parents' money. And second, this supposed bonanza may not even be real (see "A Rather Uncertain Jackpot" below).  <p>  <p>What's more, counting on a big handout from your parents is hardly a, well, mature approach to personal finance. We think the more important insight here lies behind the hype, where an anti-inheritance backlash is taking root. It's too early to call this fledgling intellectual movement a trend. But it should prove of more significance than any onetime transfer of wealth no matter how large.  <p> In the vanguard of this new movement are a small number of upper-middle-class folks, boomers and parents alike, who could easily be building an estate for their kids. Instead, they plan to leave nothing behind when they die. Even a single dollar left on the table, they say, represents an opportunity for happiness either as spender or gift giver that has been lost forever. We believe these people's example contains the seed of a new, holistic view of personal finance, a healthier approach than the inheritance model now in vogue. <p>We call it "dying broke."  <p> Our corporeal lives are finite. Shouldn't financial life end at death, too? That's what 67-year-old Bill Brady figures. The former owner of his own security company, Brady is now busily spending every penny he earned over more than a half century of work. Between renovating his country home and fixing up his boat, he takes the time to explain his credo: "I intend to enjoy life with my wife and family, do the things I never got to do. I'll pass my money on to my eight children while I'm alive." <p> He's not alone in his resolve. Take the ebullient 48-year-old Dwight Tierney, vice president of <a name="AMEX:VIA.B"></a><b>Viacom</b>, the giant entertainment company. "I've explained to my three children that if I do things right, all that'll be left over will be enough to pay my debts and bury me." Or consider Allan and Lori Bahn, who'll pass along the same message when their kids are old enough to understand. Allan, the introspective 41-year-old inspector general of New York City's Department of Transportation, and Lori, a thoughtful 38-year-old exercise entrepreneur, have a 3-year-old daughter, Hallie, and a 2-year-old son, Jack. "Leaving lots of money to them upon my death would diminish their survival instincts," says Allan. "They wouldn't have to exercise the skills that make people stronger."  <p> Brady, Tierney, and the Bahns have all looked closely at the idea of inheritance. Like other die-brokers, they've come away with the conclusion that leaving money to one's kids is, at best, a mixed blessing. Their reasons are varied: Inheritance can be inefficient, harmful to relationships, destructive of the work ethic, even bad for society as a whole. But whatever the specific objection, these people are agreed on one thing: Money is bestused while its owner is alive to see the benefits.  <p> Dying broke doesn't mean not saving or not planning carefully for the future. In fact, it requires at least as much thought as any other financial philosophy (see "One Die-Broker's Experience" below). But it differs from traditional strategies by not putting off enjoyment until it's too late. Die-brokers use financialtools to allow them to live fully and securely up to their means. If they want to help their grand kids, for example, they won't leave behind a trust fund. Instead, they'll help pay off college loans or take the kids to Paris. If they want to help adult children, they won't leave a stock portfolio; they'll help buy a vacation home. The idea is to build a better sort of legacy: skills, memories, a sense of family. And, not incidentally, have some fun along the way.  <p> The downside of such a strategy, of course, is abandoning that most entrenched of financial traditions: inheritance. But as we'll see, that's neither much of a sacrifice nor for most people much of a change.  <p> Inheritance has been around for as long as humans have had something of value to pass along. Prior to the Industrial Age, property passed from one generation to the next mostly as fixed assets: a farm, some land, tools for a trade, a family business. These assets were the backbone of an unspoken contract between the generations. The oldest son of a farmer, for example, would slowly assume his father's work, knowing that the farm would eventually be his. When the father died, the son would take over the farm with the provision that he'd take care of his mother.  <p> A daughter, meanwhile, might receive valuable heirlooms, like silverware or furniture. A younger son might get tools or perhaps a library of books. Just as the oldest son assumed a responsibility along with his inheritance, so did the younger children. They were charged with making good use of their inheritances and passing them on to subsequent generations. In this admittedly simplified vision, inheritance was about family possessions rather than money. Except in the richest families, wealth was expected to come as the result of hard work, ambition, and virtue.  <p> With industrialization and the resulting shift to a more mobile, urban society, however, families had fewer assets such as land or small businesses to pass along and the Great Depression sopped up much of what remained. Many average Americans lost their tie to a family heritage and sharpened their reliance on themselves, looking especially to the skills and knowledge that came from education. The way to become rich in the modern U.S. was to train as a doctor or a lawyer. For middle-class folks, inheritance stopped being part of the family cycle and was transformed into an idle fantasy.  <p> The apotheosis of this attitude may have come with popular television shows such as The Millionaire, a popular drama on which everyweek some John or Jane Doe was handed a check for $1 million. From Little Lord Fauntleroy to Charles Foster Kane, inheriting great wealth was part of our collective unconscious. But it was all harmless day dreaming, having to do with surprise telephone calls and distant relatives and kindly strangers. Real people seldom died with much money to give away.  <p> By the Reagan era, things had begun to change once more. Extensive government support systems had helped many World War II vets and their younger siblings go to college, buy a home, and send their own kids to college on the cheap. Coupled with the economic boom of the post war years, that had freed up lots of money to be saved. Meanwhile, real estate values had gone through the roof. When the baby boom generation began buying houses in droves, older people reaped a considerable profit. In addition, these folks were the first and probably will be the only generation in American history to take advantage of generous private and public pensions. Suddenly, the U.S. had an older cohort with a lot more than Aunt Minnie's topaz pendant to pass along.  <p> The final piece dropped into place with Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cuts. Reagan's program chopped by two thirds the number of estates subject to tax and sliced taxes for the rest, too. After1981, a savvy couple could leave $1.2 million tax free. By the end of the decade, twice as many families would have enough wealth to pass along big bequests as during the 1950s and 1960s. Boomers began talking wistfully about getting their parents' money but only among close friends and after a couple of bottles of Cabernet had been knocked back.  <p> Then Avery and Rendall released their figures, and the floodgates opened. Before long, it wasn't just okay to discuss a hoped-for inheritance; it was positively trendy. A generation that had venerated On the Road instead started acting out Martin Chuzzle wit. Precious few took the time to examine whether inheriting money was really such a good thing.  <p> The division of an estate has always been grounds for family fights worthy of a Eugene O'Neill play. And when a parent's estate is composed of investments as opposed to, say, a family farm society hasn't devised a customary way to divide the spoils. The two most common approaches are equal division and need-based division. But both methods can rile the recipients. As attorney Erwin Shustak, who has been involved in scores of estate battles, says: "It's rare that testamentary gifts turn out the way the giver intended. Some people are resentful they weren't left more. Some are resentful a sibling was left the same amount they were. I've seen it create more problems than it solves."  <p> Even if such conflicts can be avoided, receiving a monetary bequest can cause other dilemmas. "It's ironic, but a large inheritance is often detrimental," says financial advisor Gary Ambrose. "Sometimes people aren't able to handle it either financially or emotionally. They end up being worse off in both areas of their lives." That's particularly true when it comes to inheriting money: <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> shares or T-bills don't carry with them the moral road map that used to come with a gift of family property.  <p> It has long been theorized that inheriting money erodes an individual's work ethic. That's backed up by the results of a 1992 study by Douglas Holtz-Eakin of Syracuse University and David Joulfaian of the U.S. Treasury. Using IRS records, they showed that 4.5 percent of those who received an inheritance of less than $25,000 dropped out of the work force but almost one in five who got more than $150,000 packed up their work clothes. In fact, just expecting a bequest can damage a person's financial habits. A1994 study by economist David Weil of Brown University found that people who expect an inheritance spend more, and save less, than others in the same income bracket.  <p> Expecting an inheritance can also hurt the dynamic between elderly parents and their children. Every dollar the parent spends, whether on a rattan dining set or a two-week vacation in Italy, can be viewed as a dollar that's coming from the child's pocket. For those who'll leave a fortune either way, the calculation can be shrugged off. But for the merely well-off it has serious implications. Should you draw on principal to buy that perfect retirement home or settle for something less satisfying? The more eager people are to leave a healthy estate, the more likely they'll compromise. This amounts to choosing quality of death over quality of life. <p> A culture of inheritance also does little for U.S. society as a whole especially since tax revenue from after-death gifts has fallen since Reagan's tax cuts. (The Republican Party's Contract With America would slice in half again the number of bequests subject to tax, to just 0.5 percent of all estates.) It's often proposed that a boom in inherited wealth will speed the division of America into a society of haves and have-nots. There's certainly evidence for this view. In 1982, for example, parents with networths of between $1 million and $2.5 million left average bequests to each of their children of $238,567, according to an oft-cited study. Meanwhile, those kids already had incomes double the median family income.  <p> And of course, inheritance can be an inefficient way to pass along wealth. Even after the easing in 1981, estate taxes still are among the highest levied by the Internal Revenue Service, ranging up to 55 percent. And if an estate's assets are mostly in a qualified retirement plan an increasingly frequent occurrence the tax bite can be even harsher. Says financial planner Madeline Noveck: "It's conceivable that heirs could be left with only15 to 30 percent."  <p> Finally, consider the deadening effect on the psyche of a generation that's being encouraged to rely on inheritance as part of its financial plan. It's tough to wait for a loved one to die so you can come into your own.  <p> Just ask Prince Charles.  <p> What makes America's newfound obsession with inheritance so galling is that there's a better alternative one that makes more sense whether your children are 4, 14, or 40. And while it's not a complete cinch to execute, it's stunningly simple to understand: Use up your money while you can enjoy it; leave only enough to settle your affairs.  <p> In some ways, dying broke mirrors a conventional personal-finance plan. It advocates building wealth as early as possible. It uses conventional financial tools (see "How to Use It All Up Safely" on page 65). Where it diverges from tradition is in its treatment of assets. Traditional plans seek to preserve assets even beyond the life of the individual. Dying broke means exploiting these assets, though it'll lead to their depletion. Even with sucha distinction, however, die-brokers have no radical disagreement with traditional plans at least in the early stages.  <p> Those who choose to die broke begin their financial lives in the time-honored way: They try to grow wealth through sound equity investments, while protecting themselves and their family from disaster by insuring against early death, disability, serious illness, and the like. So far, so good. During the peakearning years of middle age, though, dying broke begins to veer slowly away from conventional practice.  <p> Middle-aged couples who want to die broke maintain their insurance and keep building their personal wealth to the extent possible but they no longer grow a nest egg at the expense of their own quality of life or that of their children. Savings may be spent on things like much-needed family vacations, renovations, or down payments on second homes. Meanwhile, long-term-care insurance should be bought while it's still affordable: A 40-year-old can take outa lifelong comprehensive policy, with a decent benefit of $250 a day, for an annual premium of less than $900.  <p> It's after age 60 that die-brokers break rank most firmly with their peers. Rather than view their life savings as capital from which to earn income either primary or supplemental, depending on a person's attitude toward retirement they regard assets as a storehouse from which it's time to start drawing. Outliving one's money is an obvious concern, so a big chunk of savings should go toward annuities that'll serve as longevity insurance, guaranteeing a decent income for life. Long-term care has been dealt with already, so that's not a problem.  <p> What's left over, then, is for enjoyment. Free of the burden of preserving an estate, die-brokers can use their money freely albeit on a long-term budget to help their families and improve their own lives in large and small ways. Now's the time to look into tools like a reverse mortgage, which can provide extra tax-free income while you maintain use of a property. Now's the time to start giving gifts to your kids and grandkids and reaping the tax advantages.  <p> The rewards are large. Strictly on the financial side, one person can give another up to $10,000 a year tax free. That means a couple can give each of their children or grandchildren $20,000 a year. Additional gifts can be made "presently tax free" if applied against your $600,000 estate exclusion. (In effect, youget the benefit instead of your estate.) And any money paid to educational institutions or medical facilities as a gift to pay for someone else's education or care is tax exempt, too. Even bequests to charities can be structured so they provide a stream of income while the donor is alive.  <p> There are other types of reward, too. Compared with leaving money in a will, giving gifts while you're alive is better for those on the receiving end. With life expectancy rising, inheritances will pass to people later and later in life. Parents who live well into their 80s will be leaving their money to 60-year-olds.While still in the prime of their lives, these recipients have already gone through the period when extra money would have made the most difference. Sure, it'll be nice for them to take that cruise but it would have been nicer to start the small business they once dreamed of.  <p> Die-brokers also help society. For over two centuries now, the engine of wealth has been shifting away from property land, say,or a set of tools and toward knowledge and skills. Well-chosen gifts can help kin acquire these 21st-century assets. That might mean helping a teen pay for college, giving a 30-year-old the freedom to get a professional degree, or helping a 40-year-old become an entrepreneur. It might even mean taking a family member to Mexico or buying a computer game like Myst. The way we see it, any expenditure of less than $1,000 that broadens a mind is worth more than an equivalent savings bond.  <p> And passing wealth along during life offers big emotional benefits to die-brokers themselves. The joy of seeing a young child learn, or getting the thanks of a young adult, can not be measured. "When you give a child something, you're saying to them, I'll be here when you need me,' " says Nancye Green, the 47yearold president of a design consulting firm and a mother of two who has decided to die broke. "It's the act of giving, not the money, that's really important."  <p> Of course, die-brokers shouldn't forget about themselves. Get yourself over to Ireland while you're still young enough to climb Croagh Patrick. Go out to dinner more often. Don't hang on to your money so your kids can blow it on a Mercedes you'll never see buy the darn car yourself. As Bill Brady, the energetic former security consultant, says, "I get to enjoy my life and see my children enjoy the fruits of all my labors."  <p> So why aren't more people doing this? Partly it's because little media attention has been given to the concept of dying broke especially compared with the recent wave of hype about inheritance. Partly it's because the idea is new enough that few financial advisors offer plans for it yet. These things are changing, though. Planner Gary Ambrose, for example, calls dying broke "a wonderful value system." Nick Morrow, an accountant who specializes in lifetime financial planning, calls it "probably the smartest thing you can do."  <p> There's also been some hesitation because of the nature of annuities the primary tool for dying broke. By buying an annuity, you hand over some of your wealth to an insurance company. In return for your cash, the insurer pays you a guaranteed stream of income in essence, betting that you'll die before you come out ahead. You're making an actuarial gamble too: You bet that you'll die before your insurance company does.  <p> "When you buy an annuity, you're often giving up control of your capital," says Jesse Gottlieb, senior vice president of Alexander & Alexander Services, an insurance consultancy. "People don't like that. Even though there are ways to mitigate the risk, they're afraid the insurer could go broke and leave them with nothing." Die-brokers will protect themselves in a couple of ways. They should buy annuities only from an insurer that has been rated AAA by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's for at least10 years running, for example. They may also buy annuities from more than one such company, diluting risk even further.  <p> Some people also worry about dying too soon and leaving money behind that'll go to their insurer instead of to their kids. Others are convinced they can generate a better income stream on their own. And still others fret about locking up their money in an illiquid investment. An emergency will arise, they imagine, requiring the lump sum they've irrevocably paid to the insurer. Such misgivings have led insurers to introduce new products that, for example, offer access to an annuity's cash value at a price, natch. But while such innovations may boost people's comfort with dying broke, it's really America's fixation on inheritance that must change for this concept to move forward.  <p> As long as inheritance was focused on property, it served a social purpose: promoting family continuity. But now that the mechanism is focused on money, its benefits are murkier and its drawbacks are clear. We think dying broke is shaping up as a worthy philosophical replacement. It lets us devote our energy to life, not death; to the present, not a future that never comes. People are human beings, not corporations that must be perpetuated. And money is best used for families not heirs.   <p>  <p>A RATHER UNCERTAIN JACKPOT  <p> Baby boomers may indeed receive the biggest intergenerational transfer of wealth in history but the payout won't be nearly as impressive as some believe. As economists Robert Avery and Michael Rendall admit in their 1993 study about boomers and inheritance, they took some shortcuts to arrive at that much-cited estimate of a $10.4 trillion bonanza.  <p> Take, for example, the rising cost of end-of-life care for boomers' parents hospitals, nursing homes, and such. Avery and Rendall didn't address it at all. Gifts to charity weren't taken into consideration either. And all inheritances were expressed in1989 dollars, without accounting for decades of likely inflation. Perhaps most problematic, though, were rosy assumptions about the habits and demographics of boomers' parents projected all the way through the year 2040. Avery and Rendall are up front about these problems, presenting their numbers as little more than hints about the future. But the media down played such caveats to focus on a sexy headline.  <p> What's a more realistic scenario for boomers, then? No one quite knows but trends suggest that the huge bequests now being predicted (an average of more than $90,000 per recipient) simply won't pan out. For one thing, boomers' parents are living ever longer and retiring ever earlier. That means they'll be spending far more on living expenses. And increasing health care costs at the end of life could have a big impact, as we've said.  <p> There's also evidence that older people's habits are changing: They're saving less and spending more than anyone previously expected. A study by economists Laurence Kotlikoff and Jagadeesh Gokhale, for instance, found that the average 80-year-old is spending $1.16 for every $1 spent by a 30-year-old. In the 1960s, by contrast, 80-year-olds spent just 65 cents for every 30-year-old's buck. Medical costs may account for much of this increase but consumption is up in every other category, too.  <p> Meanwhile, older Americans are beginning to pass along money while they're alive. We endorse this "die broke" attitude, of course, but it'll deplete inheritances. A couple of illustrations: A study by Richard Anderson of Columbia University found that 25 percent of college tuition prepayment plans and nearly all such plans for kids under 12 are now funded by grandparents. And according to the National Association of Realtors, more and more first-time home buyers are making down payments with help from family members.  <p> Finally, all this hype about an inheritance explosion may prove irresistible to the tax man. Republicans hate estate taxes, but the Congressional Budget Office has noted that a tantalizing windfall some economists say $80 billion by the year 2000 could come from enacting two changes in tax rules: cutting the personal estate exemption in half (to $300,000) and applying capital-gains tax to estates. Despite all the publicity, therefore, the true extent of boomers' patrimony is unclear. What is certain, though, is that few of us can count on getting rich this way. For most people, inheriting great wealth remains what it always has been: a fantasy.  <p> HOW TO USE IT ALL UP--SAFELY  <p> To die broke, you'll need some combination of these seven everyday financial tools. Talk to your advisor whether an accountant, financial planner, or attorney about a mix that makes sense for you: It'll vary according to your age and your current financial health. "The key to getting the maximum benefit from dying broke," says accountant Nick Morrow, "is to make sure you do nothing to jeopardize the lifestyle you've chosen while simultaneously using every tax and legal vehicle possible to make sure your wealth is used in the most efficient manner."   <p> Annuities. These are the instruments that make dying broke possible, by shifting the risk of outliving your savings to an insurer. An annuity offers lifelong income in exchange for a lump-sum payment. There are many variations, but most die-brokers will go for "immediate annuities," which offer income from the moment they're purchased usually in one's 60s. They're also the easiest annuities for comparison shopping. Look only at insurers with AAA ratings for the past 10 years, then compare the quoted monthly income per $1,000 investment.  <p> Long-term-care insurance. An invaluable tool for maximizing disposable income. In traditional financial plans, it's used to protect assets from being eaten up by nursing-home or home-care costs. For a die-broker, this insurance frees spending money that might otherwise be held in reserve. The best policies offer lifelong coverage and the savings from early purchase are substantial. <p> Disability insurance. Essential for anyone who relies on earned income, particularly in middle age. Since die-brokers are apt to devote more income to themselves and their children and less to long-term saving disability insurance is a crucial safety net. An employer's plan may not be enough: Benefits should last as long as you plan on working. Annually renewable disability income policies are a good option.  <p> Major medical insurance. As with disability coverage, it's vital not to skimp on this type of program. Die-brokers typically live for the moment, but they can't ignore the financial devastation that can be caused by a family member's illness.  <p> Term life insurance. For someone planning to die broke, term-life policies can serve an important role: They protect against the early loss of a spouse's income in youth or middle age. Once that need can be addressed through savings, however, the insurance can be allowed to lapse. In later years, more affordable whole-life policies will provide for burial expenses and after-death payment of debts.  <p> Reverse mortgages. So far, we've dealt with protective measures a big concern for die-brokers, and perhaps all that's needed if you're a good saver. But for those who want to squeeze every last dime from their wealth, reverse mortgages are indispensable. These loans are secured by the equity in a home, which would otherwise pass into your estate at death. No fixed amount is borrowed; rather, the lender offers a monthly payment for as long as the borrower lives in the home (until death, for our purposes). Fees are included in the loan, and interest isn't paid until the loan is settled (again, at death). The resulting income comes tax free, since it's actually a loan. And of course, you get to stay in the house. When the house is finally sold to settle accounts, the lender takes half the profit or, if you've lived long enough, swallows the loss.  <p> Charitable giving. Giving money to family members has big tax benefits. Donating to a charitable organization can accomplish the same result and many nonprofit bodies now offer gifting plans that provide a stream of income similar to that from an annuity or reverse mortgage. There's also the psychic reward of doing good. And there's public acclaim, too, if that matters to you. To put it bluntly, give while you're alive and you get to attend a testimonial dinner. <p>  <p>ONE DIE-BROKER'S EXPERIENCE  <p> Dwight Tierney remembers the instant he decided to die broke though he didn't think of it that way at the time. Back then, Tierney was looking for a philosophy by which to live, not a lifetime financial strategy. "It was around 25 years ago, when I first started working in New York City," says the 48yearold vice president of Viacom, the big entertainment company. "I was walking down 48th Street, where all the music stores are, when I fell in behind a father and son. The son looked to be around 12 or13 and was clutching a guitar case to his chest. As I passed them I overheard him say, Dad, I want to thank you so much for this guitar you have no idea how much it means to me.' And the father replied, You have no idea how much enjoyment I got in buying it for you.' "  <p> From that point on, Tierney resolved, he would strive to get the same pure joy from his money. And he's followed the stranger's example ever since. "I've gotten the pleasure of giving my daughter the down payment for a handyman's special that she and her husband have done wonders with," he says. "I've had the thrill of giving my son the down payment for a truck that would make it possible for him to launch his own business. And I've helped my youngest afford payments for a car."  <p> Tierney hasn't yet reached the stage of life when he'll begin spending his nest egg to zero. But as a die-broker, he's already treating his finances differently, paying extra for a strong safety net and not worrying  about long-term accumulation anymore. "I'm not looking at 10- or 20-year returns," he says of his current investment style. "I'm looking to exploit the cash I have now to maximize its productivity so I can do the things I want for my family. I don't want to wait till I'm 65 to enjoy myself. AndI don't need to be buried in the best casket in the best plot in the best cemetery."  <p> Now that Tierney's moving into a spending mode, he says he sometimes feels a bit guilty perhaps because, like other die-brokers, he's disbursing wealth in a culture that preaches piling it up. And while he's not living beyond his means, his lifestyle is more lush than he could have imagined when growing up in a lower-middle-class home. Tierney also grapples with balancing his needs against those of his wife and their three children. "There have been times when I realized that if we did something for one of the kids, we couldn't afford to do something else for ourselves," he says. "In those instances, we've compromised. Sometimes we give a portion of what they need; other times we just lower our own sights. And of course, if the kids are in danger, you throw your own wants out the window."  <p> Still, Tierney and his wife are adamant that their children will get no helping hand from inheritance. "We want our legacy to be that our kids got a good education, and that they got support spiritually and financially when they needed it," he says. "Life isn't a dress rehearsal. The best time to give love and money is now."  <p><p><p>

						June 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> HOMEWORK WITH THE FAMILY   <p> By Alvin Rosenbaum  <p> In 1989, having paid the rent on some pricey downtown Washington office space for nearly two decades, I decided to stop commuting and start seeing more of my family. So I hauled files and equipment to my basement rec room and turned myself into a telecommuter. <p> Somewhat to my surprise, not only did I achieve my original goals, the move also made me far more focused, productive, and self-reliant in my work a result that, it turns out, is hardly atypical. According to Charles Grantham at the Institute for the Study of Distributed Work, an Oakland, California, teleworking think tank, white-collar workers in a range of studies experienced an average 15 percent increase in productivity after they began working from home a few days a week. Among full-time home-office workers, particularly consultants and those operating their own businesses, productivity can double, says Jack Nilles, an early telecommuting advocate and consultant.   <p> Over 200 computer-literate teleworkers and their managers recently took part in a study of telework programs by Smart Valley, a Palo Alto, California based information-management trade organization. Those surveyed said the benefits of working at home, including enhanced quality of work and personal life, far exceeded expectations. <p> The problems included promotion worries, maintaining office relationships, and, significantly, integrating work and family life. Families may not adapt naturally, or easily, to having a working parent or spouse home during the weekday, much less one unavailable to do chores or play with children.  <p> After two years in the rec room, I built a space behind my house with its own approach and entry. Unfortunately, most houses mine included were not designed for office work. Historically, the homes of the well-to-do have contained a number of sanctum-like spaces, libraries, dens but not rooms fitted out as a home office, or, more important, separated from the rest of the house. Physical isolation may seem a luxury, until a prospective client traipses past the breakfast dishes and a food-throwing infant on the way to the spare-bedroom office.  <p> Of course, you can't turn your home into a Potemkin village every time a client drops in. Working from home takes the cooperation of everyone in the house, according to authors Paul and Sarah Edwards, who recommend a week's trial run to uncover issues that need to be resolved. Invariably they appear: Is the office computer shared or not? What bathroom should business visitors use?  <p> Clear boundaries between home and office are essential, beginning with a door between them. Is the workspace off-limits to the children? If not, when is it okay to come in? I once had to lock my office door to make the point to my small son that he couldn't wander in and play computer games whenever he wished.  <p> I discovered after several trial runs that I was not very good at sharing the office with a coworker or an assistant. But working alone was impractical and lonely. My solution has been to increase the size of the business through strategic alliances that keep me in constant communication with coworkers through visits and the full panoply of electronic aids: E-mail, fax, phone, and modem. I also joined a downtown club to have a comfortable place to hang my hat between appointments and to meet colleagues. <p> There is no one formula for making your telecommute successful. Each person wants something different from a home office. And that's the point: At home your environment is custom-built for your needs. For example, I'm surrounded by my library, have 80 square feet of counter top to use as project staging areas, and have technology best suited to me, not to a purchasing department.  <p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - -  <p>Alvin Rosenbaum's web-site address is http://www.al.net. <p><p>

 BUILDING A BETTER TOWN TO LIVE IN  <p>
 By Russell Miller  <p>
 Three things stand out on the map of Abacoa, a new town under development in Palm Beach County, Florida. Smack in the center of town sits a 7,500-seat baseball stadium. A university campus with room for 4,900 students opens across from the town square. And one of the units on the map's scale is "five-minute walk." <p>
 Planned for 2,050 acres of native pine owned by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Abacoa will be both the spring-training base for Ted Turner's Atlanta Braves and home to a branch of Florida Atlantic University. By 2000, some 5,000 Abacoans could be living there, a population that should triple by 2015. Abacoa is a prime example of New Urbanism, a planning philosophy designed to conquer sprawl, tame traffic, and recapture a sense of community. New Urbanist planners look to old-fashioned towns for inspiration. They argue that sociable residential streets within walking distance of shopping and work will be the American neighborhoods of the 21st century.  <p>
 Abacoa was laid out by a prestigious team of New Urbanist leaders. Two of the designers, Peter Calthorpe and Andres Duany, spoke recently with Worth.  <p>
 Calthorpe, based in San Francisco, has long advocated pockets of pro-pedestrian development linked by transit lines. In <a href="http://www.lagunawest.com/">LagunaWest</a href>, an 800-acre town near Sacramento, California, he planned in 1989, Calthorpe demonstrated his model for integrating home, retail, and public facilities with jobs through roadside office parks. <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple Computer</b></a> was the first major recruit. An advisor to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, he also sits on President Clinton's Council for Sustainable Development. <p>
 Duany, together with his wife, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, is best known for Seaside, a Florida resort town in which building codes are written to control the proportions of streets and skyline. Architectural details like porches, windows, and fences make the houses pleasant places for socializing while also molding the shared space beyond. The Duany/Plater-Zyberk practice is based in Miami.  <p>
Worth: How does Abacoa differ from other projects you've designed? <p>
 Duany: It's unusually complete. It's large enough. It's going to be very well balanced in terms of the elements of workplace, office, and shopping. But also it will have a university, tremendous sports facilities, and elementary schools.  <p>
 Worth: How does that make such towns different?  <p>
 Duany: Most towns are not towns. They're suburban sprawl, a collection of statistics that don't have the physical bond that makes a town, how the elements are assembled in order to createpublic space.  <p>
 Worth: So in a place like Abacoa, retail mixes with houses and apartments?  <p>
 Duany: There's a declension. The corner store the equivalent of a convenience store is in the neighborhood. Then there's a main street, the dry cleaner, the small market, the bank, the video store, the restaurant, and so on. At a regional scale, there are entertainment centers, which have the cinemas and the restaurants. And then there are the big-box retailers, out on the highway.   <p>
 Worth: Doesn't the market demonstrate that Americans prefer subdivisions set apart by fences and even a gate?  <p>
 Duany: If you ask people, "Would you like to have a gated community or, for the same price, have a library nearby?" we know what the percentages are: It's overwhelmingly the library. Between a clubhouse and little shops nearby, it's overwhelmingly the little shops. If you ask if you want "retail" next to your house, what they're imagining is a 7-Eleven, and the answer is, of course, "No." But if you say "a corner store," especially if you show people a picture of what you mean, that answer's quite different. People say, "People don't live near where they work." But when you ask them, "Do you want your work to be near where you live?" they'll say yes.  <p>
 Worth: Who decides what building materials may be used?  <p>
 Duany: We decide in conjunction with the home builders and the master developer. The rules are fixed because the homeowners' association fixes them. The homeowners' association is more powerful than municipal codes because their rules are more difficult to change. And they can sustain lawsuits better because you contract into following the rules when you purchase your land.  <p>
 Worth: What makes you believe developers will embrace plans like yours?  <p>
 Duany: They're profitable. Lot for lot and square foot by square foot, Seaside and Kentlands [a development in suburban Maryland] outperform the competition. I can predict that by the turn of the century the model will have changed.  <p>
 Worth: Who do you expect will live in a town like Abacoa?  <p>
 Calthorpe: Our goal is always to have a diverse population base elderly, singles, families. We have double-income families now: Mom's not at home to take care of the kids. So what kind of a neighborhood works? A neighborhood with day care nearby, and parks and stores within walking distance so the parent doesn't have to be there to drive the kid everywhere. It works for the elderly, too. <p>
 Worth: Do people want neighbors with different levels of income? <p>
 Calthorpe: You know, supposedly people don't want to but LagunaWest is succeeding. It's got $300,000 to $400,000 homes and $100,000 homes. People are afraid of crime and poverty. I don't think they are afraid of social diversity. When you are talking about affordable housing, more often than not you are talking about the teacher in your school or the policeman or fireman in your community.  <p>
 Worth: Critics argue that Americans won't give up the freedom cars symbolize, that we prefer subdivision street plans with, for instance, culs-de-sac, to keep traffic off streets where we live.  <p>
 Calthorpe: People like culs-de-sac because through streets have too much traffic and people travel too fast on them. If you have multiple pathways, you don't have too much traffic. If you have narrow streets, people go slower. In solving one problem, you solve the other: It becomes a more walkable neighborhood simultaneously. <p>
 Worth: What about security? People pay more to live in gated communities.  <p>
 Calthorpe: You can try to achieve security through exclusion and gates and guards, or you can achieve security through community. I've had parents tell me, once again in Laguna West, that they feel safer about having their kids playing in the streets. They figure somewhere along the street, one out of 30 houses, someone's on their front porch. Whereas in the typical suburban pattern, where it's all garage doors, there's no reason for an adult to ever be out there.  <p>
 Worth: Will retailers abandon strip malls for a new version of Main Street?  <p>
 Calthorpe: Safeway's one of the biggest supermarket chains in the country. We're working with them on one of their typical sites only 12 acres, in Boulder, Colorado. We showed them a plan that included housing and offices and civic uses, a day care center and a library, as well as their store. They discovered that the land-use economics performed so much better than the standard strip center that they're now going after entitlements building permits for a mixed-use plan.   <p>
 Worth: That sounds like the sort of module you could slip into an existing city.  <p>
 Calthorpe: A lot of what we're doing has to work as infill. The thousand-acre freestanding town like [Abacoa] is not the wave of the future. The wave of the future is going back in and taking underutilized commercial parcels, industrial areas, skipped-overlands in existing suburban areas, and redeveloping them. In Portland, Oregon, we demonstrated that you could add another million people without expanding the growth boundary just by redeveloping parcels into more compact neighborhood centers.  <p>
 Worth: Does that create investment opportunities?  <p>
 Calthorpe: Huge. For example, we looked at a shopping mall [inPortland] just an object with a huge sea of parking around it. The owner said, "What if we put the downtown Portland grid into my parking lot?" It turned out that he had the equivalent of12 city blocks. If you develop those at only two- or three-story densities, he has tremendous land value. But for that to happen, you have to have an intelligent region that says, "We're not going to have development out in these farmlands. We're going to have redevelopment on these parking lots."  <p>
 Worth: How can a home buyer know if a community embodies New Urbanism principles? Isn't it just a subdivision with a few extra porches and sidewalks?  <p>
 Calthorpe: One way is to imagine yourself as a ten-year-old kid and see how many places you can get. Just draw a mental map: Can I get to the park? Can I get to the library? Can I get to school? Can I get to stores? The next question is, What's the quality of the path? Do I have to go out on a big arterial, with sound walls on either side, or am I on a tree-lined street? The other way is: How diverse is the community? Is this just for one age group or one income level? Or is it for a heterogenous community?  <p>
 Worth: Do you agree with Andres Duany that yours will be the do minant development model with in a decade?  <p>
 Calthorpe: I see the New Urbanism as expanding the realm of possibilities. I do believe it'll become the majority because it reflects more of the reality of our culture than the homogenous nuclear-family vision, the way the American Dream used to be.

						"Out of it steps our future, through this door/Enigmas, executioners and rules..." -- W.H. Auden<p>
At the dark end of a memorably bright winter's day in December 1993, a young man wearing a tan windbreaker rose from his seat on the 5:33 train out of Manhattan's Pennsylvania Station and began shooting his fellow passengers in the back and in the head. With his semi-automatic pistol gripped in both hands, the man -- a deluded and incessant failure named Colin Ferguson -- fired a bullet into Maryanne Phillips, who was reading a newspaper in the next seat. The bullet burst through the chest of the 39-year-old Nynex employee, exploded out of her left breast, and continued on to shatter the bones inside her upper left arm as if they were made of glass.<p>
Ferguson turned and fired a bullet into the head of Dennis McCarthy, a husband and father and an assistant manager at the Manhattan headquarters of Prudential Securities; a garrulous fellow who loved early mornings, big breakfasts, cheap ties that looked expensive, black-diamond ski runs, and saloons full of strangers. Friends said that when Dennis McCarthy came into a room filled with 100 people he didn't know, he would invariably meet 75 of them, offending 25 and befriending half the others in the process.<p>
McCarthy was riding home from work alongside his 26-year-old son, Kevin, the big and often introverted only child of a clever and opinionated father and a quietly strong and all-providing mother. Kevin had joined his father as a Prudential employee in the mutual funds division just six weeks earlier, and because of the commute he had shared with Dennis since taking the job, Kevin sensed that he was finally getting to know and respect his father as a fellow adult, as someone he no longer needed to test and challenge.<p>
After Ferguson shot Dennis McCarthy, Kevin -- who loved video games, rock music, movies, and dancing in the aisles at "hooter bars" with his friends -- had just enough time to raise his right hand as a shield before Ferguson shot him, too. Among the 140 bullets Ferguson brought along the night he boarded the third car of the 5:33 to Hicksville, Long Island, were a few dozen "deep penetrator" Black Talon cartridges. These were designed so as to unfurl six razor-sharp prongs upon entering a live target. The bullet was intended to claw its way up to 11 inches into living tissue, tearing an ever-wider hole like some vicious copper-petaled flower in full bloom. It was a Black Talon that tore apart the hand Kevin raised, blew a gaping hole in his skull, and then seemed to detonate inside his brain. <p>
This, as Kevin's father died against his left arm.<p>
Ferguson then strolled backward from the rear of the train toward the front, filling the car with acrid clouds of gunsmoke and splattering blood over handbags, winter overcoats, newspapers, and bound appointment schedulers. <p>
After the first sharp cracks of the pistol, some of the suburbanites standing near a door of the car in anticipation of the train's arrival at Merillon Avenue, in the suburban retreat of Garden City, looked back and saw what was happening in the rear of the car. A stampede commenced, with women knocked to the floor and men leaping over them "like terrified deer in the forest," as one seated passenger would recall it. Passengers rammed into locked doors at the front of the car, and with that, the full car of 80 or more commuters realized they were trapped. The neatly dressed man was now leisurely turning from left to right as he fired, as the train coursed deeper into the nightmare, like some exitless, silver-coated abattoir rattling through the preholiday evening.<p>
Ferguson shot a 35-year-old CPA and triathlete five times. He shot a pregnant banker, a software specialist, three lawyers, and two financial analysts. He shot employees of Salomon Brothers, National Westminster Bank, Moody's, IBM, Viacom, Reuters, and Consolidated Edison, and then he moved along to shoot again. <p>
Almost all of the passengers locked inside the terror of the third car were middle-class Americans in the way of white-collar workers who leave the office at five to get the train. They weren't the high-profile, late-night Manhattan laborers featured in The Wall Street Journal. As with the vast majority of commuters who navigate the anonymous crush of Penn Station and board the 90 trains leaving for the suburbs of Long Island during rush hour every weekday, they were the kinds of people for whom the evening's train ride home defined the blandest of middle-class certitudes. <p>
For more than a century, the short ride home on a train -- away from the urgency and innumerable threats of the city -- has been essential to a shared vision of safety that in many ways defines the purpose of life in an American suburb. Everyone riding in the 5:33 that night must have realized that violence and crime had flowed out from the city in the wake of the postWorld War II suburban surge. Yet in all that time, only one passenger had been killed on a Long Island Rail Road train, when a kid with a rifle fired into a passing train in 1968. Commuting on the LIRR was statistically much safer than driving a car, crossing the street, or even breathing the New York air.<p>
One passenger sitting in the middle of the third car, a lawyer named Tom McDermott, had heard the sound of gunfire thousands of times during his combat days in Vietnam, but he still figured the first cracking sounds were rocks hitting the windows. A broad-shouldered man of 50, McDermott had been at the Securities and Exchange Commission office in Manhattan conducting research for an upcoming case. He would always remember, perhaps because of the bleak irony involved, that December 7 had seemed a very good day, because he'd found a parking place close to the tracks at the Mineola station and had then caught an early train home.<p>
As soon as McDermott saw the pack of terrorized passengers rush up the aisle past him, he realized he was hearing gunfire. The shots were repeating so rapidly that he thought a shootout had erupted beyond the partition defining the rearmost seating area in the car. The row in front of McDermott emptied out, and he stepped into the aisle to help some of the women who had been trampled by the rushing crowd. Then he looked up and saw Colin Ferguson standing in the vestibule a few feet away. Ferguson was sliding a new 15-round clip into his 9-millimeter P89 Ruger. McDermott heard the sibilant glide of the spring-loaded container and the affirmative click when the clip was in place.<p>
"My God," McDermott thought as Ferguson raised his gun, "he is going to shoot me."<p>
McDermott turned away as a bullet entered below his neck and traveled down through his shoulder. He remembers hitting the floor and sliding his head under a seat as Ferguson strolled up and stood over him. McDermott was sure that the man with the gun realized he wasn't dead, so he closed his eyes tightly and waited for the end, thinking hard about his three kids and all the things he should have told them about the possibility of a future in which their father was a memory.<p>
Two quick shots were fired. Then Colin Ferguson walked away to shoot others. McDermott stood up, covered with the blood of the two passengers seated above him. Both of them -- Jim Gorycki, a kind and easygoing 51-year-old father of four who didn't like commuting at all, and a pretty 27-year-old New Hyde Park woman named Mi Kyung Kim, a librarian at Columbia University -- had been killed. "And they were still just sitting there," McDermott would recall too often over the coming year. "They were leaning on one another, their heads softly touching."<p>
Everything around him -- the heavy clouds of smoke from the gun, the macabre and enormous silence of the event broken only by the report of the pistol, the contorted faces of those who'd been shot and those passed over -- all of it became emblazoned on Tom McDermott's memory. He would be able to recall tiny increments of a day begun with the most prosaic victory of a parking place and concluded with the sight of unceasing human slaughter. <p>
Strangely numb to his own wound, McDermott rushed to the back of the train in search of the emergency brake. He saw people bleeding on the floor and in their seats. He saw Dennis McCarthy lying in his son's lap. A woman sat bolt upright nearby, unhurt and yet unable to move. Her eyes blinked away tear after tear. "God help us," she said.<p>
Ferguson shot Amy Federici, a 27-year-old woman who worked for MTV, and a 30-year-old woman named Marita Theresa Magtoto, who had just passed the bar exam and joined a downtown firm. Lisa Combatti, seven-and-a-half-months pregnant and lying on the floor after a bullet passed directly through her sciatic nerve, looked up and stared at Marita Magtoto as the life vanished from her face.<p>
Frank Barker, next in Ferguson's path, looked up at him and said, "Please don't kill me, I have seven children." Ferguson -- who had begun to mutter, "You're gonna get it ... and you're gonna get it," as he fired -- proceeded to shoot Barker several times, one bullet coming into his mouth from beneath his tongue. <p>
Ferguson had stopped beside a bank VP to reload for the second time when he was suddenly tackled by a briefcase-wielding, 42-year-old Lehman Brothers bond trader named Kevin Blum. While Blum's wife and kids waited in their Volvo station wagon a few hundred feet away at the approaching station, the tall and balding trader had decided to charge. He believed he would be shot next. Blum was joined by another trader who worked for Goldman Sachs and then by a Merrill Lynch employee who piled on top of Ferguson too. The three held the now-passive killer down until the doors opened at the station. "In the morning," Ferguson said softly, "this will all be over."<p>
The three men who subdued the killer would become known as "the heroes." They would meet the president of the United States and the governor of New York, and locomotives would be named for them. All would find that the accolades only made it harder to shake loose of the cloying horror of the day, because they'd charged to save themselves.<p>
The police would find seven pages of scribbled notes in Ferguson's pockets, each line beneath the heading "Reasons for This" indicating his perception of a vast network of racists and vindictive, bureaucratic institutions that had conspired to destroy him. Since Ferguson had emigrated to the United States from Jamaica in 1982, he had battled with and sought administrative or legal redress from a long list of organizations that had employed him and fired him. He fought with two academic institutions that he believed had oppressed him. The focus of his complaints included "the racism of Adelphi University" and "the racism of the EEOC" -- the federal Equal Employment Opportunities Commission. He listed the racism of the New York Worker's Compensation Board, and of the staffs of the governor and lieutenant governor of New York, and the generalized "racism of Caucasians and Uncle Tom Negroes." His notes listed various lawyers he'd approached to handle his complaints, including two "black" -- Ferguson adorned the word with quotation marks -- civil-rights activists. It would turn out that Ferguson had experienced the institution of marriage for a short time and knew some of his neighbors, but those connections had also been broken by the conspiracy. He referred to his neighbors in the notes as "filthy swines" and wrote, "I hate them with a passion."<p>
So Colin Ferguson boarded a train and in three minutes shot 23 people he'd never met. Ferguson would forever rearrange the familial, psychological, physical, economic, social, and political lives of a group of strangers in ways that only the many tens of thousands of people who become victims of violent crime each year tend to understand. A crime of violence is the prelude to a labyrinthian process of violation that reaches out to involve and profoundly change people far beyond the immediate circle of those injured or killed.<p>
By force of some brutal, Manichaean symmetry emanating from Colin Ferguson's perceived injuries at the hands of society's organizations and systems, his brutality would launch his victims, their families, their friends, eyewitnesses, those who rushed to help the victims, and many others into a vast webwork of brand-new relationships with many of the same kinds of organizations and systems Ferguson loathed. An aura of infamy would immediately envelop the event known as the Long Island Rail Road Massacre of December 7, 1993, and during the many days of heavy news coverage, Americans of the least victimized classes could not avoid the claustrophobic vision of people not unlike themselves becoming trapped inside a tunnel through a weekday evening with a madman wielding an efficient gun. <p>
And yet when the members of families crippled by American murders and maimings get together -- as they do more often now, as public awareness and organized advocacy increase with the toll -- they tend to talk about how quickly people forget what happened, and how the unvictimized never quite realize that the crime is only the beginning. <p>
For all of the coming year, the victims of the shootings would experience the medical establishment, insurance bureaucracies, corporations, the media, the criminal-justice system, government agencies, political organizations, and other institutions in new and different ways. Several of the victims and survivors would become politicized by their experience, urged on to challenge the status quo by the eternal silence of people they had loved or by the terrible things they saw on that train. Some would perceive themselves as still ruined a year later, some would feel saved by strangers drawn to aid them, and not one of them would be the same.<p>
The shooting instantly undermined basic assumptions that allowed most of the people in the third car of the 5:33 to fall asleep at night or turn corners without fear of what they might find. Basic suppositions woven so deeply into the psyche that they are usually imperceptible -- that you get home at the end of the day, for instance -- were now absent from their calculations. Out of the public bloodletting and the pain, a bunch of people headed home one night on a commuter train were forced to reconsider everything about what it means to be alive.<p>
Carolyn McCarthy had never much enjoyed addressing three or four people at the same time, so an appearance before an auditorium full of reporters at a press conference would surely entail an act of will. Dennis, her husband of 27 years, was the talker in their small family, a real "love life" person, Carolyn would say. "He had a comeback for anything you had to offer." Carolyn always preferred to talk "one-on-one ... off to the side." When she had gone back to finish college at the age of 30, tests revealed that Carolyn's lifelong trouble with reading and selecting the word she wanted to say had all along been the result of a learning disability, a case of dyslexia that caused words like "dyslexia" or "mimosa" to come out as "dys-ah-lexia" or "the Moses." <p>
Up at the Vermont ski house she and Dennis shared with friends, Carolyn would occasionally raise her hand. "Wait a minute," she'd announce. "I'm gonna say something." And everyone would laugh and wait patiently while she got it out.<p>
The administrators who came into the intensive care unit at North Shore University Hospital the day after the shootings told Carolyn that the reporters downstairs wanted to know how Kevin was doing. Carolyn realized that the probability of what several headlines called a "double tragedy" in her case had concentrated public focus. A former intensive care nurse, Carolyn had listened carefully to the dire prognosis of Kevin's tough-talking neurosurgeon, Nancy Epstein, after Epstein came out of the operating room. Since then, as she sat up all night holding Kevin's hand, she had refused to talk about the arrangements surrounding Dennis's death, because she knew the funeral might include her only son.<p>
Five of the victims carried out of the train when it finally stopped in Garden City had been rushed to North Shore. Next to Kevin in the ICU was Helen Alexanderson, a 31-year-old woman who planned to marry in a few weeks and now had gunshot wounds in her chest, abdomen, and thigh. Maryanne Phillips, the first passenger shot, was also nearby. A 61-year-old man had chest wounds, as did a young electrician named Bob Giugliano, who had been clawing at the door leading to the next car when a bullet went through his arm and into his chest. <p>
The police would have trouble finding many of the bullets Colin Ferguson fired because of the way they shredded and broke apart inside the victims. There were many more bullet wounds than bullets fired because one powerful round sometimes injured two or three people.<p>
Five riders on the train were dead on the day after the event. Along with Dennis McCarthy, Jim Gorycki, young Mi Kyung Kim, and Marita Magtoto, a 34-year-old man named Richard Nettleton had died in his seat near a window. Seventeen others had been shot, and two people had been judged so severely traumatized by what they had experienced -- one man had a bullet part his hair and skim along his scalp -- that they were considered wounded, too. <p>
When Kevin McCarthy arrived at the hospital he exhibited no neurological functioning at all. Nancy Epstein, who rushed to the ER from a Christmas party just two minutes away, judged Kevin to be "as neurologically close to dead as you can be." "But with a kid," she said, "you try everything."<p>
Epstein, tall and with very thick black hair, was a notably gifted surgeon who had worked on the broken heads of people who'd walked into whirring helicopter blades and on the victims of machete attacks. She'd trained at Bellevue/NYU, the huge people's hospital on Manhattan's East Side, where she'd seen hundreds of gunshot wounds over the years. But Kevin McCarthy's head was opened up "like a big book." Brain and skull fragments were pouring from a wound at the level of the motor strip, which almost always means the victim will be paralyzed. Epstein and the other doctors spent hours removing hair, skin, and scalp embedded deep in Kevin's brain, discarding in the process a great deal of brain tissue cut off from vascular nourishment and therefore rendered useless. <p>
Epstein figured Kevin had a 10 percent chance of waking up after the operation, and she said as much to the sad-eyed blonde woman standing beside his bed. "Kevin and Dennis are my life," Carolyn said. "They're my reason to be."<p>
Epstein was impressed by Carolyn's even grace when the idea of attending the press conference was posed. The auditorium was jammed with cameras and lights. Carolyn sat beside her brothers and sister and the doctors. When Epstein started to speak, she reiterated that the odds were stacked against Kevin McCarthy. Then she went on to list the many deficiencies of movement and mind that would probably be the result of such a devastating injury if he survived.<p>
Carolyn listened with her head bowed, but she could feel a strangely powerful, almost emergent sensation overtaking her. Carolyn's best friend, an effusive blonde woman named Carol Neary, was at the press conference, and Neary -- who'd been there for the rare soliloquies Carolyn offered at the table in Vermont -- was bowled over by the transformation evident from the moment Carolyn began to speak. <p>
" -- I'm sorry," McCarthy interrupted as Epstein was speaking. "But you're wrong. My son is going to get better."<p>
Kevin had opened his eyes during the night. He squeezed his mother's hand in a way that made her know how terrified he was. Carolyn stared hard into her son's eyes, and she could see him knowing her. <p>
"He's still there," Carolyn continued at the press conference, turning to Epstein.<p>
Carol Neary couldn't believe how her friend sounded as she went on to talk about her own experience with rehabilitation as a nurse and of the power of "positive energy" to heal. Tearful reporters asked questions, and Carolyn responded with eloquent resolve.<p>
Epstein listened, and as the cameras chattered noisily around her, she leaned toward the microphone. "All I hope for," she said, "is to be proven wrong."<p>
 Joyce Gorycki was unable to remember eating or sleeping at all before her husband's funeral, four days after the shooting. Everything about Jim Gorycki's violent death was so much different from her transitory fantasies of losing him. Everything about the experience was so much bigger than she'd pictured it, so wayward and skewed and unreal. Reporters were still camped outside the apartment as if laying siege. Every so often one would ring the buzzer and ask Joyce questions through the intercom. <p>
Joyce said she had a premonition that something was going to happen to Jim. She and Jim were so strangely attuned to one another -- "like soul mates who knew the other's feelings without talking" -- that they used to joke that they must have been married before in an earlier life. When Joyce sent out the annual Gorycki Christmas letter on the morning of December 7 -- including the news that a corporate downsizing program at Moore Business Forms meant that Jim now had to commute to Manhattan for the first time in 24 years -- she felt something was seriously wrong.<p>
Joyce and her 10-year-old daughter, Karen, had to wait more than four hours after the train was due to find out why Jim hadn't come home. Joyce called all the hospitals in the area, so she knew he wasn't among the injured. It was 10:30 when two policemen finally arrived. Karen started screaming as soon as the door opened, and Joyce collapsed on the foyer floor.<p>
Five hundred people variously traumatized by what had happened on the train had by now phoned the counseling hot line set up by the LIRR. Other hot lines, mental-health associations, and victim-assistance programs had received innumerable other calls and visits. Among the many people who came to the train station in Garden City each night bearing wreaths and flowers, reporters and police officers found survivors of the massacre wandering around the platform looking for someone to talk to. Several said they couldn't stop seeing the shooting over and over when they closed their eyes.<p>
Through a haze of shock, Joyce still managed to worry about life insurance, funeral expenses, and the improbability of supporting the family alone on her back-office job with a publishing house. Joyce's brother said he would take her to the Social Security office to deliver the required forms, but she feared the cold bureaucratic experience would put her over the edge.<p>
"We had the simplest life," Joyce said to friends at the funeral. "Now nothing will be simple again. All that time we sacrificed, and we never got a house."<p>
Joyce received letters from the president and the governor. One of her friends regarded all the reporters staked out at the apartment, and when she got inside she said, "Joyce, you're like Jackie Kennedy."<p>
Joyce took tranquilizers after the funeral, but still she couldn't sleep. She lay awake crying over premonitions she hadn't accurately understood and cursing the injustice of her loss.<p>
On the morning of December 12, five days after he was shot, Tom McDermott turned on a television set to watch himself on This Week With David Brinkley. Tom's wife, Rosemary, was usually polite when she turned down requests for interviews with Tom. But sometimes, from his bed, Tom could hear her raise her voice: "Have you no sensitivity at all?" A producer at the Brinkley show turned out to be a friend of a friend, however, and Tom said he'd grown up watching Huntley and Brinkley read the news.<p>
McDermott was wearing bandages and a sling for his left arm. The bullet had passed within a centimeter of an essential artery on one side and delicate nerve bundles and bones inside his shoulder on the other. For some reason, the bullet never opened or frayed, and a doctor had told Tom that he hadn't seen a cleaner entrance and exit wound in nine years of treating gunshots.<p>
So McDermott was quickly sent home with gauze taped to his front and back. He firmly believed his life had been touched by a miracle. McDermott had felt himself fundamentally changed from the moment he got up from under that seat, drenched with other people's blood. As he stood up, he realized he no longer feared death. <p>
He tried to make it through Jim Gorycki's big funeral but had to flee halfway through. "Jim was only a few years older than I," he said, "and he had teenaged children like me. I realized I didn't know what was going on around me. 'What's going on here?' I kept thinking. 'This is not fair.' Nobody on the train was more important than anyone else. Why was I spared? Why did I turn left when I came inside the car to find my seat instead of right? Why didn't my bullet explode?"<p>
Many of the survivors of the shooting -- there was one fewer as of the morning before McDermott appeared on television, with the death of Amy Federici, the young designer who worked for MTV -- were variously wondering why they had been spared. <p>
On the Brinkley show, Tom McDermott shakily said he was grateful he had been "spared by God." He said he now looked at life from "a different perspective," though he'd spent four days asking himself what that perspective called for him to do. <p>
The show had opened with gory film clips of the aftermath of the LIRR shootings, and included others depicting child-killings in St. Louis and other tragedies that were part of a wave of holiday-season violence. <p>
The last part of the show featured Brooklyn congressman and gun-control advocate Charles Schumer and Wyoming senator Alan Simpson, a vocal opponent of restrictive gun legislation. Schumer argued that 20 years earlier Colin Ferguson might have gotten on the train and simply started ranting: "Now he gets a gun and he shoots." Schumer said that since the states had shown themselves unable to handle the escalation of gun violence, he had authored legislation that called for the federal government to intervene. Schumer declared that even New York City's tough gun-control laws were ineffectual, for recent research indicated that 98 percent of the weapons used for crime in the city were purchased out of state -- as was Colin Ferguson's gun.<p>
Simpson, ever affable of style, acknowledged voting against the relatively mild weapons restrictions included in the Brady bill. "I come from Wyoming," Simpson said with a slight smirk wedged into his long face, "a place where gun control is how steady you hold your rifle."<p>
The words catapulted Tom McDermott to his feet. He heard himself yelling at the television in rage.<p>
"What?" his wife kept saying. "What?"<p>
Tom raced to the phone to call the television studio in Washington, but the segment had been taped and Simpson had left. "Did you hear the sarcasm!" McDermott yelled. "Did you hear the complete disregard ... how steady you hold your rifle!"<p>
And from that moment Tom McDermott knew what he was supposed to do. He had been chosen to survive the tragedy to make sure that others wouldn't have to see what he had seen or die because of a gun. "I'm a radical now," McDermott would begin to tell people wherever he went. "I'm a radical for the safety of us all."<p>
The first word Kevin McCarthy spoke after his first operation was "Dad." When he began to speak in phrases, he said he remembered only the sound of one shot being fired. That and his father lying on his lap. <p>
"We can't handle this pain right now," Carolyn would say when they both began to cry. "So let's kind of push it away." <p>
Kevin's friends came to his room as his miraculous recovery progressed and would often talk to him, though he didn't respond. Doctors hailing from innumerable specialties came and went -- some 200 North Shore employees became involved in his case -- and at first Carolyn watched them carefully and as quietly as she could force herself to be. "Kev," she'd whispered when her son first woke up, "you're gonna hear doctors talking over you. Talking about what's wrong. Do not listen. Listen to no one." <p>
But over the next few weeks Carolyn came to trust, and then to admire, some of the medical specialists. She was particularly drawn to Nancy Epstein. Doctors and nurses who worked with the brilliant and notably impatient surgeon were used to seeing Epstein race through hallways and wards, refusing to physically or intellectually slow down for those not quick enough to handle the pace. Colleagues were surprised by Epstein's habit of stopping to spend time chatting with Carolyn McCarthy.<p>
"She's there every goddamned morning at 6 a.m.," Epstein would say later. "Every morning she's there making sure he goes through the range-of-motion exercises, or she's just sitting there with him around the clock. Carolyn McCarthy's one tough, no-bullshit babe."<p>
On the 12th day of the new year, 36 days after he was given the slimmest of chances to survive and three months earlier than his doctors had said he might be freed of wires and tubes and machines, Kevin was transferred from North Shore's big central facility in Manhasset to the hospital's physical medicine and rehabilitation wing in Glen Cove. A phalanx of photographers awaited the arrival of the ambulance, because nobody had yet gotten a picture of the high-profile massacre victim who'd defied the odds. Kevin was wearing a helmet, and metal dowels and hinges protruded from his reconstructed right hand. His left side was paralyzed, and his cognitive abilities appeared to be severely impaired. He had almost died on Christmas Eve, when a blood clot lodged in his lungs. A filtration system had been inserted inside his lower abdomen on Christmas Day to make sure the same thing didn't happen again.<p>
Nevertheless, Carolyn's days were buoyed by the most transitory display of the old Kevin peering back at her through his private fog. Every so often, her spirits would soar at a demonstration of Kevin's -- and Dennis's -- ironic sense of humor. Even in the ICU, Kevin would sometimes punch at his heart monitor to simulate heart arrhythmias and then smile when the nurses ran in. During one of the early, painful days in rehab, Kevin told Carolyn he didn't want to get better. He wanted to be disabled. After a pause long enough for his mother to appear horrified, he said, "Better parking."<p>
One day he opened his eyes and asked his mother to get back the suit he had been wearing on the train ... "and a refund for the ticket," Kevin managed.<p>
The refund arrived soon thereafter, along with silk flowers, since real plants weren't allowed in his room.<p>
Carolyn put the check in front of Kevin. "Now Dad's refund too," he said softly.<p>
At the Glen Cove rehab unit, Kevin began a rehabilitation regimen under the direction of Pat Corcoran, a specialist in physical medicine. But none of the "ADLs," as they call them in the world of rehab -- the activities of daily life -- came back easily. His memory would come and go, and his emotional state would change radically in an instant. After a few weeks, he began to try computer puzzles and other cognitive exercises to retrain his mind. Kevin's left hand wouldn't move at all, and he moved his reconstructed right hand with extreme difficulty and pain. The physical exercises often caused him so much pain that he would scream out loud.<p>
Nancy Epstein was worried about Kevin's lack of emotional affect, but then she also had to wonder if having women like her and Carolyn McCarthy hovering around, always telling him what to do, wasn't causing him to clam up. Carolyn had asked a psychologist named Mark Lerner to treat Kevin for the combination of profound grief, post-traumatic stress, and neurological damage he'd suffered, but Kevin soon told his mother that he didn't want to see the psychotherapist anymore. "There's nothing more to talk about," he said. <p>
One day during the very cold winter of 1994, Kevin was sitting at a table doing exercises when Pat Corcoran noticed tears in the big kid's eyes. Corcoran glanced up at the television suspended overhead and saw Colin Ferguson on the screen. <p>
He jumped up and reached to turn it off.
"No," Kevin said.<p>
In articulate, weirdly haughty phrases, the man who'd killed Kevin's father stood in court enumerating a long list of urological, orthopedic, and circulatory complaints. Ferguson also averred that in "the facility in which I am housed" he received "no sympathy."<p>
"Come on, Kev, I'm gonna turn it off,"  Corcoran said again.<p>
"No," Kevin said haltingly, the tears falling down his cheeks. "I want to see."<p>
On March 23, Ferguson addressed members of the local press corps at the Nassau County Jail. He wore leg irons and handcuffs, and his face was swollen and discolored from a recent beating at the hands of four fellow inmates.<p>
Ferguson said that upon being approached by four attackers wrapping strips of cloth around their knuckles, he had declared, "Let there be no violence." He added later if he ever became a wealthy man, he planned to "volunteer my services to those who are internationally subjected to poverty."<p>
It was now becoming clear that Colin Ferguson's own Caribbean boyhood was spent in anything but poverty. He had in fact grown up amid servants and cricket fields, a child of privilege in Kingston, Jamaica. He'd attended the best private schools, and he and his four brothers had cars and motorcycles while still in their teens. But his father, a senior executive with a large pharmaceutical firm, was killed in a car crash when Ferguson was 20. His mother died shortly thereafter, and everything about the family and its fortunes changed.<p>
Ferguson left Jamaica in 1982 and spent the following three years in Southern California. He held retail and low-level administrative jobs he considered well beneath his background and abilities. Fellow employees would later tell members of a reportorial team working for Newsday that Ferguson believed racism held him back.<p>
Ferguson moved to New York in 1985 and began his serial wars against institution after institution. He fell off a stool at work in 1989 and, despite a $26,000 settlement, spent years pursuing and repursuing a workman's compensation claim. He would hire lawyers to sue the state and the employers who had wronged him. Then he would hate the lawyers for betraying him in one way or another. He studied at two Long Island colleges and was invariably at odds with fellow students, administrators, and teachers. He said his professors wouldn't call on him in class. <p>
Ferguson was accused of harassing a woman on a New York City subway in 1992 and spent months thereafter placing phone calls to officials and seeking out lawyers who would pursue his claim that a "racist and vicious" motive had inspired the charge against him.<p>
Born so high and fallen so low and alone at the age of 35, Colin Ferguson was renting a little room in Brooklyn at the time of the shooting. He apparently chanted and talked about and to God long into the night. He had no job, money, or friends. But he did have the gun and the bullets he'd obtained legally during a trip to California.<p>
Radical trial lawyer William Kunstler said he was drawn to Ferguson's case because Ferguson was a pariah. Since garnering fame 
in the 1960s for his defense of civil-rights activists and antiwar protesters, Kunstler had defended more than a few pariahs -- among them a mob boss, a drug dealer accused of shooting six policemen, and a man accused of raping a young investment banker in Central Park.<p>
In March, Kunstler and his partner, Ronald Kuby, announced they would not only defend Ferguson but would pursue a groundbreaking defense predicated on the assertion that Colin Ferguson was an insane man who hailed from a nation all but devoid of the venomous racism he would find in America. Ferguson's experience of that racism, the lawyers planned to argue, had turned him from a madman into a mad killer. <p>
Kunstler said he waited for years for the chance to do "an education job" such as the one that presented itself with the Ferguson case. Kunstler didn't plan to touch the particulars of Ferguson's problems with the Workman's Compensation Board or Adelphi University; rather, he would call forth testimony from social scientists and social psychologists that would delineate the "strength and venom of American racism and the black rage that is its result."<p>
Ferguson's incarceration was costing the state more than $1,000 a day, and each day of trial would probably cost $3,000 more. Aside from his treatment after the jailhouse beating, Ferguson's other medical complaints led to doctors' visits every few days. He complained regularly about the quality of the reading material in jail, and he said he was positive that an assassin sent to get him by conspirators was just biding his time.<p>
It was one of the many jobs of a Nassau County homicide detective named Brian Parpan, a 20-year veteran of the force, to inform all the victims of the LIRR shooting about the existence of the New York State Crime Victims Board. Since the first government-sponsored victim-assistance system was constructed in California nearly 30 years ago, every state has established programs designed to compensate crime victims for uncovered insurance expenses, lost wages, and other out-of-pocket expenses. New York victims or their heirs are allowed to claim up to $2,000 for funeral expenses, up to $20,000 for lost wages, and unlimited medical expenses. But Carolyn McCarthy and most of the other LIRR victims found that the process of application and reapplication was overwhelming. The New York board fields some 30,000 applications from victims each year, and it labors under an immobilizing backlog. McCarthy gave up on the Crime Victims Board, though she did struggle for six hours with the paperwork from the Social Security Administration. <p>
Brian Parpan was also in charge of the ongoing investigation of the shootings and of organizing the victims and witnesses to appear before a grand jury. Few of the victims or eyewitnesses made it through a description of events before the grand jury without breaking down. As they spoke, Parpan could see various members of the jury crying too, and then cops and others in the room started to cry.<p>
By the time a 93-count indictment against Colin Ferguson was handed down in January, most of the people who'd witnessed the massacre had partaken of some form of therapy or psychological counseling. <p>
Tom McDermott spent time with one group composed entirely of men and women from the train who had not been shot. He was quickly struck by the seriousness of the psychic wounds suffered by those who were passed over. One young lawyer told of being chased up and down the aisle by Ferguson; with huge emotion he talked of the bullet holes he later found in his suit. During another meeting, all the men in the room realized that they shared guilt over the fact that as Ferguson came near, they had each thought exclusively about their children. "Not one of us thought about our wives," McDermott said later. "However unacceptable that may have seemed when we first said it, we realized that all of us thought about never being able to say goodbye to our children, to never have the chance to assure them that they would be all right."<p>
McDermott joined another group composed of people who had been shot. He would look around at the crutches and canes and wheelchairs and hear about all the metal plates and surgical pins that often seemed to be the only things holding some of the people in the group together, and he felt a mixture of wonder and rage. Hardly any of the victims had returned to work, and most of them faced subsequent surgical procedures. <p>
After a session with other victims, a young banker named Debra Weber, who was shot in the buttock and leg, was able to phone Joyce Gorycki. Joyce had been unable to consider going to therapy, because in truth she was still unable to consider accomplishing anything at all but waking up in the morning. When Weber haltingly began to speak on the phone, Joyce wondered if she'd been sitting close to her husband on the train. Maybe she'd seen it. For some reason this thought made Joyce feel a little better, and when she eventually met Weber at a gathering of victims in March, she felt better still.<p>
Carolyn McCarthy said she had no time for counseling sessions. Her life was dedicated to Kevin, her days ordered by the tiniest progressive indications that he was healing.<p>
Mark Lerner, the psychologist Carolyn had asked to treat Kevin, told her she had better start talking about things.<p>
"I know the facts," Carolyn said, staring at the shrink with her clear blue eyes. "And I'm talking all the time; I'm talking all day."<p>
"But you're putting things into little boxes to get by," Lerner said. <p>
"Can you change anything, Dr. Lerner?" Carolyn asked.<p>
Lerner shook his head.<p>
"There's my point," she said. "And those little boxes? That's the way I handle life."<p>
Late at night, Carolyn McCarthy would try to read some of the hundreds of letters that arrived each week. She could handle only a few, so her sister picked them out during the day. Every so often, the letters would help her cry.<p>
She had been able to cry at Dennis's funeral, held the day after Jim Gorycki's in the same church. She also cried with Kevin whenever they tried to talk about what happened. But one night during the winter Carolyn began to sob so powerfully that she wondered how she would ever stop. She would always remember that it was money she cried so hard about -- money and the way it insistently connected her to so much pain and anger and fear.<p>
But then worrying about money had always been Carolyn's task in the family. Every year she and Dennis reviewed their finances, and not long before he died, Carolyn had asked Dennis why he had so little life insurance and why he'd decided not to pay for double-indemnity protection. Dennis, in Carolyn's estimation, was a "spender." He thought nothing of getting a new pair of skis every year. He didn't think about saving money, because enjoying life was far more important. Kevin was the same way: He'd gone out and bought two $500 suits before starting his new job.<p>
Carolyn knew that medical-insurance contracts were filled with booby traps, so one night after Kevin was ensconced at the rehab hospital, she tried to spread out all the medical bills and letters from Dennis's employers at Prudential to see where she stood. She sat on the living room floor, surrounded by pictures of Dennis and Kevin and a sea of bills that covered the carpet.<p>
Carolyn crawled around trying to match up all the reference numbers to see what charges Pru-Care, the Prudential insurance wing, had received and covered. Nancy Epstein had recently become irritated with Prudential's handling of Kevin's case. At a party, Epstein had approached Burton Malkiel, a member of the Prudential board of directors (and the author of A Random Walk Down Wall Street), and said, "Your guys are sure blowing it with Kevin McCarthy."<p>
Kevin's nearly $200,000 worth of treatment through North Shore hospital had already exceeded by a substantial sum the McCarthy family's net worth. Dennis's funeral costs had run close to $9,000, $5,000 of which was covered by disbursements from a fund set up for victims by the Long Island Rail Road -- but it was unclear how much more money the fund would pay out.<p>
As she sat on the living room floor, Carolyn felt herself slipping underwater. The next thing she knew she was sobbing and she couldn't stop.<p>
Something about all those pieces of paper on her living room floor was impossible for Carolyn to fit into a box. As she sat weeping into the evening, the phone rang and Carolyn answered. A man identified himself as Joe Tierney and said, "I'm calling from the Prudential employee-benefits department, Mrs. McCarthy. If you have any problems from now on, just call and ask for me. If you have any bills or paperwork there, just pack it all up and send them to my attention."<p>
To Tierney's embarrassment, Carolyn would refer to him after that as her angel.<p>
"I knew someone told him to do it," she would say. "But something about the timing of it ... you know, like a call from heaven."<p>
Joe Tierney would join a long list of new connections, alongside doctors and cops and so many others. Kevin and Carolyn would from that point be dependent on Prudential, as they were on other organizations and institutions, as they attempted to steer a course back toward a semblance of what was home.<p>
During the spring, Tom McDermott appeared with William Kunstler, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, and several others on Geraldo Rivera's cable talk show on CNBC. The show was one of dozens refocused on the Long Island Rail Road massacre by Kunstler's controversial "black rage" defense. McDermott was seated next to a convicted felon named Paul.<p>
After Kunstler and Dershowitz argued about the black-rage defense, McDermott commented that nobody who had survived the events of December 7 envisaged the shootings as anything but the "venture" of a lone gunman. "None of us saw it as a matter of black against white," McDermott said.<p>
When it was Paul's turn to speak, the convict said that he, for one, understood black rage. In fact, he continued, wagging his finger in McDermott's face, he could even understand getting a gun and dispensing rage -- he turned now to fully face McDermott -- "starting with this cracker right here."<p>
McDermott just stared back at the man.<p>
Since being reborn as a crusader, McDermott had spent the better part of every evening and weekend talking about guns. He attended meetings of activists, lobbied politicians, and tried to gently rally fellow victims to the cause. He now knew that more people died from gunshot wounds over two years in America than had died in all the years of the Vietnam War. He'd discovered that so few American soldiers are shot by guns nowadays that military medical personnel are sent to train at Jamaica Hospital, an institution not far from a Long Island Rail Road stop, because gunshot trauma is addressed there throughout the day. He knew that there were 70 million handguns in the United States and more gun dealerships than grocery stores.<p>
McDermott had established contact with most of the LIRR victims by now, and he asked each of them to get involved in efforts that might someday assure that such a thing would never happen again. Amy Federici's parents, Arlene and Jacob Locicero, were early conscripts, as was the young triathlete John Forni, who'd made an astounding recovery from his many bullet wounds to the chest, arm, face, and hand. Tom approached Joyce Gorycki at a candlelight vigil held in memory of Amy Federici, and Joyce said she wanted to help when she felt that she could. Tom had talked to Carolyn McCarthy about lending her voice to the cause in February, but she said her duties with Kevin sucked up all her time.<p>
During a January trip to Albany to urge the New York legislature to adopt a ban on assault weapons, McDermott and the Lociceros worked with Tina Johnstone of New Yorkers for Gun Control. Johnstone, a Staten Island mother of two whose husband, a New York editor, had been shot and killed a year earlier by a 16-year-old boy, had become an ever more tireless and articulate advocate. During the January trip, Johnstone's own state assemblyman told her he would not support a ban because people ought to own 9-millimeter guns for self-protection. Her state senator, Robert DiCarlo, had told her that most people who die from gun wounds are drug dealers anyway.<p>
Carolyn McCarthy phoned McDermott during the spring to say she was ready to take the plunge. She joined McDermott for a lobbying trip to Albany, where she immediately noticed that several legislators were unable to look her in the eye. She listened closely during a meeting with leading Republicans that included Ralph Marino, then the leader of the state's Republicans and a representative from Long Island. <p>
Marino said that he thought federal legislation should address the licensing and banning of guns. He had problems with certain items in a bill before the state senate, one that would ban 51 different assault weapons. For instance, he thought the limit on the legal size of bullet clips should be held at 15 and not reduced to 10.<p>
"The last five bullets in Colin Ferguson's second clip killed at least three people," Tom McDermott pointed out, his voice even and restrained.<p>
Marino began to speak of the importance of budget discussions and other items clogging the agenda. Someone asked Marino why the Republicans had demanded that the return of the death penalty be inserted into the bill. Everyone knew that Mario Cuomo, then New York's governor, would not sign a bill that reestablished the death penalty.<p>
Marino just smiled and in his soft voice said the two issues could not be separated.<p>
At this, Carolyn McCarthy, who was sitting directly across from Marino, leaned forward and stared hard in Marino's eyes. "That's not a good enough answer, Mr. Marino," she said loudly and deliberately. "Vote on the death penalty in the morning and the assault-weapon ban in the afternoon. Get me a scissors and I'll cut the bill in half for you, because I do not want to have to come up here ever again!"<p>
"Guess I kind of lost it there," Carolyn said to Tom on the way home. "A display of Irish temper, I guess. Now I see what we're up against."<p>
During the summer Kevin McCarthy would finally sense that the thick shroud that had enveloped his thoughts for so many months was beginning to peel away. Events slowly came into sharper focus. <p>
Carolyn was reminded too often of the many differences between the old Kevin and the son she helped dress, shower, and organize every day. But she forced herself to step back and consider how far they'd come.<p>
Two Garden City cops who'd entered the McCarthys' far-flung constellation of new friends, John Hoffman and Neal Sullivan, organized a fund-raiser for Kevin and other victims at the Garden City Hotel. When Kevin heard about their plans, he'd enunciated the unlikely goal of walking into the event.<p>
It was Hoffman and Sullivan who had waded back past other victims to pull Kevin out of the railroad car -- a young paramedic had told them she was sure she'd seen his hand move. Kevin had ballooned to 260 pounds before the shooting, so Hoffman and Sullivan had trouble lifting the stretcher. The two policemen kept checking in at the hospital to see how Kevin was doing. Carolyn had also gotten to know the deeply traumatized young paramedic who'd seen Kevin move his bloody hand, and she kept up with the the stunned ambulance driver who had driven Kevin to North Shore University Hospital and the crack neurosurgery team that, just by chance, was close at hand.<p>
When Carolyn realized that her old house had narrow doorways and other impediments to a wheelchair -- Kevin's probable means of getting around, it seemed at that point -- a mustachioed LIRR cop named Terry Culhane came over to measure doors and do carpentry work. Culhane was another who had boarded the third car early on December 7. When Carolyn told Culhane she couldn't face taking the train into the city to give her speeches and meet with politicians, he began to give her rides as often as he could.<p>
The special fund for victims established by the LIRR had swelled beyond all expectations. Contributions came from sources such as the Citibank VP who set up a stand in Penn Station two days after the shooting to collect money to help the victims. The New York Islanders hockey club donated over $70,000 to the fund, and Long Islandborn pop singer Mariah Carey, who had called the hospital to see if she could help Kevin, pitched in more than $200,000. The LIRR would eventually dispense more than $500,000 to the victims over the course of the year, and though several of the victims had already announced their intention to launch a variety of suits against the railroad -- and some felt that disbursements from the huge kitty arrived too slowly -- most privately acknowledged the LIRR and its employees had done pretty well.<p>
Carolyn's fears for her financial future were further allayed when Prudential pledged to match all contributions employees made in the name of her husband and son. Eventually $245,000 would be paid to a trust set up in Kevin's name -- a sum separate from the $320,000 Prudential's insurance wing would pay out for Kevin's medical care over the course of the year.<p>
Even veteran benefits workers had become intimate listeners. In July, Carolyn McCarthy was informed that the Social Security Administration had lost all the paperwork pursuant to her claims, so she made an appointment to go to the nearest office. She saw a sign that said that people with an appointment should proceed to Window 2, which was next to a line where 75 people waited. "Who do you think you are!" "Get in line!" people began to yell at her. One man came over and tried to push her to the back of the line. After the appointment, Social Security officials helped Carolyn leave through a side door. Months later she still referred to the incident as "the riot."<p>
Each victim of the LIRR shooting had horror stories about the loss of independence that marks the bureaucratic aftermath of victimization, but for the most part, long lists of systems renowned for a lack of sympathy had become humanized in the face of so much concentrated pain. "What Prudential did for us," Kevin McCarthy said, "was show that they can care about the little guy."<p>
"Well, of course they can," William Kunstler observed when told of Kevin's observation. "Of course! Those who control the nation's life mold laws and organizations in their own image. These institutions were designed to perpetuate the kinds of people who run the society."<p>
And yet none of the people riding the 5:33 served on corporate or hospital boards. The victims were more privileged than many Americans -- certainly more privileged than Colin Ferguson at low ebb -- and much less than others. Most of them were people who lived in unspectacular houses or apartments and went to work every day.<p>
Joyce Gorycki had become friends with some of Jim's fellow employees at Moore Business Forms whom even he had never met. From the middle ranks of the Chicago and San Mateo, California, offices of the company, people wrote her letters and called her on the phone. Around the time Joyce sat down and realized that it would be impossible to continue on her salary alone, Jim's boss had called to say that her husband's benefits were forthcoming, and that employees in the New York office had already established a support fund.<p>
Joyce talked regularly to her church pastor, Robert Mursch, who had quickly come to her aid when he heard what had happened on the train. She also consulted regularly with her daughter Karen's guidance counselors at school, but Joyce's brother kept insisting that she talk about the tragedy in a therapeutic setting. In June, Joyce finally felt ready to join a bereavement group.<p>
Carolyn McCarthy now realized that she was the only survivor or victim of the LIRR massacre who'd avoided some kind of counseling during the year. She said that one of these days she'd get around to it. "But I can't slow down now," she explained before leaving to give a speech in New York City one afternoon. "I've seen how others whose tragedies are less famous and farther in the past than mine have politicians' doors closed in their faces. Having Tom and me along has opened up certain doors that were closed. We only have so much time before all of this is just another crime."<p>
The Garden City Police event at the Garden City Hotel drew some 540 people. There had been other smaller and much less opulent events thrown by some of Kevin's friends in local bars, and there was a memorial road race run in memory of Dennis, with everyone wearing buttons bearing a picture of Dennis in a ski jacket, sunlight reflecting off the top of his head. But the Garden City gala drew politicians, business leaders, victims, and all sorts of friends.<p>
The huge crowd was already seated in the ballroom when Carolyn pushed Kevin's wheelchair to the doorway of the ballroom. Kevin had managed to take steps twice in therapy before the event, but he hadn't told his mother. So Carolyn stood back in surprise with the others as Kevin stood up and began to lurch into the ballroom, throwing his left leg out in front of him in a circular motion that required a great deal of balance. <p>
After a moment of hushed silence, someone in the crowd started to clap and everyone rose. Kevin turned bright red with embarrassment when the band struck up the theme song from Rocky, while Carolyn stood at the doorway and wept.<p>
In September, Colin Ferguson informed the judge overseeing his case, a thoughtful, round-faced man named Donald Belfi, that the state was plotting with his attorneys to blind him. After Ferguson refused to be examined by a retinal specialist -- which would have been his 59th visit by a medical professional -- he demanded to be seen by another retinal specialist, claiming that the conspiracy to render him sightless was designed to make him unable to identify the "Caucasian shooter" who had really been aboard the train on December 7. <p>
Ferguson refused, after a few visits, to see the psychiatrists his defense team had drafted and refused to cooperate with the psychiatrists hired by the prosecution. Ferguson had also decided to reject William Kunstler and Ron Kuby, in large part because of their supposed complicity in a plot to kill him. He also rejected the "black rage" insanity defense, because he was not in the least bit insane and was not the man who pulled the trigger. <p>
Kunstler and Kuby responded by asking the court to declare Ferguson psychologically incompetent and unfit to stand trial. <p>
On December 6, 1994, one day before the anniversary of the LIRR shootings, Ferguson shuffled into the dim and high-ceilinged courtroom in front of a class of unsettled-looking high school students who'd come to the trial to learn about the American legal system.<p>
Ferguson now wanted to be his own lawyer, which would mean that he would be able to put the people he'd shot on the stand and grill them personally. If those close to the victims imagined this as a process of further victimization, it was clear that to Ferguson the public display would be a chance to exercise his intellect and gifts of expression in ways previously proscribed by a racist system.<p>
Dressed in khaki trousers, a bright tie, and a white shirt made bulky by the bulletproof vest under his tweed jacket, Ferguson asked to sit along one wall of the courtroom so as not to be associated with Kunstler and Kuby, still his attorneys of record despite his desire to fire them. When he'd moved to a chair along one wall, Ferguson smiled at the leonine figure of Kunstler and said, "May the best man win."<p>
Kunstler walked away shaking his head.<p>
Ferguson rose to state that he considered the proceedings about his sanity a "kind of mock trial" that might preclude his later access to an untainted pool of jurors. Then he sat back down and listened, his eyebrows often raised in bemusement or irritation. His face had thinned over the course of the year in a way that highlighted the aristocratic nose he now held high in the air. <p>
A defense psychiatrist, Richard Dudley, testified that Ferguson suffered from an "encapsulated delusional disorder of a persecutory type." Dudley said that Ferguson irrationally believed people were out to destroy him. He therefore couldn't work with lawyers and couldn't defend himself.<p>
Ferguson rose to his feet. "I object," he said.<p>
Donald Belfi would eventually rule that Ferguson was competent to stand trial and therefore able, by right, to represent himself. As his own attorney, Ferguson said he would subpoena both Bill Clinton and Mario Cuomo. The court would allow the defendant to be served specially packaged food in response to his contention that enemies at the jail were trying to poison him, and the state would pay for a private investigator to hunt down the illusory gunman Ferguson claimed he saw on the train.<p>
Ferguson would appear often in court over the coming weeks, his demeanor at one moment lofty and then suddenly bewildered and weak. His eyes would look dead, then flare strangely bright. And nothing about his obvious madness appeared in the least poetic or instructive. Ferguson looked like nothing but what he had become, a living symbol of other people's fears.<p>
On the morning of the first anniversary of the shootings, Kevin and Carolyn McCarthy traveled to the Church of Holy Innocents in Manhattan, where a memorial mass for Dennis was scheduled. Though only Carolyn and Kevin knew it, the perennially irreverent Dennis McCarthy had stopped in daily at the church before going around the corner to his office.<p>
Carolyn held the arm of Kevin's black suit as he walked slowly to a forward pew near an altar dedicated to Dennis's memory. "I'm starting to fall apart," Carolyn had reported a day earlier. "I feel like I never had time to really mourn Dennis, and now I find myself going into my bedroom a lot to cry. I'm not used to this, and I'm really mad at myself. The other day the psychologist who said I survived by putting things in little boxes called and asked which box I'm in now. I told him I might be inside the last of them. I feel like I'm nearing some kind of end."<p>
Dozens of Dennis's friends and colleagues from Prudential sat together in one section of the big church. Carolyn inventoried the Prudential officials on the way in, and she noted the presence of a group of senior LIRR officials that included the president of the organization. <p>
A hymn was sung. Paul Keenan, a priest who had gotten to know Dennis during his regular visits, observed that Dennis McCarthy had leaned up against "the veil that separates this world from the Kingdom of God" and had gone over to the other side. Keenan noted that Dennis's widow seemed to harbor no malice or hatred for the man who killed her husband. "She was able to transform her hurt and anger into something else," he said. Kevin, who hadn't attended his father's funeral, sat bolt upright, blinking tears away from his eyes.<p>
Later that day would come a candlelight memorial at the Merillon Avenue station. Carolyn had recently referred to the station in the present tense, as the one "where Kevin and Dennis get off."<p>
Before the vigil, family and friends gathered in the kitchen of the McCarthy house. While Kevin's uncle, Tommy, buttoned Kevin's shirt and tied his necktie, some of the old friends -- skiing and drinking buddies who remembered Dennis from when he was a stick-thin kid known around the neighborhood as "Whitey" -- began to talk about Dennis McCarthy. "Well you know that the reason he liked to get up so early was so he'd have more time to bust everyone's balls before bed," declared Budd Salerno, Dennis's best friend, and everyone holding beers in the kitchen laughed.<p>
"I'm lucky because of these stories," Carolyn said, a smile below her sad eyes as she handed out candles. "For the rest of my life I'll be able to hear stories about my jolly Irishman. These stories give me strength."<p>
Below the train platform, hundreds of people drawn from the myriad circles of pain and support milled around in the damp evening waiting to meet the 5:33. A small stage had been constructed on a stretch of grass below the platform. Joyce Gorycki, looking very pale under the intense lights held by camera crews, stood near the stage holding up a large picture of Jim and a lighted candle. Two women nearby passed out flyers that offered free counseling at the high school when the memorial was over. High school students sat in circles on blankets, singing songs, and groups of nuns stood by chatting softly. Politicians moved through the crowd shaking hands, and cops eyed the growing crowd uneasily. Doctors like Pat Corcoran from Kevin's rehab days mingled with emergency-services workers who hadn't been back to the train station for a year. Carolyn McCarthy hugged the paramedic who'd discovered that Kevin was alive, and the woman told her that she was still in need of constant therapy because she just couldn't shake the effects of walking into the third car of the train. "But my therapist told me I had to come," she said. "So here I am."<p>
"If you look at the pictures," a young paramedic said to Tom McDermott, "I'm the one next to you wearing a stethoscope when they carried you out of the train. You squeezed my hand."<p>
Tom McDermott looked overwhelmed. "Thank you," he said. "I'm so glad you came ... to tell me. Thanks."<p>
Tom then moved back through the damp night in search of fellow victims. He knew that Lisa Combatti had a healthy baby girl named Kimberley Ann, and that Minoru Saito, the Japanese businessman shot in the leg during the rampage, was back at work, though his Japanese company had asked him not to become involved as an advocate. Frank Barker, the father of seven, could still not move his left thumb, but he was back at work and could hold his kids in his arms. Brendan Doyle, who still carried a bullet in his abdomen, had left Long Island that summer to join UN peacekeeping forces in Croatia. <p>
Carolyn McCarthy and Joyce Gorycki had worked the phones constantly for a week trying to get the victims who still lived in the area to come out for the vigil. The two widows talked often now. Jim used to tell Joyce about the McCarthys, the garrulous father and softspoken son who often rode with him in the third car. Joyce had recently told Carolyn that she planned to move to Phoenix after Colin Ferguson's trial. She and Jim had always planned to move there together.<p>
"It's like a reunion," Joyce said, surveying the large crowd at the vigil. Even the Kims, the devastated parents of Mi Kyung Kim, who died at 27 in the seat next to Jim Gorycki, stood huddled together in the wind, their candles protected by folded pieces of paper. Mrs. Kim sobbed beneath a big pair of sunglasses throughout the proceedings.<p>
Near the platform, Debra Weber hugged Helen Alexanderson and showed her that she was walking. Alexanderson, who had been married in January next to crutches trimmed with lace, said she was planning another ceremony so she could walk down the aisle. John Aspel, for whom a bullet in the belly had set off a long year of related traumas and personal setbacks, came up to Carolyn McCarthy. After he walked away, Carolyn said, "There's still so much horror in that poor man's eyes."<p>
Frank Barker stood beside his wife and children, shaking his head as he told another victim that while trimming the hedges he'd managed to cut off the end of a finger on the same hand shot on the train. He abruptly stopped talking when he heard a train whistle. "Here it comes," he said, staring up at the platform. "Here comes the train."<p>
The silver railway cars glided in alongside clouds of steam turned silver in reflection. "They've platformed it the wrong way again," Frank said, pointing to the two cars left short of the platform, as two cars were a year earlier at precisely the same time.<p>
The crowd remained very quiet until the train had disappeared. Joyce Gorycki stepped up to the stage and stood before a line of television cameras 50 feet long. "I'm positive that all the victims who didn't survive are looking down at us to see all of the people who've come," Joyce said. Then she began to thank the many people who'd helped her make it through the past year.<p>
Arlene Locicero, Amy Federici's mother, also thanked all the people hailing from corporations and government agencies who had responded to her daughter's death. "The children of this nation must be protected ... this violence must end," she managed before breaking down. Arlene turned to a young woman standing nearby. She drew the healthy-looking woman, who had received her daughter's heart in a transplant procedure, to her side. "This is Theresa Caravella," Arlene said. "She is Amy's heart."<p>
With Kevin towering above her a few inches away, Carolyn McCarthy looked out at the crowd. "Through the prayers and strength of family, friends, and the community, Kevin and I have survived," she said. "A year ago we all began a journey we did not want to take. For some, this day means closure, and I guess that's the way it should be. For others, this day is just the beginning."<p>
For several weeks during the winter of 1995, Colin Ferguson once again strolled back and forth in front of people he'd shot aboard the 5:33 to Hicksville. Drawing on a courtroom vocabulary he'd gleaned from the classic tome Fundamentals of Trial Technique and deploying stage movements and body language lawyers use only on TV, Ferguson argued that "Mr. Ferguson," as he referred to himself, had been sleeping innocently in the third car of the train when a stranger stole a gun he was transporting to "safe haven." After the smoke had cleared, Ferguson averred, the victims of the shooting had joined agencies of the state in an elaborate conspiracy to blame him and thereby destroy "yet another life."<p>
Ferguson questioned 15 eyewitnesses, all of whom refused to refer to him in the distant third person he preferred.<p>
"You shot me," Maryanne Phillips said to Ferguson, staring hard into his eyes.<p>
Tom McDermott took the stand and once again rolled the lurid tape of human slaughter he seemed doomed to forever carry inside his head. Many of the victims would soon join Tom in bringing a lawsuit designed to establish a legal chain of responsibility connecting murderers with the makers of the weapons and bullets that are their tools. In support of the suit and his constant lobbying efforts, McDermott could eloquently recall the horror of the train ride several times in a day. But up on the witness stand, with Colin Ferguson once again squared off at ten paces, McDermott seemed suddenly unnerved. He seemed to flail inside the nightmare in search of words. "The pushing," he said slowly, his voice weaker with each phrase. "The falling down ... no screams ... blood all over ... like a battlefield."<p>
Carolyn McCarthy and Joyce Gorycki sat in the audience, the two widows having decided that they would be in Colin Ferguson's sight whenever he turned around. Carolyn had been surprised at how shaken she was by the photographs of Dennis lying on the seat and the constant echoing of his name during the proceedings, and now the sight of Tom groping for expression moved her deeply.<p>
Ferguson eventually rose for cross-examination, and as soon as he began to speak -- "Mr. McDermott, is it your testimony..." -- McDermott's shoulders squared, and he again showed the mixture of dignity and profound sorrow that lent so much power to his words. "You were absorbed in details," Ferguson said, "...all these details, Mr. McDermott. It is your testimony that you could still identify the shooter?"<p>
"You walked past me," McDermott said, much louder than before. "You fired from your right to your left, from your right to your left, down into the seats." Because he was afraid Ferguson would come back, find him alive, and pump another bullet into him, McDermott said, he got up and went to the back of the train in search of the emergency brake. And still, McDermott continued, leaning toward Ferguson, "I was concerned that you would shoot me in the back."<p>
On the night of the 17th of February, 437 days after he'd shot his way into the middle of so many strangers' lives, Colin Ferguson was convicted of six murders and 19 attempted murders. As he was handcuffed and led from the courtroom, spectators began to clap and cheer.<p>
Outside the courtroom, the new extended family of victims gathered beside Tom McDermott, Carolyn McCarthy, and Joyce Gorycki as Tom told reporters that it was time to direct public focus away from Colin Ferguson and back to the safety of innocents. The others then came forward to take a turn addressing a public now aware of their plight more because of Ferguson's twisted legal performance than because of the pain he had caused. Most of the victims had decided that their tragedy and healing implied a certain responsibility to convey the truth of their ordeals -- or at least that part of the agony an outsider could begin to understand.<p>
"I know that there will always be aspects of those three minutes inside the devil's paradise that none of us will ever be able to express," Tom McDermott said. "There is a kind of chaos beyond anything that happens in a war, a vision of cruelty that can overwhelm the mind. And I know that I will never forget the words I heard myself say as the shooting and killing continued that night. 'This can't be,' I kept saying. 'This cannot be.' "<p>

						February 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Feature  <p> BOMBS AWAY <p>The bond salespeople worked in the Juice-O-Matic of the new economy. It was a machine with only two settings, hectic and burnout. A short story adapted from the upcoming novel Bombardiers.  <p> By Po Bronson  <p> The time had come. The bond salespeople double-timed out of their predawn mission briefing and marched down the aisles of the Atlantic Pacific Corporation to take their places in the bunkers. They were soldiers in their 20s and early 30s. Mercenaries. Professionals. Shock troops in the trenches of information warfare.  <p> They eyed the clock. It was two minutes to five in the morning, San Francisco time. They rehearsed the research department's sales pitches. Coyote Jack, their sales managerbosstyrant, paced back and forth in his fishbowl office, trying to look brutish and mean. It was his signal that there would be hell to pay for anything less than a 110 percent effort. Sidney Greeder refilled his coffee thermos. Sue Marino scanned the Post-It crib notes pasted down the side of her phone. Nickel Sansome set a tiny American flag and flagpole above his turret. Nelson Dickey turnedall seven framed pictures of his children toward Sansome's flagpole in mock allegiance. Eggs Igino reprogrammed his Quotron to constantly display the live prices of bond futures, gold futures, oil futures,and dollar futures down the left column of his screen. Lisa Lisaused the reflection of her face in the green monochrome monitors to lengthen her eyelashes, which she then batted in Eggs Igino's direction.  <p> They turned up the volume on their squawk boxes until the hoarse feedback made the worn-out speakers hiss and pop. They all gazed into the dark night clouds that rattled and bowed the enormous, wall-high window panes. Some of them jumped when the air-filtering vents overhead clicked on with a churning grumble. The heating element on the monster photocopier in the back room sucked ina rush of electricity that made the fluorescent bulbs above momentarily dim. Then the phone banks went red.  <p> "Incoming!" screamed Nickel Sansome.  <p> "Sell the Aussies!" screamed Eggs Igino.  <p> "More yield than Treasurys . . . !" screamed Nelson Dickey. <p> "It's patriotic!" screamed Sue Marino.  <p> "Of course we'll buy them back!" Sidney Greeder screamed.  <p> "Syndicate! Syndicate!" Lisa screamed.  <p> In a single day, the 37 salespeople in Atlantic Pacific's San Francisco office could move $1 billion in bonds, mostly new issues. Their customers were big pension funds, corporate treasurers,and state, county, and local governments. It was a filthy profession, but the money was addicting. The phone rang constantly, and everyone suffered cauliflower ears, neck rashes, and cervical pain, and when the sun came up and they had already been at their desks two, three hours, they went to the 41st floor window and imagined what it would be like to have to ride a bus or find a parking place. On days when the sun didn't come up and instead their tower was socked in by clouds and fog, the other world existed even less than usual; they could not see the streets below or most of the shorter buildings, and they were one of the few spaceships in the sky.   <p> Sidney Greeder's stomach soured and his back stiffened and he began to worry that he was going to develop an ear infection from all the germs that bred unrestrained in the receiver ofhis phone.  <p> "Do you see anything in there?" he asked Lisa Lisa, having unscrewed the receiver cap, exposing the resonator drum.  <p> "I don't see anything," she said, scrutinizing the cap. She poked the end of a paper clip through the holes in the hard plastic. <p> "I'm thinking of microwaving it," he said. "Kill 'em off." <p> "Would that do anything?"  <p> "It couldn't hurt."  <p> From his small outpost in the middle of the sales pit, Eggs Igino enjoyed the daily spectacle. He didn't see the harm of it. He didn't think there was any harm because the whole world was trending toward disorder anyway. He was an intellectual, and he knew how to maintain a certain scientific distance from his surroundings. His superiors were no more threatening than mitochondria in a petri dish; his colleagues, mice in a maze. <p> Igino had been selling bonds for Atlantic Pacific for less than a year, but he already had become the office's number-two producer. He was closing in fast on Sidney Greeder. Greeder, the reigning King of Mortgages, had been on the job for five years and had succeeded by learning to channel his anger into sales efforts.The King hated his customers, and he made them pay by selling them bonds. In contrast, Igino was a success because he had no anger--or fear--to channel in the first place. Selling was a game to him and he knew just how to play. Igino was quirky and jovial, a smart aleck with bad taste in ties. He had a freckled face and an athlete's casual slouch and globular, walnut-sized, muscular jowls that stirred as he spoke.  <p> Later that morning, Coyote Jack bolted upright when John White, managing director of the San Francisco office, buzzed the salesmanagerbosstyrant on the intercom. "He wants to see a what?" Coyote Jack shouted increduously.  <p> "A bond. Any kind of bond. Eggs says he can't sell bonds anymore if he's never seen one."  <p> "You want to what!?" Coyote Jack rasped, suddenly poking his head into John White's plush office, where Eggs was reclining leisurely on John White's sofa and John White was digging through his desk, dumping out the contents.  <p> "I want to see a bond," Eggs Igino remarked flatly. Coyote Jack's shoulders dropped.   <p> "What the heck for? J.W.--he's bullshitting us, right?"  <p> "I thought I had one in my desk somewhere here," John White mumbled as he dug into a drawer.  <p> Eggs looked down and picked under a fingernail on one hand with the other. "I've sold billions of dollars of bonds. I think it's time I got to know what I was selling."  <p> "You're selling them just fine without ever having seen one!" Coyote Jack blurted in frustration. Coyote Jack was a fat man with thin skin who wore garish watches and pointed shoes and starch-hardened shirt collars that caused a rash.   <p> John White sighed. "It's just a piece of paper with a bunch of colors and words printed on it. It's like a Publishers Clearinghouse Sweepstakes coupon."  <p> "I'd still like to see one. I would sleep better at night knowingI wasn't part of some big hoax. They're really just on the Fed's computer, aren't they? I'd like to know they really exist." <p> "We used to use the pieces of paper," John White said. "Hell, that was a long time ago. When you sold a bond, little old menon Wall Street would go pick it up, sign for it, and place it in a leather satchel. They would walk across the street and deliver it. We used to take lunches back then, walk out on the street. I saw a bunch of bonds once, when one of these little old men tripped on the curb and fell on the pavement and his leather satchel flew open, spilling millions of dollars into the gutter." <p> "This is stupid," Coyote Jack gasped. "It's idiotic. I ought to fire you, Igino. I ought to bust your ass right back down to vice salesman." This was far from an exaggerated threat; Coyote Jack had fired three salespeople in the past month alone, one simply because he had the gall to floss his teeth during one of Coyote's sales briefings.  <p> But Eggs Igino only laughed. He was the most promising young salesman in the firm. They would sooner shoot their foot off than fire him.  <p> "Why don't you just go over to the window at the Federal Reserve branch across the street and buy one," Eggs Igino suggested." Just get me a little $1,000 face-value T note. I just want to see one."  <p> Coyote Jack and John White stared at each other, realizing they had no choice. All the firm's money was handled out of New York, so Coyote Jack had to go to the downtown branch of his bank and withdraw a money order for $1,000, which he carried across the street to the Federal Reserve bank. He found the window, set down the money order, and asked for the current ten-year note. The teller requested his checking-account number so that the bond could be credited to his account. But Coyote Jack didn't want it credited; he wanted to walk out with it. The teller stared at him curiously. He told her he wanted to stuff it inside his mattress. She said that such a thing was no longer possible--the bank had to have an account to wire interest payments to. He asked for them to be mailed, by check. Such a thing was not anoption.   <p> Finally, Coyote Jack admitted that all he really needed was something that looked official, something that would serve as proof of ownership, even if it wasn't the bond itself. She gave him a receipt, stamped with the embossed seal of the Fed and a printed signature of Alan Greenspan. But it was no bigger than a credit card carbon, and it came in black ink on greenish paper. It could have been Monopoly money. For $1,000, he really though the was getting ripped off. Coyote Jack marched back to the sales floor and threw it down on Eggs Igino's desk with a show of resentment. <p> "What do you got there?" Sidney Greeder inquired.  <p> Eggs Igino removed the receipt from its brown envelope. "It's a bond," he said happily, though he was dissatisfied with its unassuming appearance.  <p> "No kidding. A real bond? Can I see it?"  <p> Eggs held the bond up to the light to see if it had some hologramon it or colored thread--something to be sure it was real. "Haven't you seen one before?" he asked Greeder.  <p> "Me? Naw. When would I have seen one?"  <p> "I just thought you've been selling them for almost five years, you might have seen one before." Eggs put it down on the desk and scratched at the black type with the point of a paper clip to see how it was printed.  <p> "Hey," Lisa Lisa saluted, crossing over behind Eggs. "What's everyone looking at?"  <p> Nickel Sansome rubbed his bald head and snickered. "Boy, Lisa Lisa--haven't you ever seen a bond before?"  <p> "That's a bond?" Lisa Lisa asked with chagrin. "It's not very impressive."  <p> "Well what did you expect?" Sidney scoffed. "A brick of gold?" <p> "I thought it would be bigger, at least," she answered, leaning over Eggs Igino's shoulder. "Can I feel it?"  <p> "Get your own," Sidney Greeder jeered.  <p> "I'll buy it from you," Lisa Lisa said. She looked at the Teleratescreen for the ten-year note, which was trading 98-2 bid. "I'll give you 2+ for it."  <p> "98-4," Nickel Sansome bid, in a plain, poker-faced grunt. <p> "It's Coyote Jack's," Eggs said. "I can't sell it to you. Besides, I wouldn't sell a real bond for less than 99. There's an authenticity factor you've got to add in."  <p> "I'll give you 99," Lisa Lisa put in. "It had better be real,though."  <p> "99-4," Nickel Sansome bid, standing behind her.  <p> "I could just go across the street and buy one," Lisa Lisa responded. <p> Eggs shrugged his shoulders.  <p> "99-8," Nickel proffered excitedly.  <p> "Done!" Eggs pronounced. "Sold to the man in the flesh-colored skullcap." His hands flew out to his calculator and tapped the keys, figuring the number of days between interest payments and how much was owed. "Make a check out to Coyote for $1,082.46," he said, handing over the piece of paper.  <p> Nickel Sansome beamed proudly, examining the snippet of paper carefully. He wrote the check out for Eggs, who took it into Coyote Jack's office and handed it over.  <p> "What's this?" Coyote Jack inquired, staring at the check. <p> "I made you a little profit," Eggs said.  <p> "How did you do that?"  <p> Eggs shrugged his shoulders. "I really just wanted to see a bond."  <p> "Sure you did," Coyote Jack said. "You know what you are? You're a damn genius, Igino. You could sell venom to a snake."  <p> "Yeah, right."  <p> "Hey, I'm paying you a compliment! You're the A-team, a regular Green Beret. You're the genius who sold Modesto County those Freddie Mac adjustables. <p> Eggs pulled a loose thread on the sleeve of his shirt. "They don't need money to buy a CMO when our repo desk is more than happy to loan them the money to buy it with. It's not that different from <a name="NYSE:GE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10634"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> loaning someone the money to buy a car." <p> Coyote Jack laughed with delight. "Heck, kid, we ought to have you out there talking to the press. You make it sound so simple." <p> "That's because it is simple," Eggs answered.  <p> "You wouldn't believe the flak this firm took after that Orange County fiasco."  <p> Eggs was nonchalant. "Yeah, well, there's a big difference between a principal-only strip and an adjustable-rate CMO, isn't there?" <p> Coyote Jack looked at the kid. He had a bright ruddy aura about him, a good-hearted glow that made Coyote Jack's stomach shoot with pain. Coyote Jack couldn't help but imagine what it would be like to have the most promising young salesman in the firm not show up for work one day. He knew why everyone else would show up for work tomorrow. For instance, Sidney Greeder was waiting to be fully vested in the pension. Nickel Sansome needed his money because being rich was what was expected of a man in his family. Lisa Lisa needed to prove she was as strong and smartas any man on the floor. They all needed their jobs, no matter how much they bitched and moaned. They all had their reasons, except Eggs Igino. He was too young to have suffered, and he was too innocent to be corrupted. Coyote Jack knew almost nothing about the kid, but corporate surveillance had dug up the fact that he didn't eat meat. It bothered Coyote Jack to no end that the future of the firm was a vegetarian. The only other story they could come up with was that when Eggs Igino was about to begin his all-Pac-Ten senior season for the Stanford Cardinal soccer team, the top goal scorer of the previous year met a woman named Katie, fell in love, and quit the team. A few years later,when something went wrong, the kid took off for Mexico. Coyote Jack understood the pattern: The kid had a soft heart, and he could quit again.  <p> So Coyote Jack had no choice but to invent a reason for the kid to keep coming to work. "Relax," he said to Eggs. "Hey, let me ask you something. I've been thinking. Can I ask you something?" <p> "I guess." Eggs looked away.  <p> "Don't get so defensive. I'm just talking. You used to live down in Mexico, right? You liked it there, spent your days on the beaches, climbed palm trees, etcetera. Am I right? You think about it, don't you? You look at all this stuff, all these buildings, and your mind starts wandering to the surf-and-sand landscape, right?"  <p> "Sure. What's your point?"  <p> "My point is, there's talk about a Honolulu office."  <p> "There is?"  <p> "Hawaii. You and me, kiddo. Luaus, volcanoes, Polynesian girls. There's a lot of mortgages coming out of Hawaii. Lot of money from Japan and Hong Kong."  <p> Coyote Jack reached into his desk and brought out an envelope, which he threw into Igino's lap. "Tickets to Hawaii. First class. They're open-ended--you can use 'em anytime. Go take a look-see, get acquainted with the island. I've got this saying, If you're going to go to hell, you might as well go to hell in Hawaii." <p> "Let Lisa Lisa use them. She covers the Hawaii accounts, and she needs a break more than me."  <p> "Lisa Lisa goes all the time. You keep them, use them when you like. Think about it, Igino. That's all I'm asking. Right now, we're just talking. We're studying the numbers."  <p> When Eggs Igino left his office, Coyote Jack began to wonder why he didn't just fire Lisa Lisa and give her accounts to Eggs Igino. If Eggs Igino had done well selling bonds to rural Modesto, he didn't see why he wouldn't do even better with those fast-growing counties in Hawaii. Eggs Igino had sold the GMACs and the Freddie Mac convertibles and the Aussie 8s of '03. And that was to the pension funds! There was no telling what he might do with a more aggressive account. So what if there was no new office in the works? Assigning him Hawaii would convince Eggs that there was.  <p>
The next attack could come from anywhere. The economic forecasts were useless. The fundamentals went ignored. The Federal Reserve was unpredictable. Money supply meant nothing in a global market. The Americans followed the lead of the Japanese, and the Japanese followed the Germans, and the Germans followed the Americans. They waited for instructions from the top, but the standing order remained the same: Sell bonds. Nobody knew where the market was going, but those who knew less than the others lost their shirts and had their eyes ripped out and were made to swallow. In the morning, there was always the chance to make it back.  <p> Two days later, after the market had closed, Coyote Jack called Lisa Lisa into his office. He sat her down in a chair and paced behind her back.  <p> "I tried to line them up," Lisa Lisa said, when Coyote Jack wondered why the State of Hawaii hadn't bought any of the Freddie Mac adjustables. Lisa Lisa squirmed. Her feet snaked around the leg posts of her chair. "But Coyote--they're a state! They need their cash for social services. They don't have money lying around to dump into Freddie Macs."  <p> "Having no money is not an excuse. Our repo desk will loan them all they need."  <p> Lisa Lisa turned her head around, but Coyote Jack circled out of her view. She turned the other way, he dodged back behindher.  <p> Lisa Lisa fell forward in her chair. "You're being ridiculous, Coyote. You want me to put Hawaii in the repo market after all that's happened in Southern California?"  <p> "Why the heck not!? There's still no sign of inflation. You saw the PPI this morning."  <p> "It's more complicated than that. . . ." Lisa Lisa groaned with exhaustion. "I've got principles. I've got a reputation with my accounts. We've got to build back our trust."  <p> "What's so complicated about it? General Motors loans drivers money to buy a car, don't they? Why not loan Hawaii a little dough to buy some Freddie Macs?" He walked up to his fishbowl window and stared out over the sales pits. "You think you're entitled to that seat on the mortgage desk? You aren't royalty. This ain't no monarchy."  <p> Lisa Lisa bit her lip. "The State of Hawaii was nothing before I picked it up."  <p> "That was three years ago. What about this year? You taking a vacation this year? You doing the bubble bath this week?" <p> "Blow off, Coyote."  <p> "Don't ever talk to me like that unless you mean it, girl." <p> Lisa Lisa stormed out. She ran to her desk, grabbed her purse, and ran into the bathroom. At times like this Lisa Lisa wished she were not alone in the world. For a woman in the workplace, the need for constant affirmation was often the most threatening addiction of all. Lisa Lisa's fundamental weakness was that she was strong. She could yell on the phone and drag herself out of bed at 4 a.m. and make men fantasize with her in mind. She could run four miles in 23 minutes and down a martini without wincing. Lisa Lisa had so many strengths that she was weak with desperation. She was the oldest of three brown-haired sisters,but she was the only one not yet married. Someday it would make sense why she'd become what she'd become, because she didn't come this way to be alone.  <p> When she came back from the bathroom, she snuck in the backdoor and went into the kitchen. Eggs Igino was making a new pot of coffee. Eggs Igino, with his great ease with the world.  <p> "What gives, Lisa Lisa?"  <p> Lisa Lisa leaned up against the counter beside him. "Do you know what it's like to be a woman in this business?"  <p> Eggs Igino turned around, and she was only inches away. She reached up to his neck and straightened out his tie.  <p> She answered her own question. "You're not supposed to be a woman. You're supposed to check it at the door."  <p> Eggs put his hand on her back. "You all right?" he asked.  <p> Lisa Lisa pursed her lips and nodded, looking away to control her emotion. They were quiet. "I hate this job," he said finally. <p> Lisa Lisa wiped at the tears in her streaked makeup. She took a deep breath. "You're lucky," she said.  <p> "Me? Why?"  <p> "Hating your job is a luxury. I need my job. This is my chosen career. I can only afford to dislike little parts of it."  <p> Eggs looked at her. "We're salespeople. We answer the phone and tell people what they want to hear."  <p> Lisa Lisa shook her head. "I'd like to think I am a step up from that."  <p> "Believe what you want."  <p> "You're becoming like Sidney Greeder. Hating your job is just a convenient way to avoid responsibility for selling so many dubious trades."  <p> Eggs felt insulted. Sid Greeder walked around hunched over like an old decrepit man, muttering to himself. "There's a big difference between me and Sid Greeder," Eggs blurted.  <p> Lisa Lisa replied, "Yeah, like about four years on the job." <p> Eggs didn't know what to say. People rarely spoke this openly with each other at the office. All the joking around didn't make any of them true friends.  <p> "Hey, Eggs, you know, I don't live far from here. Would you walk me home?"  <p>
 They were at her apartment on Telegraph Hill. Eggs didn't know what he was doing there. She sat him down at her kitchen table and asked if he wanted a glass of water. She told him most people don't get enough water. Water and sleep. So he said okay and took a glass of water. She asked if he used salt on his food,and he said no. So she got out a vial of iodine and put a dropin his water, saying most people don't get iodine now that they don't salt their food. Then she went into the bathroom to touchup her makeup.   <p> "Coyote Jack's been talking about a Hawaii office," Eggs said, trying to make conversation.  <p> "Is that right?" Lisa Lisa said, from the far-off place in her mind.  <p> "I can't tell if he's bullshitting me. He might just want me to have something to look forward to, something to stick around for."  <p> "I go to Hawaii twice a year," she said, softly. "It's nice." <p> "It's a tempting thought all right. Then again, he might just be messing with my head."  <p> "Eggs?"  <p> "What?"  <p> "Do you have a girlfriend?"  <p> "Uh, no."  <p> "You know a lot of guys, they treat their girlfriends like princesses. Men have thoughts--all sorts of thoughts, dirty thoughts, mean thoughts, thoughts they're ashamed of, really--but they can't bear to share those thoughts with their girlfriend. They tell themselves that they don't want to hurt their girlfriend, or wife, or whoever. They think they want to protect her. But that's not it. You know what it really is?"  <p> "What?"  <p> "They're afraid. They're afraid of their own thoughts."  <p> Eggs nodded slowly.  <p> Lisa Lisa went on. "I didn't think you were the kind of man who was afraid of his own thoughts."  <p> "What do you mean?" he asked, stalling, a little ashamed.  <p> Lisa Lisa stopped and turned toward him. She rolled her shoulders back and tossed her hair. "I mean, what are you thinking about right now? Are you really thinking about Hawaii?"   <p> Eggs just watched her. He didn't say anything. She caught his eyes and stared him down.   <p> "Are you just looking at me, Eggs, or are you looking at me?" She stepped forward, then looked down, then looked up again at him. "You know," she said, "sometimes I look at you and I think you are just way too young, you're just a baby. But then there's times I'm just overwhelmed, because you're a baby, but, well, you're a really, really beautiful baby." Lisa Lisa kissed him on the lips very briefly, so that he would be left wanting more. His lips were big and soft and she had to kiss him a couple times, actually, to cover all of his lips. She kept kissing them.  <p> "What's going on?" Eggs asked, stopping.  <p> "Nothing," Lisa Lisa said, looking away. "Please, don't stop." <p> "This isn't right," Eggs said. He sat up and stared at her and saw her again as the Lisa Lisa he worked with. "I gotta go," he said anxiously, heading for the door quickly. "I'll see you tomorrow, okay?" The door shut.  <p> Lisa Lisa went into the bathroom. She looked at herself in the mirror.    <p> "Such a child," she said aloud, and tried not to think about it.  <p>
At 4 a.m., Lisa Lisa dragged herself out of bed and forced herself into her clothes. She walked the cold downtown streets to work,sheltering herself against the breeze that swirled at the corners. The streets were peaceful, almost sympathetic, and for a moment knowing that she was alone in the world felt liberating rather than sad. On the way into the building, the security guards told her she looked awfully nice, and she smiled. She rode up the elevator and strolled out onto the sales floor. She went into the kitchen, poured herself a cup of coffee, grabbed a plate of scrambled eggs and hash browns from the caterer's breakfast cart, picked up a copy of the Wall Street Journal, and moseyed to her desk as she glanced over the front page. She looked out the window where the sun shone orange against the other towers. Light banter came over the squawk box, and she began to takedown opening numbers and construct the story of overnight trading. She removed the wrapper from her breakfast and took a bite of hash browns. Slowly, the others straggled into the office.  <p> Lisa Lisa tried to concentrate on her work. She tried to push Eggs out of her mind. She watched as Coyote Jack came out of his office with a huge, proud smirk on his face. He walked directly to her desk. She thought he was going to apologize for the day before.  <p>
Eggs Igino was just walking across the esplanade as Lisa Lisa came bursting out of the building and onto the street, looking hysterical, angry, and blown to pieces. She threw her bag of belongings at him.  <p> "You little snot-nosed bastard!" She swung at him and missed. <p> "What the hell?" Eggs jumped back.   <p> "You knew all about this!" she cried. "Oh, you jerk, you knew all along that you were going to get my accounts. I wouldn't let you use me like that, I wanted to make you pay with your heart, and you were afraid, you're such a little boy, you're so scared . . ."  <p> "What are you talking about?" Eggs stammered. "Did you get fired?" <p> "Don't play dumb, you jerk. Of course I got fired. All that stuff about the Hawaii office, you knew damn well. Right, now you'll ask me who's going to get my accounts! I just can't believe you. I can't. Get away from me!"  <p> Eggs tried to grab her arm, but she swung at him again and ran off, clutching at her elbows.  <p> Eggs stood there for a long time, sorting through what she had said, putting it together. He thought about where he'd come from, and where he was headed, and he didn't know--had never known--what he was in it for. It was something he'd had to try, something he had to prove to himself, but once he was in it they kept setting up more and more challenges for him to prove himself against. He looked up at the building, to where it disappeared in the clouds above.   <p> "GET BACK TO WORK!" Coyote Jack screamed, looking through his internal window at where Nickel Sansome was slothfully padding about in his bunker. "You lousy paste-for-brains cockroach! Do you feel like being next?!" Coyote Jack slammed the phone backdown and paced his room in circles, pushing aside his furniture. Then he stopped at the window again and stared out at Eggs Igino's desk. He was dying to tell Igino that he would pick up the Hawaii accounts. The only trouble was that at that very moment, Coyote had no idea where Eggs Igino was.  <p> It was not like Eggs to be late coming to work. Not like him at all.  <p>
Eggs Igino reclined in his seat and rolled his head to the side, smelling the leather of the headrest. Out the small window the sun was just coming up, and they were the only bird in the sky. His head was throbbing. When the stewardess spoke to him, he jumped up in surprise, then asked for a tomato juice. He put his book down in his lap. There would be plenty of time to read on the beach when he got there. Lodged above the tray table beforehim was a GTE Airfone. He popped it free with a credit card but didn't make the call.   <p> Thinking back on the last few days, he pulled a paper napkin out of the seat pocket and began to write on it with one of his corporate pens in light blue ink:  <p> 1. Knowledge is Power!  <p> 2. Knowledge is not a Candy Bar!  <p> When you eat a candy bar, Eggs thought, the candy bar is gone. And if you give it to a friend, then he gets to eat it and you don't. Knowledge can't get used up, and you can't get rid of it by giving it away. Then again:  <p> 2b. Word Travels Fast.  <p> The power of knowledge was fleeting and temporary. We would all be powerless. Then he wrote below the other lines in large,energetic, slashing letters:  <p> 3. Power is Temporary!!!  <p> This was the third law of information economics. Lisa Lisa was living proof of that--and so was he. Eggs could call Coyote Jack when he got there. Maybe. Maybe he would wait a few days, give him a scare. Eggs Igino chuckled at the thought of Coyote Jack staring out over the sales floor, wondering where he'd gone. The tickets were open-ended, after all. Eggs didn't know when he intended to go back. Maybe he would take up surfing, ride the Blue Monster at Molokai. He set the phone back into the headrest. His eyes closed. He thought of the ocean, the power of the wave. <p>

						It's not how much you make, but what you make of it. A groundbreaking survey of America's inner financial life.<p>(For June's cover story, Worth and Roper/Starch Worldwide conducted a groundbreaking survey to probe the America financial psyche.  Then we used the results to identify seven distinct money personalities.)<p>By Robert Sullivan<p>Your money or your life? Not a simple question, since most people can't seem to differentiate the two. Just read the dollar signs. Forty percent of Americans think about money more often than sex. Fights over money are the number-one source of marital discord (just slightly ahead of arguments about what television show to watch). Fifty-six percent of us say there comes a point in every marriage when money becomes more important than sex. Twenty-eight percent of the country rates making the wrong choice on a major investment decision as stressful -- more than are anxious about speaking in public or enduring a root canal. <p>Last fall, Worth and Roper/Starch Worldwide, one of the country's largest market-research firms, mounted the first extensive probe into the dark recesses of the great American money brain. We sent a battalion of pollsters door-to-door across the country. Knocking on some 2,000 doors, they asked each of our respondents 83 detailed questions about their personal financial lives: We wanted to know how Americans make, spend, squabble over, and think about money. The resulting report, entitled "The Personality Factor: A Worth/Roper Survey of America's Inner Financial Life," is a groundbreaking exploration of the murky interplay between our emotions and our wallets. <p>Why do some people control money effortlessly while others are controlled by it? Thirteen percent of Americans seem psychologically coded to accumulate money. About a quarter of the populace has a very difficult relationship with the dollar. The vast middle manages its money carefully -- though often overcautiously. Using a number-crunching technique known as segmentation analysis -- and some very powerful computers -- Roper's statisticians identified seven distinct money personalities: hunters, gatherers, protectors, strivers, nesters, splurgers, and idealists. One of these profiles describes the money personality of almost every American.<p>If the '80s focused on acquisition, the '90s are about holding on. This is a decade of anxious conservatism. Fully one third of the country describes itself as extremely unwilling to take any financial risk. When asked to name two or three qualities they associate with money, only a quarter of Americans identified freedom, pleasure, or achievement. Rather, in the current American mind-set, money represents security and comfort. <p>Americans don't mind saying they need money, but they're uncomfortable saying they want it. Although they feel the dollar's strong psychological pull, they're not quite sure where it's pulling them. For instance, half the population says it believes that money can't buy happiness. And yet nearly 70 percent of Americans maintain that doubling their earnings would make them a lot or somewhat happier. <p>What's more, financial comfort doesn't necessarily buy emotional ease. "There's absolutely no relationship between the amount of money one has," says Dr. Allan Scholom, a clinical psychologist in Chicago, "and the amount one worries about it." In short, it's not how much you make but what you make of it. Higher-income Americans are only slightly less likely to tie happiness to income. Sixty-seven percent of those earning more than $50,000 a year believe that higher salaries would make them happier. <p>Given this basic contradiction in how we set the emotional value of a dollar, it's not surprising that as money opens fears, it closes mouths. Among eight touchy subjects we brought up, money was the one Americans said they feel least comfortable discussing, well ahead of religion or politics, topics once considered taboo. While 58 percent say their spouse knows how much they make, just 15 percent say their best friend knows their income. "The two most difficult subjects for my clients to discuss are sexuality and money," says Laura Wimbish, an adjunct professor of clinical psychology at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago. "While the sense of shame over sexuality is dissipating, the shame surrounding the topic of money is still there."<p>Why is money such a loaded subject? Because the way we see money gets to the root of how we see ourselves. Money equals character: When asked what feature they would most like to change about themselves, our respondents most frequently mentioned the amount of money they had. Money equals image: In general, Americans would rather be richer than thinner, smarter, taller, more patient, or better looking. Money equals control: Free spending is seen as a sign of weakness. Even as Americans want fatter bank accounts, they don't necessarily want to live more extravagantly. Sixty-five percent say they agree with the phrase "I most enjoy buying practical and sensible things." Only 20 percent say they "most enjoy buying things that are luxuries." <p>What's more, the time-honored work ethic still prevails, even in these modern times: 59 percent view hard work as the best way to get ahead. Only 34 percent cite intelligence as a crucial ingredient to success. Guts, street smarts, ruthlessness -- the values associated with the '80s -- lag far behind. <p>One might conclude that if we are averse to spending freely and still see ourselves as hardworking, we might also be more careful with money than ever. But relatively few Americans feel confident about handling their personal finances. (In fact, just 19 percent were able to correctly identify the Dow Jones Industrial Average as the combined prices of the stocks of 30 major companies on a given day.) It's as if people want to keep money at arm's length. Fifty-one percent of the country manages its money by merely dumping it in a savings or checking account. Only 5 percent of the country holds five or more different investments.<p>"(It) gives me some kind of content to remember how painful it is sometimes to keep money, as well as to get it," wrote Samuel Pepys, the 17th-century English diarist. "This morning came home my fine camlet cloak, with gold buttons, and a silk suit.... I pray God to make me able to pay for it." Today, on the cusp of the 21st century, our sentiments have scarcely strayed. The following profiles unlock the secrets behind the pain and the pleasure, the give and the get, that are inherently intertwined in the constant, conflicted greening of America.

THE PROFILES<p>
THE HUNTER<p>Percent of population: 13<p>Profile: Takes risk to get ahead<p>Patron saint: Bill Gates<p>Hunters, with a mean income of $44,000, earn more than any of the other money types. They are characterized by an aggressive attitude toward making, spending, and investing money, optimizing their financial resources every chance they get. Hunters describe themselves as "a bit extravagant." They unabashedly desire money, equating it with happiness, freedom, achievement, and power. And most of them have no reservations about talking about how much they have.<p>Hunters are by no means alone in placing such a high emotional value on the dollar, but they are distinguished by a general ability to make money; two thirds of them feel comfortable choosing investments, compared with barely half the public at large. More than any of the other money personalities, hunters believe that intelligence and guts are the keys to financial success. <p>True to their aggressive natures, hunters tend to have comparatively unsettled personal lives. After the strivers, they are the second most likely to be divorced. Those hunters who are married say they tend to win arguments over money but lose most others. Hunters are most likely to say their spouse calls the shots when they argue about disciplining the children. They are also most likely to be unable to resolve fights over their romantic or sex lives.<p>Take Jerald C., a 28-year-old who lives outside Denver, where he is an accountant for his family's manufacturing company. When it comes to money, he is confident about his abilities. "I'm definitely competent," he says. He doesn't understand why anyone wouldn't invest his or her money. "I can make more that way," he says. "I can't see letting it just sit in a bank in a savings account." Jerald reads the business section of the Denver Post thoroughly and faithfully, diligently investigating any potential investment possibilities. He is comfortable with risk, being of the belief that even a loss can be a gain when it comes to his long-term financial future. "Basically," he says, "it makes you a little wiser." When Jerald thinks about the future, he worries about things that he feels he can't control, such as his health, but he says he never spends a lot of time worrying about money. <p>Randy W. is an antiques dealer in his mid-30s who lives in Southern California. He and his wife run the kind of ragtag operation that borders on being a junk shop, but they often act as if they were trading pork-belly futures in the commodities pit at the Chicago Board of Trade. Just recently, Randy spotted a valuable collection of comic books and impulsively paid $3,500 for them.<p>"I know they're valued at over $11,000," Randy says. "I mean, who in their right mind wouldn't buy 'em? There's some things that are just obvious. When you can pay a nickel for something and then turn around and sell it for a dime, you should just buy it. You should double it or triple it. And if you can't sell it triple, then come down a little bit."<p>And then comes a little wrinkle of guilt. Like many hunters, Randy thinks of himself as extravagant, a feeling that might be a result of overzealousness in some members of this segment. He says, "I feel like I blow a little more than I should."<p><p>THE GATHERER<p>Percent of population: 19<p>Profile: Better safe than sorry<p>Patron saint: Warren Buffett <p>Primarily middle-aged, and with a mean income of $35,000 (just $1,000 more than the public at large), the gatherers make up the largest segment of the population. As investors, they tend to be conservative, and they subscribe to traditional values: Women shouldn't pay on dates. Friends shouldn't borrow from friends. While the gatherers are more likely than any of the other six segments of the population to have three or more investments, they also believe it is inappropriate to desire money too intensely. In fact, it is just this attitude toward money that makes the gatherers seem selfish. Forty percent describe themselves as "miserly but wise." Fully 100 percent are looking out for themselves when it comes to money.<p>Though gatherers are often tight with their hard-earned money, they are very comfortable with their ability to manage it. They know how money works, how to use it, and how not to use it, and they use it as they please. When 47-year-old Pamela S. speaks about money, she does so with a matter-of-factness that makes her sound like a bank president about to retire from a long and blissfully uneventful career. "I have no worries about money," she says. She does not live a lifestyle of either the rich or the famous, yet she and her husband, a physician in suburban Rochester, New York, consider themselves well-off. "I know I can afford to buy the things that I want," Pamela says. It's easy for her to feel this way; she is completely debtless. "We've paid off our house," she says. "We have no loans and only two credit cards, and we pay those at the end of every month. My husband and I are probably more traditional than most people in that we pay cash for everything." <p>Gatherers represent the mainstream of the American financial psyche. Modest, slightly puritanical, theirs are the values of Main Street, U.S.A. Of all the money personalities, they feel the most comfortable buying a new car, financing a house, or filing an insurance claim. But computers make them nervous. Fifty-one percent say they are uncertain about how to use one. <p>When it comes to money, gatherers are the voice of reason, archetypal of the anxiously conservative American investor. Thirty percent own stocks or bonds, as opposed to 23 percent of the rest of the country, but they are hardly gamblers. For them, money is security. They think of themselves as competent in financial matters, disciplined with spending; 73 percent of them agree that "with money it is more important to plan for the future than to enjoy what I have now." Eighty-three percent of gatherers -- more than any other money personality -- claim to be satisfied with the size of their paycheck.<p>But risk averse often translates into overcautious. Ninety-six percent of this group believes that it is better to be safe than sorry when it comes to making financial decisions. The gatherer tends to equate money with a sense of self, a sense of security. "A lot of people," says Northwestern University adjunct professor Laura Wimbish, "feel they've got to hold on tightly to their money for fear they'll never be able reproduce it if it all disappears."<p><p>THE PROTECTOR<p>Percent of population: 16<p>Profile: Puts others first<p>Patron saint: Paul Newman<p>After the hunters and the gatherers, the protectors are the most financially savvy group in the U.S. But protectors don't feel tied to money the way the first two groups do; they are much more likely to be concerned with other people. Money is simply a means of shielding others -- spouses, children, parents, or friends. <p>Seventy-five percent of protectors say that it is right to think of other people before yourself in financial matters. To them, money does not represent power or freedom but security. Protectors are predominantly women. They tend to be college educated. Of all the groups, they are the most likely to be married and least prone to divorce. Protectors are twice as likely to have worked for a political party as any of the other money personalities, suggesting a general sense of civic-mindedness. They are also among the most well-off of any of the segments. At $36,000, their mean income is second only to hunters'.<p>Around the house, the protectors tend to be pliable. Though they call the shots when it comes to housekeeping, they concede to their spouses many decisions about shared activities: what TV show to watch, where to go on vacation, which friends to spend time with, and even when to have sex. <p>Protectors don't gamble with their money. Michelle S., a 20-year-old secretary who lives with her husband and their children in a small town in Ohio, has half her money in stocks, half in a savings account. "We kind of play it safe and a little risky," she says. Like most protectors, she sees money as a means to buy security for her family. When she shops, she buys what she needs and what her children want. "It means a lot more to me to see the smile on my daughter's face than to have something of my own," she says. Any variation in her shopping pattern makes her feel guilty. "If I buy for myself, I think, 'Gosh, I shouldn't have bought that. I could have bought two things for my daughter.'" <p>Since protectors are not emotionally tied to their money, they do not equate financial success with self-worth. They are among the least likely to see work as anything more than a means to make money. "It wouldn't be such a big deal if anything happened with either of our jobs," Michelle says. Nor do protectors see financial failure as a source of embarrassment. Of all the groups, they are the least likely to be upset if they find out they've paid too much for something. <p><p>THE SPLURGER<p>Percent of population: 14<p>Profile: Travels first class or not at all<p>Patron saint: Elizabeth Taylor<p>Splurgers are the most self-indulgent of the seven money personalities. They have the fourth-highest mean income -- $33,000 -- and they are the second youngest of the segments; their mean age is 40. They are three times as likely as the overall public to say that they'd rather buy a luxury item -- whether or not they can afford it -- than a practical one. Though their chief monetary goal is financial independence, they are nonetheless risk averse, confining most of their investments to CDs and savings accounts. Second only to the hunters, 65 percent of the splurgers expect to be a lot or somewhat better off five years from now. <p>The splurger, in fact, most resembles the hunter -- but without the financial acumen. Splurgers don't consider the accumulation of money as an end in itself. Money is simply a means -- a means to consumption. Splurgers tend to be self-centered and somewhat impractical. They are the most likely to believe that similar economic backgrounds are a key ingredient to a successful marriage and most likely to disagree with the phrase "It's more blessed to give than to receive." Perhaps that explains why splurgers are the most likely to lose domestic arguments about whether to spend or save money. <p>Two thirds of this group say they are apt to buy really nice things regardless of how much they need them, in comparison to 36 percent of the general public. Splurgers consider themselves indulgent rather than practical, and they are almost twice as likely as the general public to agree with the statement "I try to go first class most of the time in dinners, traveling, clothing, cars." They are also almost twice as likely to agree with the statement "I am more impressed by someone who appreciates quality and buys only the very best." <p>Take Diane W., a 38-year-old who lives in a suburb of Denver. To her, having more money primarily means being able to take more vacations. It means taking time off from her work at a local printing plant and from her housework and taking a long trip with her husband and children. Waterskiing in Hawaii sounds nice to her at the moment, but in the past she's been to places all over the country. "I just want to get out of the grind, out of the school-homework routine," she says. "I want to get to actually enjoy something, something out of the ordinary." Diane feels she has a tendency to spend a little more than she should or than she actually has -- as a rule, she travels first class, for example -- but in matters of travel, she doesn't see any way around this. She'd rather not go than go economy. She's beginning to think about reeling in some of her shopping habits, especially since she doesn't always stick to necessities. "I usually spend money the way I want," she says, "whether I need something or not." <p>Chris F., an office clerk, has three children and her share of credit card bills. Nevertheless, when she sees a dress she has to have, well, she has to have it. "Some people will buy just clothing, for example,'' she says. "They'll go buy a remake of something. And I would rather have the something."<p><p>THE STRIVER<p>Percent of population: 13<p>Profile: Controlled by money<p>Patron saint: Tonya Harding<p>More than any of the other segments, the striver is controlled by money. Ninety-two percent say that money makes the world go round. They have the lowest mean income of any of the groups, $29,000, but even if a striver has money, it's doubtful that he or she will have a very healthy relationship with it. Eighty-five percent of strivers say they would feel "just terrible" losing money in the stock market. (By contrast, only 33 percent of the hunters, who accept risk as integral to financial success, are greatly upset by losing money on an investment.)<p>Strivers are twice as likely as the average American to think of money as power and, in turn, happiness. Almost 90 percent believe that one can never have too much money. Seventy-four percent will never be happy making only an average amount of money. And yet only 12 percent of the strivers consider themselves well informed on financial matters. While 51 percent of Americans describe themselves as basically competent with investments, only 33 percent of strivers feel the same way. The chances that a striver attended college are relatively low, and the lack of education puts strivers at a disadvantage. Fifty-eight percent do not know how to use a computer; 51 percent are at a loss when it comes to knowing how to finance a house.<p>At home, strivers tend to be domineering. Of all the groups, they are most likely to win fights over how the house is kept. They dictate the family's social life, and they tend to get their way in disagreements over their sexual and romantic lives. At the same time, they are the segment most likely to agree that sex takes a back seat to money at some point in a marriage. To a striver, all important household issues come down to money and who controls it: A striver thinks that the spouse who brings in the most money should call the shots. Needless to say, strivers are the most likely to be divorced. Those who are single tend to think that if they were better off, their romantic lives would go more smoothly.<p>Strivers are jealous of people who have money. Three quarters of them agree that "wealth makes people more attractive than they would be otherwise," as opposed to 15 percent of the general public. They tend to attribute financial success to luck or connections.<p>"Some rich people don't know they have money," says Louis A., a retired printer in Philadelphia. "They want to push their money around and expect better treatment, and I don't have a lot of time for that."<p>Nonetheless, strivers marvel at the success of others, even while they rail against those with money. Joann S. lives in Detroit, where she is an accountant for a small company. She works hard, coming home late every day -- she barely has enough time to take care of her daughter -- but the payoff she expects from all her labor never seems to come. In fact, everything seems to work against her. "People who have the wealth don't deserve it, and I think they are foolish with it," she says. She thinks the only reason she isn't richer is that she doesn't have the right connections. "I'm not political enough," she says. "I don't have any friends with any power."<p>Like the splurgers, the strivers are not savers. Says Elizabeth P., a 42-year-old grocery clerk in Pennsylvania, "I was born poor, and when I go out of this world, I'm going to die poor. I'm not one of these people who works their ass off and puts money in the bank so their kids can fight over it. I'm going to enjoy it myself while I'm alive."<p><p>THE NESTER<p>Percent of Population: 14<p>Profile: Needs just enough to take care of self<p>Patron Saint: Roseanne Conner<p>Of all the money personalities, the nesters -- mean income $31,000 -- are the least engaged with their financial lives. They aren't tied up emotionally with their money, nor are they very savvy with it. Their concerns mostly begin and end with themselves and their families. Like the protectors, nesters have pragmatic financial values, but where protectors primarily view money as security, this group translates financial well-being into comfort, simply because they seem to worry less about security. They think in terms of fulfilling their immediate needs. Nesters may not want much, but what they have, they see as theirs. Only 9 percent of nesters see money as something to leave for their heirs. Eighty-three percent of nesters believe that one has to look out for oneself when it comes to money. Only 60 percent of the general population shares that view.<p>"I don't want to sound greedy," says Kathie P., a 38-year-old secretary and mother of two in a small town outside of Pasadena, California. "I just want enough to get by." When she pushes herself to think extravagantly, she thinks of maybe being able to take a trip somewhere and not once having to worry about how much money she is spending. She doesn't think extravagantly often, though. "I don't want anything outrageous," Kathie says. She couldn't really care less about investments or finances much beyond the bills and her checkbook. "I just kind of go with the flow," she says. Despite this attitude of financial laissez-faire, Kathie believes that the only person who can help her make it through her happily modest existence is herself. "Nobody else is going to do it for you," she says.<p>Nesters are the least likely to make getting ahead a top priority, the least likely to agree with the statement "How much money I have says a lot about who I am," and the least likely to agree that a person can never be too rich. Two thirds of them are dissatisfied with their salary, but this discontentment is not driven by ambition. Just the opposite, in fact. Nesters are the segment most likely to quit work altogether were they to hit it big in the lottery. They are apt to have life insurance, but only 11 percent have three or more investments, the lowest of any of the money personalities. And money is not something they want to talk about. They are slightly less likely than the average American to be comfortable discussing their financial situation. The nester just wants to be left alone: 74 percent of nesters say that how they spend their money is nobody's business but their own.<p>"Money doesn't matter to me," says Dora G., a 28-year-old waitress who lives in Colorado. "It doesn't even matter when it comes to relationships. It doesn't matter to me if someone I'm dating has little money."<p>"It takes money to get along, but the Lord has blessed me with enough to get along," says Emma H., 82, who lives in a farming community in Texas. "I'm just happy to be comfortable. I feel like I wouldn't spend no more than I had to." She has lived her entire life in this fashion, and, like many nesters, she doesn't have much, but what she has is hers. "We don't like to have a lot of debt," she says. "We try to stay away from that as much as we can."<p><p>THE IDEALIST<p>Percent of population: 10<p>Profile: There's more to life than money<p>Patron saint: Allen Ginsberg<p>True to their name, idealists are the least materialistic of the money personalities. Accordingly, they have the second-lowest mean incomes: $30,000, and they'd be just as happy to make do with less. Money means nothing more than security. It is certainly not something to be trusted or relied upon -- 78 percent of idealists believe that money is the root of all evil. Eighty percent believe that "money means nothing without someone you love to share it with." Idealists most closely resemble nesters, but they are more generous. Nester tend to limit their modest involvement with money to looking out for themselves; idealists simply limit their involvement with money.<p>Consequently, idealists do not live by many hard and fast money rules. They don't link cash and happiness; they are the least likely to agree with the statement "The better my financial life, the better my romantic life." They tend not to think that a successful marriage depends on similar economic backgrounds, that the spouse who brings in the most money should have more power, or that there comes a point in every marriage when money becomes more important than sex.<p>When it comes to making or losing money, idealists are not emotionally involved.  Eighty-four percent report that they'd only be "a little upset" if they lost a lot of money in the stock market. Then again, idealists aren't very likely to put a lot of money into the stock market; only 7 percent own stocks, compared to 14 percent of the population at large. They aren't much more at home in, say, the local Ford dealership. Thirty-three percent of the idealists are uncertain or at a loss when buying a car.<p>"Material things aren't a big thing to me," says Barbara T., 29. "But I guess money is important. I mean, we have kids, and they need food, they need clothes." She is reluctant to acknowledge what she feels is the essential truth about money. "I hate to say it," she says. "But money makes the world go round." If she has money after paying the bills, she thinks of herself as fairly generous. She doesn't always have the money to give, she says. "but when we do -- well, I don't want to sound corny, but I think it's important to give back what the world gives to you." She is impressed with people who have a significant amount of money and yet are practical rather than indulgent with it. Ultimately, she believes that wealth means nothing. "You could have a million bucks, but if you don't have anybody to share it with, it's no fun."<p>When an idealist makes an investment, it's generally a modest one. Only 24 percent have two or more investments. They are the most likely money personality to hold term life insurance policies. Sixty percent have regular savings accounts -- the highest percentage of any of the personality groups. Forty-eight percent have checking accounts -- tying them with the nesters for the lowest percentage.<p>But in the end, idealists stand apart from the rest of the country in large part because of their almost complete indifference to the dollar. Forty-five percent of idealists say that a doubling of their family's income would not make them any happier -- a higher percentage than any other segment. "As long as we're good and healthy -- that's all that matters to me," says Marie F., a housewife and mother of three in rural Tennessee. If she won a million dollars, she doesn't think it would change her life at all. "I'd put it all back for the kids' education," she says. J.B., a 69-year-old retired engineer who lives in Georgia, concurs: "Money's a necessity," he says. "That's basically all that I look at it as. I don't feel like it gives a person any amount of power."<p><p>

Small caps could underperform for an entire year<p>Nobody knows precisely why the January effect exists, but every year, almost without fail, small-capitalization stocks rally from mid-December until late January, leaving their bigger brethren in the dust. In only 6 of the last 68 years have small-cap stocks failed to outperform large-cap stocks in that period, notes Claudia Mott, small-cap analyst for Prudential Securities.<p>Well, make that 7 out of 69.<p>It's not that small-company stocks did badly in January; it's just that they were supposed to do better. The major small-cap indexes, the Russell 2000 and the Wilshire Small Cap, turned in gains of 3.1 percent and 3.0 percent respectively in January. The S&P 500 returned 3.4 percent and the Dow 6.2 percent<p>Small-cap stocks didn't beat the Dow last year (see chart), but they did outperform the S&P, which badly lagged both the 30 Industrials and the Russell. But the absence of a strong January effect bodes ill for the sector in 1994. In five of the previous six years without a strong January effect, Mott points out, small caps lagged the S&P. In 1989, the last time a year opened without a January effect, small caps returned 8.1 percent, a far cry from the more than 25 percent returned by the S&P that year. Mott isn't willing to say this marks the end of the small-cap rally without seeing a further rise in valuations and a decay of fundamentals. In fact, she's projecting extremely strong first-quarter profits for her sector. Still, history would make anyone cautious.      <p><p>

Sociologist Barry Glassner focuses on midlife career changes as a defining event for many baby boomers<p>By Suzanne Costas<p>Psychologists and psychiatrists have long claimed that the midlife crisis is about death anxiety or facing mortality. Sociologist Barry Glassner argues that, to a greater extent than previous generations, today's 35- and 40-year-olds are acting out this issue in their careers. For baby boomers, the fear of extinction takes the form of worrying about spending their remaining years in unfulfilling jobs. Many are panicking and turning their work lives upside down.<p>For his just-published book Career Crash (Simon & Schuster), Glassner talked to 400 highly successful, college-educated people who had suddenly lost or left their jobs. Glassner is chair of the sociology department at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. He was interviewed by Suzanne Costas, a senior writer at Worth.<p>
Q: What was the most startling discovery you made in the course of your research?<p>A: A couple of things surprised me. First, that career crashes are a predictable crisis in baby boomers' lives. Among people who luck out, who don't have career crashes themselves, few don't experience a crash secondhand, through a spouse. Second, I found that people don't go in any single direction when they crash. Before I started the research, I assumed there would be certain professions that everyone was moving out of and certain ones everybody was moving into. But for every lawyer who goes back to school to become a teacher, I found a teacher who was becoming a lawyer. A third big surprise was the preponderance of voluntary career crashes. More career crashes occur because people get to a point where they're miserable with what they're doing. They don't want to spend the next 40 years of their lives that way. The previous generation's professionals had pretty predictable career patterns. For baby boomers, that's not the case. A fourth surprise was that job leavers are often more unhappy, in the short run, than job losers. The person who loses a job expects to be miserable, but a person who has said, "Okay, now I'm going after my dream," is more prone to disappointment.<p>
Q: Why did you choose to examine the career crashes of baby boomers?<p>A: Actually, I wanted study why so many baby boomers are depressed the rate is about four times higher than for people who are over 65. When I started interviewing people, it came leaping out that what they were upset about was their work lives. Again and again they talked about how dissatisfied and depressed they were about this. I'm not suggesting that that's what causes these high rates of depression but rather that a source of widespread disenchantment and psychological pain is displeasure and discomfort with a career.<p>
Q: Are these people blaming their jobs for problems that a career change alone couldn't possibly solve?<p>A: I spent quite a while investigating that possibility. But that's not what was going on, usually. Their family lives and relationships were reasonably happy. But many thought if they really put their talents to the right use, they'd get out of the work world what they thought all their lives they were going to get out of it. For some that meant a lot of money. For others it was doing good or doing something creative. The entrepreneurs' stories were the most moving. They'd worked things out in great detail, and then they failed. Not only did they not make a lot of money, they went bankrupt. The good news is that most people I interviewed were better off after the career crash not right away, maybe, but before very long.<p>
Q: Some readers may think these people going through a career crisis are basically whiners and spoiled brats.<p>A: That's the most negative thing I've heard so far, and I've heard it from employers especially. They say, "If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen," or "A job isn't supposed to be fun." My response: This generation was promised fulfillment. They were promised by their parents and the media that their lives would be a constant learning experience, ever more progressive and rewarding. And the fact is that most work situations  most careers, these days  don't offer that. They don't even offer career advancement.<p>
Q: Your book is fundamentally similar to Gail Sheehy's 1976 best-seller, Passages. What does your work contribute that's new?<p>A: Using her term, I would say the career crash is a major passage, in many cases the major passage in midlife for this generation. The midlife crisis back then was characterized by concern about trying to be young again. For a lot of men, it meant leaving their wives for younger women. For many women, it meant coping with the so-called empty nest when the last of the children left home. But the baby boomers have now shifted the focus.<p>
Q: Is it possible that the career change you're talking about is just the chosen vehicle for this generation to go through a midlife crisis and is otherwise fundamentally no different?. <p>A: A generation gets to midlife, or any other stage in life, at a particular time in history. When the previous generation got there, the sexual revolution was going on, the whole touchy-feely, human-potential movement was going on, interest rates were going through the ceiling. Well, what's going on in the world as the baby boomers reach midlife? The work world is collapsing. There's a downsizing revolution. Corporate ladders are shrinking; the rungs above have disappeared. The main social changes and upheavals that are going on when you reach midlife have a lot to do with what your midlife crisis is about.<p>
Q: Some might suggest that the real challenge is to recognize that life is hard and that not all work situations will be perfect.<p>A: A very important step is to abandon what I call the 
three-S measure of success status, success, and security. That's what we're really talking about here. People think if they just get the right status, the right level of security, the right salary or income, their work lives will be wonderful. But then they have a conflict with someone at work, or the job gets boring again. So the real task during a career crash is to discover what is really important to you in life, to set things up in the next career or to focus on getting things that really make a difference. Some, for instance, figured out that what really matters is being able to use a talent they had neglected "I'm really good working with people, and I have a job where I never work with anybody."<p>But there are price tags. Often the price is lower income, which means a reduced lifestyle. Or it means relocating. And that cuts both ways. I interviewed a fair number of people who realized only during a career crash that they hated where they lived and knew there were places where they'd be happier. That's key. It's not about deciding you're going to go up in the hills and live off the land that usually doesn't work. Rather they may move where they can afford a bigger house or not have to commute. They plan their next career move based on things like that which, of course, you're not supposed to do in America. Career moves are based on making more money and having a more prestigious title.<p>
Q: So those who engaged in self-examination benefited most from their career crisis.<p>A: Yes. They focused on what really matters to them and what they have to offer, and then they put those two things together. It's like making an investment. If you do it well, do it wisely, you come out ahead.<p>

						Like many of the articles in Worth, "The Commuter" is a story about finding creative solutions to financial dilemmas. But it also represents a departure for the magazine, since this story is fiction. Nicholas Wren, the quintessential man on a train, earns a decent living but dreams of a better life for himself and his family--a goal he plans to achieve through a brilliant but risky stock play.<p>Colin Harrison, 33, is a senior editor at Harper's magazine, a self-proclaimed "financial junkie," and the author of two highly acclaimed novels, Break and Enter and Bodies Electric. Like his novels, this story, his first in a national magazine, is informed by an acute understanding of how the real world works--and the price we all pay to live in it. What follows is part one of "The Commuter"; the conclusion will appear next month. <p>By Colin Harrison<p> Buffalo grass, nicholas wren told himself as he gazed out of the commuter train at the gray doomscape of the Bronx. He'd definitely go with the buffalo grass. It wasn't an easy choice--there was much to be said for the Kentucky bluegrass variety called Baron, or Citation II, a perennial ryegrass resistant to aphids and webworms. Around him the other riders rattled their newspapers and flipped through printouts and memos as the train flashed past block after block of abandoned buildings. No, he decided, it had to be buffalo grass--soft, apple-green buffalo grass that formed a tight sod, needed little water, and grew to a maximum of six inches and then stopped! The stuff had been developed by some obscure grass genius at Texas A&M. He'd mow only three times a summer! He pictured, what--two, three acres? Lisa and the kids, Frisbees, maybe a dog. He'd get out there on a John Deere and remember the bold wager that had catapulted them out of the city. It was a bet, in fact, that he was going to place today. <p>Outside in the February cold, graffiti ribboned along the walls next to the tracks, continuing even into the tunnels. The train car was dirty and overheated, with a mood of futility--a hundred-odd souls hurtling toward the very same moment 24 hours hence. Did they suffer the same pressing anxiety he and Lisa felt? For the last few years, the two of them had entertained the idea of fleeing their cramped condo 30 minutes north of New York City and moving back to Lisa's hometown outside of Cincinnati--a place where someone could buy a five-bedroom Victorian for around $160,000 and actually know the mailman by name. But now there was a certain urgency; there had been an incident two weeks ago--a nasty incident--and Lisa was desperate to leave. <p>He and his wife had realized, of course, that the entire metropolitan area was slipping into barbarity. Only a month ago, three youths in ski masks had blundered onto the very train Nicholas was riding, the 7:48 from Croton-Harmon, a mere two cars forward of him, shot one round of a 9-mm pistol into the roof, and nervously relieved a dozen riders of their money and watches before fleeing. And one of the secretaries at Belton Associates, the engineering consulting firm where Nicholas worked, had been brutally raped in her apartment and was now on indefinite leave.<p>But none of this had prepared them for what had happened to Lisa outside the Grand Union. How could it? The van had bumped the back of her Camry, and when Lisa looked up in her rearview mirror, she hadn't liked what she saw. No, not a bit. The men were already out of the van, she'd later told Nicholas tearfully, and they looked strangely angry, considering they'd hit her, and anyway, what were two men in a rust-eaten van doing in a suburban shopping center? She'd shifted into first gear and hit the gas, but even so, one of them got the passenger door open, a hand and gun coming in first, with the words "Give it up, bitch, give it--" But he was a second too late, and the Camry kicked him back against the rear door. By then Lisa was going 40 miles an hour across the parking lot. <p>Later, as they'd examined the damage to the rear bumper, Nicholas had seen the fear in Lisa's face. The van incident was just the latest proof that they were living in a landscape of bad possibility, that the hour was late. It was time to go.<p>There was one problem: money. Perhaps $8,000 for a mover, plus six months' living expenses while he and Lisa found work, a minimum of $30,000. If, as he hoped, he started his own consulting business, he'd need another $20,000, at least. And because banks would be less eager to lend to people without jobs, they'd need a sizable down payment on a house--say $50,000. This came to $108,000, which they could scrape up. Barely. But there were other costs: Lisa would insist on busing the kids into the private school she'd attended in Cincinnati. Two kids, two tuitions--another $18,000 a year, and Nicholas needed that money now, in case it took a while to get a business rolling. <p>But this wasn't all: Lisa's mother--lucid, stoic, and 68 years old--suffered from diabetes. She had lost one foot already, and was sliding as the months went by. This was another reason Lisa wanted to move back to Ohio soon. Her mother, whose assets amounted to $11,000 and a small farmhouse with a rotting roof, would soon need skilled nursing care on a daily basis, which Medicare wouldn't pay for. If they could unload the farmhouse (for maybe $35,000, if anyone was foolish enough to buy it), her mother might eventually qualify for Medicaid. Yet there were more problems: The local nursing home, a private facility ten miles away run by a large Texas-based corporation, had a six-year waiting list for Medicaid patients. But Nicholas had heard that if one was willing to fork over $28,000 a year--cheap by New York standards --then this outfit would smile and miraculously find a bed. The other option was a private-duty nurse--three hours a day at $22 an hour was $66 a day, or about $24,000 a year. Which didn't include the time and expense of trips to a dialysis center every other day and which meant that Lisa could probably not work full time. <p>When it was all said and done, Nicholas figured he needed at least $200,000 in hand if they were going to move to Ohio. Their net worth was more than that, but if they couldn't unload their condo (built in the mid-'80s with such greedy haste that the wallboard was actually falling off its framing), then the move was just about impossible. Their condo village, Nicholas had found out, had nine units more or less identical to theirs for sale. Three had been on the market for more than 18 months. People hated condos now, knew they were a bum deal. To make matters worse, Nicholas and Lisa's place needed perhaps $4,000 or $5,000 in work to make it ready for the market. If he couldn't sell the condo quickly, there was no other source of $200,000 cash. Certainly not his and Lisa's salaries. Her part-time work in a small local law firm brought in $26,000, and he was due to make $88,000 this year. While $114,000 had once sounded ample, it now provided just enough for a mortgage payment, a vacation each summer, and perhaps new bikes for the kids every year or two. <p>And what about making money in the stock market? The averages had gone up through most of '93, but Nicholas felt the market was dicey in even the best of times. Last June, one of the personal-finance magazines had recommended Nike stock at $69 a share. The projected 18-month return? Forty-seven percent. "A terrific buy," the text had trumpeted and so Nicholas bought 100 shares. But when he'd finally dumped the stock in the first week of October, it was down to 451/2. He'd lost only $2,300, but the experience just confirmed his belief that the market was in a strange time. Each new high brought the voices of doom from the financial press, and while he wasn't sure he agreed with them, the market felt choppy and capricious, and he knew that any play he could make had better be specific--not an attempt to time the market or bet on interest rates (though he had predicted November's carnage in the bond market). As for commodities, it was a devil's game he'd never played. He'd once read that the price of corn was affected by no fewer than 14 unrelated factors, including the price of fertilizer and who was in power in Moscow.<p>What he needed was to make money in some way that departed from the honest but meager buy-and-hold strategy. And he needed it soon. The family budget didn't have much breathing room--nothing left over for, say, Broadway tickets or anything that might make Lisa feel that her life was the one she wanted. She was great with the kids, dutiful toward him, but he could see that inwardly she felt that her existence had become forgettable. And as he'd discovered bitterly only a week before, her one avenue of solace did not include him.<p>After arriving in grand central, nicholas walked from the train toward his office on 47th Street--just another man in a winter coat and scarf. In the lobby he ran into Hal Gruber, the senior vice-president.<p>"You remember we've got the monthly meeting," Gruber said.<p>"Ten o'clock."<p>"I got the first readings on that Culver City location," Gruber said, raising his eyebrows.<p>"What was it, 1,000, 1,200?"<p>"Eighteen-fifty."<p>"Will they shield?" Nicholas asked.<p>"They don't know. The owner's daughter works 16 feet from the highest reading."<p>Belton Associates had pioneered the growing specialty of electromagnetic-field consulting, one of four firms with national reputations. Every few weeks another office building around the country was discovered to harbor a cancer cluster among its employees, and scientific evidence increasingly suggested that electromagnetic fields created by power cables within the buildings might be the cause. There was, for example, the Ford House Office Building in Washington, D.C., which had 12 cases of cancer, five of them brain tumors, among its 500 employees. Or the cluster of brain-tumor deaths at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in Missouri. And now, female emergency medical technicians in New York City were complaining that their <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a> 800 MHz radios were affecting their menstrual cycles. <p>All this bad news was good news for Belton Associates, which consulted with companies that were designing new buildings, telling them how offices should be laid out in respect to phone lines, transformers, cables, and electrical-service equipment. The firm also conferred with companies that suspected the potential for EMF health problems among their employees. Sometimes electrical equipment could be shielded, at other times offices could be reconfigured, and occasionally, if EMFs reached high enough levels, companies were forced to abandon buildings to avoid litigation by their employees.<p>It was Nicholas's responsibility to coordinate and oversee Belton's nine technical teams as they moved through various consulting projects nationally. He knew where they were and the severity of the EMF problems in each location--worst in raised-floor buildings with huge power requirements to run air conditioning, computers, phones, lights. In his five years at Belton, he'd gradually discerned an intriguing pattern. So intriguing he hadn't mentioned it to anyone else at the firm.<p>The companies most disrupted by EMF tended to be in office buildings built between 1978 (after it became clear that new buildings would have as many computers as people, thereby requiring higher power levels) and 1989 (when design-phase EMF shielding became more typical). Most commercial buildings erected in this time were service companies dealing with information--banks, insurance offices, 800-number phone operations--and, Nicholas had observed, when operations crucial to the company's cash flow were affected by EMF problems, something happened: Profits dropped. The effect was most pronounced in smaller companies that were forced to heavily modify or move out of their chief offices. <p>Because the companies did not want to alarm their employees, they would generally proceed quietly with the office closings, often attributing them to other causes--say, restructuring or consolidation--with the result being that the analysts who followed the stock sometimes didn't know of the disruption until weeks or months after it had occurred. On several occasions, Nicholas had watched in amazement as stock pickers touted certain small-cap companies that were about to take huge hits to their cash flows. Locked into their spreadsheets, pressured to issue buy and sell recommendations on stocks every day, the last thing they'd know about would be what was actually happening at the company. <p>But if he knew a company was in trouble, then he could short the stock. He'd merely borrow a certain number of shares of the company, immediately sell those shares, and then wait for the stock to drop to a certain price, at which point he'd buy back the same number of shares and return them to the lender, pocketing the difference between the proceeds from the sale of borrowed stock and the cost to replace it.<p>The difficulty, of course, was that he couldn't trade on information he knew about Belton's client companies--that was insider trading. (And when he thought about that, invariably the theme song to Cops would pipe into his head: "Bad boy! Bad boy! What you gonna do, what you gonna do when they come for you?") So he dutifully read the industry publication that came to his office every month, a newsletter with dense columns of minuscule type that updated the latest research, hoping to spot a small, publicly traded company with EMF troubles. Several prospects had appeared, but he'd discarded them as shorting possibilities--the affected operations weren't critical enough, other positive profit news would counteract the EMF effect, or other negative news would surpass the EMF effect. Sooner or later an opportunity would come along--it had to.<p>Meanwhile, the "Ohio scenario," as Nicholas referred to it, had become increasingly desirable over the last few months, and he'd realized that if a shorting opportunity came along, he'd better have some money ready. In fact, considering what he wanted to do he'd need every dime. He and Lisa's regular savings were minimal, under $15,000. But his wife's grandmother had died five years back, leaving Lisa about $19,000, and Lisa had asked him to invest it, which he had, choosing one of the less speculative health-care funds, buying on the fallbacks in price that occurred whenever the media carried a surge of stories on health-care reform. Then the media would become interested in something else and the health-care stocks would climb back. In three years, he'd turned that original $19,000 into $37,000. When the Japanese stock market had dropped off the cliff in '92, he'd waited with fiendish patience, watching the Nikkei average fall into the grave (to 14,309 to be exact), then finally taken all of the $37,000 and bought into a Pacific index fund that same August, just before the Japanese government announced it was going to "fix" its own stock market with various tricks. Fourteen months later he was up 47 percent and gleefully sold out with just over $54,000. <p>But he needed a bigger stake, much bigger. So in October he'd tapped out his credit cards for another $12,000 in cash. The carrying cost on that debt was negligible--less than $200 a month. He also borrowed $65,000 from his mother. That gave him a grand total of $146,000 to play with. Yet this still wasn't enough for the white-knuckle wager he had in mind. So as a final measure, he'd refinanced the condo, hitting the interest-rate cycle close to the bottom at 6.75 percent for a 30-year mortgage. The condo was worth $310,000, and he and Lisa had owed $110,000 on the old mortgage, leaving $200,000 in equity. The bank had allowed him to pull $150,000 out of that, giving him a new mortgage for $260,000, which sounded like a hell of a lot to carry, but at 6.75 percent it was about $2,000 a month--not so bad. "Going to put that money to work?" the bank's lawyer had inquired at the closing. <p>Yes, sir. With the $150,000 from the refi, he now had $296,000. Through the end of the year, he'd funneled each piece of money into his brokerage account as it had been received, and so now all of it, with accumulated interest, was sleeping peacefully at a tooth-rattling 3 percent--a little more than $298,000. It would seem that he could just use this sum to move to Ohio, but that meant carrying the $260,000 condo mortgage while buying a house in Ohio--too much. Nor could he carry the mortgage by renting out the condo, because that was strictly prohibited by the homeowners association. No, the $296,000 could only be understood as a short-term fund with which to leverage more money. All he needed was an opportunity. The fall had trudged along, and the stock and bond markets kept hitting new highs, making him second-guess himself. Had he made a huge mistake? Even the idiots were making money! <p>But then something extraordinarily lucky happened. <p>Just four days before, he'd gone to the annual EMF conference in Miami. By now it was something of a chore yet a good excuse to get away, and Belton Associates picked up the tab. He wasn't a scientist but he was management, and Ralph Belton liked to think that his management people were up on their engineering research. Besides, all of Belton's main competitors would have people there--CrossTek, Crane Associates, Kimmel Engineering.<p>So he'd gone, pinning his name tag to his shirt each morning, attending the presentations of papers, jawboning with the other conferees afterward. On the last day, in the morning session, old Lawrence Davis, Crane's chief engineer, had given his presentation. Davis, whose head radiated wiry red hair, liked to show off the difficult cases he was tackling on behalf of Crane Associates. Nicholas had considered skipping Davis's presentation (instead lying in bed and watching CNN or one of the soft-porn films on the hotel TV), but ever the dutiful soldier, he'd dragged himself down to the hotel's conference center along with about 25 others--most of them engineers. <p>Standing next to the podium and using computer graphics projected on a large screen, Davis sawed on about the usual things: new frequency-measuring equipment, shielding configurations. Nicholas slumped in his chair, letting his mind resonate with the hotel's drumming ventilation system. After dozing off at one point, his head lolling backward, he forced himself to sit up, if only to be polite and appear professional. <p>And that was when he heard old Davis describe the latest instance of his own glory. Crane Associates, Davis boasted, had received a call from a Seattle-area data-processing company, RemoteCount, Inc. The company's processing facility had a grid-pattern EMF with peak measurements of 3,029 mG--a genuinely shocking figure. Davis moved briskly toward the relevant scientific question, but Nicholas got the gist of what had happened: After signing a consulting agreement and performing an initial examination of the premises, Crane Associates had argued to the RemoteCount executives that the company was running a huge litigation risk by continuing to allow its 1,400 employees to work in the building. Shielding of the electrical equipment wouldn't work, according to Davis, for the power grid ran throughout the entire structure, even directly beneath one of the ladies' restrooms. Crane had presented data about brain-cancer latency rates and EMF exposure, Davis went on, the conclusion being that after nine years of operation, the RemoteCount facility was just about to enter a 20-year window of higher probability for a brain-cancer cluster. Davis didn't need to say any more. Nicholas could guess that the RemoteCount executives had consulted their legal counsel about potential liability costs and then, upon getting the estimate, freaked out.<p>At this point, he sat upright in his chair in the auditorium. Assuming that RemoteCount was publicly traded, here was a company that fit his paradigm (key operations affected, information-based) and--and!--presented no insider-trading problem! He was learning about RemoteCount in an open forum! Just 25 sleepy engineers, but open to the public! Advertised in the industry journals! Pay your $1,395 for the three-day conference! They let anyone in! Davis was scratching his scraggly red hair and describing how he planned to tear apart the entire power system of the RemoteCount operation! The company had big, big problems! <p>But wait. When had all this been discovered? From the ninth row of the small auditorium, Nicholas raised his hand.<p>"Yes?" Davis frowned at the interruption. "A question?"<p>"This may be getting a bit ahead, but I'm curious to know whether the situation in Tucson you described earlier would be helpful in evaluating--"<p>"Yes," old Davis blurted, happy that someone was paying such close attention, "yes, we were able to modify the model and apply it directly."<p>"So this Seattle situation wasn't recent?" Nicholas asked slyly from his seat. An open forum! Anyone can attend!<p>Davis frowned. From a scientific point of view, the question was irrelevant. "Oh, no, quite recent," he said, turning back to the screen. "Last week, actually." <p>The information was new! Davis rambled to his conclusion, and then while the rest of the audience shuffled obediently toward the hotel's restaurant for a lunch of overcooked vegetables and soggy fish, Nicholas fled to his room and called Jane Chung, his broker. She confirmed that RemoteCount was public, traded over-the-counter on the Nasdaq. Shortly thereafter she called back, with a certain excitement in her voice: RemoteCount was a thriving data-processing company, deriving all of its income from two sources--sorting out medical-insurance claims and, recently, organizing creditors' claims against large companies that had fallen into Chapter 11. Handling the bankruptcy claims against a major airline, for example, RemoteCount had recently processed no fewer than 357,000 pieces of paper. All of this activity transpired in RemoteCount's huge data-operations center east of Seattle, where, as Davis had said, 1,400 people peered into screens all day long. There was no other facility. It didn't take a genius to figure out that shutting down the building meant RemoteCount could not process claims, which meant that the company could not make any money. RemoteCount's cash flow was about to hit a wall! Of course, the company would be forced to establish some kind of temporary processing center, but it would take weeks--months!--to find such a facility, and more time before a computer network was installed, people transferred, retrained, and so on. <p>But when would the brokers learn of the problem? They certainly hadn't yet, Jane had said, for the stock had floated merrily along at around $47 a share for months, held largely by big West Coast pension funds--Calpers, Oregon Public Employees, Washington State.<p>"The fourth-quarter numbers are out soon," Jane added. "They could start dumping then."<p>"But it could happen sooner, right?"<p>"Conceivably, someone else in that room figured out the same thing you did," Jane said. "You want that, remember. But it means you have to move quickly to borrow the RemoteCount at 47."<p>"There were guys in the room from a lot of small West Coast startups--specialized engineering companies, system-service companies, companies like that."<p>"That supports my point. They could easily be on the pension committee of their company, and they would know if their company held RemoteCount stock."<p>"Maybe they're sitting on some decent profits," Nicholas mused.<p>"Well, the stock has done nicely. It was at 38 a year ago. Somebody's been buying...." Jane was reading. "There's a good future growth feeling about the stock ... but you could say it's overpriced....The p/e is 41, so you could make an argument about it being overpriced."<p>She interrupted herself. "Nicholas, someone at that conference could call the benefits manager at his company tomorrow, telling them RemoteCount has big problems, dump it immediately."<p>"What would happen?"<p>"You'd have the regional pension funds seeing that, getting on the phone, and calling around to ask why, and then maybe the big pensions in New York would catch on, TIAA-CREF, and then the technology funds might--"<p>"How far could it go down?"<p>"That's impossible to answer," she told him. "But I've seen stocks lose half their value in one day. If a few major institutional investors want out, suddenly there's no market to prop up the price." <p>Yes, yes, yes, Nicholas had muttered to himself yesterday on the plane from Miami back to New York, and suddenly there's no market to prop up the price. <p><p>now, in the few minutes before the ten o'clock meeting at Belton started, he closed his office door and called Jane Chung again. "I want to do it," he told her. "I thought about it all night."<p>"How much?"<p>"The whole account, 298 and whatever."<p>"I checked this morning with our stock loan department. We don't have any RemoteCount to loan out. So they'll have to call around, see if they can find some to borrow."<p>"Jane, I'm worried the stock'll drop and I won't--"<p>"Just be patient," she said. "Give me a few hours." There was a pause. "And, hey, you do realize that if we do this and you're wrong, if the stock goes up instead--"<p>"Then I'm screwed. I'm burning thousand-dollar bills."<p>"Yes."<p>"Just find the stock for me, Jane. I'll call you after lunch."<p>At his computer, he did the math one last time. Because of various margin rules, he figured he'd be able to actually borrow about $270,000 worth of RemoteCount stock--at $47 a share, some 5,700 shares --from whatever unsuspecting source was located by Jane's stock loan department. She'd sell the stock for him as soon as it was borrowed, and if all went right, he'd watch RemoteCount's stock begin to drop. The farther the better. Would it start soon? At the bottom, if he could hit it, he'd buy back the 5,700 shares. Every dollar the stock price dropped would generate $5,700 of profit, more or less, after Jane's commissions. If the stock dropped 10 points, $57,000 in profit; 15 points, $85,500, and so on. How far could it go? If RemoteCount lost three months' worth of income, it still had to pay its executives, service its bank debt of $105 million and bond payments, and pay consultants like Crane Associates. Even laying off people cost money. Moreover, the firm might permanently lose business as its clients shifted their accounts to other providers--some of them the newer, low-cost data-processing outfits in the Caribbean, Ireland, places where labor was much cheaper. RemoteCount might not only post a sizable annual loss but be seriously weakened. Any analyst would realize that RemoteCount stock might not pay a dividend in 1994, and that would be another reason to dump it. Who would buy a stock in a company like that? Bottom-fishers, vulture funds. But they would let the stock fall to sickening levels. Could it fall to $10 or even $5 a share? Nicholas pulled out his calculator; if the stock fell to 5, and he sold then, he'd be looking at almost $240,000. Stranger things had happened in life. Those who never wager never win, he reassured himself. Life is a sequence of bets. <p><p>it was after 11:30 when he finally turned his attention to the other matter at hand. His wife was having an affair--sneaking into the city when the kids were in school. He'd discovered it only a week ago, shortly after the van incident in the supermarket lot. She'd forgotten--or chosen not--to erase a phone-machine message before he came home one evening: "Monday at noon," the voice crooned, "I'll be the man with the unlit cigarette and the maroon scarf." Ha. Such wit. Such style. Such an asshole--the self-appreciating voice belonged to Richard Chambers, a former neighbor who'd recently moved back into the city. Chambers was an officer at the Ford Foundation. He drank exotic Kashmiri tea and liked to talk about his collection of African masks. Lisa had always found him charming, and now, no doubt, met him at his apartment, perhaps a hotel. Maybe a different hotel each week, just for thrills. (The excitement in the elevator, the fresh bed.) There'd been signs, of course --yes, he'd been a fool not to see them: the aloof expression on Lisa's face, a renewed interest in wearing high heels. The extra hundred miles or so on the car's odometer each month. Or, most sickeningly, the night they were in bed a month or two back and she'd pinched his nipples while he was on top of her--seemed excited by it. Someone has taught her this, he'd thought. <p>He decided not to confront her just yet; in market-theory terms, he had inside information but was choosing not to act upon it. He didn't blame Lisa, not exactly. Maybe she'd been worrying that despite all their talk about moving to Ohio, they'd never do it, in which case she had stepped outside the marriage for a little excitement. Maybe she figured that they would move to Ohio and she'd better have some fun now. Maybe--aah, maybe he'd let himself go to pot. He was, after all, 30 pounds heavier than when they married, and sometimes when he caught a glimpse of himself in a store window, he was mystified by what he saw: a 37-year-old man in an overcoat, hair receding, face softened by too many lunches at Grand Central's Oyster Bar, too many hours pushing paper. <p>But what to do? Over the weekend, before his trip to Miami, Nicholas had shuffled around the house pondering the question while Lisa was out with the kids. He'd combed through the junk in the basement, staring at his wife's black winter coat in the closet, even sticking his hand in the pocket, finding nothing. He'd seen this situation a couple times with his friends--the wife and husband went through a long agony of confrontation and confession, sometimes breaking up. Such protracted suffering didn't appeal to him, seemed destructive, even. And the hell with therapists. Therapists were consultants, for God's sake, and he knew how useful consultants were.<p>It had occurred to him, wandering the house, peering into the refrigerator, that if he could destroy his wife's relationship with Chambers remotely, then he could avoid a conflagration at home. At the same time, his stock play, a quarter-million dollars out of nowhere if it worked, might get Lisa excited about replanting the family and the marriage in Ohio. Then, staring at a drawer of outgrown baby clothes, an idea came to him. It was clear, it was quick, it was full of emotional violence, and it hinted that Nicholas Wren was a strange and desperate man who might stop at nothing. And, most important, it was perfect for such a fastidious soul as Richard Chambers. <p>He called up Chambers from Miami and asked him to lunch after his return. "I thought we'd better have a little talk," Nicholas said calmly, knowing Chambers would understand why. "Yes, of course," Chambers replied, attempting to sound at ease. "I have a three o'clock meeting. Perhaps I should reschedule...." Nicholas let these words hang there and die. "No," he answered, "I think we'll be done quickly." <p><p>it would be a bit of ugly business, but that made Nicholas happy. Life is a series of bets. Sell Chambers, buy buffalo grass. They'd agreed to meet at Giverney, a quiet out-of-the-way place in the Village. Very elegant. Once inside, past the freshly cut flowers, the girl checking the reservation book was genuinely French and arrogant about her beauty; her scrutiny was frank, for she was deciding whether patrons were to be dumped close to the windows near the street, the restaurant's crass zone of easily pleased tourists, or to be graciously ushered back past stacks of French bread and bottles of sweet after-dinner wines to the quiet enclosed garden court in the back, where bankers quietly delivered the bad news to their clients or Wall Street men enjoyed a discreet lunch with their mistresses.<p>When Nicholas arrived at the restaurant, he told the hostess he preferred the garden. And then looked away. In New York, if you look away, that's the indication you expect no difficulty, that your preference has been expressed and your mind is now on to more important matters. Nicholas was in his good gray suit and a black tie with flecks of red, and the hostess showed him back to the garden.<p>Chambers came in a minute later, a dapper walking stick of a man. Nicholas hated to admit it, but he understood why Lisa found him attractive. Chambers was a studied presence. He had fine features and soft hands. He was a man who'd spent years building his surfaces; he planned his conversations days in advance; he spent a long time choosing shoes; he had a lengthy opinion about American foreign policy toward Haiti. Of course Lisa found Chambers interesting and mysterious; her own husband didn't shave over the weekends, farted to amuse the kids, arrived at the dinner table with house paint on his hands, and had long since lost his manners in bed. <p>He stood and extended his hand as Chambers approached. Sitting down now. Very polite. Suppressed mannerisms, smoothing the tie repetitively, etc. The waiter arrived.<p>"They have a very good steak here," Nicholas said. <p>"We'll both have it then," Chambers agreed heartily. "Despite the impact on the heart."<p>"Despite that, yes."<p>"You've been well?" Chambers offered, with no hint of irony. "The consulting ... the electromagnetic thing prospering?"<p>"Terrific, very good. And the foundation? Giving away millions every day?"<p>"We do have some innovative projects underway, in fact," Chambers answered, a man who dictated too many letters. "We're less prescriptive than in the past, and perhaps we work better with the local officials and citizenry."<p>"Do you get down to Latin America much anymore?" Nicholas asked.<p>"Maybe twice a year now. The larger projects mostly."<p>From there it went to NAFTA, with Chambers dilating on the effects at the village level: acceleration of change--more jobs, less traditional culture. Then, after his soup, Nicholas put down his spoon. "Of course you know that I asked you to lunch here because you're screwing my wife."<p>Silence. Their eyes met. Two men in fine suits. <p>"Yes," Chambers said. "Yes. Well, I--"<p>"No, please, don't say anything more," Nicholas interrupted. "No explanation is necessary. I see your attraction to her--I am her husband, after all."<p>Chambers seemed relieved, yet puzzled. Is this all there would be? his eyes seemed to say. <p>The steak was served, and for a few minutes they busied themselves with that. The knife and fork, the butter on the potato. Then Nicholas slipped his hand into his breast pocket. Chambers appeared alarmed. A gun? No, of course not. They were civilized men. Nicholas pulled out a small white envelope. <p>"If you are going to continue to do what you are doing, I think you should look at these," he said. <p>Chambers waited warily. <p>"You see, I want to hasten your perceptions, Richard." Nicholas slid the envelope across the table. <p>Chambers opened it. Inside was a small stack of photographs. <p>"The first," Nicholas said, "is when Lisa had Tommy."<p>The delivery room at Lexington Hospital. A clinical shot, between the knees, as the baby crowned. In the photo, Lisa was huge; 40 pounds heavier than she was now, her ankles thick, her face bloated (yet Nicholas had thought she was beautiful, truly). Overhead lights reflecting off her kneecaps. The doctor's green gloved fingers could be seen spreading Lisa's labia to reveal something that looked like a wet, whitish tennis ball. <p>"Huh," said Chambers.<p>The next picture was a closeup of Lisa straining as she pushed the baby. Her face was a mask of veins, sickening, magnificent, one eye shut, the other a slit of suffering consciousness. <p>"I took all of these," Nicholas said evenly. "I was there."<p>Chambers turned to the next photo, which, Nicholas knew (for he had carefully arranged the sequence), was taken at a slightly different angle than the first; it showed Lisa straining again, a full body shot, the nurse urging her, the fetus a monstrous rise of belly. Her chin was up in the air and her arms thrust back above her head, gripping the top of the delivery table. Pushing. Pushing for all she was ever going to be worth.<p>"Of course, the first baby is usually more painful," Nicholas said. "Plus this was back labor, the baby pounding the spinal nerve. It was very bad here, actually. Lisa wouldn't take the epidural." <p>Here Chambers paused. He'd been chewing his steak. He swallowed what was in his mouth with uncomfortable awareness and looked up at Nicholas.<p>"She screamed so much she was about to vomit. I told the anesthesiologist to just put in the goddamned needle." <p>The next photo showed the head of the baby outside of the labia, supported by the doctor's hand. The wincing face of the baby was elongated from labor and covered with white gunk from inside the womb. The struggle in the baby's face suggested that the outcome was in doubt; in fact, Tommy had been vigorous from his first breath.<p>Now Chambers twisted his watch around his wrist as if handcuffed by it. <p>"Have a look at the rest," Nicholas said.<p>"Well, I--"<p>"Just look at them, Richard." <p>There were six or seven more photos, and Chambers grimaced with each one: healthy baby being suctioned; umbilical cord; Tommy resting on Lisa's breasts, his face a wrinkled monkey mask that she was kissing; and the last, a shot of Lisa and Nicholas holding the baby together.<p>Chambers slipped the photos back into the white envelope and sucked at his teeth contemplatively. A waiter appeared, offering coffee. No thanks. Some dessert, gentlemen? They declined. Chambers handed back the envelope. <p>"I also have a set for my daughter." Nicholas said, patting his breast pocket. "Tommy was easy, but Sally came out blue."<p>Chambers touched his napkin to his mouth. <p>"Did Lisa ever mention that Sally came out blue?"<p>Chambers shook his head silently.<p>"The umbilical cord was around her neck. They couldn't slip it off. Lisa was frantic, terrified. The doctor had to--" <p>"Okay," Chambers interrupted, a wince flashing across his face. He got the point. There were other possibilities, he seemed to be thinking, there were other women. He appeared to understand that the whole affair could only get messy from now on. He'd not quite imagined the graphic quality--the horror of it. If they had been his children, that might be another matter. The photos had seemed so ... so veterinary.... This was Lisa, this was where--<p>The two men sat in silence. Around them was the tinkle of silverware on plates, the bustle of waiters, the musical hum of conversation. Nicholas knew that he'd won, but he did not feel triumphant. It sickened him that he'd had to do this. The moments when his son and daughter had been born had been the happiest of his life. And now he would always think of this lunch.<p>"So--" Nicholas began, but the waiter arrived with the check. Chambers pulled it toward himself. <p>"I'll take it." He gave a brisk nod that suggested this was the most efficient way to conclude. <p>And that was that. The men left the restaurant separately, Nicholas second. He paused outside at the steps and watched Chambers march away down the narrow street with the brisk step of someone who knows he has just eluded disaster, just sold out at the top of the market.<p><p>uptown, in his office, jane chung's number was busy. He left messages. Had she found the RemoteCount stock? What was happening to the price? He waited, agonized. Finally she called, shortly after four.<p>"Don't worry," she said, "the price didn't move yet. And I actually found the shares. A wirehouse out west, Monroe Securities."<p>"Never heard of them."<p>"It's a house with a small investment bank that specializes in local and regional IPOs. They handled RemoteCount's IPO four years ago."<p>"I don't get it."<p>"They're still sitting on stock they couldn't sell."<p>"Are they suspicious?" he asked.<p>"They might be, but to them it's easy money."<p>"What are the terms?" <p>"The stock is callable at any time. The running fee is 3 percent of average daily market price, calculated and paid monthly."<p>"Three percent a month?"<p>"Yes. Now our house rule is that we must have 10 percent overage in case we have to mark to market."<p>"You mean if the stock goes up and I'm toast."<p>"Right. But I'll put in a buy-stop at 50. That would be about a 6 percent loss."<p>"A mere 17 or 18 thousand dollars."<p>"Well, the math works out a bit differently," Jane said. "You have a little more than $298,000 in your account. I'm setting aside $27,090 for our overage rule, which leaves 271, and I'm setting aside another 3 percent of that--about 8,000--to take care of the Monroe fee."<p>"What am I left with?"<p>"Two sixty-three." <p>He was tired of waiting for the rest of his life to begin. "All right. Do it."<p>"You're sure?"<p>"Yes. Just get that sell order in quick."<p>"You'll send me a letter that directs--"<p>"Already typed," he said. "I'll fax it in about a minute."<p>After Nicholas hung up the phone, he walked down the hallway to the office fax machine, past the usual afternoon chatter: Ewing looked good last night, the new De Niro movie, Clinton making promises. He slipped his letter of instruction into the tray and watched it feed through. For a moment he considered yanking the sheet out of the machine. But he calmed himself. The fax finished. He retrieved the letter and returned to his office. <p>He glanced at his watch and realized he'd better get moving if he wanted to catch the 5:14 home. Right now Lisa would be watching the local news in the kitchen--the murders and fires and scandal. He wondered if she knew him anymore. Perhaps he didn't know himself anymore, except that he was a man pulling on his winter coat in a lighted office in the dark sky high above the street. His dreams had become transsubstantiated into digital pulses that even now were across the city somewhere, moved onward from Jane into another bright current of dreams that itself flowed through another computer, another trader. In time those pulses would come back to him, revealed for what they had become. As nothing--mere expirations of hope. Or as an odd, terrifying, exultant form of energy: Money.<p>The conclusion of "The Commuter" (Part 2) will appear in the March issue of Worth.

A century ago, Horatio Alger assured America's youth that virtue could be rewarded with riches. The myth survives in today's pop culture, but it's not a pretty story. <p>By Richard Todd<p>"There are some boys, as well as men, who cannot stand prosperity." <p>--The World Before Him, 
by Horatio Alger<p><p>When Snoop Doggy Dogg, the militant rap star, was indicted on murder charges a week before his new record, Doggystyle, crested the charts ... when, during the same week, another rapper, Tupac Shakur, was arrested on charges of forcibly sodomizing a woman in a New York hotel room (three weeks after he had been arrested for allegedly shooting two Atlanta cops)--when these two incidents occurred late last fall, it seemed as if culturally we had crossed a dangerous line. The distinction between art and life had collapsed utterly; more to the point, "art" seemed to be inspiring death.<p>You could shrug this off; you could say, "Well, what's so surprising? Rap is to music as murder is to interpersonal relations." But, no, that isn't what most people felt. The (alleged) crimes were shocking. And here is why: These young men had made millions of dollars singing about street life, often advocating violence--but why did they have to go and do it? In a cover story (featuring an attitude-laden photograph of Mr. Dogg), Newsweek expressed the perplexity perfectly, in terms that were all the more meaningful for their banality: "These performers should be classic American success stories: young men of humble origins who through sheer talent and hard work rose to the mansions on the hill."<p>A thorough deconstruction of that sentence would take us deep into American mythology, into our confusion about money and success, and before long it would lead to one figure: the 19th-century writer Horatio Alger Jr. No one reads Alger anymore, but everyone remembers him as a symbol of the American Dream, the rags-to-riches story. His titles alone evoke this stirring notion: Do and Dare, Dan the Newsboy, Fame and Fortune, Frank and Fearless, Tattered Tom, Sink or Swim, Paul the Peddler, Rupert's Ambitions. Alger's--like Snoop Doggy Dogg's or Tupac Shakur's--subject matter was provided by the young men of the street. In a loopy way, not entirely cheerful to contemplate if you believe in progress, Horatio Alger was the Snoop Doggy Dogg of the 19th century. <p>All popular culture is best understood by the lie that it tells, and Horatio Alger is no exception. His lie, though, is more interesting than the one he is generally accused of. We usually take Alger as an apologist for naked capitalism and a staunch believer in the most private of enterprise, the lonely individual succeeding by dint of hard work. We still speak of a spectacular self-made success as a "real Horatio Alger story." Each spring an enterprising businessman receives the Horatio Alger Award at a lavish ceremony in Washington, D.C. For years social historians have rather sniffishly used Alger's once-popular books for boys as an emblem of the worship of success that has supposedly plagued our culture. <p>Poor Alger! He deserves better. Maybe not a whole lot better, because no one would accuse him of being a neglected genius. His work, which has gotten thoughtful attention from only a handful of literary scholars, is not art, and yet it suggests much about our culture--particularly our attitudes toward business and money.<p>The bare-bones plot is almost always the same: A young hero, in straitened economic circumstances, is cheated and mistreated by a corrupt world yet survives without losing his virtue. Material award awaits him, though often it is modest, such as a clerk's job in a countinghouse with brighter prospects ahead. The reward, moreover, tends to occur in the last few pages of the book and to be treated perfunctorily in a happily-ever-after sort of way. Struggling is more than half the fun. The important achievement of the hero is the maintenance of his principles. The novels are all intensely moral stories.<p>The attractive lie for Alger's 19th-century readers--youths and parents alike--seems to have been a sentimental affirmation of the integrity of character in a mean and tawdry world. This message arrived with a particular power because it spoke to the anxiety of the time (an anxiety that has perhaps not entirely vanished from our life).<p>So steeped in the culture of business are we, our thoughts organized in bottom-line language, that we forget how recent a thing the dominance of commerce is in our national life. But 19th-century Americans reeled under the burgeoning of business. Imagine yourself as a small-town American in 1850. Local lads left town with packs on their backs and ended up in the disreputable city; shifty-eyed drummers showed up selling snake oil--was this what was going to happen to our little boy? A historian named Karen Halttunen has chronicled these fears in an excellent little book called Confidence Men and Painted Women, which points out that the 19th century saw the wholesale rise of doubt and distrust in ordinary social relations as we became a rootless and ambitious society. <p>At bottom it was a psychological unease, a fear that the very nature of the self was undergoing some horrible change. If you stayed at home in your little town, you worried that the old virtues had been replaced by a new one called success, and that it was going to elude you. If you ventured forth in search of success, you worried about what you would have to do to achieve it. Who exactly would be the person who would arrive at the end of that perilous journey? Would you have to change utterly to accomplish what you wanted? Was it necessary to participate in the world of artifice and deceit in order to survive?<p>Along came Alger with the deeply comforting answer: No, you could have it both ways. It's not simply that you could "make it"; you could make it without being unmade. Virtue would be rewarded by Providence. But one should be clear that it was indeed Providence and not the "system" that cares for us. Alger, in fact, harbored dark views about the world that was emerging around him, about its materialism and greed, its encouragement of corruption. As one of his more recent and insightful critics, biographer Gary Scharnhorst, has pointed out, "Alger profoundly distrusted any behavior that was motivated by the desire to accumulate money."<p>Alger had a reassuring puritan conception of character--like grace, the important virtues seemed to be inborn. He came by his puritanism honestly, a New Englander with some 15 Mayflower ancestors, son of a minister. The family was poor but never unaware of its distinguished lineage. <p>Alger was a slight youth, short in stature, and--like an Alger character--when he entered Harvard, he was set upon in the Yard by a group of tough sophomores and thrashed. He survived and prospered academically and later called his Harvard years the happiest of his life. He went to divinity school, left without finishing, and toured Europe. (This seems to have been the occasion, according to one biographer, of his first heterosexual love affair, with a French tart, a traumatic enough event to discourage him from further efforts in this genre until late in his life.) He lived for several years in Cambridge, teaching, preaching, and writing fiction and verse. He accepted a job as minister to a church in Brewster, on Cape Cod, a move that proved disastrous yet decisive in the course of his life. He was soon driven away for (according to church records) "the abominable and revolting crime of gross familiarity with boys" (italics in the original). He fled to New York and ever afterward tried to conceal the Brewster episode, his short-lived career in the ministry, and whatever his homoerotic inclinations may have been. Effeminate lads turn up in his novels, and their mannerisms provide a sure sign of their moral decay. Heroes have manly gazes and clear brows, and their financial reward is often accompanied by prospects of a suitable marriage.<p>New York seems to have been good for Alger (as it has been for so many other writers greater and lesser). His own financial needs made him turn to a form at which he knew he could make some money, children's books, and the city seems to have turned him outward, made him into an observer. He became particularly interested in the plight of the urchin class and (one might speculate) sublimated his pederasty into advocacy for the lot of impoverished boys. He wrote his first successful series of books about a character named Ragged Dick for the explicit purpose of exciting sympathy for homeless children, and as he prospered, he became a prominent benefactor of the lodging houses that tried to ease their pain. <p>Two pleasing opposites animated Alger's novels: his moral homilies on the one hand, and on the other, his gritty descriptions of the perils of life in the city. For a modern reader, the pleasure of the books (and there is some) lies chiefly in his rendering of countinghouses and boarding houses, of the myriad lowlife charlatans waiting to strip a boy of his few pennies, as well as the heartily upright and honest poor (like the lovable Mrs. O'Keefe with her apple stand in Adrift in New York) who might be turned to for help. I expect that Alger's young readers may have found their joy in these books similarly: cozily experiencing the titillating horrors of urban life. It may be that for every youth who was persuaded to try his luck in the city, another ten imagined themselves getting hustled by a con man and decided to stay on the farm.<p>Alger's popularity had peaked by the 1880s, and by the end of his career he was writing with greater difficulty and less reward. His work had sustained him but not made him rich. By his estimate his lifetime sales amounted to 800,000 copies. In 1898 he went home to Massachusetts to stay with an aged relative and to die. Strangely, though, his greatest commercial success lay ahead, with a posthumous boom in interest in his fiction during the early years of the 20th century. A country that had by then been through two traumatic panics and felt its looming involvement in the dark turmoil of Europe may have been nostalgic for the simpler days of 19th-century capitalism. It seems to have been during this time, when his books were selling a million copies annually, that Alger's reputation began its ossification into the cliche of the success story. Readers stopped listening to the sermons and cut to the chase.<p><p>Reading alger now, one is struck by a paradox: Though the books are hopelessly antiquated, the dialogue stiff and laughable, the references entertainingly obscure, the essential theme is not dead. We still wonder what is necessary for success and fear the price in loss of self may be unacceptable. An apprehension about money still affects our lives and makes itself felt in the ambivalence--the mixture of veneration and suspicion--that we display toward the very successful. But it is not uncommon for literature to wear itself out on themes that are not themselves exhausted.<p>Certainly we cannot imagine our children being interested in books like the Alger books --our children are much more sophisticated, their ears bred to tune out anything that sounds remotely like Alger's starched pulpit sounds. Yet reading these books makes one reflect on the culture that children do absorb and what it is telling them about the "real world." To find an equivalent in popularity of the Alger books today, one has to turn to other media, to movies, CDs, television, and video games, and to their two essential ingredients, sport and violence. What is the message that lies therein? What now is the lie that we are telling to the children?<p>Gangsta rap, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Beavis and Butt-Head--these are not self-evidently identical phenomena, but if you take just a step back, they do indeed share something. They promise instant identity through power. It's as if our society had projected its fears of impotence and anonymity onto children and provided them with the illusion of an answer: Zap, slam dunk, blow him away. The wisdom of Snoop Doggy Dogg confers a moral blessing on such nihilism and stands the Alger story on its head: No matter what you achieve, you will always be a victim. If the 19th century feared loss of self, the late 20th seems to fear it hasn't a self to lose.<p>We lament, for good reasons, the way violence permeates popular culture. One doesn't have to be an alarmist to think that bloodshed in the movies is dangerously romanticized, that children have no idea what real violence is like until they try it, which movies tempt them to do, that many rudderless kids may be guided into crime by what is given them for entertainment. But one can feel sad about this for a more basic and mundane reason: It is so unrealistic--not about the nature of violence, but about the way the world really works. <p>Violence (and sports) offers very little in the way of career opportunity. Not many openings at all in the world for gunmen, drug lords, or slayers of Super Mario, or even, alas, for point guards. It is a striking feature of children's culture today that the world they will inhabit, a world of jobs and corporations, of getting by or getting rich, scarcely makes an appearance. The absence is true not only of the mass culture of the screen but of the more sophisticated literature for children that has blossomed in recent years. It tends to be inward and psychological and not show children--or adults for that matter--in contact with organizations. I asked a children's-book editor about this recently, and she said that business didn't appear in children's books these days: "The businessman may be that dumb guy from Wall Street Mom is dating while Dad finds himself as a carpenter in Vermont." I spoke to a prep-school headmaster a while ago who said that one of the most troubling things about his students was that many had no idea what their parents did for a living. Some of the parents did it rather well, too, but didn't think their kids would be interested. Another editor was trying to put together an anthology of literature about work for teenagers (some 40 percent of whom have worked by the age of 17). "The only problem," she said, "is that there is no such literature."<p><p>No more rags to riches! now it's just do it. It seems a shame, because the nascent world of the 19th century has come true: We are a business culture, one that still values, even insists on, some 19th-century virtues. And most kids will take their place in it--not as dramatically as Ragged Dick or Tattered Tom, but nonetheless it will be their lives. Too bad we don't have a new Horatio Alger Jr. to tell them what the world they're actually going to live in is like. <p>Richard Todd is a contributing editor at Worth.

						When the great flood of '93 left Mike Pieper's farm under 16 feet of water, he undertook an extraordinary effort to clean it up himself.  At least it was a problem he could solve.<p>By Donovan Webster<p>Mike pieper is sitting in the stern of his green steel skiff, looking out across some of the prettiest farmland in southeast Iowa. It's mid-August; eight-foot cornstalks should be gleaming in the late-summer sun. But this year there's only water, muddy Mississippi River water as deep as 16 feet in some places. The great flood of 1993 has covered nearly everything in sight. Beyond the silent brown lake that covers the 3,200-acre Pieper farm, Crayola-green bluffs rise on the east and west horizons. The knoll on which the farm's 17 buildings sit pokes up through the floodwaters, but even on that higher ground a half-dozen barns and sheds are still submerged to their rooflines by water that has changed Mike Pieper's life forever.<p>Pieper dials the outboard's throttle back, and silence fills the air. The boat coasts past a trio of corrugated-steel silos, and Pieper, a sinewy bantam rooster of a man in blue jeans and a navy work shirt, speaks for the first time in half an hour. "Haven't been out here in six weeks," he says. "Haven't set foot in my own home in a month and a half. Unbelievable." <p>Finally--with the boat pushing a last, low wake across the water--the hull grinds against the dry, raised soil of the farm site. Behind him, the water is awash with sodden green cornstalks. The day is sunny and humid. Clouds of houseflies pulse beneath a pale blue sky. <p>"Okay," Pieper says. "Let's see what's left of the farm."<p>Pieper goes ashore, plunging his heavy boots into the saturated, yogurtlike mud. He's looking for a clear path to the farmhouse, 200 yards away. This is his first trip back to the farm since the Mississippi River levee, three miles distant, split in two spots on July 11, just outside the small farming community of Wever, Iowa. Since then, he and his wife and four children have been living in a cramped rental house a dozen miles away. He has spent endless days with federal and state bureaucrats and recently learned that the government and the Army Corps of Engineers will offer him virtually no help for months. (They'll focus on his troubles, they say, when the floodwaters recede and they've had time to assess the damage--sometime in early 1994.) <p>Yet, right now, Pieper's got some 15 billion gallons of water covering the five and a half square miles of his farm, with no way to dry it out. Like most farmers who reside near levees, he carries no flood insurance. "Living this close to a river, our annual premiums can run to near 20 percent of a farm's value," he says, "so we'd be rebuying this place every five years. Nope, better to gut out a bad year every few decades." Pieper thinks the flood will cost the farm $1.5 million. "It'll hurt us," he says, "but we'll swing it."<p>Buried in slop to his ankles, Pieper peers around one of the three quarter-mile-long buildings that housed his family's hogs and steps through the back door. Inside, the floors and stock pens are slick with four inches of sludge. The air is thick with buzzing flies and the stench of rot. He plods on, grabbing the gunky top rails of hog pens when he needs balance. Ahead of him, near the center of the building, a puffed, drowned dog has been pinned beneath the rail of a stock pen. Finally, after much scrambling and slipping, Pieper makes his way out the building's front door and back into sunshine. <p>Beneath his feet, the earth is alive with countless thousands of frogs. He walks across the farm's parking area and reaches his farmhouse. Though this is Pieper's first trip back, a pair of carpenters, 2 of the 20 workers the farm employs, have already started gutting the downstairs of the two-story white-frame house, leaving only wall studs in place. The windows have been knocked out by windblown waves, and since the waters have receded, the hot summer sun has compounded the damage, leaving the house parched and desiccated. But Pieper hardly acknowledges the sheer devastation and instead comments on early stages of the cleanup. "The guys could have done more," he notes disappointedly. Mildew coats the ceilings. Stagnant water covers a stairway that drops toward the basement. "They could have started pumping this," Pieper says, pointing. "We've got to get this place cleaned up."<p>Pieper goes back outside. He walks toward a warehouse that contains his engineering equipment and tools. To keep more revenue flowing into his farming operation, Pieper has diversified over the years in a half-dozen directions. Aside from controlling its land and livestock, Pieper Farms Corp. owns the local farm-supply store. Away from the corporation, Pieper himself is a partner in a high-tech ceramics-manufacturing company and a self-taught engineer who designs and fabricates prototype farm implements. (Recently, some of his creations and insights were integrated into Caterpillar's new and hugely successful Challenger series of tractors.)<p>Pieper enters the tool barn's gaping sliding door. Around the white walls, a brown line from the flood's high-water mark rises to six feet off the ground. Dozens of metal-cutting machines are covered in slime and rust. On the building's walls, scores of power tools hang on pegs; all have been ruined. Waterlogged engineering plans lie on Pieper's broad desk. To the desk's right, a wall of cubbyhole shelves brims with rusted screws and bolts.<p>"When the levee broke," Pieper says, removing his snap-brim hat and shaking his head, "we didn't have time to get this stuff out. Replacing it's gonna cost $100,000." He slaps the hat back on his head and heads outside. "I don't even know what the flood's done to my farmland yet," he says. "It may have destroyed that, too." As Mike Pieper stands there uncharacteristically still for a long moment, a huge, dark-green frog bounds across the shed's parking area and--splat!--lands square on his boot. <p>Pieper looks down and, seeing the frog scramble off his toe and leap away, begins to laugh. He tosses his hands in the air, then bends and drops his fists to his knees. It's another half minute before--still giggling--he recovers.<p>"Been a hell of a year for frogs," he finally says, straightening and shifting the hat back on his head slightly. "Been the worst year possible for me. But, man, it's been a fine year for these frogs."<p><p>"There's an old farm saying," says gregory Hanson, a professor of agriculture at Pennsylvania State University. "A drought will scare you, but a flood will kill you."<p>The latest figures available show that for many of the Midwest's farmers, 1993 will enter the books as the worst harvest in history. By mid-July of last year more than 8 million acres of farmland were underwater or uncultivated, with another 20 million adversely affected by the weather. All told--figuring crop losses, machinery damage, and home and building destruction--the flood will have washed some $25 billion from the national economy, and in the estimation of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, one of every ten farmers affected by the flood will be run out of business.<p>Mike Pieper should be the kind of farmer who can withstand a flood's deadly blows. One of seven children, he has made this farm his life. While his siblings all went to college or pursued professional degrees, Mike went to work on the farm after graduating from high school. Since 1974, he's worked seven days a week, from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., tilling, building, tinkering, and fighting to keep hold of the Jeffersonian notion that a well-managed family farm remains the key to American prosperity. And for Pieper, the work has paid off. He manages the farm with his semiretired father, Bud, 69, and younger brother, Bill, 36, who had once intended to be a dentist but didn't like it and returned to the farm.<p>The Pieper farm is the biggest spread in the 17-farm Green Bay district, and Pieper, his wife, Cheryl, and their four kids make their home in a comfortable four-bedroom house just down the road from the homes of his parents and brother. He sends the three eldest children to private school, and--though he has taken only one vacation in five years--business trips in the past 18 months have delivered him to such places as Nigeria, Ukraine, and Australia. ("We all wish he'd take a little more time off," says his brother Joe, an engineer at Caterpillar in Peoria. "Cheryl and the kids try to get away every year, but Mike often stays on and keeps working.") <p>Thanks to an annual net growth of 14 percent, Pieper Farms has also become a textbook case in farm management--literally. Since 1987, Ray Goldberg, a professor at Harvard Business School, has followed it as part of a senior management seminar. And thanks to the farm, Mike has become something of an agrarian TV hero; for the past two years, he's been featured in a widely rotated television commercial for DuPont's Classic herbicide, a spot that ends with the slogan "What makes them better is you."<p>(All of these accomplishments have left some of the neighbors less than thrilled and perhaps a little jealous. In fact, when I first arrived in Wever last August, I stopped by the Beach Front, one of two bars in town, asking directions to the Pieper place. After a minute of letting the question hang in the air, a pair of surly-looking farmers glanced up from their beers. One pointed out a picture window toward the flooded eastern horizon, then added derisively, "Mike Pieper? You mean old Indiana Jones.... He lives thataway.")<p>Despite all the outside acclaim, his own family members aren't completely pleased with the way the farm has been run recently. A series of events--set into motion six months before the flood--has left the farm awash in family tension and hard feelings. In September 1992, after more than ten years of hemming and hawing, Pieper's six brothers and sisters, each of whom has an equal share in the corporation under an estate-planning arrangement with their father, decided to sell the farm. Though three of Mike's brothers have worked on the farm--including Bill, the latest of them--the Pieper clan has spread across the country. To them, the farm represents a chancy investment, and they do not want to leave control of their patrimony in Mike's hands.<p>As it is explained by an off-farm brother, droughts in 1986, '87, and '88 and the hard-bitten economics of farming have increased the corporation's value little since 1981, despite the steady growth. None of the shareholders has seen a dime from the farm except the ones who worked on it. To the nonfarming shareholders, the only constant has been volatility. So in September of '92--"Since it was always intended for one of us to own the farm, and we're not getting any younger," the brother says--the Pieper siblings came to Mike and Bill and told them it was time to liquidate. They figured they could take their shares of the corporation, each worth in the neighborhood of $300,000 (after taxes), and look for better profits elsewhere.<p>As had been the plan for years, the farm's shares would be sold to just one of the brothers. It seemed the only tenable way to keep a Pieper on the farm was to have just one brother own it, since, as Mike says, "owning a whole farm by halves won't cut it for anybody." Mike said he'd make a bid. As did Bill, the amiable bachelor who'd overseen the farm's 20,000-hog livestock operation since finishing college in 1981. Both brothers said they'd get their offering packages together by the end of 1993.<p>So, in the months preceding the flood, the only question that hovered above the Pieper farm was a simple yet brutal one. Which brother would buy the farm and ascend to the security of a hefty agri-corporation? And which brother would leave, with nothing but one seventh of the farm to show for his years of toil?<p><p>Then in the spring of 1993, the deluge began. From Minnesota to Kansas, from Nebraska to Indiana--across an area the size of the Midwest itself--a season of relentless rain fell on soil still saturated from winter snowmelt. The ground couldn't soak up the excess water. Heavy downpours of four inches weren't uncommon, and week upon week, the water started to back up. Throughout the Mississippi River basin, in places as far away as Nebraska and eastern Montana, the soil was so muddy that many farmers weren't able to get their seed in. And for those who did get their planting done, the mud and standing water often rotted seeds before germination could take place. <p>In the upper drainages, away from the Mississippi, the Midwest's wide, flat, braiding rivers began to swell. And after a while, the larger rivers downstream--the Des Moines and Iowa rivers in Iowa, the Missouri River in Kansas and Missouri, the Rock and Illinois rivers in Illinois--overflowed. In March there were 26 days without sun. In April there were 23. In May there were 21. By mid-June, even the Mississippi was filled, and the runoff had nowhere else to go. Predictions of a record Mississippi River flood began to circulate.<p>On the Pieper farm, just inside the Mississippi River levee in southeast Iowa, they'd seen this kind of thing before. In fact, in 1951, the year Bud Pieper got married and bought 146 acres of the farm he'd been renting in Iowa's lush Green Bay, the Mississippi rose up and flooded him out. But the experience didn't deter him from buying more cropland in the bay "whenever it became available and with what few dollars we had at the time." The floods threatened again in 1958 and 1973, but each time the water lifted quickly and dropped. Bud Pieper had always been able to get his crops in and out. In 1993, though, the water just beyond the levee rose and stayed. This flood--if it happened--was going to be different, and everyone in the Green Bay area knew it.<p>On June 28, three days after the Mississippi had risen seriously above flood stage for the third time in as many months, the 17 farmers in the 14,000-acre Green Bay Levee and Drainage District (the area protected by the 22-mile Green Bay levee) met in the offices of the valley's grain elevator, which itself is perched on the levee's edge to take advantage of river-barge loading available through the elevation. "Six inches of rain fell that night," says the elevator's manager, Nick Huston, a trim, chain-smoking man of 46. "We knew we had a big problem coming our way." <p>Because Pieper was the largest farmer in the Green Bay (or the Bottoms, as locals call it) and was "known as a go-getter with a good mind for engineer-type thinking," Huston says, Pieper took over the job of flood-fight coordinator. In that meeting, Huston got the other pivotal job, "as a sort of supply sergeant," he says. "I turned our office into a command center. We manned the telephones and the weather-station computer to get people the flood-fight materials they'd need while anticipating the lifting of the river." <p>Over the next 13 days, with the river rising as much as a foot a night, Pieper, Huston, and hundreds of volunteers worked around the clock, fighting to maintain their 22 miles of levee protection. Like the farmlands of the Netherlands--and thanks entirely to the levee--the Green Bay had been made into some of Iowa's most fertile farmland. Before the levee was built in the late 1800s, the bay was a swamp. Then, after the levee was in place, leaving the bay a full eight feet beneath the usual level of the Mississippi, the rich flood plain with its sometimes tricky water table could be tilled into astonishing fecundity.<p>Now, in late June of last year, the Green Bay Bottoms and every farm in it was in danger of being drowned. As the river grew nearer and nearer the top of the levee, Pieper, Huston, and the volunteers went through 600 rolls of snow fence and 150,000 sandbags in a matter of days. They brought in 13 bulldozers--summoned from across Iowa--to prop and buttress the levee. On the night of June 30, the Army Corps of Engineers, who were already spread thin across the Midwest, set up an Emergency Operations Center at the elevator offices, bringing some National Guard units with them to combat the flood. But the rain kept falling. As the river kept rising, Nick Huston got on the phone to building suppliers: He ordered every piece of wood and sheet of plastic he could scrape up, and the volunteers and Guard units--plus dozens of prison inmates in a paramilitary boot-camp program--went to work making a temporary plywood-and-plastic "flashboard" levee atop the soil.<p>On television, the rising water had become a national news story. Tom Brokaw and Harry Smith helicoptered above the swollen brown water of Illinois's Rock River. So far, no levees had broken, but, as the farmers of the bay knew, all the water in the Des Moines, Skunk, and Rock rivers was headed for the Mississippi and would fill the Big Muddy a few miles on either side of the town of Wever. The onrushing torrent would turn Green Bay Bottoms into ground zero of the great flood of '93.<p>As the situation grew more ominous, farmers in the bay began to divide their time. By night, they'd fight the flood; by day, they'd prepare their farms for the worst. On the Pieper farms, employees as well as friends and volunteers undertook a massive effort to protect the operation, moving more than 30 truckloads of hogs into spare pens wherever they could be found. (Some of the animals were trucked as far away as Minnesota.) On July 2, the Piepers had to sell 8,000 immature "feeder" pigs they were cultivating at up to 25 percent below profit. On the farm's crop side, Pieper had to move to higher ground 72 pieces of machinery as well as 130,000 bushels of grain stored in the farm's three silos. <p>Finally, on July 10, the flood crested. "We were all exhausted," Huston says. "Everybody was screwed down tighter than a drum." And, miraculously, throughout the day, the levee held. "When the crest passed at about 2:30 or 3:00 that afternoon," Huston says, "everybody was so high, any of us could have kicked a train right off its track."<p>But as the water began to fall, a new, even more dangerous stage of the flood set in. "When a crest passes," Huston says, "a vacuum develops out in the river." That's when the levee began sloughing into the river. At 1 a.m. on July 11--as Pieper, his army of volunteers, and the National Guard were just beginning to breathe a little easier--Mike Pieper took a call on the Motorola radiophone he wears on his belt. "It was the sheriff," Pieper says, "and he said, 'Hey, Mike, we've had a report there's water on the blacktop.'"<p>At the moment Pieper was at his house, securing it for the night. He ran out to his truck and drove toward the levee's lowest zone--its furthest downstream point--where the break was reported. "I got to where our farm-supply store is, " he says, "about 200 yards from the levee, and there was water covering the road. So I drove out into the water a little ways and stopped the truck. And I was PO'd. I thought, 'Oh, shit, it's true.'" After a minute of sitting in his truck and thinking, Pieper opened the truck's door to see if there was a current. "I saw this leaf or something drift past in the darkness," he says, "and I knew the water was moving. I knew that, somewhere, the levee had busted.<p>"I got on the phone," Pieper says, "and I called the the flood-fight office and said, 'Everybody, everybody, the levee has broken. Get out of there. Get out.' I sounded a little frantic, they tell me, but I wanted everyone to get out of there safely." <p>After that, Pieper says, for a long few minutes he shut off his truck and listened to the water as it moved across his farmland, purling and gurgling against his truck tires. "It was really quiet, almost peaceful," he says. "The night was black, and I just sat in my truck and watched the water finger its way across the low spots and into the bay, like watching a growing bad dream."<p>Officially, at 1:05 a.m. on July 11, 1993, the Green Bay Drainage District became the first Mississippi River revetment to wash away in the great flood of '93. Ultimately, the river would fill some parts of the bay to 16 feet, just as it would drown two thirds of the 1,100 other levee districts across the Midwest. In the bay, the river pressed through the levee at a pair of gaps whose length totaled 1,400 feet. The incoming tide crushed empty grain silos like Styrofoam cups. It lifted petroleum tanks from their moorings, leaving them drifting with the wind and current across the bay's ten-mile width. Woodchucks and ground squirrels had to be rescued from treetops, while coyotes--always heard in the bay but never before seen--drifted around the newly made lake on logs, helpless as castaways. Before the flood stabilized, 60 billion gallons of water spilled out of the Mississippi River and into the Green Bay Bottoms. It took two complete days for the river to cover the bay's 14,000 acres. <p>Two weeks after the levee broke, mike Pieper stood among the sandbags and snow fences and stared across the flood. He'd tried to play along with the program. He had dutifully attended the daily Corps of Engineers and emergency-aid meetings, which were held in the fire station in Wever, on higher ground overlooking the flooded bay. Some time during the second week of sitting around, Pieper grew weary of the bureaucrats and their public-policy programs. The government, he discovered, was offering some assistance--on its own timetable--and was not giving out any money so that Pieper and the other farmers in the bay could help themselves. "Everything they were proposing had strings attached," Pieper says. He'd had enough of "the kind of people who propose ideas but never act on them."<p>The only objective, from his perspective, was to get his farm dry as soon as possible. And because the drainage district's usual pumping station, at a confluence of drainage and irrigation canals near the grain elevator, had been destroyed, Pieper began to cast for alternatives. He got on the phone and called around the country, trying to find some kind of auxiliary pumps--but no such things even existed. So the next day he jumped into a skiff and, using a rope with a rock tied to one end, took some depth soundings. When he'd found the bay's lowest altitude spot--the place where the water was deepest and where, eventually, the last of the drained flood would end up--he drove some long stakes into the lake bottom that had once been his farmland. After that, he came ashore, pulled a measuring tape from his belt, and lifted a stick from the ground. <p>Over the next hour, Pieper, leaning on his self-taught engineering skills, reasoned and figured. Using the stick he'd lifted, he etched a pump design into the sand, then copied it roughly--in blocks and circles--onto a sheet of paper. He made some more final measurements, double-checking the sand for a set of "mental blueprints I could carry around," and went home to bounce his scheme off a couple of phone-conferenced engineers. <p>In early September, the water is still standing 14 feet deep across the Green Bay District, but Pieper is ready to do something about it--personally. Using the empty hulk of an old department store in the bluff-top town of Fort Madison, eight miles south of Wever, he has put his farm employees to work building pumps, an effort paid for with $28,000 of the farm's money. Against the sound of blowtorches and arc welders, Pieper says, "We were the first drainage district to get our paperwork into the Corps of Engineers, and they told us they'd respond in 26-plus weeks. I'm a farmer. I can't wait for the corps to think about draining my land next February or March. I'll need to be planting crops then."<p>The crew is in the midst of fashioning nine 80-foot lengths of pipe--each one 36 inches in diameter--into pump tubes. Inside three of the tubes, they mount boat propellers. The nine tubes will be trimmed and married together to make three 280-foot-long siphons. The propellers are each powerful enough to suck floodwaters into the pipe and will push the water 25 vertical feet over the levee and down into the river. They will be attached to drive shafts, which, in turn, will be powered by three 18-wheeler truck engines. When the pumps are operational, Pieper will trailer the device onto the levee, drop the propellered ends of the pipes into the bay, and begin pumping the floodwaters at a rate of 135,000 gallons a minute. "After that," he says, "all we'll have to do is close the levee, keep the pumps going 24 hours a day, and wait a few months."<p>Most of the other farmers have apparently decided to wait for help. All summer and into the autumn, across the Green Bay Bottoms, few can be found. On rare occasions, Pieper sees his neighbors returning home for a day or two, monitoring the flood and wringing their hands at their waterlogged houses. "Most farmers," says Nick Huston, "they're purely farmers. They're not like Mike, who's a problem solver before he's a farmer. Most of the other folks in the bay, they farm--which isn't a criticism, since that's no easy thing--but most of them, they've just disappeared. They'll come back when the water's gone."<p>For Pieper, the successful draining of more than 14,000 acres has taken on a greater meaning. It would prove that he deserves the farm his brothers and sisters had decided to sell. Mike says he doesn't know what has become of the other bay farmers. "I hear tell that some of them are living on high ground with their families and in-laws until the water recedes," he says. "They're helping out on other farms where they're needed, returning the favor to those farmers who helped us during the flood fight. Which is great. It's fine for them. But I've got to keep working down here. I can't wait that way."<p>He isn't entirely alone in his efforts. His brother Bill is hard at work cleaning out the farm's three quarters of a mile of hog barns. Bud Pieper pitches in, and a cousin, Karl Pieper, who's also a farmer in the bay, is helping Mike with the pumps. One afternoon, as the pumps are being trucked in, Pieper drives along the levee for a distance to where another of the area farmers, Squirt Blanchard, has started helping to reclaim the bay. To do this, Blanchard has spent the past week driving a Pieper Farms bulldozer back and forth across the levee, shaving the top from it and using that excess sand and earth to close the levee's gaps. "The Corps of Engineers owns the levee," Pieper says as he watches Blanchard move sand toward a 923-foot levee break, "and I'm not sure the corps is going to like us closing their levee for them. But," he says, throwing up his hands, "they know where to find me and Squirt if they want to toss us in jail."<p>As the building and moving of the pumps nears its completion, there are endless problems to attend to: More iron has to be machined; the universal joints in the driveshafts aren't sturdy enough; extra steel has to be ordered for the pumps. And always in the back of Mike Pieper's mind are the larger issues that compel him to push himself ever harder.<p>Beneath the floodwater, for instance, he still doesn't know what his farmland looks like. It may have been carved into an untillable canyon by the rushing flood (or covered by a layer of sand, making it equally unfarmable). And of course he's still got to come up with the money to buy the farm by the end of the year: Between the farm and its related businesses, he estimates he'll need around $2.5 million. "I'm not educated like the rest of them," Pieper says. "They've all got college degrees to fall back on. Farming on this farm, it's all I know."<p>So Mike Pieper often stays up late into the night, working on whatever needs tending to. To construct his farm bid, he spends a few evenings a week with Harry Tucker, a supervisor for the University of Iowa's Farm Extension Service in the nearby city of Burlington. Then he goes home and works at his desk, running down John Kincaid, the technical manager for the Army Corps of Engineers in Keokuk, making equipment orders for the pumps, and poring over the fiduciary tables that will help him thread the farm-finance needle. Late at night, he might drive over to the spot on the levee where the pumps are being assembled. "But most nights," he says, "when I can't find anything else to do for a few hours and my head hits the pillow, getting that money together is all I think about. Sometimes it's just easier to stay awake."<p><p>
FEATURE:  A FARMER'S BATTLE (2)
FEB 94<p>A FARMER'S BATTLE (1)
By Donovan Webster<p>
On the pieper spread, there is often talk of the "last generation of family farm," and Mike doubts his 13-year-old son, Zachary, will make farming his career. "A lot of farm kids," Pieper says, "they've seen what happened to their folks during the farm crisis. They don't want to work that hard."<p>In 1946, when Bud Pieper and his four brothers returned home from World War II, only two of them went back to work on the 200-acre farm in central Iowa run by their parents. "There were too many snouts in that trough already," Bud says, "and I just thought there was a better future for me somewhere else." For three years, he stepped away from farming entirely, going to work in the production-control department at A.O. Smith, a company that makes glass-lined hot-water heaters. Then, in 1948, Bud Pieper's father came to him with a proposition. "He'd make the payments for me on a farm here in the bay, and we'd split the harvest at the end of the year," Bud says. "It was a good deal, and I took it."<p>The ground in the bay was rich but unimproved ("I had to pull shrubs and trees out to get good fields," Bud says). In three years, he'd farmed the rental property well enough that he and his new wife, Glorine, bought their own 146-acre place in the bay, and from that rich ground grew the 3,200-acre Pieper farm of today. "We came into the bay at a lucky time," he says. "A lot of older farmers were here then, and each year one of them would want to sell a 100-acre parcel here, a 300-acre piece there, and we'd buy everything we could."<p>By 1981, three decades after Bud had purchased his first land in the bay, the Pieper farm spread across 2,500 acres. The commercial hog operation he'd started with "a few pigs out in a pen" had grown to move some 10,000 hogs for slaughter through its barns every year. What had started as a typical family farm had grown, 30 years later, into a state-of-the-art operation. Over the next decade, under Mike and Bill's management, the farm would add 700 more acres and the livestock would double in number. <p>A corporate farm like the Pieper operation is potentially lucrative, but the downside is perilous. And basically, it all comes down to the weather. In the last decade alone, the Pieper farm has survived three droughts and now this flood. Fortunately, a few good crop years --plus the dependable cash flow generated by the hog operation--have kept the farm afloat. But the corporation is mortally tied to the vagaries of crop farming, and thus diversification seems to be the only long-range solution. The issues this has raised, in large part, have led Mike's brothers and sisters to opt for liquidation. "The decision to sell the corporation," Mike says, "isn't about something that happened among the kids 35 years ago--who liked who better or who treated who badly. It's business." Mike would like to manage a farm in which he is free to invest its assets as he sees fit. The other shareholders favor a less aggressive approach. For instance, in 1981, Mike was able to buy the local supply store with the corporation's money. But he hasn't found corporate support for some more ambitious projects: When he traveled to Nigeria last spring, he was there to discuss building a huge fertilizer plant with government officials. The corporation showed little interest in investing.<p>As Mike Pieper wrestles with the life-and-death issues of the diversification required to protect his farm, he mourns the passing of a way of life. According to Pieper, something will be lost when, in another few generations, the once-abundant small farms across the United States have been absorbed by the larger corporate ventures. "There'll be a loss of self-reliance," Pieper says. "Our work ethic may even suffer, not to mention what'll happen to the fabric of rural America. One of the underpinnings of what's made our country the way it is will have been eroded down."<p><p>Cheryl pieper is medium-sized and blond. A native of Bradley, Illinois, she came to Iowa in 1978 as an elementary-school teacher. "There was a job here, and I needed the classroom hours to complete my master's degree in education," she says. "So I moved to Fort Madison, and I was introduced to Mike through a friend."<p>After a year-long courtship, they were married in 1979, the year the two took up residence on the farm. "We had Zack pretty quickly after that," she says, "and I gave up teaching and became a farm wife, helping out with the books and working at the kids' school, eventually joining the school board." <p>Sitting in her kitchen and listening to Cheryl Pieper, it's obvious the years on the farm have been good ones. "You get a good crop year in the bay," she says, "with the corn all tall and green and the beans growing, and it's the most beautiful, most positive place in the world." <p>Cheryl's home in the bay, she says, has been a fine place to raise children, and she's always enjoyed being part of the Pieper clan. In fact, she says, throughout the 15 years she's lived on the farm, family relations have always been friendly and supportive, with "something new and interesting always coming along for Mike and me." It is, by all outward signs, a solid, sturdy marriage, though one that, because of Mike's long days of work, has left Cheryl to do much of the child raising herself. Still, the Piepers eat breakfast and dinner together most every night, and you can see that they're justifiably proud of the family and the life they've put together. In fact, it is Cheryl who, one night after a big pot roast, asks if I've seen the DuPont ad with Mike and the farm in it. When I say no, she leads me to the VCR and--after asking Zachary to wire the thing correctly to the TV--we slip the videocassette inside. In the ad, which shows Pieper standing next to one of his corn-planter designs on a snowy winter day, the sales tag rings out: "For people who like to do things their own way, DuPont Classic...."<p>These days the DuPont slogan has taken on new meaning. Between the impending sale of the farm and the subsequent flood, relations with the family have become tense. Mike and Bill, who didn't have much contact before the decision to sell, have become even more distant and often try not to be in the tool barn at the same time. And it's Mike who seems to be pressing harder for his siblings to bend to his wishes--or be damned. Late this summer, as the floodwaters covered their fields, the brothers and sisters had a revelation: No one really knew how much the farm was worth. To divine the corporation's price, they've decided to enlist an agribusiness consultant, the Ferguson Group  in Peoria, Illinois, to appraise the farm's value. The fee for the appraisal, they say, will be picked up by the corporation. It's a decision that turns Pieper blisteringly angry. He's afraid the outside appraisal will place an unrealistically high price on the farm, putting it further from his reach. With the help of Harry Tucker, Mike has been quietly building his own idea of what an accurate bid package represents. <p>After seeing the Classic advertisement, we go back upstairs. As we sit back down at the kitchen table, a high-pitched cacophony piles in from the other room. A second later, five-year-old Jillian charges into the kitchen, closely followed by eight-year-old Lindsey. As Jilly climbs into her mother's lap--screaming "Save me! Save me! Save me!"--Cheryl is a picture of parental calm. She strokes the red ringlets of her daughter's hair, then sets her youngest back on the floor again. As her daughters run off, Cheryl turns back to the conversation. One of the obstacles to Mike's being sold the farm, she says, is that the other brothers and sisters are very conservative with their money and investments. "And, well," she says, "Mike has a more aggressive style of doing business than they might like. I'm sure it makes the other kids a little nervous. "<p>I ask her what'll happen if Mike is denied, if the farm is sold to Bill, or--if both offers are found unacceptable--the thing is gaveled away in an auction. "If Mike doesn't get the farm," she says, her voice firm and solid, "we'll have lost everything. I really don't know what we'll do."<p><p>In early fall, the pumps go in, the levee is bulldozed shut, and by October, with the onset of the new school year, a sense of structure has finally returned to the Piepers' life. Around the rental house, Cheryl finally finds time to do the household cleanup. In her free time--of which there is precious little--she's started going out to her farmhouse in the bay and, working with a few friends, has begun scraping away the flood damage.<p>Down on the Green Bay levee, week after week, the 18-wheeler engines have been roaring, pumping roily streams of floodwater over the levee and back into the Mississippi. After a month, the floodwaters have dropped enough that automobiles can again drive on the roads farthest from the levee. One October evening, as the sun sets, Pieper takes me on a drive to inspect some of the recently flooded land. We roll along, looking at the slick, lifeless sheen of the silt-blackened fields. Beached fuel tanks and abandoned tires protrude from them at odd angles. Pieper talks of the bid package he's started to arrange. "We're putting together a solid deal," he says. "It's based on how much the land is worth after the flood, with capability to be back at top capacity in five years. We think it'll point up some of the overpricing that these fellas from Peoria might try to build in." <p>His offer, Pieper says, will be an extremely flexible one, which asks for owner financing over 18 years but which he can tailor to most any whim the stockholders toss his way. "If they think I'll make more money faster than predicted," he says, "I'll build in a sliding scale. So on those years we do better--okay, I'll pay more."<p>At many of the flooded houses around the bay, vans and buses, many with out-of-state license plates, sit in the driveway. When we roll past one flood-ravaged house with a van carrying Wisconsin tags, Pieper stops his truck and backs up. "Let's go in here," he says. "You've got to meet the Amish."<p>Shortly after the flood hit, David O'Rourke, the minister of the United Church of Christ in the nearby town of Denmark, Iowa, spearheaded a coast-to-coast relief effort. Over the past month, 750 volunteers--from the Church of Christ, the Mennonite church, and the Amish faith, among others--have migrated to the bay for one- and two-week stints as volunteer carpenters. <p>Finding the help was only half of O'Rourke's goal. He has also been lobbying construction-supply companies, working to get as much as $60,000 a week in donated Sheetrock, insulation, and hardware. He's also gotten food-processing companies to pitch in, and Hormel, Dial, and Armour have kept the relief workers in cold cuts, bread, cereal, and bottled water for weeks now. <p>We head inside the farmhouse, where, upstairs, some Mennonite and Amish men and women are screwing down new Sheetrock panels over bright pink insulation. On our way back outside, we run into Mahlon Gingrich, a farmer from Spooner, Wisconsin, who also happens to be head of the Mennonite Disaster Services. He's been in the bay now for more than a month, since the cleanup began. "We had to take a boat to some places first," the short, sturdy Gingrich says. He goes on to trace the painstaking treatment that's been required to clean the 37 flood-damaged houses in the bay, basically rebuilding each one from the inside out. First, he says, the houses need to be gutted. Then the aid workers clean out the insulation and muck, finishing by washing the remaining shell of a house from top to bottom with bleach. "From teardown to finished, painted walls," he says, "the whole thing takes about three weeks."<p>We get back in the truck and roll on. In the distance, toward the levee, a sea of mirror-flat floodwaters still coats half of the bay's floor. Along the water's edge, hundreds of herons and egrets are standing perfectly still, waiting for a shad minnow or frog to blunder into range. Beyond them, a three-quarters moon is rising above the Mississippi's bluffs. Still, inside the truck cab, only talk of money fills the air. Pieper says that, as a contingency, in case his brothers and sisters won't agree to the owner financing they've originally offered, he's also been looking into bank loans, which would still allow him buy the farm outright. It has been a frustrating search. Because of the type of loan he's asking for--a total farm mortgage in the millions of dollars--he's got to show substantial collateral. "And all I've got to show as collateral is my record as a successful farmer on the farm I'm trying to buy," he says. "The bank will do it, but I'll really have to play ball." To get the loan, he'll virtually have to accept the bankers as partners.<p>We keep driving through the bay. Away from the truck the reexposed land looks like tar. On some of the farms, furrow lines are still evident, and the land will in all likelihood be tillable after another few weeks of drying. For an endless-seeming moment, Pieper pauses, his face screwed tight in consternation. "Anyway," he finally adds, glancing out the window into the last light of the day, "whatever happens with me and this farm, the soil all around the bay here isn't as ruined as I'd feared. Least we've got that to be happy about."<p>It's nearly thanksgiving before mike and Cheryl Pieper's farmhouse begins to resemble its old self again. Because they're conscious of the advantages they have over other bay residents--their larger, more prosperous farm, their rental house in town--they've asked to have O'Rourke's disaster workers help them last. And long before the workers arrive, in early November, the farm's carpenters have gone a sizable distance toward fixing the house up. They have drained the basement and cleaned the place out; they have rewired and reinsulated. New windows and Sheetrock have been installed, and the kitchen and family rooms have new cabinetry in place, too. Each day, while the kids have been at school, Cheryl Pieper has been at her flooded-out husk of a home, working alongside the carpenters. She's been cleaning and painting the second floor, which--while never under water--suffered substantial mildew and humidity damage over the summer. It's been a long, hard job, but by the closing weeks in November, the house is inviting and livable again.<p>One night, after Mike has finished his farm duties for the day, he joins Cheryl in the basement to do a little cleanup and painting. It's about 7:30, and with carpet layers coming tomorrow, Cheryl has enlisted the older kids--Zachary and Kimberlee--to help her clean. As she paints the sloping ceiling above the cellar stairs, she's talking about the rental house and the family's summer.<p>"It's amazing what we've learned to tolerate," she says, painting long, even strokes down the wall. "We don't keep the rental place clean like we keep our own house. It's always a mess. It's resembled our lives over the past few months: chaos." <p>In their rehabbed farmhouse, however, order has already reasserted itself. In the four bedrooms of the house's second floor, the kids have started moving back in. There are new linens and bedspreads fitted on each of the childrens' mattresses; even the grout in the bathroom glistens. Cheryl's glad to be past the big stuff, she says; happy to be so nearly moved back home. Then, as she finishes her painting, working along the bottom of the stairwell ceiling, there's an audible catch in her throat.<p>"Hey, Mike," she says. "They missed a spot."<p>Pieper, who has been painting the stairway's rail, stands up and follows his wife to the bottom of the steps. There, just where the stairway's sloping ceiling joins the drop ceiling of the basement, there's a two-inch gap. Somehow, the carpenters neglected to put a new piece of fascia over the old, flood-browned ceiling. And through that little break--nothing more than a slit--you can see the flood, the impending farm sale, and all this year has wrought come washing momentarily out, moving in a grimace across Cheryl's face. <p>"Aw, it's just a little stain," Mike says.<p>Lifting her paintbrush, Cheryl starts pressing paint onto the gap, moving the end of her brush, hoping to cover the flood. Each time she tries to paint over the stain, though, its anemic brown comes back through. Behind her glasses, her eyes glisten. "Sometimes it feels like we're never going to get past this," she says to her husband. "We're never really going to get past the flood, are we?"<p>Mike bends down and dips his brush in the can of white paint at their feet, then straightens and begins painting the gap, too. "It's just what's left of a little water," he says, moving his brush back and forth. "It's nothing."<p>Over the next 20 minutes, Mike and Cheryl Pieper lay coat after coat of paint on the last stain left on their house by the great flood of '93. Each time they finish painting, the stain bleeds back through. <p><p>On saturday, november 27, with very little fanfare, Mike and Cheryl Pieper move their family home. It's two days after Thanksgiving--nearly six months after they were displaced by the flood--and the house, a moldering mess even at Labor Day, is now a showplace of new appliances and fresh paint. Over the next week --in circling, countless laps from the rental place in Fort Madison--Cheryl will transport the family and its belongings back home, back into the well-ordered life it was forced to abandon in July.<p>For Mike, the days after Thanksgiving are especially sweet ones. Despite the sale of the farm still looming in his thoughts, on December 2--seven weeks after he fired up the 18-wheeler motors for the first time--the bay is pumped dry. And as he walks the mucky farmland near where the paired levee breaks occurred, Pieper is pleased to learn that, even right against the breaks in the levee, the soil hasn't been scoured out. Only two of the bay's farms have been ruined. "A lot of the current in the flood," he says, "flowed in through the upstream break and out through the downstream one. It didn't flow inside the bay and eddy and press. We just got lucky." <p>Now, with the bay empty, Pieper, his cousin Karl, and a half dozen of the farm's workers have started dismantling the pumps and transporting them to the tool barn, where each one will be cleaned up and refitted. After fielding a number of inquiries, Pieper will be renting his pumps to the 18,000-acre Indian Graves Drainage District, just north of Quincy, Illinois. Like all the Mississippi River drainage districts around Quincy, Indian Graves is still under water, and after six months of wrangling, the Army Corps of Engineers has finally started closing levees, and the drainage is ready to be pumped.<p>Pieper now shows a respect for the Army Corps he didn't have a few months ago. "The corps is just way undermanned," he says. "They can't stay staffed up for the 500-year flood. Now that the actual flooding is past, that the situation is stable, they've really moved much faster than we were led to believe. Hell, they've moved like a lightning bolt."<p>Away from Pieper's house, out across the bay, the soil has finally dried enough that farmers can again drive their implements onto it. And in many of the fields, which are being dusted with the season's first snow, the farmers are busy plowing and disking their land, re-oxygenating the soil while also folding the new layer of silt in with the tilth. Mike was able to turn his fields weeks ago; the lightweight, aluminum-bodied tractor prototypes he created a few years back move better across soft muddy soil than do standard tractors. Now, the ground beyond Pieper's white farmhouse stretches toward the horizon like soft brown corduroy. All that remains is for Mike Pieper to buy the place.<p>On December 6, after months of planning and figuring, Pieper submits his offer to his six brothers and sisters, the Pieper Farms Corp. stockholders. After months of figuring, the bid has come in a few hundred thousand dollars higher than expected. "I'm willing to work with them," he says. "If I make more money than I'm projecting, I'll dump the excess profit into paying off the note faster. Whatever they want. I'm willing to go that extra mile on this thing."<p>His offer is dismissed summarily. Further, with his eldest brother, Joe, age 40, functioning as spokesman, Mike is told that the decision to sell the farm has now been pushed back to the spring of 1994. <p>"The reason they've put off the sale," Mike says, "is total bullshit. The shareholders say they're not ready to sell, and they've got a bunch of reasons. They say that--for sure now--they're going to bring in that guy from Peoria and that Bill hasn't had time to put his bid together, that he's been too busy." Pieper adjusts his hat. "Well, I've been busy, too," he adds, "and I got my bid in on time. What's brother Bill been doing that I haven't?" <p>Hoping to get a true fix on the circumstances of the farm sale, in the weeks preceding the year's end, I contact a number of the Pieper brothers and sisters. As Mike has intimated, they are scattered across America. Barb, a wireless-computer-technology representative, lives and works in the Chicago area. Matt is a Pepsico distributor in Plano, Texas. Joe is a Caterpillar engineer in Peoria; Maggie is a nurse in Hallmark, Missouri; Jean is a Peoria homemaker. They are all reluctant to speak about the farm's sale--and the surrounding acrimony. Off the record, they each fear "fueling the fire of an already difficult situation," or being shown as "saying something that might be misinterpreted."<p>Like the members of so many farm families, each of the Pieper shareholders I spoke with was quick to point up that, more and more frequently, the situation that they've found themselves in isn't unique. "This is happening to farm families all across the country," says Barb. "The issues this sale has brought up, the bitterness of it--unfortunately, it isn't something rare among farm families anymore."<p>As for Mike, with his offer rebuffed, he says he's finished. "I did what I was supposed to," he says. "I got my offer in by the end of the year, even though I was also busy draining the bay, and--pfffft--they aren't going to see that offer again. It was all or nothing, get your package on the table before the end of 1993, and I did; and I didn't get jack for it. Nope. Nope. That's the last bid they'll see from me." <p>He doesn't see the point "in putting seed in the ground on a farm I may not own come fall." If Pieper does leave, he says, he probably won't use his share of the corporation's buy-out to start another farm. He doesn't have the energy, he says, to begin again, since transforming a "from-scratch" farm into what he wants would take 15 years or more.<p>Instead, Pieper says, he'll look for a job as a plant manager (he's already received an offer from a large fertilizer company), or maybe he'll cash in his collaborations with <a name="NYSE:CAT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10304"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Caterpillar</b></a> and others and become some sort of farm-equipment designer. Whatever he does, he says now, when the spring of 1994 rolls around, it's very possible won't be planting any seed on the farm he's spent his life building up and tending. It's possible, of course, that his intransigence is just a negotiating ploy, but he claims his decision to leave is final.<p>"This whole thing has been my choice," Pieper says, "but I can't help being a little angry. I spend my life tending my family's farm, sweating my sweat, doing the work of three men while my brothers and sisters go to college, and when I hit middle age, they all just try to screw me out of the deal. Somehow, it just doesn't seem right." <p><p>One evening in early december, i climb into the cab of a Quincy-bound truck with Mike Pieper. Together, with a load of pump equipment in the back, we make the hour's drive south toward Indian Graves, talking on and off along the way. He has just learned that his brother Matt is considering giving up the soda business and returning to the farm in a partnership with his brother Bill. It's an arrangement that would virtually assure that the corporation won't be sold to Mike. As we skirt the line of bluffs that over the course of last summer girdled in the mighty river the way a man-made levee system couldn't, I ask Pieper if he blames the flood for the changes that have visited themselves upon his once-secure life.<p>Pieper smiles and shakes his head. "Nah," he finally says. "A farmer can't ever blame his luck only on nature or the weather." He steers the truck away from the river and toward the higher ground. "There's so many other things involved," he says. "To blame the flood for what's happening to me, that'd be cheating." <p>Donovan Webster, who wrote about Greenpeace in the June 1993 issue of Worth, is a freelance writer living in Chicago.<p><p>

						Children ask for a lot at the holidays. Many parents feel powerless to say no. Are we trying top give our kids everything we didn't get? A father grapples with the monster behind the tree.<p>By James Kaplan<p>"Dad," my five-year-old son said to me a couple of months back--it was August, the weather saunalike--"I can't wait till Christmas."<p>A small inner voice cried, Oh, no. Still, I was curious to know just what he had in mind. Please, I prayed, no more action figures. The inside of our house, no doubt like many of yours, is strewn with these grotesque and bellicose boy dolls, each of which, at six and eight and ten bucks a pop, has held my son's loyalty for a period approximating the life span of a mayfly. Their limbs and accessories lie scattered in every corner, like the aftermath of some action-figure plane crash. <p>"Why can't you wait for Christmas?" I answered, with as much sweetness as I could muster.<p>" 'Cause the living room will be covered in toys," he said.<p>Well. I restrained myself from the obvious comeback ("But it already is"). For even as the child in me knew exactly what he was talking about--the dream of abundance starts early and takes hold powerfully--the grown-up in me was filled with dread and distaste at the thought of the coming holiday. <p>My dislike, of course, had nothing to do with Christ or his birthday--but then, nor do most aspects of the holiday itself. You may go to church on Christmas; you may light candles on Hanukkah; you may observe all seven days of Kwanza. You can't avoid Christmas as an economic avatar. American retail sales last December, buoyed by consumer optimism after the presidential election, jumped from $156 billion in 1991 to a healthy $169 billion and change. The average American family, according to the National Retail Federation, spent $400 on holiday gifts. <p>But let's look at that $400 for a second. The figure looks way low to me. I suspect that in trying to sound prudent and average, that average family failed to report Sega upgrades, miscellaneous Lego mini-sets, or assorted last-minute doll accessories that somehow managed to add another $379.95 to the already strained Visa balance. <p>"Two thirds to 70 percent of the [retail] toy business happens in the fourth quarter," says Jodi Levin of the Toy Manufacturers of America. Which means, since toys are a $17 billion business in the U.S., that Americans laid out, very conservatively, $10 billion on toys last Christmas. In a country where fourth-quarter consumer spending is regarded, with almost superstitious awe, as a major economic indicator, where a good Christmas can make the whole country feel zesty (and last year--up 8 percent over the previous December--was zesty indeed), $10 billion is nothing to sneeze at. <p>And I helped. A lot.<p>A quick rundown of last year's Christmastime credit-card receipts, many of them from the dreaded <a name="NYSE:TOY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11495"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toys "R" Us</b></a>, shows me that, astoundingly enough, we seem to have spent on our two children alone close to what that putative average family spends on all its gifts put together. <p>Are we insane? Are we wealthy? No and no. This sum does not reflect purposeful lavishness on our part. We had a clear enough idea of our financial horizons, so we didn't intentionally go overboard. We did not go out and purchase miniature English riding habits for our five-year-old and two-year-old boys. We didn't buy state-of-the-art learning computers. We just got a lot of not very expensive kid stuff, and it added up.<p>Here's some of what we bought just for the five-year-old: One Decepticon Transformer and one Slag Transformer, at about $15 each. Tyco's Doodle Dome, for about $20. A large basic Lego set, at $25. A Playmobil Civil War set, for $16. A Nerf missile launcher, at $20. Then there was the cellular-phone pencil case, at $15; the bug-catching set, with butterfly net and magnifying glass, at $15; and $30 or so worth of books. Not to mention another $30 on miscellaneous stocking stuffers: plastic dinosaurs, Crazy Foam, a Ninja Turtle watch, a Koosh.<p>Two hundred dollars. One child.<p>How did this happen? Was there a game plan? Was there a budget? No to both, even though I agree there should have been. Here's how it works in our house: We love our kids, and we want them to be happy. So my wife begins to see things, soon after Labor Day, that would be perfect for them for Christmas. She buys them. She stores these things in the basement and our closets. Soon she forgets what she's bought and buys more. <p><p>As christmas approaches, we both lose track altogether, panic, and go out and buy even more stuff. Then, usually at the very last minute, once my older son has received whatever arcane messages television and catalogs and his peers have sent him and decided what he really, really wants, I myself cruise our local suburban-blight shopping strip, scan the hopelessly picked-over merchandise, and settle (all faint hopes of fiscal sanity thrown to the winter winds), not for the desired toy, which has long since been snapped up by other desperate parents, but for something else that costs just as much or more. <p>Throughout this process, my dialogue with my son about his presents is minimal--although I'm sure he'd prefer it otherwise. My pretext is secrecy; the reality, I think, is that I'd rather not face what's really going on. <p>What is going on?<p>Much as sex attacks the brain's seat of reason, Christmas shopping for our kids melts down the higher mental functions of otherwise responsible adults. Just as we will walk through fire or face down armed muggers for our offspring, we will also go into debtors' prison to do right--or what we suppose to be right--by our children at holiday time. <p>But what, precisely, is right? What has to do with us and what has to do with them? If doing right means compensating for our own past deprivations, maybe we ought to think twice about it. If it means assuaging a guilty conscience, maybe we should think three times.<p>We all make mistakes as parents. Some of us make bad mistakes. Could it just possibly be a further, deeper mistake to assume that a token--no matter how expensive--can redeem us in a child's eyes? Of course children are happy when they get toys; they're also happy when they get candy. But there's happiness, and there's happiness. The greatest presents of my childhood, the things I remember with acute joy, had contextual value--some sort of tie to an emotion, a person, a discovery. More often than not, this value was utterly accidental. But the context was crucial, since the greatest present we can give our children is our presence, our absolute attention. How barren to presume that a thing, in the absence of that attention, can compensate.<p>How barren, but how common.<p>"Any manager of a Toys 'R' Us, if he's worth his salt, quickly learns to recognize a certain type of single parent who comes into the store on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon," says David Liebowitz, senior vice president and director of research for Republic New York Securities Corp. "This is the parent who gets the kids on alternate weekends or once a month or whatever it is. And that manager can tell by looking at that parent precisely, to the dollar, what he or she is going to spend. I call these purchases conscience gifts."<p>Or does doing right by our kids mean fulfilling that old dream of abundance? And is that dream a lodestar for our lives or a nightmare trap? And if it is a trap--as I believe it is--how do we begin to help ourselves and our children climb out of it?<p>Whether guilty or simply holiday-addled, we have holiday fever stamped into our genetic circuits. And the toy companies know it. "Parents are going to buy toys for their kids at Christmas," says Noah Manduke, a senior vice president and account director at Ogilvy & Mather in Los Angeles, which creates much of Mattel's advertising. "They may not buy a house; they may not buy a car. But they're going to buy toys."<p>"The toy industry has not had a down year since the assassination of President Kennedy," Liebowitz says. "Even if times are harsh, we will not take it out on the children. The children of America will not be denied."<p>We have made a beginning of discussing economic realities with our five-year-old. Throughout the rest of the year, when he points at some $27.95 gewgaw, we can say, "That's a really big toy, honey. We'll have to save that for a special time."<p>But then comes Christmas. What do we say then?<p>And what do we say to him about the junk? What about the action figures and other plastic crapola that in his broadly tolerant toy worldview is just as good as what seems "better" to his parents? Do we forbid it? Discourage it?<p>And how do we save ourselves from our own worst emotional and economic instincts where Christmas is concerned? <p><p>Was christmas better once? when i was a kid, maybe? Or am I fooling myself? Let us consider Mr. Machine. When I was ten, 30 or so years ago, Ideal's Mr. Machine, a top-hatted transparent walking robot with visible gears, was quite simply the coolest toy I had ever seen up to that juncture in my life. I wanted it desperately, or thought I did, and its nefariously infectious television jingle--"Here he comes, here he comes, greatest toy you've ever seen/And his name is ... Mr. Machine!"--bored the message into my head. As Christmastime approached, the commercials increased, and my need sharpened. The only problem was that Mr. Machine cost some 20 bucks, and 20 bucks for a toy in the early '60s was big money. Or so it probably seemed to my father, the holder of the purse strings, who wisely saw where Mr. Machine was headed--straight (and fast) toward the scrap heap of holiday history. He was willing to go over the toy budget if doing so involved electric trains. Electric trains were likely to stick around for a few seasons; moreover, he could play with them, too. I never got Mr. Machine, but I did get electric trains, and they did indeed last a long time, and I remember them with keen pleasure.<p>But I also remember Mr. Machine, the toy that got away.<p>Did my father explain to me that we couldn't afford to buy both Mr. Machine and electric trains? Did he explain to me that Mr. Machine was junk? <p>He didn't. When it came to child rearing, my parents were of the generation that believed, as John Wayne said in the movies, "Never apologize and never explain--it's a sign of weakness." For various reasons, our parents were more assured in their grown-up-ness than we are. And coming out of radio days, they could credibly profess the kind of ignorance about toys and toy ads that men commonly claim when it comes to buying women's underthings. Not to mention the fact that they remembered the Depression, which they could invoke with convincing authority when it came to limiting domestic spending.<p>Maybe, too, Christmas threw my father into the same kind of non-conversant state it throws me into now. Maybe, when I wanted nothing more than to talk about Mr. Machine, he wanted nothing more than to escape.<p>And then, perhaps my father didn't really understand the concept of a toy that wasn't a miniature version of something real. After all, he grew up before the Great Toy Blitz. I came just at the start of it. Let us examine that significant year of 1963: the era of Mr. Machine and the last down Christmas for toy retailers for 30 years. In that year, Mattel's net sales (almost all of it domestic at that point) totaled about $96 million, or around $480 million in today's dollars. Hasbro's 1963 sales were $13.4 million--about $67 million today. Last year, Mattel's worldwide net sales, including the sales of its new acquisition Fisher-Price, totaled $1.85 billion. (Barbie alone accounted for over $1 billion of that.) Hasbro's sales last year totaled $2.54 billion.<p>The earth's population has increased by 40 percent over the past 30 years; the toy business has grown by about 500 percent. Advertising has risen commensurately.<p>For the period between Halloween and December 25 this year, toy companies will spend, at the very least, $1 billion on advertising. <p>My five-year-old, who watches up to two hours of cartoons daily on several cable channels, gets around 40 minutes of toy commercials--more toward the holidays--in with the mix. He stares at these ads as raptly as he stares at Captain Planet or Looney Tunes, and he decides he wants many of these things they advertise, these growling, whirring, grotesque, testosterone-fueled figures and vehicles. He also studies avidly the daily avalanche of catalogs that come in the mail. And he decides he wants many of these things, too. There are nice things in the catalogs--more so than on TV. There are science sets and magic sets and Lego vehicles that get even me excited. And he wants it all.<p>When it comes to Christmastime and toys, my son and I are peas in a pod. Like him, I grew up in front of a television. My generation, the first to have been nurtured on the tube, is also the first, where our own children are concerned, to stare ourselves in the face. In a very real sense, our Kids "R" Us. Unlike my father, I've been there. "You saw it on TV? You have to have it? I know, I know."<p>I'm in it as deep as my son. An Infiniti commercial can pluck my heartstrings, even if my American Express payment is a little late this month. It started quite early, this gnawing feeling: I deserve; nothing is ever enough. I've seen my five-year-old, time after time, receive a much-desired toy one day, then put it aside grumpily the next day because "it's not special anymore." He wants something new. Does this mean he's a bad kid? A spoiled kid? Have my wife and I done something terribly wrong?<p>Whatever happened to sugarplums? I'm talking, of course, about the sugarplums that danced in the sleeping heads of kids in Clement Clarke Moore's A Visit From Saint Nicholas. One wonders what happened when the kids next door came over on Christmas day. ("Whadja get? Whadja get? Sugarplums? Yeah, me, too. Only look--mine are bigger!") <p><p>As toy volume has mushroomed, toy selling has changed from an art to a science, with appropriately clinical overtones. The stakes are so high that getting inside kid's heads--so that kids can ultimately get inside their parents' heads--has achieved paramount importance. On the first floor of its corporate headquarters in El Segundo, California, Mattel has its own testing facility, called, with rather chilling corporate euphemism, the Imagination Center. There, behind one-way mirrors, executives and advertising people can watch children play with the goods and assess the sales potential. The children are allowed precisely one half hour in the center. They are given toys as payment for their participation.<p>At Hasbro headquarters, in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, it's one big room, also with a one-way mirror, called the Fun Lab. The children who participate don't receive toys, but they do get a T-shirt and a small toy, and as a Hasbro company spokesman tells me, "We know it works because the kids keep coming back."<p>The kids like it, in other words. Why shouldn't they like it? And why should they have any idea what they're actually doing?<p>It's all clean and corporate and not unworthy: The process addresses important safety and age-appropriateness issues. When challenged on the moral worth, the imaginative capital, of a product like--just for example--Kenner's The Littlest Pet Shop, the toy people can riposte with: "The kids keep coming back."<p>"I think Christmas is less excessive than it used to be," a Hasbro executive insists. Like many other toy people I talk to, he prefers that I not use his name: High volume equals high stakes, which equals high tension. Toy companies, in marked contrast to their product, are just as grim as arms manufacturers when it comes to back watching. "There was a time not too long ago," the executive says, "when things were bad--when a parent would try to make up for his or her own shortfall throughout the year, when people would say, 'The hell with the budget.' I think parents are getting away from that. I think people are getting more sophisticated."<p>Is this really true? And, if so, could sophistication--as in computer games and teaching toys--just be another way of opting out of talking with our kids?<p>"Parents are spending much more on their kids than they used to," says Selina Guber, president of Children's Market Research of New York. "Toys have become more expensive. You also have far more dual-income families"--hence more absent, and guilty, parents--"and you have baby boomers, who have fewer children and are more interested in educational toys, which are quite costly. And children are more involved in family life than they used to be--parents are apt to go along with what kids want."<p>How do kids know what they want? The toy companies tell them. Relentlessly. "Seventy to 80 percent of all TV advertising comes in the fourth quarter," says Ogilvy & Mather's Manduke. "Particularly the big-ticket items, like video games and accessories. Happy Holidays Barbie retails for $35; they don't even market it until November and December. Mom's propensity to buy a $35 doll just doesn't kick in till then. But in that period, they'll sell a million units."<p>Does Manduke feel conflicted about what he does for a living versus his own three-year-old child's still-to-be-awakened mercantile consciousness? "Absolutely," he says. "Yes, I'm concerned about the blitz of TV pitches he's going to encounter. There's no question that television advertising is creating demand among children. That's what we're in the business of doing.<p>"But I put it back to the parents," he says. "Parents have the ability to limit and focus TV watching and toy buying. They don't have to just walk down the aisle of Toys 'R' Us and throw everything in the car. The burden of striking a healthy balance for kids falls back on the parent."<p>He's right--but it falls so heavily.<p><p>I went to fao schwarz, looking for the magic of christmas past. It had passed. "Our serious escalation begins November 1," said John Eyler, president and CEO of the company, as he walked me around Schwarz's flagship Fifth Avenue store in New York. It's quite a store: a kind of toy-buying theme park, running at a jazzed-up '90s pace, from its giant robot elevator and its wall of video monitors advertising Nintendo's Mortal Combat game to its crisp, customer-beckoning displays for such big-ticket gizmos as CD-I and 3DO video game machines. <p>I remember FAO Schwarz from my youth as the very Temple of Toys, a pricey but creamily magical emporium, with a touch of Olde New York (and old Europe): heavy on the dolls, stuffed animals, and wooden trains. Any lingering resemblance to that misty old Babes in Toyland tonality is fleeting at best. These days Schwarz (which everyone in the company carefully pronounces "Shworz," rather than "Schwartz," as though to avoid any uncorporate taint of ethnicity) is a 26-store chain, a multimillion-dollar business owned by the giant Dutch conglomerate K.B.B. Miracle on 34th Street is dead. As if to emphasize this fact, Barbie's white fiber-optic eyes, on the big sign in the Barbie store-within-a-store at FAO Schwarz Fifth Avenue, follow the shopper with a cold technological insistence.<p>Nor does Eyler, the Schwarz CEO, bear any resemblance to some avuncular--or even flinty with a heart of mush--ideal of a toy-store boss. Gray-haired but boyish, smooth-faced and cool-eyed, he is the very model of the modern young chief executive. His business card has FAO Schwarz's rocking-horse logo on it, but that doesn't mean he's sentimental about toys. This is war, and he knows it. Yet it's a war in which Schwarz has captured what he considers the high ground. "Our merchandise overlap with Toys 'R' Us is only about 20 percent," Eyler says. "A third of our merchandise--take an item like Rockette Barbie--is exclusive with us. Another third you'll find at just a few specialty stores."<p>He looks me straight in the eye. "We do no promotional advertising at all," he says. The withering implied reference to Toys "R" Us's TV and Sunday-supplement insert blitzes isn't lost on me: The "I don't want to grow up/I'm a Toys 'R' Us kid" jingle plinks insipidly in my mind's ear. "We've never had a sale," Eyler says. "And the toys in FAO Schwarz aren't stacked up out of reach on shelves. Every toy in the store may be played with. Instead of spending money on advertising, we spend it on our selling associates. Our people aren't just salespeople. They're really expert toy consultants."<p>In confirmation of this, winsome, perky, stupefyingly well-informed selling associates pop out at every turn as Eyler and I walk around the store. Granted, the presence of the Big Kahuna can't help having a galvanizing effect--but one gets the sense these toy consultants would be galvanic on their worst day. They know their merchandise cold. <p>Things at Schwarz Fifth Avenue are heating up. "The month between Thanksgiving and Christmas accounts for about 25 percent of our overall volume for the year," Eyler says. "The Fifth Avenue store is open from nine in the morning till nine at night for the holidays, and by 10:30 in the morning, we're at full store capacity. A line forms outside, and the wait to get in can be anywhere from three minutes to an hour."<p>The preparation for this onslaught begins soon after the previous Christmas, in January, with cleaning, painting, and preventive maintenance. "By May we're beginning our final preparations," Eyler says. "The merchandise is in, and the primary maintenance has been taken care of. Then in July, August, and September, we install the holiday displays. By November we're ready. We install 40 extra cash registers for Christmas."<p>And how does this Christmas look for FAO Schwarz? We're standing by the foot of the escalator, where a big talking stuffed bear in a red BMW convertible gives directions to the store's various sections when the appropriate button is pushed. "Most retailers think it's going to be flat to 3 or 4 percent [up]," Eyler says. "On one hand, we've never been better prepared for Christmas. On the other hand, there's so much uncertainty this year--about the tax bill, about the health-care plan. My biggest concern is if the health-care issue lingers throughout the holiday. Uncertainty is the worst enemy of the retailer." We glance at the bear, which is telling a couple of openmouthed kids how to get to the Lego department. But if the bear knows anything about the effects of the health-care package, he is not talking.<p><p>You'll look in vain for holiday magic at Toys "R" Us. "All we do for Christmas is put in extra stock," says Carol Fuller, the company's spokesperson, with admirable bluntness. "There aren't any special aisles or anything. Everything is chainwide, so everything is the same." That's a lot of sameness--450 U.S. branches (a few more may have sprouted up while you read this article) and 208 international stores. The chain, Fuller says, feels its hot items this Christmas will be Playskool's Talking Barney ("because anything Barney sells," she says), Kenner's Baby All Gone, Hasbro's Baby Cries So Real, and--pushing many an average family toward, and perhaps past, its $400--Mattel's My Size Barbie, at a walloping retail price of about $129. And by the way, when Toys "R" Us announces its What's Hot List, it isn't just being wishful. Fuller can't remember the chain's ever being wrong about predicting a bestseller. "Our buyers sit here and talk to vendors all day long. It's experience," she says.<p>Isn't it amazing? The stores know just what we have to buy for our kids. The kids know just what they want. Seamless.<p>So here I am, finally, inevitably, with the wife and kids at our local branch of the Big T. It's a gray fall Saturday with spurting showers: the kind of dark day conducive to fiscal introspection and family quarrels. The Christmas season has begun. How can I tell? It's not the crispness of the air (the air is soggy) or the seasonal decorations (they're not up yet, nor, at the ever-functional Toys "R" Us, will they be); it's the stock. The aisles of the store, which in spring and summer often have a dispirited, depleted look to them (this is especially true of the video games and electronics sections, whose big-ticket offerings go begging when the holiday screws aren't on), are full to bursting. The place looks almost cheerful. Almost. If you look up, the corrugated ceiling is there to tell you what this really is: a warehouse. No, it's more than a warehouse. Warehouses are largely quiet and passive. This is a machine.<p>As we round a corner, an angry dad with a tattooed bicep has turned on his young son. "Let's get outta here," he shouts. The kid flinches. An inauspicious omen. Fortunately for us, the true pressure isn't on yet. Today is a day more for quiet contemplation in the aisles of Toys "R" Us than for the full-out, 12-hour mania that is on its way. Today is just a walk-through. The ceiling-high racks of stuffed animals stare impassively. The boxes upon boxes of Baby Alive, Baby All Gone, and Baby Check-Up await the onslaught. In the aisle devoted to the Barbie Shop--a billion dollars of business gets you a whole aisle--Army Ken at $19.99, Caboodles Barbie at $12.99, and Earring Magic Barbie at $10.99 are ready for the grabbing. Down in Manhattan, so are Rockette Barbie and Madison Avenue Barbie, each $65, exclusive to FAO Schwarz. The extra cash registers are in place. All over the country, the toys and the commercials are ready to go, as we the unready brace for the seemingly inevitable once more.<p>In a few weeks, at the last moment, my five-year-old will once again receive the final word on What He Really Wants. Last season it was Kenner's Bat Cave Command Center, a 30- or 40-buck bunch of plastic that, by the time I arrived at Toys "R" Us late one desperate close-to-Christmas night, was long gone. I remember staring at the packed, Command Center-less shelves in stunned disbelief: How, amid so much plenty, could the one essential item be missing? The single shell-shocked-looking stock person I was able to collar registered little emotion as he told me that the Command Center wasn't likely to be back before Christmas: What's Hot had become What's Gone.<p>The Bat Cave Command Center was missing at every store up and down the strip, of course, and I bought my son the Transformers instead, which went the same way the Bat Cave Command Center would have gone--into oblivion on December 26th.<p>But then, all at once, it hits me.<p>It doesn't have to be this way. I'm not the angry dad! <p>I'm not the dad who throws presents at his kid to feel I've done a decent job. I'm the dad who actually talks to my son, because I actually enjoy it and because he actually teaches me things. And I teach him things, too. So couldn't one of the things I teach him be that Christmas can be a few good presents, presents we could have fun with together or at least talk about? <p>And couldn't one of the things he teaches me be what he wants, and why? Because now that I think of it, just as my father never asked me why I wanted Mr. Machine, I never did ask my son why he really wanted that Bat Cave Command Center.<p>If he'd told me, I would have found it someplace. I swear.<p>James Kaplan's nonfiction portrait of JFK International, The Airport, will be published in June 1994 by William Morrow.<p>

Across America in search of the Great White Sale<p>By Michael Lewis<p>In the decades since world War II, there have been two great changes in the way Americans shop. The first is the gradual shift toward a pattern of consumption that has little to do with the simple satisfaction of needs. The second is the sensational rise of the shopping mall as a place to satisfy this peculiar lack of needs. In 1946 there were eight shopping malls in America. In The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs's 1961 classic on the decline of American civic life, the term mall is used only to designate any public space designed for foot traffic. Yet in America between 1970 and 1990, 25,000 shopping malls were built, each one more alluring than the last to the person whose only real need is the need to shop. <p>The prospect of 25,000 malls probably sends shivers of pleasure up most American spines. But there is also a loud minority of artists, intellectuals, and puritans who deplore the pleasures of the mall and view the modern American shopper as a kind of pervert. Having spent a good part of the boom years outside the country, I had always felt neutral on the subject. To get my fix on the modern mall, I would have to immerse myself in state-of-the-art mall culture. I selected three of the most famous malls that have gone up in the last several years, and I would spend two days in each of them. They were chosen for diversity--of place, of style, and of ownership. About the only thing they shared was size and age. These malls were new and they were big. <p><p>Horton Plaza: San Diego
Horton Plaza sits incongruously in the middle of downtown San Diego, looking as if it is dressed and waiting for a ride home to the suburbs. Built by the Hahn Co. in 1985, Horton Plaza's outdoor arcade is a delightfully improbable combination of Moorish palace, art deco studio, French brothel, and Florentine villa. At 1 million square feet, the shopping area falls right on the line drawn by mall jocks to separate the wimp mall from the he-mall. <p>What distinguishes Horton Plaza from most malls is not only that it has no roof but also that it affords views of the surrounding city. From the top floor, a shopper can gaze out over colorless, product-starved, crime-ridden San Diego and take pity on the people outside of the mall. This sensation is fully consistent with the intentions of the developer of Horton Plaza, Ernest W. Hahn. In speeches to fellow mall tycoons, Hahn has said, "The role of the developer is really now that of a sort of small city builder. He's no longer just creating stores and being the landlord." And in many ways, Horton Plaza does resemble a small city. It offers food, clothing, shelter, a police force, a government of shopkeepers, and even a curious form of citizenship--something called Club Horton:If you join, you may win $500 worth of free shopping.<p>I arrived at Horton Plaza intending not to buy anything--because I didn't need anything--but to watch other people shop.  Emerging from the parking garage were insatiable-looking types whom I followed for a while, carving half-mile loops around each of the mall's five levels. The huge majority of encounters between objects and people were flirtations that led nowhere. In Brookstone on  level one, two middle-aged men stood conspiratorially in front of a rack of plastic indoor sporting goods. One fingered the Hot Drive plastic three wood and golf ball set. "This is something else I use around the house," he said. "Maybe I should get one," said the other. But he didn't. Ten minutes later, a group of children gathered around a small, dark, sinister object resembling a miniature outboard motor. automatic nose-hair clipper, said the overhead sign. "Let's get this for the butthead," said one. But they didn't. <p>On the third circuit I spotted an empty bench in the shade not far from Lady Foot Locker. How nice it would be to sit in the sun and watch the traffic of freshly shod females. This innocent desire led to what I believed to be an innocent purchase of a copy of Lord Byron's Don Juan (to hide behind), which was on sale at Doubleday Book Shop, and a tall cafe latte with almond and chocolate sprinkles from one of the mall's many caffeine outlets. Ten minutes later a lovely lady in tennis shoes emerged from Lady Foot Locker on the arm of a man in a maroon and white striped long-sleeve cotton shirt that tapered neatly down the front and billowed like a spinnaker off the back. It was, I was forced to admit, far better looking than anything I owned. It looked, in fact, a lot like a shirt I'd seen at Abercrombie & Fitch. <p>I can't fully explain how, but this first tiny flicker of materialism somehow set fire to a Yellowstone of wants deep in my soul. Amid so many vendable goods, the ordinary process of free association was clearly fraught with danger. To think of a thing was to desire it; one desire led to another. Just as the desire for the good opinion of the Lady Foot Locker clientele propelled me into the Abercrombie & Fitch shirt department, the desire to do justice to the three new shirts sustained an hour in the Gap. The desire to alleviate the weight of my new shopping bags led me to a cafe the next level up, where Eric Clapton's new CD was playing. From my cafe table I could see the record store, and the flames leapt over from my inner fire trench and ignited another grove. I was off. Acquiring the disc, I remembered that I needed a disc cleaner. And that is when I stumbled back to Brookstone.<p>Now, no sane person would ever go out looking for the stuff Brookstone sells; indeed it's hard to imagine Brookstone outlets without shopping malls to put them in. Brookstone sells nothing but things that you know you don't need until you happen upon them in a moment of weakness: gopher traps, automatic nose-hair clippers, ultrasonic yard guards, one-handed battery-operated pepper mills, deer alerts, single-handed spring-action rasps, fast convenient garlic crushers, and giant bird frighteners. As I replaced the one-handed battery-operated pepper mill, I thought smugly that the world divides neatly into two kinds of people: those who have the inner strength to resist Brookstone and those weak-spirited souls who cannot. Then I laid eyes on the automatic beverage warmer. The automatic beverage warmer was a nifty electric square a bit larger than the bottom of a teacup. Having spotted it, I forgot all about the CD cleaner and realized, for the first time in 15 years of coffee drinking, that I was ever so slightly bothered by the shifting temperature of the coffee on my desk. <p>But enough of my personal descent. What grew clear over two days in Horton Plaza is that, contrary to popular opinion, the shopping mall has far more to do with spending time than with saving it. People may come with some goal in mind, but they seem quickly to forget what it is. None of the dozens of people whom I stalked did anything so simple as walk in, find a store, buy something, and leave. They arrived and set out in some direction only to be diverted by the design of the place, which required them to loop past stores they never intended to visit in order to reach their putative destination. The common observation that people in shopping malls seem to have so little control over their purchases leads others to conclude that they are being manipulated. But are they? <p>To answer the question, I called Jon Jerde, the Los Angeles architect who designed Horton Plaza. Before I was able to ask him anything, he told me--in the tone of voice used by one expert when speaking to another--about all the idiotic questions he is asked by laymen who think mall architects manipulate shoppers with sinister, unseen powers. As uninterestedly as I could, I asked him, What evidence of his ability to manipulate shoppers did these questioners offer?<p>"Oh, you know," he said, "the way the elevators are spaced out, thereby inducing you to walk out of your way and confront the beasties in the bushes. But look, if I was that good, I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing. I'd be rich. And anyway, impulse buying is just natural in our society. Impulse buying may be close to orgasm as the first reason that capitalists get out of bed in the morning." <p>What opened Horton Plaza to the charge of being sinister wasn't the location of the elevators but how effortlessly it gave you what you wanted: It was so pleasant to be inside. Then, too, the assault mounted on your senses by the mall fostered introversion, narcissism, and a certain lack of awareness. Why reach out when everything around you is trying to reach in? I found it surprisingly easy to sneak around behind people and snoop on their private moments at the sales racks. If people in malls so often look as though they are in a dumb trance, it's only because they are. Lulled by "Italian street music" in the corridors, seduced by the pleasing diversity of their surroundings, the shoppers give freer reign to their flightiest compulsions. <p>The most curious of these was the urge to acquire useless shards from the real world outside the mall. One of the most popular stores in Horton Plaza was the San Diego City store, owned by the city of San Diego. It consisted entirely of artifacts of civic life outside the mall: old street signs,  fire hydrants, water meters, traffic lights, fireman's boots, bus token machines. Just as all sorts of things become art when they are hung on a museum wall, all sorts of things become merchandise if they have a price tag. Since everything on sale here was at once worthless and priceless, the prices seemed somewhat arbitrary. The store manager had no idea how the city decided to charge $150 for an old traffic light. <p>Among the more popular items was a $30 sign, riddled with bullet holes, that said no shooting within city limits. One of the bullet holes looked as if it were made with a TOW missile. "What made this?" I asked the clerk. "I don't know," he said. "The police department takes them out and shoots them for us."<p>It was the end of my second day and time to move on. As I left, a delicious shudder passed through me: Here was an imitation of a genuine city sign being sold by a genuine city inside an imitation of a genuine city. <p>
Cherry Creek Mall: Denver
Not until you become one yourself do you realize how many signs and signals in our society are directed at the pro shopper. As the desk clerk handed me the key to my hotel room--in an Italianate Loews in suburban Denver--she said something I would not normally even have heard, much less salivated over: "We offer a complimentary shuttle service to the Cherry Creek Mall."<p>The next morning a friendly young man  drove me to the mall. "What brings you here?" he asked. "I came to shop," I said. That failed to impress him. "A magazine is paying for it all," I said. "All right!" he said, and high-fived me over the front seat. On the way to Cherry Creek, he described some of the many hotel guests who flew in from Texas just to shop at the mall. One woman--"a friend of the Kennedys"--came up three times a year from Dallas. She would ask him to let her off a block away from the mall for fear that she would be seen in a limo and charged higher prices. <p>I had a bad feeling about Cherry Creek the minute I arrived. It was spotless, white, wide-open as an aircraft hangar, and as free of unseen forces (that is, charm) as it was when it opened in the summer of 1990. On the heels of Horton Plaza, it felt sterile. The genius developer James Rouse has said, "Shopping is the most democratic of all experiences. It includes everyone, and a [shopping mall] is the most democratic institution in the marketplace." Cherry Creek shows what happens when the mall strays too far from this noble credo. It runs 1,390,000 square feet and holds 130 shops--give or take a few. But unlike Horton Plaza, it does not have much egalitarian ambition. <p>The source of the problem is the ratio of fancy national chain stores to small local shops. The Cherry Creek shopping experience is dominated by Lord & Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nieman-Marcus and Foley's. Such heavy reliance on the glitzy chains suggests anxiety in the soul of the developer, in this case the Taubman Co. It's like inviting a celebrity to your party because you don't think anyone would show up otherwise. This struck me as a gross failure of imagination. Shopping malls offer a sense of order like exists in no city. All stores open and close together. Everything in them is new and improved. The lightbulbs always shine. When you add to this the requirement that all the customers be rich, you've sacrificed whatever diversity and unpredictability a mall might contain. Cherry Creek was about as convivial as a hospital ward. Even the handful of teenage boys exercising their God-given right to hang over the mall railing and peer down women's blouses seemed slightly unsure whether they belonged. <p>Turning quickly from the department stores, I began my mall weave, ignoring the intense pantie vibes emanating from Victoria's Secret and landing in the Body Shop. The Body Shop complicates mall values by introducing an awareness of the world outside and a concern for people who live in places where they don't have malls. In the Body Shop you need a machete to hack through the forest of depressing leaflets about the rain forest to get at the colored soaps and erotic Japanese Washing Grains. <p>The propaganda seemed not to have the slightest effect on the eager American consumers who went there to shop. The manager of the Body Shop in Horton Plaza had told me, "The ladies go berserk here. It's like a bigger bathroom for them." <p>Now, if you go into any public establishment and ask the owner about his clientele, he is very likely to say, "We get all kinds." Not so the Body Shop. The Body Shop gets one kind. And there she was! The lone woman in magenta who circled the Cherry Creek store wasn't shopping; she was strip-mining. In 17 minutes she opened and inhaled 16 bottles, scratched and sniffed 27 soaps, and mauled five soft sponges and two Footsie Rollers. She bought one green sea-turtle endangered-species soap for $1.40 and left behind an ecological disaster. <p>The only place in every mall more intent than the Body Shop on making you a better person is the Nature Company, which has all of the Body Shop's moral ambition with none of its style. Inside every Nature Company store stands a meter that insists, absurdly, that if you deposit 25 cents you will save 90 square feet of rain forest. And--presto!--all of a sudden you have gone from blissful absorption in mall life to a sense that if you keep your change, you are murdering trees. <p>The stores themselves are filled, as you would expect, with books and trinkets meant to rekindle a love of nature. But because they are intended not to give pleasure but to make you feel guilty for having failed to save the environment, their net psychological effect is to make you want to run out and kill something small and furry. Especially when you are aware that some percentage of your donation will go straight into the coffers of the Taubman Co. Dour nature lovers sit at the back of the stores beneath photographs of endangered species. They read brochures, drink Rain Forest Herbal tea and watch short nature films of the genre known as Bugs Fucking to Mozart. I suppose it is true that we organisms are in this thing together. But the forced self-righteousness of the Nature Company struck me as a basic violation of the moral code of malls, which is: <p>1. Every Man for Himself, Especially During a Sale. 
2. Don't Park in the Handicapped Slots. 
3. Don't Eat Frozen Yogurt While Pawing the Merchandise. 
4. Don't Leave the Clothes in a Steaming Heap on the Floor of the Changing Room. 
5. And if you're over 18, Don't Steal. <p>It's enough to make the serious shopper run to Brookstone and buy a dozen of those vibrating lawn stakes that send gophers sprinting for the hills and make groundhogs quake with fear. Luckily, I had a plane to catch. <p>The Mall of America: Bloomington, Minnesota 
The payoff. The Mall of America is by a couple of million square feet the largest mall in America. When it opened last year, it was spoken of in the same breath as electricity, the cotton gin, and the first landing on the moon. The Mall of America likes to recite statistics about itself: 4.2 million square feet, including communal areas, 358 stores, 46 temporary cart stalls, 12,000 permanent employees, 12,750 parking spaces, 20 acres of roofing. To its credit, it has preserved the balance between small and large stores. And though it hopes to draw a third of its business from tourists, it has so quickly integrated itself into the life of the Twin Cities in the year that it has been open that it could probably provoke a popular uprising by closing its doors. The Junior League met once in the amusement park in the center. It has nine nightclubs, eight art galleries, and a historical research center. It has its own newspaper, which includes reports of unusual incidents in stores. The day I arrived, Bakers Shoes reported, "A lady from Nebraska was going to send her daughter back on an airplane because she didn't have enough room for her in the car with all the packages they had accumulated over the weekend they spent in Minnesota." Huzzah! <p>Jon Jerde, the Horton Plaza designer, also  had a hand in designing the Mall of America, of which he is rightly less proud. "I stood there the day of the opening," he says, "and I said, 'My God, this is not what it appears to be.'" What it was, he wasn't so sure. But he felt the sheer scope of the place somehow altered the people inside.<p>This is only partly true, I think. Along the longest shopping corridors that Jon Jerde will ever design, the two main beliefs that govern state-of-the-art shopping malls--including Horton Plaza and Cherry Creek --are simply pushed to new limits. The first is that the bigger the mall, the more it will appeal to consumers (and the more free publicity it will receive when it opens). The second is that the mall should be not merely a place to shop but also a place to recreate. About an eighth of the floor space in the Mall of America is given over to an amusement park called Camp Snoopy. And the stores strive to divert their customers in all sorts of seemingly unprofitable ways. For example, the Oshman's Super Sports USA store contains a basketball court, batting cage, archery range, golf simulator, and ice rink. After every meal I wandered over, shot a few hoops, played three holes, and took a few dozen cuts at a hard softball. <p>Anyone who has tried to fit a large bucket of popcorn between his legs during a movie knows that there are limits to the joy of bigness. The larger and more complex the mall becomes, the more it tends to mimic the society outside of it. Already there have been three violent incidents in the Mall of America: One woman reported a sexual assault, a man has been shot, and an off-duty Minneapolis cop was arrested for leaving one of the mall's bars and shooting off his gun in the fifth level of the parking garage. This is very bad news because one of the reasons people go to malls is that they are not like the surrounding cities. <p>What's more, as a mall expands, it begins to consume itself. It defeats its own purpose of putting everything you need within walking distance. The Mall of America raises the possibility of employing a team of Sherpas to pack your booty out. The only people larded with possessions, I noticed, were an overweight middle-aged couple on electric scooters. Their baskets were so full they could hardly see the road, and so they ricocheted off the potted plants and vanished down one of the long corridors to the envy of us all. <p>So for two days I snooped around the place struggling with my inner shopper and interviewing salespeople. Despite the fact that I didn't see many people buying much, all of the salespeople seemed to be "exceeding their quota." (At the heart of the American economy lies this paradox: Even while it is on the skids, every salesman is more successful than ever.) But when you spend two days in any mall, you acquire goods by osmosis. And eventually there came the most poignant moment in any pro shopping career: when the compulsion to buy more stuff requires you to buy more luggage to put it in. <p>Hovering over a black leatherette sack fat enough to hold a newly acquired mini basketball goal, I acknowledged my debt to all those who have done so much to promote the cause of insatiability. Truly, in this world, there is no such thing as too much. The woman at Bentley's Luggage & Gifts said that my predicament was considered normal within the some 4,000 walls of the Mall of America. That's why she was exceeding her quota. <p>Of course, when I finally got home, I found that I didn't much like anything I had bought, except for the indoor mini basketball goal. The human imagination imputes greater value to objects when they belong to someone else, and so we end up buying all sorts of things that give us  far less pleasure than anticipated. I am told that the purist postpones consummation. He browses. He fends off vampirish sales clerks with those silver-cross words: "Just looking." But the thing is easier said than done, especially when one has the capacity for deep regret. It is easier to leave the mall than to get the mall to leave you. In the days that followed my trip, I began to recall the many flirtations I had enjoyed: the olive sports jacket in the Gap ; the Bang & Olufson CD player ; the AT&T phone with the visual display; the gopher traps. <p>I am haunted by objects. <p>

						September 1993 <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> PO' BOYS ON PARADE  <p>Ninety-four years ago Thorstein Veblen gave us his Theory ofthe Leisure Class.  Today, he'd probably wonder: Where's theleisure? Where's the class?  <p> By Richard Todd  <p> We have all been influenced by Thorstein Veblen's classic study,The Theory of the Leisure Classwhether we've read it or not.It was Veblen, writing in 1899, who gave us the term "conspicuousconsumption" and thus altered our sense of the role rich peopleplay in our society. I turned to Veblen not long ago becauseI was feeling perplexed about society, particularly about whythose in its upper reaches seemed to be letting me down.   <p> For instance:  <p> The New York Times Magazine features a cover story on DavidGeffen, a name vaguely known to me. He has a billion dollars,made in the record and movie businesses, and he rides aroundtown (New York) wearing jeans, a Gap T-shirt, and a white painter'shat turned backwards. He stops in to see his friend Calvin Klein.Geffen admires the blue jeans Klein is selling. Klein tells him,"It's the poor look. This is the '90s. You don't want to lookrich."  <p> I meet a young friend for lunch, a beautiful woman of (as theyused to say) "independent means." "I must tell you," she says."I have a personal trainer. Edward." "And how is Edward?" I ask."Well, our first session he made me do 500 sit-ups. Then I threwup." I was curious about how Edward, who I learned was beingpaid $60 for a 40-minute session, had made her do 500 sit-ups."He just yells, Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!' "  <p> William Gates, the richest man in America, has completed hishouse, a $35 million mansion. It is built largely underground.  <p>  <p>Before we go on, a quick Veblen refresher. In The Theory of theLeisure Class, Veblen, an economics instructor at the Universityof Chicago, perceived that the accumulation of wealth led tomore than material pleasures. Even in America's supposedly classlesssociety, there was a ceremonial quality to being rich. Veblenwas writing in an age that had seen the splendid excess of therobber barons and the formation of the great industrial fortunes,of gold dinner services and palazzos imported stone by stone,of Vanderbilts and Morgans and Rockefellers. It was his drollinsight that this indulgence wasn't purely self-indulgence. Therewas a trickle-down effect, too: Society's most privileged were"solemnly" obligated to demonstrate to their inferiors how tospend money.   <p> Like an anthropologist on a South Seas island, Veblen delineatedthe tribal mores of gilded-age wealth, laying bare the pretensionsof the rich in wonderfully ironic prose. Objects that might seempure indulgence, he pointed out, were in fact useful and necessaryas emblems of one's station. "Waste" was not waste at all, buta way of proclaiming freedom from want.  <p> And there was nothing more important to waste than time; thusthe leisure class. A suitable indolence demonstrated how farremoved one could afford to be from work, and from this followeda consistent logic of leisure time. Sports and games were valuedfor the nonproductive time required for learning them. Elegantmanners reflected idle hours of instruction, and clothes weremore attractive for their impracticality.  <p> What, then, would Veblen make of a billionaire in a backwardspainting cap, cruising around working the phones in his limousine?I don't know, nor am I sure what he would think of servants hiredto perform torture, or of captains of industry who bury theirhouses.  <p> In other words: Where's the leisure? Where's the class?  <p>  <p>One of the difficulties of talking about class in America isdefinition. Although Veblen doesn't specify the boundaries ofupper-class life, it's plain that neither he nor his readerswere in any doubt about their own location on the social scale.Not so for today.  <p> During last year's presidential election campaign, one got asense of the popular conception of the upper class when BillClinton found it acceptable to propose increasing the taxes ofonly "the rich"; to wit, those earning more than $200,000 annually.(Of course, the number has subsequently been revised downward,but that's another story.) Two hundred thousand dollars is alot of money in a country where one out of ten people dependson food stamps. It puts you in the top 2 percent of the nationsocio-economically, and that itself ought to qualify you to jointhe leisure class. But it's not my impression that many peopleearning $200,000 a year feel rich, much less leisured.  <p> Let's conjure up such a household. I see a couple the age, well,of the president and his wife. Theirs is a blended family, livingcomfortably on Russian Hill in San Francisco, with two college-agekids (by earlier marriages) and a little girl of their own whoattends a private day school. They have a cabin in Sonoma County,and both work. Nice. But not, perhaps, sybaritic. To borrow aneconomist's term, their TMT index (tuition, mortgage, taxes)claims about $140,000 of their income, and after items like insurance,food, and clothes, there isn't an enormous amount left over forLeisure Class dues. Nor do they have a lot of timein the corporatelife, it's not easy to coordinate vacations; last year they hada week together. Spent it scuba diving in the Galapagos. Swalloweda lot of salt water, got great slides. Husband came home witha sinus infection.  <p> Even at higher reaches, inside the charmed circle of the top1 percent of earners (entry level currently $350,000), life oftenfails to provide the insouciance that Veblen evoked. The nationgot a glimpse into a household well into the 99th percentileearlier this year during poor Zo Baird's 15 minutes of fame.Twelve-hour days, a long commute, and baby-sitter problems. Nota restful life. Tell Zo about Veblen's theory about domestichelp, that having a maid is a matter of merely symbolic importance.Tell Zo about Veblen's sense of the ornamental role of upper-classwives!  <p> Being well-to-do in America is a paradoxical business. Comparedwith much of the rest of the world and all of human history,it means being absurdly privileged, but it also means being harried,stressed. And indeed this is a condition that seems to have beenelevated into a virtue.   <p> Stress, not bountiful ease, seems to be the lifestyle lessonthat the upper-class models for the rest of the society; busy-nessis becoming our liturgy, if not our national religion. Idle hoursare to be filled with purpose. The New York Times reports thatthe fashionable aide for Hollywood stars to have is a "politicalconsultant," someone who can brief you on political issues whileyour trainer hollers at you. Suffering is chic even on holiday;one of this year's favored vacation spots is Siberia.   <p> Still, with personal fortunes now mounting into the billions,there ought to be a few people with time to call their own. <p> According to Forbes magazine's most recent listing of the richestAmericans, some 50 individuals (or family groups) now enjoy fortunesof more than a billion dollars. This is different from earning$600,000 or $800,000 a year as a corporate lawyer, differentfrom having a million or two put away. One billion dollars doessuggest, at the very least, a life of ease, with time to offerone's less fortunate fellows a lesson or two in graceful living. <p> But the thumbnail sketches Forbes provides of its richest peoplecan be disheartening for those of us who like to imagine thatsomewhere there are people who are showing us how it's done,illuminating through their purchases and their play, as Veblensaid, "what scheme of life the community shall accept as decentand honorable."  <p> Here are some phrases from the mini-biographies of the richest:"Shoots hoops in backyard," "I'm basically a peasant," "allegedvacation spot: Disney World," "works, on average, 12-hour day.Enjoys running, even off job," "Got to get to work. Got to paythe bills," "somehow I've gotten more seedy as time goes on,""flies coach."  <p> Flies coach?!  <p>  <p>The late Sam Walton, who flew coach when he wasn't piloting himselfin a light plane around his empire of melancholy discount stores,was asked why he didn't get himself a better car. He made a pointof driving to the office in a battered pickup. He replied, "AmI supposed to haul my dogs around in a Rolls-Royce?"  <p> Walton lived in a modest ranch house. Just like the modest housethat Warren Buffett, the billionaire genius-investor, still hasin Omaha (purchase price: $30,000), though, as Michael Lewispointed out in The New Republic, Buffett doesn't actually livein the ranch house. He also keeps a lavish apartment at the Plazain New York and a beach house in Malibu.  <p> And then there is Ross Perot, whowhatever one might think ofhis ideologyno one would confuse with an arbiter of taste. <p> It is my theory that something is going on with the very rich,and even with the relatively rich, that was not predicted byThorstein Veblen. For lack of a better term, let us call it CovertConsumption.  <p> Do not misunderstand. I do not think that human nature has radicallychanged, or that greed has been eliminated from our culture.When billionaires get together to play, they must still derivepleasure from comparing toys. David Geffen has a $26 millionGulfstream jet; surely this must give him some sort of snug satisfactionas owners of lesser airplanes step aboard ("Hi! Like my jet?Like my painter's hat?"). But stylish public behavior for thecontemporary billionaire includes a po' boy routine.  <p> In broader, social terms, one sees the same phenomenon in thecircled-wagons habit of the very rich. Once people built mansionsin the cities that generated the wealth; now they commandeerwhole other towns, such as Aspen, and turn them into privateplaygrounds.  <p>  <p>It is altogether fitting that the apotheosis of covert consumptionshould be the richest man in America, William F. Gates, 37 yearsof age, founder and chairman of the Microsoft Corporation. Hecommands a fortune totaling $7.3 billion. This is really quitea lot of money when you consider that the amount in excess of$7 billion would itself make him one of the richest people inthe country.  <p> Much has been written, understandably, about the technologicalgenius of this man and about his business prowess, but he hasnot been credited as a person of style, his style being the apparentlysuccessful effort to shrug off centuries of social expectations,to have no style. For the social historian, a figure larger thanlife. The Vanderbilt of today. But so covert is his consumptionthat we have only glimpses of his styleor lack of it.  <p> Gates abhors vacations, but has been persuaded to take them.According to "a former girlfriend," "one of our trips had a physicstheme. We collected tapes by guys like Richard Feynman and readall sorts of books."  <p> He is known for his personal dishabille. Dandruff litters hisshoulders. He wears color-coordinated outfits, of the kind hismother used to lay out for him in boyhood. Some days are beigedays, some days are green. Recently, though, he seems (on theevidence of a news photo) to have bought a business suit.  <p> He is, as one novelist has said, the best subject for fictionour age has produced.   <p> His consummate word of contempt is "random."  <p> It is his mansion that says most about him. This house, witha little less than an acre of floor space, is built into theside of a hill. It is virtually invisible. Tunnels connect manyof its partsits library, its vast garage. The land it lies beneathhas been rigorously inspected by the architects and landscapedesigners to make certain that only indigenous trees and plantsare present. As nearly as possible, he has built the house asif it were not there. Its statement is that it refuses to makea statement.  <p> The best part is the art collection. There is no art collection;instead, Gates has installed high-resolution television screensthroughout the house, on which he can access images of up to100,000 paintings to which he has bought the electronic rights. <p> One can see why he would not collect art: It's too random. Andthere is another reason, a concept of the cybernetic age: Informationis more valuable than the thing, any thing.  <p>  <p>Across the country lives another billionaire, the 86-year-oldPaul Mellon. He lives in a manor house on a 4,000-acre estatein Virginia. He does collect art, by which he means actual paintings,Renoirs, that kind of thing. He has fewer billions than Gates(two fewer). He describes himself as "picture poor." I see himsuddenly with a rush of pity. He represents an old paradigm:the belief that the world has an inherent order, that it's avast English landscape in which, according to one's rank, onelives atop the hill or in the valley, grandly or humbly, andthe more money one has, the more right and duty one has to support,conserve, and, by God, to own beauty.  <p> This is all fading, I see now. Mellon represents the past. Gatesstands forisa future of irresistible abstraction, lightnessof being, freedom, disengagement. He seems to reject the veryconcept of a social order, and with it, any responsibility hemight have to it.   <p> It ought to be a good thing for all of us, the Age of the UnpretentiousBillionaire, the triumph of the Anti-Leisure Class.  <p> Why then do I feel strangely nostalgic for the robber baronsof Veblen's day? They built their mansions foursquare on NobHill or Fifth Avenue, right out in the open for everyone to admireor mock. Their carriages had clear glass windows and they strodeinto their pews on Sunday morning. Nor were they busy or "stressed."They gave orders, sailed off to Europe for six weeks, came backto find the orders carried out. They had a vision of the world.Andrew Carnegie put libraries in countless towns across Americabecause he thought they would glorify America and Andrew Carnegie.John D. Rockefeller handed out dimesseed moneyto worthy-lookinglads. Their vision was not complicated; it was gloriously vulgar:Be like me! But in all their arrogance, and thievery, at leastthey acknowledged the rest of the world.  <p> I'm beginning to think, honestly, that Veblen was a little roughon the leisure class. He didn't see what was coming down thepike: people who would want all the money and not even want togive us a little style in return.  <p>  <p>Richard Todd is an editor at Houghton Mifflin, where he has hisown imprint.  <p>  <hr>  <p>Copyright 1993 Capital Publishing Limited Partnership.

 BEWARE THE COLOR MAFIA 
<p>
Today's color scheme can be tomorrow's headacheespecially when
it comes time to sell a house  
<p>
 By Margaret Opsata  
<p>
 As disco music blared, lady liberty and Uncle Sam announced
the finalists: H-Blue-O, Purple Haze, Kilim, Grunge, and 37 lucky
others.   
<p>
 A high school talent competition? An audition for Star Search?
No, a recent meeting of the 1,300-member Color Marketing Group,
a little-known organization that represents about a thousand
major U.S. manufacturers and dictates the colors that appear
on everything we buy, from apparel and automobiles to wall coverings
and washing machines.  
<p>
 The Color Marketing Group's stated mission is to analyze social
influences and "scientifically" translate the result into a palette
of 40-odd colors for which Americans will clamor two years hence.
After pondering such weighty matters as "the economy, the environment,
international politics, changing social issues, and cultural
events," CMG decided that in 1995 we should be swathed in such
hues as Manatee (a "medium-dark, muted brown [that] reveals a
hint of warmth hidden within"), Raintree ("this soft blue-green
leads us away from teal into a new level of sophistication"),
Artemisia ("a beautiful silver-green, a healing color from the
garden to bring into the home"), H-Blue-O ("an aquatic addition
to our palette, it speaks of clear, clean waters and inspires
new hope for the future"), Purple Haze ("spiritual and gender-neutral,
it layers purple with a smoky complexity"), Kilim ("borrowed
from ancient textiles, this sun-washed natural red links us to
our multi-cultural heritage"), and Grunge ("this gray-green reflects
youthful rebellion against establishment brights").   
<p>
 To hear the members tell it, theirs is a difficult, thankless
task fraught with peril. "If we are early with a color, it will
absolutely die on the shelf. If we are late, we only catch the
end of the color," explains Melanie Wood, a CMG board member
and corporate director of design at Mannington Mills, Inc., in
Salem, New Jersey.   
<p>
 In most cases, however, CMG's color forecasts become self-fulfilling
as member designers dash back to their drawing boards and specify
the newly selected colors for their product lines. Soon CMG's
predictions are splashed across glossy advertising layouts, paraded
on couture runways, even seen in Murphy Brown's newsroom. The
goal, of course, is to convince consumers that their lives will
not be complete unless they are wearing, walking on, washing
with, and eating from these "with-it" colors.   
<p>
 CMG and its members, who seem so astute when it comes to predicting
color preferences, grow vague when asked how long any particular
color will remain in vogue. But a quick analysis suggests that
colors selected by the group have a longevity of only one or
two years before they and their fanciful names disappear from
the leading edge. Indeed, not a single color from the 47 that
CMG designated for 1993 remains on the palette for 1995.   
<p>
 Of course, when you're buying relatively low-cost clothes that
wear out in a relatively short time, staying in style with the
latest fashions can be fun with no downside. But when you're
buying or redecorating a house, the stakes are much higher. It's
hard to think of anything that dates a home, and drags down its
value more, than carpeting and appliances in trendy colors from
decades past.  
<p>
 A more prudent approach is to make as few color statements as
possible on walls, carpets, cabinets, and appliances. "Keep these
neutral by using off-white, beige, or taupe, then add your color
punch with accessories: bright towels, pretty kitchen canisters,
matted prints, and so on," advises Kenneth Charbonneau, color
and merchandising manager at Benjamin Moore & Co. in Montvale,
New Jersey. "If you must use fun' colors, put them in selected
areas like a child's room or the powder room." When accessory
colors go out of style, as they inevitably will, the items can
be replaced easily and inexpensively.   
<p>
 Redecorating a kitchen is among the biggest challenges that
homeowners face, because kitchen color statements generally are
made not with $5 prints and $10 towels, but with $1,000 appliances.
Unfortunately, millions of Americans were seduced into buying
these appliances in once-trendy Harvest Gold, Avocado, and Coppertonecolors
that now are as old-fashioned as leisure suits. Outmoded but
still-functioning appliances in these dated hues can be repainted,
but the result is usually disappointing; true enamel paint must
be applied at high temperature under pressure, and this is rarely
done because of the cost.  
<p>
 Not surprisingly, some designers propose an "avant garde" approach"Surround
Avocado appliances with '90s colors that have some pizzazz, perhaps
a lightened fresco green and some yellow, then pop it with magenta
or fuchsia," suggests onebut people who don't want to breakfast
in an Andy Warholesque setting may have no choice but to replace
all the appliances, as they would when one finally wears out.
Anyone redecorating a kitchen today should consider only two
colors for the appliances: white or stainless. "White is definitely
the color American consumers prefer, but stainless is the better
long-term purchase," says Richard Holbrook, whose Pasadena, California,
firm designs appliances for Thermador and Casablanca Fan Company.
He points out that companies serving the European market, which
tends to be three to five years ahead of the United States, exhibited
largely stainless and mirrored-glass-plus-stainless products
at the recent 1993 International Appliance appliances at the
high end," Holbrook says, suggesting that white, long thought
to be a timeless color, may itself be on the way out.   
<p>
 On the selling side, homeowners preparing a house for sale should
resist the impulse to repaint and recarpet every nook and cranny.
"We all presume to have the best of taste, but others rarely
agree," says Benjamin Moore's Charbonneau. Instead of trying
to predict whether buyers would prefer Gray Moss or Cornmeal
in the master bedroom, focus on getting the house in clean, move-in
condition and let the new owners repaint.   
<p>
 When repainting is necessary, worry less about the interior
than about the front exterior and the entryway. "The sale is
lost if the buyers mentally reject the house before they get
inside," says color-forecaster Margaret Walch. Painting the front
door is an easy and inexpensive way to project clean-and-well-cared-for.
And if only one room is repainted, make it the one behind the
front door. When it exudes cleanliness and friendliness, the
prospective buyers will be predisposed toward the rest of the
house. They are more likely to accept structural shortcomings
like a narrow flight of stairs or an undersized bathroom window
they may encounter later on their tour.   
<p>
 When buying a house, new owners should encourage the seller
to take along any carpets, curtains, or kitchen appliances in
unfashionable colors. Doing so will rid the place of unwanted
hues and can often be used as a bargaining tool to negotiate
a lower purchase price, since many sellers are tickled radicchico
to receive the unexpected windfall.  
<p>
 Of course, color problems are only opportunities for the color
mafia. Some design professionals, like Walch, contend that mismatched
color schemes are actually "in" these days. "Happily, the whole
'50s idea of matching sets is a very antiquated one," reports
Walch. "The new color psychology is that things that are slightly
off are pleasing," Walch reports. Other designers, like Wood,
believe that old and new shades can be aesthetically blended
by using "bridge" colors. "Currently, for example, a soft, warm
peach would take us from the red/blue-based colors we had in
the past and move us over to the warmer yellow-based colors that
we are experiencing now," Wood says.  
<p>
 Bridge colors, mismatches, and avant-garde solutions; consumers
are no match for a group of determined designers who use double-speak
to defend their penchant for annually producing a new palette.
The odds are particularly stacked against homeowners who make
color choices they'll not only have to live with for years, but
will probably have to sell to someone else later. Since they
cannot win the color game, they probably should not even try.
Resist decoratiing in colors that are destined to disappear quickly
from showroom floors, leaving the home a veritable museum of
last year's art.

						By Jeff Blyskal<p>So, you're a San Francisco power couple making $100K a year each and it's career-crossroads time. Do you pull up stakes and head east to, say, New York or Boston? Do you stay put? Or do you just chuck the apartment in the city for a house in the burbs?<p>Tough emotional choices, to be sure, but they deserve economic consideration, too: Relocation can involve big cost changes in everything from rents and mortgages to taxes and costs of living. One way to eyeball these differences is with ReloSmart, a relocation software program from Right Choice.<p>To test this program, I imagined a San Francisco couple grossing $200,000 a year, paying $1,512 a month in rent for a 1,200-square-foot apartment, $1,700 a year for auto insurance, and $75 a month for electricity. A rudimentary financial profile, I know, but that's pretty much all ReloSmart wanted to know in order to calculate the big-picture cost changes associated either with renting a similarly sized apartment in New York City, Chicago, or Boston, or with purchasing a 2,000-square-foot home in Scarsdale, New York; Wellesley, Massachusetts; or San Rafael, California. (The software covers hundreds of U.S. cities.)<p>Chicago turns out to be the best choice. Moving there yields a rather broad-shouldered reduction of $18,000 in annual costs, primarily from cheaper rents and significantly reduced state and local income taxes. ReloSmart also shows what happens when that $18,000 is invested yearly in a vehicle that returns 6 percent for 30 years: It becomes $1.46 million.
Relocating to New York City, on the other hand, will cost the couple more than $23,000 per year in higher state and local income taxes and in miscellaneous expenses. ReloSmart doesn't define these miscellaneous expenses -- at nearly $18,000, they're the largest portion of the increased costs -- but I imagine that they include $75 parking tickets and $3 cups of latte. A potentially greater sacrifice: That $23,000 invested at 6 percent could be worth $1.87 million in 30 years.<p>ReloSmart is a good scratch pad, charmingly simple and useful in 
its narrow way. (Forget about multimedia dazzle.) But its limited range and power would prevent me from paying an overpriced $80 for it. Then again, I'm not planning to move anywhere soon.<p>FROM BAY TO....
The change in yearly costs for the model couple to relocate from San Francisco to: 
Chicago: -$18,487
Boston: -$4,824
San Rafael: +$7,504
Scarsdale, NY: +$8,229
Wellesley, MA: +10,521
New York: +$23,632<p><p><p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Columns  <p> WHERE IS THY STING? <p>Your financial afterlife doesn't have to be as scary as the fright-mongers would have you believe  <p> I can make you shudder with two words -- estate planning. These words trigger basic anxieties: fear of death, fear of probate, fear of taxes, and fear of lawyers.  <p> Only one of these fears, however, is at all reasonable. So gather your courage, and we will take a run through the bogus ones. <p> FEAR OF PROBATE <p>Probate is what happens when you -- ah, sorry -- die, leaving the disposition of your property outlined in a will. It's a procedure in which a state court supervises the executor of the will, who is responsible for collecting and distributing your assets. (Somethings don't pass through probate -- property owned jointly and insurance and pension benefits with designated beneficiaries.)  <p> Sounds harmless enough. So why is this process often referred to as the "anguish of probate"? Why all the articles, books, and even seminars explaining how to avoid probate? Because, according to the fright-mongers, probate involves exorbitant fees and unconscionable delays. Indeed, to hear them tell it, probate hasn't changed since Dickens gave us Jarndyce versus Jarndyce, a case that dragged on through generations, slowly stripping the estate of all value. <p> It is true that probate costs, which consist largely of lawyer and executor fees, are set high by some states. For example, in Florida and California, attorney fees average around 3 percent of the value of the estate, and executor fees in Arkansas and Wyoming start at 10 percent of the estate. The total average cost ranges from 5 percent to 8 percent.  <p> Nevertheless, most lawyers will waive the state schedule of fees and charge on an hourly basis. So even if you have a huge estate, if it is simple and your records are good, the costs can be quite reasonable. In New York State, for instance, a paralegal can fill out four to six pages of probate forms for about $200. Executor fees can also be waived. However, when the executoris a beneficiary of the estate as well, it sometimes makes sensefor the executor to charge the maximum, because this expense reduces the taxable value of the estate.  <p> It's also true that there is normally a period during which property is frozen and untouchable until the will is admitted to probate. But "horrible and unnecessary delays are unusual," according to Amy Bermingham, a trusts and estates lawyer at the New York City firm Ehrenkranz & Ehrenkranz. In New York, for instance, probate generally takes between one and four weeks. David Stack, a trusts and estates lawyer at McLaughlin & Sternin Millbrook, New York, says, "I can get a will probated in Dutchess County in three days."   <p> Even when probate takes a while, there are remedies, such as obtaining a preliminary letter of permission to administer the estate's assets. For example, just days after the chairman of a major broadcasting firm died, the executors obtained a preliminary letter that allowed the sale of company stock belonging to the estate.  <p> Simply put, probate is largely benign. Nonetheless, the anti-probate lobby, which consists  mainly of financial planners at banks and brokerage houses, relentlessly pushes its favorite alternative to probate -- the trust. Property held in trust does not go through probate.  <p> A trust is a legal relationship wherein one person holds property for the benefit of another. The grantor transfers his or her personal ownership of property to the trustee, who agrees to manage and distribute it according to the grantor's directions.  <p> The most popular trust is something called a revocable living trust, which, as its name implies, allows you to change or revoke the terms of the trust while you are still alive. Trusts do have some advantages over wills. If you own real estate in more than one state, putting that property into a trust will help avoid ancillary probate. Another consideration is privacy. Unlike wills and the probate process, the passing of property through a trust is not usually a matter of record. (In New York, some trusts, including living revocable trusts, are a matter of public record.) <p> But the drawback of a trust is that it is an empty vehicle.It must be funded. That is, after you have drawn it up, you have to put property into it: the title of your car, the deed to your house, your stocks and bonds, and the like. You have to draw up papers to assign tangible personal property -- such as furniture and silverware -- and change the name on your bank and brokerage accounts to the name on the trust.   <p> To be effective, every piece of important property should be owned by your trust. Of course, new purchases must be made in the name of the trust. Simply put, funding a trust is a hassle. <p> Trusts also cost money. Besides the costs involved in transferring property, there are lawyer fees to establish the trust. These costs are generally lower than those for probate, but not always. And some states impose waiting periods for creditors to file claims against estates with living trusts; this can delay the distribution of assets for several months.  <p> FEAR OF TAXES <p>Since most states' estate taxes involve only minor claims, this is really a fear of federal taxes. On the face of it, this anxiety seems sensible -- the Internal Revenue Service is very grabby. <p> Any estate that's worth more than $600,000 is subject to taxes. And putting your assets in a trust offers no special or clever way of avoiding taxes. Your estate gets taxed whether the property goes through probate or through a trust.  <p> Six hundred thousand dollars is not the Richie Rich figure it seems to be, however, because it includes everything you own. Everything. And once you start adding up all the everythings, you'll be surprised how fast the numbers mount.   <p> Start with your financial assets -- not just stocks and bonds but pension benefits and other retirement assets, such as IRAs; indeed, the face value of your life-insurance policy can put you way over the threshold. (The average face value of a policy in 1994 was $87,000; for people with incomes of over $100,000, it was $404,000.)  <p> Then add in all the rest: your house, weekend cottage, car, furniture, and other personal property such as jewelry and your beloved china-dog collection. "A lot of people who don't think they are rich make the mistake of thinking their estate consists only of financial assets," says Barbara Paul Robinson, a trusts and estates lawyer at Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. Moreover, all this everything is valued at fair-market value -- not what you paid for it. So any appreciation -- on your house or china-dog collection -- could easily raise the tally.  <p> The amount of your estate subject to taxes is the gross value minus debts, charitable contributions, property given to a spouse, funeral expenses, and estate-administration fees and costs. That net is called the taxable estate. Then various credits are subtracted from the taxable estate -- the most important one being the unified credit for gift and estate taxes, which can shelter up to $600,000 of value. The resulting figure, if it is over $600,000, is the number to which taxes are applied. And -- wowie -- what rates! <p> The threshold rate of the gift and estate taxes starts high-- 37 percent -- and quickly rises step-by-step to a confiscatory 55 percent on a $3 million estate. Consider what the rate does to the estate of Cain and Abel's parents. The taxable portion of their estate of $3 million, which is divided equally between their two children, should make easy millionaires of each offspring. Instead, the 55 percent bracket leaves the kids with only $675,000 apiece.   <p> But there are two ways to minimize taxes and thwart the feds: Leave all your property to your spouse or to charity. The first method, which is known as the unlimited marital deduction, is, in fact, unlimited. You can pass all of your property to a spouse without paying federal taxes. The second -- leaving your entire estate to charity -- also totally avoids taxation. These two ploys can also be used in a more limited way to reduce the value of your estate before the tax rate is applied. Federal taxes are triggered only when you want to leave property to anything or anybody else.   <p> The $600,000 credit, incidentally, is applied automatically, but you cannot take full advantage of it unless each spouse has at least $600,000 worth of property in separate accounts. (Joint ownership of property does not qualify.) Then the first spouse to die has $600,000 sheltered in his or her estate to pass onto heirs other than a spouse, and when the second spouse dies, another $600,000 can also pass to heirs without being taxed.  <p> Another way to unload taxable value from your estate and benefit non-spouses -- while you are still alive, that is -- is to take advantage of what's called the annual exclusion. This allows you to give up to $10,000 a year, every year, tax free, to as many people as you wish.  <p> And finally, there is what David Stack calls "the last, great massive loophole in estate taxes" -- an insurance trust.   <p> If you own your insurance policy, it is taxable; if someone else owns it, it isn't. So who should own an insurance policy on your life? There are two choices: somebody else, such as your children, or an irrevocable trust. The irrevocable-trust route allows you to leave the money to your children and your spouse.The trust must be irrevocable, however, because with a revocable trust, you have control over it and thus are presumed to own it.  <p> These, of course, are just basic ploys; there are fancier ones that your lawyer would be happy to explain to you. And this brings us to the last fear.  <p> FEAR OF LAWYERS <p>Although this anxiety seems justifiable, it's a waste of time. Given that the tax code is the most complicated body of law to see the light of day and given that lawyer-driven laws demand lawyer-driven strategies, you should think of your lawyer as a necessary friend. (I admit that this is a toughie, mostly because lawyers don't make it easy. Consider the following: The bound galleys of the American Bar Association's recently published guide to estate planning bore the oxymoronic, off-putting, but ultimately hilarious subtitle All the Law Every Decedent Should Know.)  <p> In short, fear of probate is unfounded, fear of taxes is reasonable but can be worked around, and fear of lawyers is misplaced exasperation. <p> Susan Lee, a contributing editor, is an economist and the author of "Hands Off! Why the Government Is a Menace to Economic Health," to be published this month by Simon & Schuster. E-mail her at sclee12@aol.com.  <p><p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> SHELTER YOUR LEGACY <p>Single-premium life insurance can save estate and income tax <p> By Tom Nawrocki  <p> If you're over 55 and have at least $600,000 in net worth to protect for  future generations, consider single-premium variable life insurance. The set up is simple: You make a single after-tax payment -- from $10,000 up -- into a policy, then direct that money into any number of investment vehicles. All growth is tax-deferred, and reallocating your investments doesn't incur capital-gains taxes if you, say, cash out  of an equity fund to get into a money-market fund. And unlike single-premium variable annuities, the death benefit is income-tax-free.   <p> If you don't need to use the money and simply want to ensure that your wealth is passed along to your heirs, have a trustee buy the policy with your money; with this move the death benefit becomes estate-tax-free as well. But this option does preclude you from choosing the investment vehicles for the money. That responsibility falls to the trustee.  <p> Single-premium variable life insurance fell out of favor inthe late 1980s when it lost some tax advantages, but it still compares well with the more popular variable annuities, says Edward L. Bayarski, president of Montauk Insurance Services in Red Bank, New Jersey. "The new generation of single-premium variable-life products are actually significantly better than those available during their heyday," he says. Many of the new plans allow more diversification than they once did, with a wider range of fund families and investment products to choose from. And the policies are more liquid than annuities, with 90 percent of their value available as a loan.    <p>

						By Kathleen Murray<p>Even if bondholders hadn't suffered disastrous losses and the average stock fund hadn't lost money last year, parents of young children would still be anxious about college costs. A four-year degree at a private college or university__never mind graduate studies__could cost over $130,000 by the time your seven-year-old goes off to school, based on figures provided by the College Board, a college cost tracking firm in New York City.<p>There may be a rich few for whom this kind of money represents an out-of-pocket expense, but most of us must plan well in advance to pay these bills. Mutual funds__particularly growth-stock funds__are still the best way to save for college over anything but the very short run, says Don Phillips, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds. "Yes, you've got a little more risk, but you're also likely to get a better return," he says. The right funds can even help parents who get a late start accumulate a respectable pool of money for their kids. "The main thing is to get started," says Lisa Osofsky, a CPA and financial planner in Iselin, New Jersey. "Then at least you have a base to build on."<p>Dollar cost averaging (investing a set amount each month or quarter) can minimize the impact of market volatility. Most mutual funds have automatic investment plans, which draw regular contributions as low as $50 from your bank account.<p>The amount you'll need to invest will vary according to your income, your child's age, and how much of the bill you intend to pay. Say you have a seven-year-old daughter. If college tuition, room, and board continues to rise at their current rate__about 6 percent annually__her total four-year tuition will be nearly $54,000 at a public school and over $130,000 at a private one. To raise $130,000, you'll need to set aside about $7,105 a year until she graduates in an investment that returns at least 6 percent annually (to help you figure out how much you'll need to save annually until your child reaches college, see the table below).<p>Years to Public Private

Sharkey, CFP, of Denver.<p>That's a sizable chunk of money, which is a good reason for turning to stocks. Bonds and other fixed-income instruments may be less risky, but putting your money in bonds paying 3 to 4 percent annually won't give you the returns you need. Phillips's personal favorite for college savings is <a name="FUND:VWUSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VWUSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vanguard U.S. Growth</b></a>, a large-cap stock fund with a $3,000 minimum investment. The fund captured a five-$ rating in our November cover story, "Best Funds," because of its low fees and solid one-, three-, and five-year total returns. Another reason Phillips likes it is that it's full of well-known stocks like <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Walt Disney</b></a>, the kind kids are likely to recognize. "It's a good way to share with them how you're saving," he says. <p>Washington, D.C., financial planner William Brennan likes <a name="FUND:MUTHX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MUTHX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mutual Shares</b></a> and <a name="FUND:MQIFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MQIFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mutual Qualified</b></a>, because in addition to growth they offer limited amounts of taxable income. We gave both these funds five-$ ratings in November. Brennan says, "My overall strategy is to try to keep the income down and focus on growth."<p><a name="FUND:TWGTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/TWGTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Twentieth Century Giftrust Investors</b></a>, a five-$ irrevocable trust fund often used specifically for college saving, is also worth considering. However, any money in this fund goes in your child's name; once it's there, you can't move it.<p>What should you avoid? Obviously, speculative or high-risk funds aren't suitable for something as sensitive as your child's education. Save the sector funds, small-cap, biotech, or start-up company funds for money you're less likely to need. You should also resist the urge to try to time the markets. Once you've selected a strategy or investment, stick with it. If you have less than ten years before your child's freshman year, start moving some of your money into fixed-income funds. Jeff Merriman, vice-president of Merriman Investment Management in Seattle, suggests dividing your investment between a fund like the four-$ rated <a name="FUND:VFINX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VFINX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vanguard Index Trust 500</b></a> and a conservative bond fund. When your kids are within five years of college, consider short-term bond funds. <a name="FUND:VSGBX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VSGBX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vanguard Fixed Short-Term Federal</b></a> invests in bonds with maturities under three years and returns averaging 7 percent (we gave this fund five $ in our December ranking of the best bond funds). And don't forget U.S. Treasury bills. You can now lock in a five-year rate of 7 percent__not bad if you want a guaranteed return up to the moment you send your child off to school. By the time junior is a senior in high school, most advisors recommend switching to a more liquid investment, like a money market fund, to get ready for tuition payments.<p><p><p>

Why credit counseling may not be what it seems.<p>By Eric Tyson <p>After three years of penny-pinching, the Federal Reserve says consumer debt is on the rise again, meaning more business for outfits like Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS), a debt-counseling organization. In 1993, more than 645,000 debtors channeled $1.14 billion through CCCS's 1,100 offices in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico. CCCS promotes itself through advertisements as a "nonprofit community service." Many of its clients don't realize, though, that the service is funded by 10,000 creditors, 31 percent of whom are credit-card issuers. <p>The bottom line: CCCS may not provide the objective help debtors need. <p>CCCS sells a monthly installment plan, typically a three-year payoff agreement, whereby it arranges with creditors to chop a debtor's interest costs by as much as 20 percent (the amount varies by creditor). In return for a fee as high as $20, enrollees mail CCCS a monthly check representing the principal and interest they owe, which is then divvied up among the client's creditors. <p>Mona Jefferson, a 49-year-old insurance- company manager and single mother in northern California, signed on for such a plan in 1993. By that time, Jefferson (her name has been changed to protect her identity) had racked up more than $130,000 in bills, thanks to large family medical expenses. When the local insurance industry slowed down, she took a 20 percent cut in income, to $90,000. Faced with $12,000 in monthly expenses on a $7,500 monthly income, Jefferson tried unsuccessfully to unload her $238,000 home. <p>Attracted by CCCS's ads, Jefferson signed on for a three-year debt-reduction plan. For a $20 monthly fee, she agreed to mail CCCS a check for $3,741 each month. CCCS then arranged to have interest charges on a few of her accounts knocked to zero, but for the most part she had to pay in full.<p>However, CCCS offered help only with Jefferson's $130,000 in unsecured debt. It didn't provide her with much-needed budgeting advice, as she had expected, nor did it help her deal with her $2,300-a-month mortgage costs. "All they wanted to know about were my credit-card and credit-line debts," she says. End result: Jefferson could only make ten months' worth of payments, largely because she borrowed $28,000 against her 401(k) account. Even this wasn't enough. Unable to keep up with her enormous monthly payments, Jefferson finally turned to San Francisco bankruptcy attorney Harry Orr. Last August she filed Chapter 7 in order to wipe out $100,000 in debts. A year later, Jefferson says, "A more appropriate name for this organization would be the Credit Card Collection Agency." <p>About 75 percent of CCCS's roughly $130 million annual budget comes from the credit industry (called "contributions" in CCCS marketing materials). Creditors voluntarily pay CCCS on average $12 for every $100 in outstanding debt it collects for them; CCCS doesn't collect payment from every creditor. CCCS also pockets the $20 in monthly service fees it collects from consumers, which, along with grants, rounds out the remaining 25 percent of its budget. In addition, CCCS receives free office space in some locations. Until last April, the CCCS office in San Francisco was located in a well-appointed downtown space provided free of charge, courtesy of Bank of America, one of the nation's largest credit-card issuers.<p>Also, it is not clear whether CCCS lives up to its IRS status as a tax-exempt, nonprofit, 501(c)-3 organization providing educational counseling. Durant Abernethy, president of the National Foundation for Consumer Credit in Silver Spring, Maryland, says, "To be a member of the National Foundation they [local services] truly have to be a nonprofit human-services organization as opposed to being in business for money." Yet its practice of neglecting to tell consumers about all practical options is troubling. Anthony Mancuso, author of "How to Form a Nonprofit Corporation" (Nolo Press), explains: "For educational purposes, a nonprofit organization should be there to benefit the public and explain the full range of options." <p>Bankruptcy, for example, is an option CCCS does not fully discuss with debtors. Although its brochures claim, "We discuss all your options," in the CCCS video "Going Broke in America: Bankruptcy and Your Alternatives," bankruptcy is downplayed. Furthermore, the average CCCS customer is dangerously loaded with more than $19,600 in consumer debt on just $24,000 in annual gross income, yet CCCS advises only 9 percent of its customers to seek legal help. Abernathy believes "that the fact they've come to us is better for their credit report than going bankrupt. Bankruptcy is appropriate for some people. "<p>Jefferson's CCCS counselor never broached the subject with her, either. "Counseling implies a range of options," she says. "I was offered one solution, a forced-payment plan." <p>Many consumers know that bankruptcy filings remain on their credit report for ten years or more; fewer realize that debt- repayment plans can also show up as uncollected debt on credit reports for seven years. Jefferson says her CCCS counselor kept her in the dark about this, too. <p><p>

That's your cue to start teaching them about saving.<p>By Neale Godfrey<p>What's the most important thing children should learn about money? "Saving it," most parents answer. The same parents, strangely enough, are responsible for America's savings rate, the lowest in the industrial world. <p>In any case, "saving it" is only partly correct. Spending it wisely is also a critical skill for children to learn.<p>Before your child can spend wisely, however, he or she must have learned how to save money. There are three fundamental reasons to save: emergencies, major purchases, and retirement. A child can readily understand the second reason; start your instruction in saving by explaining that.<p>To save money, children need a few tools. The first is a dependable source of income, from an allowance or work. They also need a place to keep their savings, a piggy bank or a real financial institution. And they need close supervision. A system that relies too heavily on self-discipline is all too likely to fail, just as it has failed from time to time in your case.<p>Start your children on an allowance by age three. At that age, most children are aware of the relationship between money and shopping. All they need to know is that when people leave money in a store, they are allowed to walk out with something they want or need.<p>An allowance should be earned for chores beyond the routine duties of caring for possessions or helping with the dishes. Receiving money is a natural consequence of performing work competently. Without chores, an allowance becomes an entitlement, fueling and energizing the "I want, I want" syndrome.<p>Don't pay half a week's allowance for chores half done. Make it all or nothing. But don't underpay, either. An allowance of 50 cents a week is way too little these days and may provide a negative incentive. Children won't work well for poor pay any more than you will. A good rule of thumb:a dollar a week for each year of age.<p>Once the child has some money in hand, provide three plastic jars labeled "quick change,""medium-term savings," and "long-term savings." Have your child put a third of each week's allowance into each of the jars. Quick change offers cash for candy and other instruments of instant gratification. Medium-term savings are for purchases that will require a few weeks of saving to finance. Get a picture of the desired item and paste it to the jar to remind the child why the money is being saved.<p>Long-term saving is important even though your children's idea of long term is probably next week. Eventually a child will understand that we all need to save for purchases or situations that are decades away, and by that point he or she will have acquired the habit of saving. <p>Encourage your child to save by matching each dollar he or she saves in the long-term saving jar with one from your purse or wallet. Kids don't have to understand the ins and outs of 401(k) plans to comprehend the benefits of a matching contribution from you. Be sure to relate your contribution to the idea of compensation for work done well, just as your employer does.<p>Three jars make a start, but you will soon acquire more: a taxes jar, a penalty jar, and others. An especially important one for many parents is the charity jar. At a very young age, children should be required to contribute to it weekly. Let them decide on the recipient.<p>Dealing with money occupies or preoccupies most of us for most of our lives. If we were ill prepared to deal with it, we can help prepare our children better. Who knows? If our kids do better than we have done, perhaps America's mediocre savings rate may even increase.<p><p>

Create and manage your own bearproof portfolio.<p>By Gerald Perritt<p>Were you one of the investors who threw in the towel during the recent market downturn? Facing down what looks like a bear market can be frightening indeed, even though we all know the virtues of being a long-term investor. <p>How can you keep your head when investors around you are losing theirs? Assemble a portfolio with modest volatility so you can stand pat during the severest of bear markets. For example, a portfolio split equally between common stocks and money market funds is only half as volatile as the stock market. Should stock prices tumble by 40 percent, the value of your portfolio will fall by only 20 percent. <p>The problem with allocating your assets this way is you reduce potential returns significantly. In this instance, your long-run annual average return potential is only about 7.5 percent. You trade return for reduced volatility.<p>It may seem impossible to trim volatility and earn double-digit returns. But by building a diversified mutual fund portfolio containing many different categories of assets, you can reduce volatility without sacrificing a lot of potential return. Call it the All-Weather Portfolio. <p>It works by spreading capital equally across seven categories of assets:blue-chip stocks, small-cap stocks, international equities, domestic bonds, international bonds, gold, and money markets. With such a portfolio, looking back over more than two decades, an investor's $10,000 initial investment would have grown to $174,700, a 13.9 percent annual return, while an equivalent investment in the S&P 500 would have grown to $112,300, or 11.6 percent annually. Even more important, you would have dodged every bear market along the way. Although stocks declined by as much as 26.5 percent in 1974, the largest annual decline in the All-Weather Portfolio was a modest 3.7 percent.<p>Remember: Accelerating inflation drives interest rates up and bond prices down. But runaway inflation also drives the price of gold higher. Thus, losses in the bond market are offset by gains in gold. Similarly, returns among the other categories of assets in the portfolio are less than perfectly correlated with one another. That levels the peaks and valleys in the portfolio's value.<p>But shouldn't lower-risk portfolios provide diminished returns? Capital-market theory says portfolio risk and return are inextricably linked - the higher the risk, the higher the returns. Does our strategy fly in the face of modern investment theory?Nope. Because the All-Weather Portfolio is more efficiently diversified than a portfolio containing a handful of domestic large-cap stocks - such as the S&P 500 index - it comes much closer to the portfolio described by efficient-market theory. In short, the All-Weather Portfolio contains a better balance between investment return and non-diversifiable risk. It works because it conforms more closely to modern capital-market and portfolio-management theory.<p>How can you assemble your own version of this portfolio? Buy no-load mutual funds that invest in each category of asset contained in the All-Weather Portfolio. With mutual funds' relatively low minimum investment requirements, an investor can create a portfolio with around $20,000 (or $4,000 in an IRA). Choose mutual funds that stay fully invested at all times and those that have low expense ratios. Use index funds whenever possible.<p>The same portfolio shown above has a beta of 0.38, versus the market's beta of 1.00; this means your funds' volatility is 62 percent below the overall market's. The portfolio has a current yield of 3.1 percent, annual expenses are 0.7 percent, and annual returns should run 11 percent to 12 percent on average over the longer run.<p>Managing the portfolio shouldn't be onerous. Set initial allocations, then rebalance them one to four times a year. Rebalancing keeps the portfolio highly diversified; it also forces you to sell funds in categories that have appreciated and add to those in categories that have fallen. In other words, you buy low and sell high.<p>This portfolio combines all the elements required for long-term investment success: Its holdings are diversified, are oriented toward the long term, and strike a reasonable balance between risk and return. It automatically requires that you buy low and sell high. Its costs are moderate and it's simple to maintain. So if you're afraid of the stock market, are constantly losing on brokers' tips, and are always buying at market tops and selling at market bottoms, the All-Weather Portfolio is just what the doctor ordered. <p><p>

Taking the peril out of playing banker to your kin.<p>By Andrew Feinberg<p>For centuries, philosophers and economists - as well as people who actually know something about human behavior - have advised us not to lend money to our loved ones. Most everyone who has gotten such advice has proceeded to ignore it, repeatedly. As Shakespeare wrote, a "loan oft loses both itself and friend."<p>Don't even bother asking yourself whether you ought to help out the next time your best friend, your sister, or your son-in-law asks for a loan. You'll come up with the money. Besides, there are other, much more interesting questions you can ask yourself. Such as: Should I insist on paperwork? What sort of terms are appropriate? If the loan is going toward an investment, how should it be structured to maximize the benefits (or minimize the losses) for borrower and lender? Should I even assume that the loan will be repaid?<p>The answer to this last one, at least, is easy: No, you should not. "If you can't afford to lose the money, don't even think of going through with the loan," advises Stuart Kessler, a senior tax partner with the accounting firm of Goldstein, Golub, Kessler & Co., based in New York City. Accountants estimate that somewhere between 20 percent and 50 percent of loans between friends and relatives are never repaid. Compare these figures to the default rates on credit card debt: typically around 4 percent. <p>Some personal loans do get repaid; loans made for emergencies, for example, are usually made good. But more often than not, personal debts are forgiven without ever coming to the attention of accountants. Loans for a down payment on a house or college tuition are the most likely to be transformed into "gifts." <p>Business loans to family or friends have a tendency to turn into tax write-offs, anticipated or not. The high failure rate of start-up companies explains this tendency only partly. Such borrowers have a habit of considering family or friends as co-investors who know well what they're doing - that is, taking a big risk - and seem unconcerned about any obligation to repay. <p>After all, if failure strikes, the unfortunate borrower has lost his business; isn't that suffering enough without further impoverishing himself to repay his family or friends? And what are family and friends for, anyway?<p>There's some validity in such rationalization. Consider what happens if the business becomes wildly successful, another Snapple or Cisco Systems: Will friends and family cheerfully accept the return of their modest loans plus modest interest while the borrower's equity makes him millions of dollars or more? Will a warmhearted thank-you note or an invitation to dine on the newly acquired yacht really compensate the lenders who made it all possible? Not very likely, even if the same lenders would have been overjoyed simply to get their money back had the business floundered.<p>One way to avoid the otherwise inevitable hard feelings that come with financing friends and family is to negotiate an equity kicker or a higher interest rate to be paid if and when the enterprise succeeds. Just keep in mind that if the business really does become a Snapple or a Cisco, a higher interest rate alone won't satisfy personal lenders. Lacking equity, lenders may be satisfied only with outright gifts of very large sums of cash or securities.<p>Whenever you lend money to someone you love or like, formalize the deal with a written loan document. It can be, but need not be, drawn up by a lawyer. A businesslike agreement has several virtues. It adds solemnity to the deal and acts to remind the borrower that repayment is expected. A loan agreement also helps counteract the human frailties that sometimes transform such deals into disasters.<p>"Without a written agreement, people may have conflicting ideas about the terms," says Lew Altfest, president of L.J. Altfest & Co., a New York City financial-planning firm. "One side hears, 'Pay me when you're comfortable.' The other hears, 'The loan will be paid off shortly.' "<p>Altfest, as it happens, learned this the hard way. Around five years ago, he extended a large business loan to a relative without bothering to execute a contract. He now believes he'll never see a nickel back. The business is floundering, and the borrower pretends the loan doesn't exist, according to Altfest. That attitude is typical but quite galling nonetheless.<p>The most useful loans for both borrowers and lenders carry an interest rate higher than the lenders could get on savings instruments but lower than the borrowers could obtain from institutional lenders. Tax laws permit some leeway in setting interest rates on such loans. To avoid income taxation created by unrealistically low interest rates, the borrower must impose a rate that varies from 4 percent to 10 percent, depending on the loan's duration. Get a rate idea from the Applicable Federal Rates table published monthly by the IRS. In general, the longer the term, the higher the rate. "If you want, you can always select the lowest possible rate by structuring the deal as a short-term renewable loan," Stuart Kessler points out.<p>Such flexibility offers ways of reducing income and estate taxes. A parent could lend money to a child at, say, 4 percent, while the child invests it at a higher rate. When the parent dies, the loan becomes part of the parent's taxable estate. But the income earned by the child's investments will stay out of the estate and be taxed at a lower rate. <p>Lending to children gives parents a way to help out their offspring in the here and now rather than from the hereafter. On the other hand, most parents know that easy money can corrupt all too easily. Common sense dictates that parents lend only to children who have shown financial responsibility, although parents will undoubtedly continue to ignore common sense in that area.<p>Restraint can weaken the corrupting potential of easy loans. Your child could settle for the cash to buy a used Jeep, for example, as opposed to a new Porsche. Your heart will prevail, but consult your head anyway. <p>Most of all, be aware than lending money is more than just lending money. It represents a control mechanism in relationships where issues of power and control are potentially destructive in the best of circumstances. Those issues will lose their potency if you prepare to accept a loss cheerfully and to forgive the loan as a gift, if necessary. Be sure you're prepared - both financially and emotionally - for the worst.<p><p>

Avoid problems by getting them to sign a lease<p>By Neale S. Godfrey<p>Remember the empty-nest syndrome  - the trauma of suddenly finding that you've got the big family house all to yourself? To more and more people, this syndrome is becoming a memory. The National Association of Homebuilders confirms that fewer heads of households aged 25 to 29 now own their own homes compared with 1982. Back then, 38.6 percent of this age group owned their homes; today that number has dropped to 34 percent.<p>One reason for this trend may be that young people are unwilling to make sacrifices such as buying a home that is smaller, less luxurious, or in a seedier neighborhood than the one in which they last lived with their parents. They may also be less willing than past generations to move in with roommates or share their housing with nonfamily members. In any case, why should they sacrifice, if there's an open-door policy back at the family manse? <p>Still, there's one device worth considering that parents and children may have not thought of: a written and formal lease or an oral, more informal one. The lease does not require legal advice. Its point is to lay out rules, quietly and unemotionally, that you and your adult children agree upon. It's a working document between grown-ups. <p>Your child may actually welcome the lease. It will spell out his or her obligations and may even relieve some feelings of dependency. Even if your child cannot share the financial burden, he or she can help with the household chores.<p>Your lease should specify the amount of rent to be paid, if any; the term of occupancy; the proration of utility, telephone, and other household costs; car privileges; issues about pets and overnight guests; and kitchen privileges and duties. <p>You may reduce the trauma of working out a lease with your child by offering to help him or her get a job. Or you could go one step further and help design a budget for your child that will help him or her reach the goal of independence. In any case, if your children are living with you, you have a right to know their finances and how they plan to become financially independent.<p>If the lease doesn't work and re-emptying the nest begins to look attractive, parents can do what other landlords do - deliver oral warnings. If that doesn't get results, you could always turn to the courts and have them instigate proceedings as they would against any other deadbeat tenants. This is most certainly playing hardball: Both you and your child will be summoned to housing court to discuss possible damages, even eviction. Not pretty and, with any luck, not necessary.<p><p><p>

Detecting the symptoms of serious financial trouble <p>By Jonathan Pond<p>Not until they reach their forties do most Americans become aware of this sobering fact: In all likelihood, they will spend more years caring for aging parents than their parents spent caring for them. <p>This is a responsibility most people freely accept. When the elderly need help, however, their children may be the last to find out about it. The trick is to spot trouble before it becomes full-blown. Specialists in family economics say that there are a number of warning signals. <p>--Changes in lifelong patterns of money management. Be on the alert for any sudden and uncharacteristic compulsion to avoid spending. It may suggest hidden money problems. This may be from a fear of outliving one's assets, but it is often a sign of something more serious. <p>--Increasing insurance coverage. The elderly are easy marks for dishonest insurance salespeople. Help your parents gauge the need for and the cost of any new insurance before they buy it. Be extremely wary of "pension-maximization life insurance," a single-life annuity product that is typically sold to pensioners about to retire, with the promise of higher monthly payouts to the beneficiary. A joint-survivor annuity is better. <p>Don't let your parents buy Medicare Gap insurance without shopping among insurers--premiums vary widely. Long-term care or nursing-home insurance is another offering to weigh carefully. It's expensive and often covers much less than buyers think. Consider alternatives to nursing homes, like home sharing, professional home care, and continuing care communities. <p>--Inattention to routine money matters. Paying bills late, threats of utility-service cutoffs, and filing income tax returns late or not at all are obvious indications of trouble. When one parent dies, pay special attention to the way the surviving parent handles money chores. You may have to take over. Execute a power of attorney or create a living trust; both allow you to manage your parents' finances without legal or management fees.<p>Advise your parents never to rush into a purchase or investment. Ask them to consult you on expenditures of $500 or more.<p>It's harder for children who live far away from their parents to watch for symptoms of fiscal dysfunction. Community programs can often help with housing problems and arrange such things as neighbor visits, deliveries of hot meals, legal counseling, and transportation. The National Association of Area Agencies on the Aging (1112 16th Street NW, Suite 100, Washington, D.C. 20036, 202-296-8130) can provide information.<p><p><p>

There are a few details no one mentions about free trade--like how it will save the Social Security system<p>By Walter Mead<p>This is not the way nafta, the north american free Trade Agreement, was supposed to work. Its enemies--most quotably H. Ross Perot--predicted a giant sucking sound as U.S. jobs drained south into Mexico. Its backers painted rosy scenarios of new jobs on both sides of the border. No one imagined armed insurrection in Mexico with helicopter gunships rocketing the outskirts of tourist enclaves and army units executing rebels in the ruins of once-sleepy market towns.<p>But this is exactly what happened in early January. To mark the inauguration of the free-trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, hundreds of Indian peasants seized six towns in Chiapas, Mexico's poorest and southernmost state. The rebels were explicit: Their rebellion, though caused by longtime poverty and exploitation, had been timed to coincide with NAFTA. The agreement, a rebel spokesman told the New York Times, is a death sentence for the indigenous people of Mexico. <p>That spokesman was perhaps a little dramatic, but unlike either the U.S. press or politicians in either country, he did articulate the true consequences of NAFTA. The NAFTA treaty is more than a free-trade agreement; to Mexico's rulers it is part of a planned national-development strategy that will change the face of Mexican agriculture and drive millions of peasants off the land. The consequences of this policy will not be limited to the occasional flash of bloody protest in the wretched boondocks of Mexico's poorest backwaters. Over the next generation, tens of millions of Mexicans, many of them displaced farmers, will cross the Rio Grande in a great wave that will affect the United States as much as did the immigration from southern and eastern Europe from 1870 to 1914. These immigrants will create whole new industries and--baby boomers take note--fund Social Security in the 21st century.<p>Anyone who knows the history of industrialization could have predicted all this. <p>Let's start with the demographic facts. According to the 1990 census, in that year there were almost 13.5 million U.S. citizens and permanent residents with a Mexican background. This was a 55 percent increase from the Mexican American population in 1980, and immigration is still on the upswing. Immigration from Mexico to the United States averaged slightly less than half a million people per year during the '80s, according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In 1991 that shot up to 946,200 new permanent legal immigrants from Mexico. To that add several hundred thousand illegal immigrants, some temporary and some permanent. A study by the Institute for International Economics estimates that total immigration from Mexico to the United States, legal and illegal, is now running at between 1.7 million and 2.3 million people each year. Even if all immigration from Mexico stopped tomorrow, natural increase would bring the total Mexican American population to 27 million by 2025. <p>But immigration won't stop tomorrow. If it simply continues at current rates, and if the Mexican American birthrate remains at its present level, there would be 74 million Mexican Americans in 2025 out of a total U.S. population of somewhere near 350 million. (That's equivalent to 80 percent of the current 92 million estimated population of Mexico.) By way of comparison, the Bureau of the Census estimates that by 2025 the African American population of the U.S. is expected to be 48 million people. <p>Will this really occur? Demographic projections are notoriously inaccurate; economics is perhaps the only academic discipline with a worse track record of prediction.<p>But trends inside Mexico that NAFTA will certainly accelerate give this prediction validity. Of Mexico's 92 million people, the 30 percent who work on the land produce only about 9 percent of Mexico's gross domestic product. Mexico's small family farms are much less productive than similar farmland worked with the capital-intensive methods practiced in the U.S. and Western Europe. <p>If Mexico is ever to become a rich modern society, most of these farmers will have to leave the land. This isn't anything to celebrate; it simply seems inevitable. In all industrializing countries, farms become larger and more efficient, and fewer and fewer hands are able to feed more and more mouths. In 1900, 39.2 percent of the U.S. population lived on the land. Today, 1.9 percent does. <p>Mexico's ruling party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), has decided that NAFTA is the way to speed up this process. As agricultural free trade is gradually phased in, more efficient U.S. farmers will gain access to Mexican markets and the price of grain will fall. This is why the Indians of Chiapas are so angry about NAFTA. The price for their corn will fall; many will have no choice but to abandon their subsistence farms. <p>NAFTA will also accelerate Mexico's shift to the kind of agriculture that can more effectively compete with U.S. farmers. Low Mexican labor costs will allow large commercial fruit and vegetable farms--modeled on the the enormous agribusinesses of California --to win a sizable share of the North American market for fruits and winter vegetables. U.S. consumers will pay lower prices; Mexico's agricultural sector will be more productive. Mexican peasants, however--if they lived in the U.S. we would call them family farmers--will be ruined in large numbers. They will have to leave the land.<p>They won't all find jobs in Mexico. NAFTA won't increase employment opportunites in Mexico's cities fast enough to handle the flood of former farmers. According to studies--prepared by pro-NAFTA think tanks, please note--the end result of NAFTA will be an increase of up to 10 percent in immigration from Mexico to the United States for the next 20 years.<p>For Mexico, this means serious discontent on the farms and in the slums of the big cities. Desperate farmers will stage incidents like the one in Chiapas. Urban workers will discover that NAFTA cannot raise their wages or improve their living standards if new unemployed workers swamp job markets and keep wages low. This combination is an explosive one in Mexico's history; it recalls conditions that bred the Mexican Revolution earlier in this century when the country overthrew a government following policies very much like those of President Salinas.<p>There is a small but real danger that Mexican unrest even on a small scale could start a vicious cycle that would block Mexico's development and plunge the country into anarchy. A few more incidents like the battle in Chiapas--next time perhaps with tourists murdered in Cancun or Acapulco--would make foreign investors nervous. The flow of investment would slow, worsening economic conditions, increasing social unrest and violence, and in turn slowing investment even further. <p>But forget all that. (I spelled out some of the investment implications of that scenario in the September 1993 Worth.) Let's assume things work fairly smoothly--that workers move without violence from Mexico's farms to its cities and then to the United States.<p>Gloom-and-doomsters, one of whom governs California, predict terrible things from the Mexican immigration. These soothsayers argue that given their huge numbers and the ease with which they can travel back and forth to the old country, Mexican immigrants will be U.S. citizens legally, but they will remain a separate people with special loyalties and a completely different culture and language.<p>Such scenarios don't seem very likely. Mexicans who live in the United States seem to be assimilating like previous generations of immigrants from other countries. They are learning English; they are entering American politics; they are giving every sign of sharing the American dream. That doesn't mean they aren't proud of their heritage, but it does mean that Mexican immigration is fitting more or less into the pattern of previous immigrations.<p>These new immigrants are going to be a huge economic blessing--a gift bigger than anything that the baby-boom and the X generations can even imagine. For shrewd investors, of course, there will be huge fortunes to be made. Tip for venture capitalists and wanna-be mutual fund managers: Spend some time in the bodegas of California, Texas, and the Middle West. Find out what Mexican-Americans are buying; find out which companies have learned to work in this market. If you've got capital to invest, help some of these small private companies grow and ultimately to go public. If you're a mutual fund manager, put together a portfolio of Mexican American stocks and send me a prospectus. This sector of the economy will almost certainly outperform the rest of the economy for the next 30 years; the time to learn this market is now. <p>But Mexican immigration is going to make money for millions of people who never put a dime in the stock market. All these immigrants--hard-working people who are very loyal to their families and very ambitious for their kids--will need housing. They are going to be willing to work hard for modest wages. They will save money to pay for education, and they will borrow money to build businesses. Economic growth is going to be faster than it would be without the new arrivals. <p>Best yet, from the standpoint of everybody over 20 in the United States today: This huge new immigration is going to bail out the Social Security system. That's right; cheer up. Mexican immigrants tend to be younger than the average citizen, and they tend to have more children. This means that--as long as we aren't stupid enough to put legal residency out of reach for these immigrants--there will be more workers paying into Social Security just when today's workers are set to retire. <p>Let anti-immigration countries like France and Japan worry about funding their old-age pension systems. The United States, this multiracial, multicultural, multireligious country that shouldn't work, but does, continues to attract immigrants. Out of our own self-interest, we should welcome these new immigrants, do our part to understand their goals and their cultures, make sure that we have a public school system that gives their kids a good start in life, and then sit back to enjoy the benefits that their presence will bring us. <p>Walter Mead is the senior policy advisor at the World Policy Institute at the New School.

Tips for passing on a family business<p>By Jim Melloan<p>What's the number one problem facing successful family businesses today? For many, it's keeping the business in the family. Current statistics show that about 40 percent of family businesses survive into the second generation, and only 12 percent survive to the third. Says John Messervey, director of the National Family Business Council in Lake Forest, Illinois, "Passing on a business is like getting a set of golf clubs and having just one game to break 80. You only get one shot at it."<p>The foundation for a smooth transition from one generation to the next needs to be laid early, through clear communication and clear structure. To help beat the odds, the pros suggest business owners consider the following:<p>--Keep roles clear. Mike Henning, an Effingham, Illinois, family-business consultant, has advised the patriarch of a business to buy several hats and label them dad, boss, grandfather, etc., so that his relatives/employees will be clear on which role he is playing when addressing them. Several of his clients have taken his advice literally--he's seen the hats. <p>--Recognize that the dynamics of a family business and the solutions to the problems it encounters may not seem rational to outsiders. "Profit is not always a motive in a family business," says Don Schwerzler, president of the Family Business Institute in Atlanta. "Often the objective is to reach ever-higher levels of break-even." That is, a growing business may be able to increase salaries and benefits while still not carrying anything to the bottom line.<p>--Appoint an independent board of directors that doesn't simply consist of Dad's old cronies. All of the principal employees, family and not, should be subject to the board's periodic review. And the appointed successor, should, of course, be approved by the board. <p>--Send children to work outside the family business early in their careers. It will build a sense of self-worth that they don't get by going straight to work for Mom or Dad. In a survey of family businesses, second-generation owners cited this as the number-one factor in successful transitions. And it was the number-one regret of those who hadn't done it.<p>--Pay children according to their position, experience, and competence, just like other employees. Parents often think they should pay their children equally, but equal pay for unequal work and commitment can be perceived as unfair. <p>--Form a family council, and hold regular meetings where members can be clear about what they want, what they expect, and how the business has affected the family and vice versa. It will form the groundwork for the future power structure of the company once the current generation has passed it on. The more honest people are at these meetings, the better the prospects for a smooth transition. <p>--Set up an estate plan now. The top estate-tax rate is 55 percent, which means that without planning, the heirs could have to come up with tax payment equal to over half the value of the business to avoid liquidating it. There are many strategies for passing on a business with a maximum amount of assets intact, but they require time to evaluate and, in many cases, years to implement. <p>--Appoint a successor as soon as possible. It's best to achieve a family consensus on who the new head of the company will be. And not just the top position but the entire pecking order will have to be negotiated. Agree on a date when the new regime will take effect--often bosses will promise the business to their children but can't let go, and the kids will spend most of their adult lives just hanging on and waiting. <p>--Draw up a strategic plan with the intended successors for sustaining and growing the business. "You can't take it for granted," says Messervey. "You don't want to become the last wagon-wheel manufacturer in the state."   <p><p>

The holidays raise the stakes in parent-child relationships. It's an emotional - and memorable - time. Here are some guidelines for families to consider:<p>By John Koten<p>The holidays raise the stakes in parent-child relationships. It's an emotional --and memorable--time. Here are some guidelines for families to consider:<p>1 Listen to your kids. be aware that your thoughts about what to get them may be overly influenced by your own childhood experiences. So have them make a wish list--and ask them questions about it. Remember that the kids' gifts are for them, not for you.<p>2 Help your children feel involved. Give them a role they can play in the family's celebration of the holidays. For example, make it their responsibility to make ornaments for the tree or to decorate presents.<p>3 Don't be afraid to say no. It is often the answer children really wants to hear, especially around the holidays, when they are prone to overstimulation. As long as "no" is a considered response, they'll view it as a sign of strength and feel reassured that their parents are, in fact, willing to be parents. <p>
4 Dismissing a child's request out of hand may mean missing a more important message. Unreasonable demands are often a cue to ask your kids, "What's going on?"<p>
5 Holiday presents shouldn't be undermined by threats to use them as a disciplinary tool. There are better ways to let your kids know if they are being naughty or nice. Taking a gift away--or conditioning it on a certain type of behavior--destroys the whole message of the holidays.<p>6 It's important for children to have a chance to learn the joys of giving. But they often need a lot of help to give gifts they can feel proud of. Take an active role as their assistant.<p>
7 Help your children develop skills as consumers by showing them how to evaluate the merits of the things they ask for. Talk them through their choices. Will the attractive toy shown on television really do what it says it will do? Don't just make these decisions for them.<p>
8 Telling your children they can't have something because "it costs too much" runs the risk of making them anxious about their own worth or about the state of the family's finances. It's better to explain why they can't have something in terms of limits. Educate them about prudence and wastefulness. Also remember that while you may appreciate how difficult money is to come by, your kids probably don't.<p>
9 Understand the role of peer pressure in your child's requests. This is a good opportunity to listen to your son or daughter's feelings about their relationships with friends. Competing with other parents in gift giving isn't a solution.<p>
10 Preserve the magic of the holidays. Traditions help a child to better understand the true spirit of giving and receiving.

Marbles, no! Barbie, yes! The kids weigh in.<p>by Will Dana<p>When it comes to christmas, kids aren't playing around. They know what toys are out there and exactly how much they cost, and on the whole, they'd rather be playing video games."If you really want something," said Brian, ten, "you got to know what it costs. You watch for the price to go down, then you ask for it."<p>Brian was one of two dozen toy experts consulted recently during a long afternoon of hard play and frank talk. With the help of Creative & Response Research, a Chicago-based firm specializing in focus groups, we gathered a carefully screened sample of 7-to-11-year-olds, put them in a room decked out with the year's top playthings, and waited for them to do what kids do best: make spontaneous, wise-beyond-their-years comments. From behind a wall of one-way mirrors, we noted their reactions. It was like a cross between Romper Room and a Skinner box.<p>The girls were more at home with traditional toys; the boys went for anything that came in a large box or looked like it was from outer space. The one mechanized girls' item we screened, Baby Walk 'n Roll, Mattel's high-end, remote-controlled walker doll, was generally sniffed at. The older girls thought it was too young for them. Only a girl from the younger group said she loved it. "I like to control things," she said.<p>Happy Holidays Barbie--cloaked in a red dress that even Liberace might have found garish--managed to jump the age barrier, as Barbies have for almost 35 years. She was hands-down the most popular toy among both the 7-to-8-year-old and 10-to-11-year-old girls. Colleen, an intense, quiet 8-year-old, regarded the doll as an object of transfiguring awe. "You're supposed to keep them in the box and never touch them," she said. "It costs like $30," said Adrienne (she was $3 low). "It could be worth a lot when you're 30 or 20."<p>Thirty dollars happened to be the price at which most of the girls considered a toy out of reach. The boys had more expensive tastes; their price threshold hovered around $50 or $60--the price of a typical video game cartridge. Almost all of the boys had at least one video game system, Nintendo or Sega. (Luckily for their parents, none seemed aware of the new $700 Panasonic 3DO system.) Brian and Kevin said they each get about ten new video games a year. <p>The boys' favorite was the biggest and most expensive toy in room, the Jurassic Park Command Compound Playset, which costs $50. It was so big you'd have to have a redwood tree in the living room to get it under. "Tell my mom I need it," urged Justin, who is eight. Kevin offered that he "would throw my Nintendo out the window for it." Though size counts, it doesn't guarantee satisfaction. When it was time to play with the toys, the boys soon abandoned the Jurassic Park monolith in order to shoot each other with a Nerf Master-Blaster, a portable missile launcher that shoots small foam smart bombs with special-forces-caliber speed and accuracy.<p>At the end of the session, we ushered in the parents to see how well they could predict what their child had put at the top of the most-wanted list. Only one parent guessed right; the average mom or dad was a month or two behind on the wish list. When one mother was informed that her son desperately wanted Sonic the Hedgehog, she looked at him quizzically and said, "I thought you told me you had enough video games." It wasn't that parent and child weren't communicating: Mom and Dad had just heard enough.<p>Amid the shower of whizzing Nerf balls and electronically synthesized dinosaur whoops, Nick, a stocky 11-year-old in a Bulls sweatshirt, looked over a small sack of marbles as if they were disease carriers from another planet. "What are these?" he asked suspiciously. "Do they bounce?"<p> <p>

Dolls may look like cheap plastic, but that cheap plastic takes years of intricate planning to create and package. Between a doll's conception and its selling point, there's a lot more than meets the plastic-lidded, spring-loaded eye. This is the story of one such product: <a name="NYSE:MAT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10966"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mattel</b></a>'s Baby Walk 'n Roll. <p>By Russell Miller.<p>1. A NEAT IDEA!
July 1991: Freelance toy inventor Larry Blaustein arrives at Mattel Toys headquarters in El Segundo, California, to pitch his idea for a doll that scoots around in a radio-controlled walker. His timing is perfect. Mattel executives are looking to fill their high-end large-doll slot for Christmas 1993. They want something cute. Something that looks zippy on TV. Something that'll sell for about $30 wholesale.<p>2. THE GREEN LIGHT
September 1991: Mattel decides that the walker-doll is telegenic and, moreover, that it might be a good time for dolls to evolve into the realm of radio control. On September 10, Blaustein is told his idea is a sell.<p>3. BABY GETS A NAME
What's an experimental prototype without a secret moniker? From on high comes the order: Blaustein's doll, for the time being, shall be known as "R.C. Walker."<p>4. A VISIT FROM REAL LIVE KIDS
Early 1992: Marketers peer through one-way mirrors as little girls are interrogated about toys. In what Mattel calls "viability tests," kids and their moms watch mock commercials for various products, then are set loose in the aisles of make-believe stores, using play money to "buy" the toys they want most. R.C. Walker is declared huggable.<p>5. A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE
On March 12, Mattel president and COO Jill Barad puts her seal of approval on the cheery lass. R.C. Walker will be the lead large doll for Christmas 1993.<p>6. THE PRICE IS SET
Through the spring and summer, engineers tinker with R.C. Walker prototypes. They disguise the radio- control unit as a pink heart. Designers also try out a "giggle feature"--a tiny sound box built into the walker. The innovations test well: Mattel sets the doll's wholesale price at $44.99.<p>7. ADVICE FROM FRIENDS
Summer 1992: Representatives of major retail chains trek to Mattel to offer suggestions. "We give them input," says Melody Young, a buyer for Toys "R" Us. "The hair, the face sculpting, the outfits, accessories--that kind of thing." Given the fact that Kmart, Target, Wal-Mart, and Toys "R" Us make up a full 70 percent of the company's U.S. business, Mattel listens.<p>8. PRIMPING AND PREENING
Fall 1992: The doll assumes its final form. The radio controller is overhauled again, morphing into a rattle shape intended to bring out the nurturing mommy that's hiding inside every little girl. The name R.C. Walker, perhaps because it sounds more like a rural sheriff than someone in need of hugs, is changed to Baby Walk 'n Roll.<p>9. THE PRICE FALLS
Fall '92: To reflect the most recent read on consumer tolerance, the doll's price has been scaled back to $39.99. A factory in Hong Kong begins to stockpile plastic baby parts.<p>10. SHE IS NOT ALONE
All is not well for Baby Walk 'n Roll. In the wee world of toy marketing, there are whispers on everybody's lips; Tyco has spawned its own walker doll for Christmas 1993. It costs only $29.99 wholesale.<p>11. A DAY AT THE FAIR
February 1993: Baby Walk 'n Roll meets the press at the American Toy Fair in Manhattan. For the first time, the Mattel doll goes head-to-head with its evil twin: Tyco's Baby Giggles 'n Go. Baby Walk 'n Roll is tough plastic; Giggles 'n Go is more huggably soft (if you ignore the seemingly bulletproof abdomen where her batteries are housed). Walk 'n Roll makes a giggle and a squeal, both of which issue from her walker; Giggles 'n Go has just the little giggle--but it comes from her very own tummy! <p>12. IT'S A GIRL!
September 1993: Baby Walk 'n Roll is alive--at least in the form of TV commercials scattered throughout the Saturday morning kiddie programs and on Nickelodeon. The ad has the doll being brought to show-and-tell at an elementary school (a school that, by the looks of it, has been overrun by teenage actors). "Right," sneers one boy. "Like there's a baby with radio control?" Within 20-odd seconds, though, the young cynic is won over, thus legitimizing the doll for four-to-eight-year-old girls across the country.<p>13. ONE THOUSAND THOUSAND DARLINGS
Mattel declines to specify exact numbers, but probably about one million Baby Walk 'n Rolls have been produced--a legion of dolls the size of Milwaukee. The goal: "Clean sell-through"--the blessed state where every unit finds a home. Unless the doll, which retails between $45 and $50, is incredibly successful, it will never be manufactured again. <p>14. WAR
The campaign is in full swing. Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald</b></a>'s Happy Meals carry Baby Walk 'n Roll coupons on every bag. Meanwhile, Mattel operatives monitor toy stores across the country, beaming sales info back to the war rooms in El Segundo, where marketing execs stand ready to launch last-minute emergency promotions.<p>15. IT'S CHRISTMAS
December 1993: Even if Baby Walk 'n Roll is a modest success, it will pull in more than $30 million before passing from the stage. Next year at this time, while hundreds of thousands of walker babies stare spookily from the corners of dusty attics, an all new, visually exciting Mattel baby will be haunting young female minds. In El Segundo, they're already playing with it.<p> <p>

If you can't be on hand when your parents are in need, here are some ways to help<p>By Mary Rowland<p>Angela heath, a gerontologist in New Carrollton, Maryland, recently wrote a book called Long Distance Caregiving: A Survival Guide for Faraway Caregivers. The book provides excellent advice on how to care for an ailing relative who lives far away. When her grandmother in Cincinnati suffered a stroke last spring, Heath followed all her own advice, hooked into the elder-support networks in the area, and made two trips to Cincinnati, where her parents also live. <p>Heath did all the right things. So why does she still feel so guilty? "For me the guilt has to do with not being able to give the necessary emotional support to my mother and grandmother," Heath said. "I feel bad because they always love when I come home, and I'm so busy I can't go often enough. I feel guilty because I do this for other people all the time, and yet I haven't been able to provide my own family with what they need."<p>And so it goes. An objective observer would say that Heath has done a great job marshaling resources for her grandmother. But when it comes to our own particular family situations, logic deserts us. Few things make us feel so emotional--and so guilty--as the suspicion that we are not doing all we should for those who count on us. <p>When experts like Heath fall prey to these destructive feelings, we can all take heart. But Heath's experience should also remind us that we need to educate ourselves on caring for distant relatives. It helps to be prepared. <p>Dee Lee is another elder-care specialist who recently had the opportunity to put her expertise to work. Lee has spent the past ten years as a financial planner for the elderly in Harvard Massachusetts. In August, her husband's mother, 82 and crippled with arthritis, fell in her home in St. Petersburg, Florida. Lee's father-in-law, who is 87, was rushed to the hospital with a bleeding ulcer<p>Lee and her husband, Doug, were faced with the decision of whether to move the couple to a nursing home. "If they would only come to New England, I could get them great services," Lee says. "But they don't want to do that. And it is so frustrating to try to deal with a traumatic situation 1,000 miles away."<p>Although it's never possible to remove all emotion from such a situation, there are things that long-distance caregivers can do to improve their chances of dealing effectively with a crisis. "Get smart on all the options before a crisis hits," advises Marie Lipari, a work/family consultant at Hewitt Associates in Lincolnshire, Illinois. "Many times, when elder-care needs arise, it happens very quickly." <p>Heath's book, published by Upper Access Books, She tells you how to tap into the aging-care network by calling Eldercare Locator Services (800-677-1116). The network provides a wealth of information. Sometimes all you need to do is describe your situation, and they can tell you what you need and what's available in your area. Heath suggests organizing your files into six areas:<p>Assessment--keeping notes on your parents' condition. <p>Medical Information--should include data on doctors, insurance policies, medications.<p>Travel--organizing your visits.<p>Community Resources--a formal network of available support services. <p>Informal Network--a list of friends, neighbors, doctors, and others who might be needed in the future.<p>Legal, Financial, and Insurance--should include your parents' attorney, banker, financial planner, insurance agent, legal documents, Social Security numbers, and location of wills and other important papers.<p>Employers can also help. "About 15 percent of companies offer a resource and referral service for elder care," Lipari says. In most cases, there is a toll-free number where you can get details on services available in your parents' community. Many employers--about 81 percent--also offer employee-assistance programs. Some of them include elder-care referral services. You may also get counseling sessions for yourself at no charge.<p>When working out these plans, be careful not to make decisions for the individuals involved. Ask them their preferences. Do they want to remain at home? Most elderly Americans do. In that case, finding the services to make that possible should be high on your list. "It's important that older adults maintain control over their lives," says Joan E. Mintz, a New York gerontologist and former deputy director of the New Jersey Division on Aging. "Even if Mom loses her keys once in a while, the family shouldn't make a decision that she can't drive anymore. Mom should be part of any decision that is made about her."<p>It is also wise to plan how you are going to talk to your parents about these issues. "If your mother is very independent but she breaks her hip, that doesn't affect her mind," says Heath. "You can talk things through with her and plan together what you will do." That approach won't work, though, with a parent who has a mental deficiency or is dependent and shies away from decisions. "Then you may have to take the lead and say, 'Let me help. I'll feel better when we have this settled,'" says Heath.<p>The holiday season can be a good time for families to get started on parental-care planning, but some work must be done in advance. If a number of siblings will be home for the holidays, discuss the plans in advance. Caring for an elderly relative can cause extreme tension between other family members because everyone typically has a different idea of what should be done and how. <p>In Heath's family, there is something of a natural division of labor. Her brother, who is financially successful, takes care of the money issues. Heath, because of her expertise, is responsible for the research. One unmarried sister, who lives in Cincinnati, does the on-the-spot follow-through. And a third sister assists the other two whenever necessary.<p>To make a holiday meeting more productive, consider taking the following steps beforehand:<p>Get a phone book for your relative's city.<p>Conduct a conference call with other family members. Discuss the agenda for your meeting.<p>If one of your parents has a health problem, schedule an appointment with his or her physician while you're in town.<p>Make a list of friends and relatives you can visit who might be part of an informal network willing to check on your parent when you're not around. If your parent is ailing, you might make arrangements with some of them to stop in once a week for lunch or a chat.<p> Schedule an appointment with a minister, priest, rabbi, or someone else who is close to your parents. Find out what social activities your parent attends. See if the church or synagogue has special resources that can provide support when you need it. Many churches have volunteers who take elderly people grocery shopping or drop in for regular visits.<p> If your parents are over 65, they are eligible to belong to the local council on aging, .a support group that may go by different names in different communities. Call for information on the type of activities this group sponsors.<p> Stop in at your local library. The librarian often has a good idea of what is going on in town and what resources are available.<p>Keep your eyes and ears open. Help may come from the most unexpected places. For instance, Doug Lee was taking a shuttle van back to the St. Petersburg airport and fretting about his invalid mother. A fellow passenger quickly volunteered to stop in and visit once a week. "I do this type of thing for my church all the time," she said. "I'd be glad to add your mother to my list."<p>Mary Rowland, a columnist for the New York Times, writes about personal finance from New York City.<p> <p><p>

Homeowners can save money by paying attention to those mysterious little policies they bought with their homes<p>By Margaret Opsata<p>A year after moving into their dream house, a Cabin John, Maryland, couple received a chilling letter from the Washington Suburban Sanitation Commission. Their home had been built illegally across a sewer easement, the letter said, and was scheduled for demolition. This was the first the panicked homeowners had heard about any easement, which had not shown up on the title search they paid for when they bought the house.<p>But the couple had also bought a policy along with the title search when they closed on their house. Like most homeowners, the Maryland couple had not completely understood what title insurance was or why they were advised to buy it. They saw it as simply another of several mysterious expenses that appeared on the settlement sheet and had to be paid before they could move into their home. Indeed, when the bombshell letter arrived from the sanitation commission, the couple's lawyer had to remind them that they had even bought title insurance in the first place.<p>Fortunately, they had. The title insurer intervened and agreed to pay the costs of rerouting the sewer line and relandscaping the grounds: an $80,000 construction bill, plus the cost of reconnecting the diverted sewer to adjacent homes and preparing new surveys for the affected properties, as well as all legal expenses involved.<p>In addition to title insurance, home buyers are often advised to buy private mortgage insurance and credit life insurance. Although these three types of policies together generate millions of dollars in insurance sales every year, few people understand what such insurance covers, whether it is a good investment, or even what it costs. And even those who do notice the thousands of dollars in premiums they're charged most often figure it's insignificant compared with the amount of their mortgage anyway. But in many cases, homeowners end up paying too much, paying for too long, or paying for the wrong kind of coverage.<p>Title insurance, the coverage that saved the Maryland couple's home, covers the cost of defending or settling claims that were not discovered during the title search. Buyers are not always told that there actually are two types of title insurance: lenders' coverage, which costs a onetime premium of about $2.50 for every $1,000 borrowed and which every mortgage company requires before agreeing to underwrite a home loan, and owners' coverage, which costs an additional onetime payment of $3.50 per $1,000 and is optional.<p>As the names suggest, the first coverage protects the interests of the lender while the second safeguards the interests of the homeowner. Unfortunately, these interests are not always identical, but more than a few buyers incorrectly assume that they are automatically protected when they purchase coverage for their lenders. The real estate agent or lawyer who handles the closing is supposed to clear up this confusion, but since commissions or fees are generally not paid for recommending buyers' coverage, advisors sometimes neglect it. Title companies themselves have little financial incentive to help out. "With only a onetime premium involved, companies have no money for advertising to consumers," explains H. Randolph Farmer, a senior vice president at Lawyers Title Insurance in Richmond, Virginia.<p>Other times, buyers decide not to purchase insurance because the threat of title problems seems so remote. Actually, disputes arise with surprising frequency in the 1990s. In addition to undisclosed easements, they can include liens placed by contractors who were owed money by previous homeowners and improperly surveyed property boundary lines that inadvertently caused a driveway or fence to be built on a neighbor's land.<p>Fraud and forgery are other leading causes of title problems. A party to an acrimonious divorce does not want the former spouse to share in the proceeds of a home sale and hires an impostor to sign relevant documents while masquerading as the marriage partner. Relatives eager to dispose of an inherited property casually forge the signature of a family member who opposes the sale. One audacious case involved an army officer's home in Georgia that stood vacant while the owner was stationed in Germany. "A woman boldly visited the county courthouse, gathered the pertinent facts about the property, forged a deed conveying the house to herself, recorded the forged deed, and posted a for sale sign in the front yard," recalls Farmer of Lawyers Title, which handled the case. When the major returned from overseas, he found his home inhabited by strangers who had innocently purchased the place believing the title was clear. Eventually they were forced to move, but their title insurance allowed them to recover their investment.<p>In fact, deceptions are becoming so commonplace that some title-insurance companies conduct identity checks at the closing table. Even so, the industry's loss-adjustment expenses are currently running about double the historical average, according to Gary Garrity, vice president of the American Land Title Association in Washington, D.C.<p>Homeowners may well ask why they should pay the cost of a title search and then pay again to insure against errors that occur during the search. The truth is, lenders don't object because homeowners are paying for the coverage. And because few home buyers protest, the practice has become entrenched within the real estate industry.<p>Even though home buyers pay the bills, lenders rarely let homeowners choose which title insurer to use. Instead, the lender typically selects a company, orders a policy, and presents it to the owner at the closing table. However, any consumer who wants to comparison shop is theoretically free to do so. Because rates are regulated by state insurance commissioners, buyers probably will not notice much difference in price among title insurers in their area. What will distinguish the companies is the level of service they offer. Some respond promptly to claims while others ignore policyholders, so it is worthwhile to seek references from real estate lawyers who are familiar with all the companies. Buyers should also contact the Better Business Bureau and the consumer-affairs department of the state insurance commission, which may know of past problems.<p>Homeowners who fail to purchase title insurance for themselves when they acquire property can buy it at any time, although they must pay the cost of a new title search. Those who presently are insured should consider increasing their coverage if their home has increased in value, unless their policy is automatically adjusted for appreciation and inflation.<p>Although the public is rarely told of its existence, a discount on lenders' insurance is available to people who refinance their mortgages if the title has been searched within the past ten years and the new policy is written by the same company. To obtain the savings, they must request a title-insurance reissue rate when making a loan application.<p>Homeowners also should remember that owners' title insurance extends from the day they purchase until the day they sell and even continues after death if title to the property remains in the family. Thus, someone who refinances does not need to purchase owners' title insurance at all because the original policy is still in effect. Unfortunately, says Benny L. Kass, a real estate attorney with Kass, Skalet, Segan, Spevack & Van Grack in Washington, D.C., "a lot of people who refinance are being sold new owner's coverage by settlement companies and lawyers who are basically dishonest."<p>Some of these same shady characters may fail to explain private mortgage insurance. PMI helps people obtain a mortgage when they have not accumulated enough to make the traditional 20 percent downpayment. The insurance, which costs homeowners between $3.50 and $5.00 a year per $1,000 borrowed (or about $1,500 a year on a $300,000 house), covers the lender in case of a default, allowing bankers to make loans they might otherwise refuse to underwrite.<p>The concept of PMI is excellent, but its execution is fraught with pitfalls. For starters, the insurance is offered by only eight companies, which seem bent on keeping as much distance as possible between themselves and the home buyers who purchase their premiums. "Mortgage insurers work with lenders, who choose an appropriate PMI program for each borrower. Generally, the consumer does not even know who the insurer is," says Suzanne Hutchinson, executive vice president of the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America, the Washington, D.C.-based trade organization for the industry.<p>Should homeowners care which company gets their PMI payments? "I would say not," responds Charles M. Reid, president of United Guarantee Residential Insurance in Greensboro, North Carolina. "It is a free marketplace, and a lender is going to do everything possible to [find] a very competitive monthly payment for the borrower."<p>That assumes that bankers shop as hard to save our money as we would. Consider that after shoehorning buyers into PMI programs not of their choosing, lenders are not required to notify homeowners when they've acquired enough equity so that the PMI can be canceled. "It is up to the homeowner to keep an eye on that because most lenders don't track it," says Bonnie O'Dell, director of consumer information at the Federal National Mortgage Association.<p>Some lenders even require that PMI be carried for the length of the loan, no matter how far down it is paid. No federal regulations have been written to prohibit this clearly unfair practice, so the only way for homeowners to climb out from under unwarranted PMI premiums may be to refinance their loan.<p>PMI borrowers should periodically review the amount of equity in their home in order to cancel the insurance or, if necessary, refinance at the earliest opportunity. Although it takes almost 11 years to achieve 20 percent equity in a 5 percent down, 30-year fixed-rate loan at 7 percent interest, rising property values or home improvements can cause the equity to appreciate much more rapidly.<p>Regardless of how much or how little equity they have in the home, those who refinance, as well as new buyers, are wise to resist sales pressure from their lender to buy credit life insurance, which pays off the mortgage if the homeowner dies. "Credit life is usually a rip-off," declares Peter C. Katt, a fee-only life insurance advisor in West Bloomfield, Michigan. Indeed, he points out that when the National Association of Insurance Commissioners studied credit life insurance in 1991, it found that only 39 cents of every premium dollar is ever returned to the consumer.<p>The credit-life industry can maintain its whopping 61 percent margin because its insurance costs from about 2 to 4.5 times as much as term life insurance, which can also be used to retire a mortgage upon death. For example, term insurance for a 35-year-old male nonsmoker currently costs 92 cents per $1,000 of coverage, while credit life for the same individual costs $4.08 per $1,000. Credit life insurance salespeople would argue that their premiums never increase while term insurance grows more expensive each year as the person ages. But they fail to point out that credit-life coverage decreases as the mortgage principal is paid down, while term insurance coverage remains constant. (To reduce term insurance in tandem with the mortgage, request a lower level of coverage every year, which will also lower the annual premiums.) The difference in premiums is less dramatic when homeowners are older, but credit life never proves to be the more economical deal. "Credit-life premiums rarely cost less than twice what someone can pay for term insurance," Katt says.<p>It is custom and lender clout, rather than any equitable division of personal responsibility, that makes title and private mortgage insurance a necessity for American homeowners to buy in the mid-1990s. Fair or not, prudent consumers have little choice but to pay for these two products. However, unless home buyers can't get life insurance any other way, there's no good reason to enrich a credit-life company.<p>Margaret Opsata has been covering real estate issues for 20 years.

Economist Paul Romer preaches the gospel of growth<p>By David Samuels<p>"Many of you probably know Paul as the father of Amy, who was with us last year," singsongs Carla, the teacher who runs the fifth-grade Future Club at the Nueva School in Hillsborough, California. "But he also has another job -- which is called being an economist. Some of you might have read about him in Newsweek. And when you come to that article, which I put in your packets, you will find that Paul was written up as a revolutionary in economic theory. He has some very interesting ideas about how economies grow." <p>Standing before the classroom, Stanford professor Paul Romer looks more like a freshman Republican congressman -- with blow-dried hair touched with gray and boyishly handsome features -- than a revolutionary. Nonetheless, at the age of 41, Amy's father, the son of Colorado governor Roy Romer (whom he advises), is perhaps the most innovative American economist of his generation.<p>In a series of papers since the mid-1980s, Romer, who did his graduate work at the knee of the influential University of Chicago economics faculty, has compelled his entire profession to rethink its fundamental belief that the potential for growth, and hence for world prosperity, is limited because supplies of labor, capital, and raw materials are limited. Not true, Romer argues. Ideas and the technologies they create are the real engines of growth and wealth. And since human invention is infinite, so too must be the possibilities for economic growth. <p>The subject, as anyone who watches TV news knows, has become the world's central economic problem -- the key to resolving everything from wage and living-standard stagnation in developed nations to controlling population growth in emerging ones. As The Economist magazine has editorialized, understanding and fostering growth is "surely the most urgent task in economics."<p>"What do we mean when we talk about an economy?" Romer asks the fifth graders, a purple marker poised in his hand. "A real economy is a very complicated thing, but there are three simple things that show up in every economy: There are people. There are rules and institutions. And there are physical opportunities. <p>"You have to take people pretty much as they are," he says, accompanied by the tire squeal of his marker on the white board behind him. "For example, it would be better if everybody in the world was more generous or thoughtful, or if people cared about each other more. And it would also be better if we had more plants and animals, or more oil, or more sunshine on the East Coast. But we can't really change the physical opportunities. What we can change," the economist explains, drawing a thick purple line beneath the word, "are the rules people use to interact with each other." <p>At the end of the question-and-answer period, a fifth grader in a pink flowered dress fixes the economist with a very serious and slightly puzzled look. "There's one thing I don't understand," she says. "What exactly does an economist do?"<p>It is a question that Paul Romer asks himself, too. "I think the essence of being an economist," he says as we drive to the Hoover Institution on Stanford's campus, where he is a senior fellow, "especially a Chicago economist, has to do with learning to turn off all your emotions and say, 'Let's think abstractly about adoption or crime.' We have a name for people who are innately really good at this," Romer adds with a rueful grin. "They're psychopaths, people who are incapable of feeling guilt, or remorse, or any emotional reaction. So there's a good reason, I guess, why one looks with a degree of nervousness at people who are really good at this activity."<p>The stretch of interstate between the Nueva School and the Hoover Institution displays Paul Romer's idea-driven economy in action. The leafy venture-capital parks of Sand Hill Road, nestled into the Palo Alto Hills, irrigate the computer firms and biotech start-ups down in Silicon Valley with streams of cash, fertilizing the dreams of the chemists, biologists, software engineers, and Stanford professors who have transformed this once sleepy college town into a wide-open gateway to the world economy of the 21st century. "We used to use iron oxide to make cave paintings," Romer says as the office parks go whizzing by, "and now we put it on floppy disks. The point here is, the raw material we have to work with has been the same for all of human history -- there's the stuff in the earth's crust and the stuff in the atmosphere. So when you think about growth, the only place it can come from is finding better recipes for rearranging the fixed amount of stuff we have."<p>Romer, who has two children, compares the labor-plus-capital approach -- axiomatic among economists from David Ricardo in the 19th century to Milton Friedman today -- to the Play-Doh Fun Factory, a bright plastic toy that comes with an assortment of dies that turn lumps of Play-Doh into lengths of pipe or beam. "It's a good illustration of what most people think about when they think about growth," Romer says, "the combination of raw material (the Play-Doh) with capital (the Fun Factory) and labor (what the child does when she pushes down the lever) in order to create a more valuable good." <p>What the Fun Factory metaphor leaves out is the multiplying effect of technological invention on our limited stocks of labor and capital. "There's only so far you can get if what you're doing is processing more and more Play-Doh," Romer says, pointing to the explosive growth of the U.S. economy since 1870 -- which can hardly be explained by increases in our stock of steam engines and waterwheels. It can be explained, Romer believes, only by a succession of new and ever more profitable inventions -- like the microchip, the product of a set of ideas that enabled the alchemical conversion of sand into powerful microprocessors and a huge new source of wealth.<p>In this view, our material future is bounded only by the capacity of the imagination to generate new ideas, which are, for practical purposes, infinite in number. "Think of a manufacturing process with 20 steps," Romer explains in his office at the Hoover Institution. "The number of possible combinations is 10 to the power 18, the number of seconds which have elapsed since the big bang.<p>"Another property that distinguishes ideas from objects," he says, "is that millions of people can use the same idea at the same time, for almost nothing. Producing the first copy of Word might cost <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> millions of dollars. Every copy after that, however, is essentially free." <p>Romer was not the first to think about the effect of technology on economics. In the 1950s, the Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Solow suggested that labor and capital could add up to more than the sum of their parts through improvements in technology, an effect that became known among economists as the Solow residual. But if technology was important, Solow believed, it also developed according to a logic of its own and could be ignored by economists.<p>This was the situation when Romer began publishing his work on economic growth in 1986, a line of inquiry that culminated in two widely influential papers in 1990 and 1991. It was this work that gave economists a way to bring technological change -- the most obvious characteristic of modern society -- back inside their economic models. <p>The impact of Romer's emphasis on ideas and growth, says Stanford economist Paul Krugman, "was like when the German general slaps his head in The Longest Day and says, 'Normandy. How stupid of me.'" And David Warsh, economics columnist for The Boston Globe and the author of Economic Principals, says, "The next generation of economists will learn a very different kind of economics because of the work that Paul Romer has done."<p>In America, the faith that economies could be reduced to simple mechanical models and driven, like a car, faster or slower culminated in the Keynesian revolution of the 1950s and 1960s, in which economists, like Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow of MIT, believed (and convinced the Kennedy administration) that, just as physicists discovered the laws of nature, economists could uncover the laws of economic life and use them to create an endless era of stable prosperity that would banish the ghost of the Great Depression. <p>Then came the oil shocks of the 1970s, runaway inflation, ballooning deficits, and work by Chicago-school economists like Milton Friedman, all of which demolished the theoretical basis of Keynesianism. By the end of the decade, the dream of a small cadre of experts directing the economy through precisely calibrated interventions in interest rates and government spending had been destroyed. Having lost its role as the power behind society's throne, economics itself seemed to lose its bearings, drifting into the creation of internally consistent mathematical models that bore no conceivable relation to the world of economic affairs. As Robert Heilbroner and William Milberg write in The Crisis of Vision in Modern Economic Thought, the "'high theorizing' of the present period attains a degree of unreality that can be matched only by medieval scholasticism." <p>As a graduate student and young professor, Romer, too, was seduced by counting angels on the head of a pin (in his case, this meant rapturously tracing the apparent similarities between the geometrical shapes called convex sets and elements of Samuelson's general equilibrium theory of wages and prices). But his interests soon shifted back to the shapeless, intractable question of how the world works. And how to make it work better. <p>With one hand on the wheel and one hand pointing to the lights of San Francisco Bay, Romer is wondering: Why not build a free-trade colony somewhere in Africa that might do for that continent what Hong Kong has done for Asia? Why not turn the city of Detroit or East Saint Louis, Illinois, over to <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Disney</b></a>, or to Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, and allow city residents to vote with their feet? In his most recent paper -- on the Social Security system and why New Dealers insisted on defining the program as an entitlement, even at the expense of achieving broader coverage -- Romer applies the tools of evolutionary biology, history, and political science to the kinds of messy questions about values that economists since the days of Adam Smith have avoided. <p>"Smith not only wrote The Wealth of Nations, he also wrote The Theory of Moral Sentiments," Romer points out. "Seventeenth- and eighteenth-century liberal thinkers wrote about what democracy meant -- not just as a system of material payoffs, but what that system meant for the kind of people it created."<p>It's rumored that Romer recently turned down an invitation to be considered for the Federal Reserve Board to stay with his family in California, and he rarely appears on the editorial pages of establishment newspapers. However much he wants his work to move the world, Romer often seems palpably resistant to spelling out its practical implications. Nonetheless, his attempt to pierce the mystery of wealth creation will be hard to ignore in our technology-driven world economy. "It has big implications for trade," says David Warsh, "and it has big implications for science policy. The debate is just beginning."<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Cover<p>BRING YOUR MONEY HOME
Feeling gloomy about the U.S. stock and bond markets? Try looking at them as a foreigner might.<p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p>Does president clinton understand how to lead an economy? Is the Federal Reserve pursuing the correct money strategies? Do American corporations still have the right stuff? <p>Questions like these often preoccupy U.S. investors, especially during periods when our own stock and bond markets appear to be faltering or weak. Yet important as they are, they also can lead to myopia. Why? Because in a global economy, all things are relative. It's crucial to focus not only on how we are doing as a nation, but also on how we are doing compared with everyone else.<p>At the moment, the parochial view is awash in gloom. We see a huge federal deficit, rising interest rates, a dollar that won't buy what it used to, and a bumbling, squabbling government. We see an economy once dominated by assembly lines and blast furnaces transforming itself into one populated by rotisserie-chicken outlets and espresso bars. We wonder if we are better at generating lawsuits than jobs, better at manipulating paper than creating useful products.<p>Seeing only trouble at home, many investors in recent years have become fervent global players, racing to the latest emerging market that can tout double-digit growth. Americans have been plowing their money into places like India and Peru at unprecedented rates. To some investors, over the rainbow has come to mean far from 
Kansas__and all the other contiguous states to boot.<p>This trend away from U.S. markets started five years ago. From 1985 through 1989, the U.S. took in more capital than it exported; an average of $60 billion washed onto our shores each of those years. But in 1990, the flow reversed direction. That year, the nation exported almost $15 billion more in capital than it imported. In 1993, net capital exports approached $17 billion as U.S. investors snapped up $128.6 billion in foreign investments. <p>Where was all this money going as it left our shores? The outflow was almost evenly divided between foreign equities and debt. Asian equities alone accounted for $17.1 billion of the total invested overseas in 1993, a 90 percent increase from the previous year. Mexican equities, which later hurt so many investors, received $5.3 billion from Americans in 1993, while the rest of Latin America got $7.3 billion.<p>Many pioneers of the overseas boom were well-rewarded. Malaysia returned 123 percent in 1993, South Africa 84.4 percent, and Singapore 74 percent. Meanwhile, stay-at-home investors pocketed comparatively paltry 10.1 percent returns that year. Some of those undoubtedly decided they should join the global treasure hunt, too.<p>Until the recent debacle in Mexico stemmed the outflow of dollars, Americans were investing virtually everywhere. Turkey, with a stock market a mere ten years old, attracted $34 million last year. Vietnam, a nation without a stock exchange, bagged $106 million.<p>As we've pointed out in these pages before, there is certainly a place for global investing in a well-diversified portfolio. Study after study has shown that investors who put at least some portion of their money to work overseas do better over the long run than those who adopt a more isolationist strategy.<p>Nevertheless, we also think the current pessimism about U.S. investments is overblown. Step back from our messy political sideshows. Let go of last year's disappointments in the stock and bond markets. And forget, for the time being, about whether or not the Federal Reserve will achieve a "soft landing" for our economy. Instead, look at the U.S. as a foreigner might.<p>What other nation has as diversified and vibrant an economy? What other nation offers the security and stability of the U.S.? Indeed, where would any other nation on the planet first go for help if it were in trouble? The answers to those questions should be obvious.<p>America's economy? It is proving to be surprisingly strong, and inflation is nowhere to be seen as yet. The dollar, although now near a historic low, is still the currency of choice around the world.<p>America's corporations? They've revamped themselves to become more productive and efficient. They continue to lead the world in scores of industries, including some, such as automobiles, in which they were written off just a few years ago. <p>America's markets? They are the most liquid and well-regulated in the world.<p>The outlook for the U.S. is never easy to divine in the precise terms that many of us seek. Yet the big picture is a positive one, especially when compared with the prospects for any other economy on the globe.<p>Although we at Worth have been wary about U.S. stocks and bonds for over a year now, our view is that the worst is probably over. In fact, we think things are starting to look pretty good for certain U.S. investments__whether in bonds or in select sectors of the stock market. More and more, we find ourselves agreeing with folks like John Manley, quantitative strategist and director at Smith Barney in New York, who says, "I see a better market ahead because there are signs the economy has moderated." Or Edward Keon Jr., senior vice president at IBES International, an investment information company in New York. Keon says he believes earnings on the 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor's index will rise around 12 percent in 1995. Although that would be well below 1994's 19 percent earnings growth, Keon argues that because long-term interest rates will be stable, a 12 percent earnings rise will translate to much bigger gains in stocks than seen last year. <p>Optimists like Keon and Manley remain in the minority on Wall Street__for understandable reasons, given the market's performance in 1994. Last year was a bad one, a year when thousands of individual stocks got pummeled and many U.S. securities did far worse than the performance of the broader market averages might suggest.<p>Analysts and investment-newsletter writers still seem to be licking their wounds. In early February, 57 percent of the revisions in analysts' earnings forecasts were downward adjustments, while raising only 43 percent of their estimates. The Hulbert Financial Digest, which ranks performance among 162 investment newsletters, says stock-only advisors are recommending having more cash than equities. <p>Nevertheless, we think there are some compelling reasons to question this mood. The most salient: the overall safety offered by U.S. stocks and bonds__an allure that may once again cause a positive inflow of capital to this country in coming months. We think investors around the world are about to send their money back to work here, as they did through the 1980s. Such capital inflows are not yet visible in Federal Reserve data, but some analysts see anecdotal evidence that this already may be happening. Once established, this trend will attract further investment, both domestic and foreign.<p>The U.S. is a safe haven. With fledgling stock markets everywhere bouncing around in the wake of the Mexican peso devaluation, dazed investors want the stability and liquidity of U.S. markets. Indeed, as the Mexico crisis unfolded, dealer firms reported unusually large buy orders for U.S. Treasurys in late December and early January. Record demand from individual investors occurred in the December and January two-year Treasury auctions and in January's five-year auction as well. <p>Treasurys also have become a magnet to investors because of their relatively high interest rates. The same interest rate hikes that made 1994 woeful for most U.S. debt and equity holders now make our debt an attractive buy. Investors purchasing 30-year bonds recently received yields of 7.7 percent. Compare this with the longest-term yields investors can find elsewhere: 7.6 percent on 30-year German bonds, 4.8 percent on 20-year Japanese debt.<p>If investors perceive that the Federal Reserve has done all or most of the rate-boosting that's required to slow the U.S. economy, strategists believe we'll see an even greater stampede into U.S. debt markets. Already, the 30-year Treasury yield has fallen from its November 1994 high of 8.17 percent.<p>The dollar may prove to be another plus. Although peaks and valleys are exceedingly tough to call in currency markets, some observers believe the dollar is now in the process of bottoming (see "Better Days Ahead for the Buck?" on page 72). A rising dollar would obviously make U.S. holdings even more attractive to foreign investors. <p>Albert Friedberg, director of the Friedberg Mercantile Group, a commodity-trading advisor in Toronto, says flatly, "Fundamentals are coming into place for a renewed and significant rise in the U.S. dollar." Specifically, Friedberg believes that the money supply, essentially the amount of liquidity afloat in the banking system, is now shrinking for the first time in five years. "Adjusted [bank] reserves have fallen at an annualized rate of 11 percent since immediately after the [Fed's] August tightening,"Friedberg notes. The result, he says, has been a notable weakening in the rate of growth for two important measures of the money supply: M1 (commercial bank deposits, currency in circulation, and other liquid holdings) and M2 (M1 plus savings accounts, money market fund holdings, and other fairly liquid instruments). The fewer dollars out there, the more valuable they become. <p>Another favorable sign for our markets: U.S. corporate executives, directors, and managers recently have been buying up shares in their companies at a fierce rate. In the past, such insider transactions have proved prescient. According to Vickers Stock Research in Huntington, New York, the eight-week insider sell-to-buy ratio now stands at 0.94. When that ratio falls below what Vickers calls a neutral level of 2.25__meaning 2.25 shares sold per 1 share purchased__the markets climb. During the past 20 years, the ratio has dropped below 1 on only eight occasions, and on average, the market moved 23 percent higher in the ensuing 12 months.<p>The index of electric-utility stocks is also sending upbeat signals. Almost without fail, a stagnating Dow Jones Utility Average precedes overall market tops, while a rebounding average precedes recoveries in broader indices. The Dow Jones Utility Average last peaked in August 1993. That turned out to be about six months before the overall market indices hit their highs. Now utilities are rebounding off a mid-November 1994 low. In the first six weeks of the year, the index was up 6.53 percent. Because utilities are interest rate sensitive stocks, their rally is an indication that the market believes rates probably won't rise much more. That's good news for both stocks and bonds.<p>The same could be said for the index of net new business formation in the U.S., now at its highest level since March 1980. According to Michelle Colley Laughlin, chief economist at Sanwa Securities in New York, this barometer of entrepreneurial activity is a fairly reliable predictor of future economic trends. For example, she notes that the index topped out in January 1990, six months before the July 1990 peak in the business cycle. Then, in late 1990, it fell to a cyclical low, roughly six months before the "official" end of the recession in early 1991. Laughlin believes the index's recent surge__up more than 5 percent in the past three months alone__will translate to 1.6 million new jobs by the middle of the year. <p>Congress could provide a further boost to the U.S. as an investment haven if it reduces the capital-gains tax. If this happens, stocks of growth companies, small and large, would rise. When the capital-gains rate began to fall from 49.1 percent in 1978 to 20 percent in 1980, valuations on small-cap stocks almost doubled, from a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.6 to 16.5 (see "When Taxes Fall, Stock Values Rise" on page 69). <p>How should investors who are interested in bucking the bearish view look to maximize their potential for profits in 1995? Those seeking income might do very well by joining in the stampede for low-risk Treasury notes with maturities of two to three years. Although these holdings are no longer the bargains they were just a few months ago, their yields__7.15 percent to 7.30 percent__are still attractive on an inflation-adjusted basis.<p>Going further out in Treasury maturities is trickier. Although some strategists think that locking in 7.7 percent for 30 years is a good bet, there is still a risk that inflation will creep above 3 percent by the end of 1995. This would have a much more deleterious effect on a 30-year bond than it would on a shorter-term holding.<p>As for stocks, even the market optimists hesitate to advise a big plunge into equities just yet. Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at CS First Boston in New York, is a believer in stocks for the latter half of 1995 but is concerned that the overall market could decline somewhat by midyear if the Fed raises rates yet again. <p>Nonetheless, history shows that it's better to be early on a move that follows a stock market correction than to be late. That's because up moves often occur in relatively short bursts. In October 1966, for example, when the S&P had declined 22 percent from a previous year's high, the index rebounded 18 percent by the following January. The S&P finished the 12-month period from the October bottom with a 33 percent gain; more than half of that was achieved in the first three months after the low.<p>A similar updraft occurred in July 1984, after the market dropped 14 percent from its 1983 high. By July 1985, the S&P 500 had risen 30 percent; almost half that gain came three weeks after the 1984 low. "Typically, a rebound from a trough in equities is fairly strong and fairly compressed," says Applegate.<p>Certainly, not all stocks are good bets. The next winners are likely to be congregated in a few sectors. Most will be growth stocks, but not all growth stocks are likely to participate. That's because consumer stocks__durables such as automobiles and home electronics and nondurables like retailers and packaged-good manufacturers__are likely to lag other sectors. In 1994, credit card debt grew 17 percent, up from 12 percent in 1992, so consumers now have limited access to credit. Also, if the consumer economy continues to surge, threatening inflation, the Fed will raise rates to slow personal income growth. <p>Companies that should outperform the market, according to strategist Applegate: "Stocks with sizable levels of non-U.S. sales and profits__say 40 percent to 60 percent__and producers of capital goods and equipment." Capital-goods stocks will do well partly because the Fed essentially has told corporate America that it won't let up on its inflation fighting until industry adds more production capacity. These investments have also resulted in sharply improved profit margins and productivity gains, particularly among U.S. manufacturers. This has translated to top performance for stocks in the capital-goods sector__including technology, basic industries, and heavy-equipment makers. Since this investment cycle began more than two years ago, the index of capital-goods stocks has outperformed the S&P 500 by 9.53 percent. Look for good buys in sectors where the U.S. is the global leader, including technology giants Motorola and Intel, farm-machinery manufacturer AGCO, battery-maker Duracell International, and Gillette. <p>Economist Keon at IBES thinks that shares in basic industries__steel companies, chemical makers, paper manufacturers__will rise in 1995 and 1996 because global demand and continued productivity growth in the sector will create higher profit margins. "This recovery has been fairly mild, but the much better earnings you're seeing show how much more productive companies are," he says. <p>Capital-goods makers are well positioned right now because labor constitutes an increasingly small share of production costs, allowing companies to pour cash into equipment that increases productivity rather than into higher-cost labor, according to Applegate. As a result, he expects after-tax profit margins of 5 percent for 1994, 5.5 percent for this year and 6 percent in 1996. The previous record margin in an economic expansion was 5.4 percent in 1988. Small-capitalization technology companies that make equipment for use in manufacturing may also do well, says Applegate. <p>Although the memories of last year's losses in U.S. stock and bond markets remain painful for many investors, this is probably not the best time to go hunting for greener pastures abroad. Especially not when some of the best opportunities may be right under our noses.<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <p>
Greener Pastures Right Here at Home<p>By Kevin Caliendo<p>
None of the six global market strategists we consulted envisions a raging bull running through U.S. markets this year. But all have increased their exposure to domestic investments in recent months. We'll let them explain why:<p>
Michael Metz, chief investment officer, Oppenheimer & Co.<p>"Relatively speaking, the U.S. is the most attractive market in the world, including all the emerging markets. We have political stability and controlled inflation. We are competitive worldwide and are still in an expansionary period. The valuations may be on the rich side, but every market is overpriced."<p>
Robert C. Elliott, senior executive vice president, investment policy, Bessemer Trust<p>"We have increased our domestic weighting because we really believe that the Fed can engineer a soft landing and that we are near the end of interest-rate hikes for a while. Therefore, we think economic growth in the States will be sustainable at around 2.5 percent. Corporate profits will still grow at an attractive level. We also believe the dollar is very undervalued and will improve. NonU.S. investors, like the Europeans, who always feel the dollar is going to weaken, will finally commit more money to the U.S. Most currency moves go well beyond valuation levels, partly because of the people who are involved in the trading and speculation."<p>
Jim Kermes, chief investment officer, Northern Trust Co.<p>"The economic cycles of foreign countries are behind ours, so they have more interest-rate increases to go. You see a lot of growth in Europe, and I don't know what is going to happen in Japan with the cost of rebuilding Kobe. So we expect some price weakness abroad, with less chance for price declines in the U.S. The way we see the economy playing out is that we won't have a recession but we will have a slowdown in growth. Greenspan is conscious of not driving a stake into the heart of the economy, so we're optimistic he won't overdo it this time."<p>
Brian A. Berris, partner, Brown Brothers Harriman<p>"We have made a modest increase in our U.S. equities position. The disappointing performance of the stock market, despite strong corporate earnings, has resulted in price-to-earnings multiples that have shrunk dramatically in the last 12 months. Couple that with a better flow of funds from foreign markets and the current stability in equities, and the result is a very attractive investment."<p>
Donald Straszheim, chief economist, <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a><p>"The U.S. is more competitive than it has it been. Cost cutting and restructuring have been going on for 13 years here versus only two years in Europe and Japan. Every time you see a restructuring and 5,000 people are laid off, a big capital-reinvesting plan is implemented, and technology and equipment is purchased. Because of this, it will be hard for Japan and Europe to keep up with us and even harder to catch up. We led the way out to a recovery, with the other English-speaking countries second and Japan and the rest of the world third. I like capital goods and high-technology companies."<p>
Eric Miller, chief investment officer, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette<p>"We did move some cash into equities because more portfolio money, including mutual funds, is going to be staying at home. You could see it happening even before the Mexico crisis. Stocks are fairly priced right now, but we'll probably see better returns from bonds. Certainly the psychology of that market has improved significantly." <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Advisor<p>THE PORTENTS OF INFLATION<p>By Manjeet Kripalani<p>Trading in U.S. Treasury securities__$200 billion worth every day__makes up the world's biggest and most liquid market. Yet this huge global bond bazaar, around which all other debt and equity markets orbit like moons around a sun, itself obeys only one master: inflation.<p>"Inflation and growth are the biggest things; the market reacts to inflation," says Debra Packman-Landis, Treasurys strategist at Smith Barney in New York City.<p>Bond yields, in fact, are set at Treasury auctions to reflect inflation expectations, and they in turn affect the flow of money into global stock markets. All this makes inflation perhaps the most important influence on any portfolio. The problem is that inflation is a lagging indicator__it doesn't show up until well after it has begun to ravage the economy and our bank accounts. Prognosticators, therefore, must analyze leading indicators, tea leaves pointing to hidden pressures in the economy. <p>For example, December inflation was a modest 2.7 percent, down from 3.1 percent last summer, yet the Fed raised interest rates in January, after six increases in 1994. "The economy is expanding at an inflationary rate," says Anirvan Banerji, an economist at the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University. "Those signs are seen in the leading indicators."<p>Some investment houses track hundreds of indicators in their search for inflation insights. Obviously, this sort of scrutiny would be impossible for an individual. It may also, however, be unnecessary. CIBCR's inflation barometer, a standard for most economists, uses only seven measures, all of which investors can easily track. A majority of these measures, listed below, must fall in concert for inflation to decline in six to nine months, as it has 11 times since 1949.<p>1. Journal of Commerce Industrial Price Index, created by CIBCR, comprising prices of 17 commodities like textiles and metals.<p>2. Import prices, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.<p>3. Federal and nonfederal debt, as measured by the Treasury Department.<p>4. BLS's ratio of employment to the overall population, which shows how tight the labor market is.<p>5. National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly report, which measures the percentage of managers reporting increased prices at the wholesale level.<p>6. NAPM's delivery-time report, which measures the percentage of managers reporting longer delivery times, suggesting changes between supply and demand.<p>7. A quarterly Dun & Bradstreet survey measuring the number of businesses expecting to raise prices in the coming quarter.<p>These anticipatory numbers are more important than ever. Under chairman Alan Greenspan, Banerji says, "for the first time, the Fed has raised interest rates in response to the leading inflation indicators, rather than waiting for inflation to hit first."<p>CIBCR's indicators have been rising for a year, signaling that inflation could begin to accelerate at any time. However, some minor relief arrived in early February, when the percentage of purchasing managers reporting slower deliveries declined.<p>"We expect inflation to reach about 3.5 percent by the summer," says Banerji. "It won't look like runaway inflation to Main Street, 2.7 percent to 3.5 percent, but the value of bonds on Wall Street might drop."<p>Since 1979, the center, founded by Geoffrey Moore, Alan Greenspan's college statistics professor, has been unerring in anticipating the business cycle, give or take six months, Banerji says. Recorded inflation data are available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (202-606-6994). An annual subscription to NAPM's monthly Report on Business is $150 (800-888-6276); CIBCR's daily fax (212-280-4420) is $4,500 annually. <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Experts<p>WOULD UNCLE SAM LIE TO YOU?
When it comes to employment and economic growth, Washington doesn't need good news to publish good numbers.<p>By Gretchen Morgenson<p>Every week, the U.S. government unleashes a fusillade of economic data that stock and bond investors await with fear and trembling. Is the economy booming or stumbling? Are jobs being created? Is the trade deficit up or down? Depending upon the answers Uncle Sam provides, markets can soar or plunge; fortunes can be made or lost.<p>Recent case: On September 2, Treasury bonds quickly jumped up a point, then plunged a point and a half after the government released August's unemployment figures, a closely watched indicator of the economy's strength. What caused the whipsaw? Initially, the employment numbers looked weak to traders in the bond market. Weak employment numbers are anti-inflationary -- good news for bonds. But after traders scrutinized the data, they realized the numbers weren't so wimpy after all -- bad news for bonds. <p>Obviously, government economic statistics are of paramount importance to investors. They are absolutely relied upon by professionals and individuals to measure the economy's progress. Without access to these crucial statistics, investors would be flying blind.<p>But is the economic data that emanates from our capital reliable?<p>Recently, a couple of veteran economists have been saying the answer is no. They contend that recent changes in the ways several key figures are assembled by the folks in Washington tend to obfuscate the economic picture. The changes make our economy look much rosier than it is, the economists say.<p>Albert Sindlinger is one of these critics. Sindlinger is worth listening to in part because of his unusually long perspective: At 87, he has perused government statistics since 1928, initially working for Herbert Hoover. Some 70 years ago, Sindlinger created the consumer-confidence survey, still used today to take the consumer's pulse. An economist in Wallingford, Pennsylvania, he and his staff conduct 5,000 phone interviews a month on consumers' incomes, job security, and local business conditions. From this research comes his view of how the consumer and the economy are doing. <p>Speaking of the recent changes in how certain economic numbers are compiled by the government, Sindlinger says, "Each administration wants to put its best foot forward. Statistics don't lie, but you can sure lie with statistics."<p>Sindlinger's biggest complaint is with the unemployment figures. He takes great exception, for instance, to the Clinton administration's claim of having created 4.3 million jobs in its first 19 months in office. He reckons that 2.5 million of those -- 52 percent of the total claimed -- are what he calls phantom jobs, nonexistent. Fantasyland.<p>How can this be? Phantom jobs creep into the picture in a line in the unemployment data called bias factor, a component used since 1983 as a way to measure the growth of small businesses. Ordinary unemployment data, compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, focused only on jobs created in industrial and service sectors, yet when the country was emerging from the recession of '81, many jobs were created by small businesses. The BLS estimated this growth at 155,000 jobs. This figure, in turn, was used to derive something called the "bias factor." Since then, bias-factor estimates have been used to figure monthly job data.<p>Back in 1983, the number of jobs in the bias factor was around 10 percent of the total being created nationwide. The economy was humming; gross domestic product was growing -- up almost 8 percent in 1983 and 11 percent in 1984. Now, the bias factor accounts for over half the jobs allegedly created, even though, as Sindlinger maintains, the economy is not doing nearly as well. <p>Still, the bias factor chugs on, piling up supposedly new jobs: In the most recent unemployment announcement, 158,000 of the 179,000 rise in nonfarm payrolls, almost 90 percent of the gain, resulted from the bias factor. Bias-factor figures are guesses and, to Sindlinger, completely untrustworthy. <p>Walter Williams, an economist at Econometric Publications in Ridgewood, New Jersey, and co-editor of The Straight Shooter, an economic-analysis newsletter, is also extremely dubious about the quality of government statistics. In addition to the misleading nature of the bias factor in job creation, Williams believes that the Bureau of Labor Statistics is undercounting about 5 million of what he calls hard-core unemployed workers. New questions put into the BLS's survey this year eliminated from the labor-force count a category of what the government calls discouraged workers, those who have stopped looking for work during the prior year. These unfortunates are not considered discouraged -- and therefore are no longer tallied -- because they have been discouraged for a year or more. That's because after a year, the government thinks these people just don't want to work, which in Washington is somehow different from being unemployed. As a result, says Williams, 90 percent of the 5 million discouraged workers have vanished from the unemployment rolls. <p>This helps keep the unemployment rate at a relatively acceptable 6.4 percent; a more accurate number, according to both Williams and Sindlinger, is 10 percent. "The Clinton people are bragging about the jobs they created," says Sindlinger. "Well, the jobs they've created are all on a computer program." Indeed, the Department of Labor's inspector general's office is auditing job figures put out by the BLS in response to allegations of dubious bookkeeping.<p>Another calculation that Williams considers unacceptable is the way wages and salaries are now reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This is a key report: Wages and salaries are the single largest income account in gross domestic product.<p>The trouble, as Williams sees it, began in 1992, when the BEA reported wage and salary increases of 5.6 percent, which contributed heavily to GDP growth of 2.6 percent, according to the bureau. But the BEA's rosy wage and salary number looks extremely suspect when placed beside the Internal Revenue Service's reports on wage and salary growth. The IRS says that '92 wages and salaries were up only 2.2 percent. With this figure, growth in the nation's GDP in 1992 shrinks to minus 1 percent. <p>Which number do you believe? Williams says the IRS is a much more credible source, even if you add to the equation incomes that are too small to be reported or that are hidden from the tax man. The BEA, on the other hand, simply uses estimates of employment, wages, and hours as surveyed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.<p>Here's something else that buttresses Williams's argument: A review of BEA and IRS reports on wages and salaries back to 1979 shows that there has never been a discrepancy in the figures as large as the nearly $100 billion gap that appeared in 1992. During that time, the disparity between wages and salaries reported by the two outfits each year never exceeded $20 billion.<p>Data regarding the U.S. merchandise-trade deficit is another area that doesn't pass the smell test these days. Although the components and the manner in which the trade numbers are collected had been constant since 1948, last year the Clinton administration decided to add a new figure to the compilation -- services. Unlike the trade balance in merchandise, which is negative, the trade balance in services is a surplus, so the overall monthly deficit comes in lower. <p>"The administration didn't like the widening trade deficit," says Williams. "So they added surplus of services. Before this, the trade numbers had been reasonably accurate." Now they are not. Why? Because there's no reliable way to measure the output of services on a monthly basis. But the Commerce Department guesses at it and throws it into the mix.<p>Understanding how the reporting of these numbers has changed in recent years is instructive on several counts. The Clinton administration, naturally, wants the economy to look robust so consumers feel good. People vote their pocketbooks: Since 1916, the incumbent party in the White House has lost every presidential election when real growth in disposable income came in below 3.9 percent for the year. Clinton wants to be a two-termer, so he must do whatever he can to make consumers believe they're better off. Furthermore, Clinton needs at least 3 percent GDP growth to keep his federal deficit-reduction plan on track. If growth drops below that rate, tax receipts won't be sufficient to reduce the deficit as planned.<p>But Sindlinger believes the public isn't gulled by funny numbers out of Washington. His case: If Americans thought the economy was as strong as the economic statistics are telling us, Clinton's approval rating would be around 60 percent, rather than the 40 percent he presently earns. Says Sindlinger: "You can fool Wall Street and you can fool the press, but you can't fool Main Street. The public simply knows better."

IS DEFLATION THE REAL DANGER?That's right, deflation. The economy moves through cycles of inflation and deflation, and the signs point to a change.<p>
By Walter Mead<p>
A Tennessee politician once told me about a candidate for public office who was being interviewed by a local reporter. <p>
"What do you think about inflation, Congressman?"<p>
The candidate paused to think and then replied: "I'm agin' it. We've got too much inflation coming out of Washington, D.C., and it has got to stop."<p>
"Then what do you think about deflation?" the reporter asked. <p>
"Well," the politician said, "I'm agin' that too. I don't like inflation, and I don't like deflation. What I want to know is, why can't we just stick with plain old-fashioned flation?"<p>
When the central banks of most of the developed world are so obviously fighting inflation, it's easy to forget that the financial history of the capitalist world is the record of swings between the extremes of inflation and deflation. Yet investors who find themselves on the wrong side of one of these swings will certainly come to regret it, for the difference between the two extremes is far from insignificant. <p>
In inflationary times, when the purchasing power of a dollar is declining, investors want to own things. Stocks, which represent ownership, are thus better investments than bonds in such periods. Deflation works just the opposite way. The prices of things decline, and the value of a dollar increases. <p>
It's hard for the current generation of investors to imagine such a development, perhaps, but it's going on right now in industries that produce computers. A dollar today will buy far more computing power than a dollar would have yesterday. Or think of all the homeowners who bought homes in the 1980s in the belief that house prices would keep rising forever. When real estate prices fell in many markets, these people faced large and totally unexpected capital losses.<p>
Such isolated economic incidents, of course, aren't enough to make an era deflationary. To envision deflation, extend trends like these across the entire economy. Imagine simultaneous bear markets in stocks, real estate, and commodities. Add unemployment: Deflation is almost always accompanied by mass layoffs as whole companies go broke or lose big chunks of their business. During the Great Depression, millions of people woke up one day to find that the value of what they owned had shrunk and their jobs had disappeared. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank from a high of 381.17 in 1929 to a low of 41.22 in 1932. The Dow did not regain its 1929 level until 1954.<p>
Bonds of blue-chip companies and governments, of course, are stellar performers in periods of deflation, as their steady stream of interest payments is worth more in goods every day. <p>
At the moment, inflation rules our thoughts. We live and invest in an era of inflationary expectations. Deflation has been almost forgotten; it is inflation that haunts the dreams of investors and central bankers as they sleep. <p>
Fair enough. But nothing lasts forever. The familiar business cycle, for example, guarantees that inflation follows deflation, which follows inflation. During an economic expansion, demand rises as the economy heats up. Shortages of workers lead to higher wages; this new purchasing power increases the demand for goods, and this pushes up prices throughout the economy.<p>
In recessions, things work the other way around. Falling demand leads to layoffs, and layoffs reduce demand even further. Wages and prices both fall until the economy is ready -- either on its own or with the help of the government -- to recover.<p>
But business cycles are relatively short-term oscillations between inflation and deflation. Longer-term forces are also at work, producing much more persistent trends. Over time, the economy seems to behave a bit like the climate. The short-term business cycle rises and falls like the temperature each day, but just as these daily cycles take place against the background of the seasonal change from summer to winter, so do the fluctuations of the business cycle occur in economic "winters" and "summers." <p>
We have had five of these economic seasons in the past 150 years of American history. An inflationary economic summer that included the Civil War and ended in the 1870s was followed by a deflationary winter that lasted until the First World War. During this deflation, the world economy was unusually vulnerable to panics and crashes. Stock markets swooned on the least provocation, and it was difficult for the economy to sustain stable growth. Temporary thaws were inevitably succeeded by a return to seasonable cold -- just as the temperature in a Maine winter has a hard time climbing above freezing for more than a few days.<p>
Summer returned as the world economy heated up with the First World War. From 1914 until the Great Depression, inflation was a more worrisome possibility than deflation. Economies boomed with the slightest excuse, and stock prices soared on any financial rumor.<p>
Winter returned with a roar in the stock market crash of 1929 and the ensuing depression, but by the 1960s the world was back in high summer. Recessions were short and expansions long and robust; prices, of course, tended to rise, but the inflationary temperatures didn't really warm up until the 1970s. Ever since, the world's economists and policy makers have concentrated on holding inflation at bay.<p>
This season will end, like all the others. But when? Are we still in midsummer, a season extended by the clever actions of central bankers? Or have we entered the economic equivalent of autumn, a period when deflationary forces are becoming more important? Nobody really understands long-term economic changes well enough to predict the exact timing of the onset of a new cycle. But an increasing number of signs point to approaching changes in the economic climate.<p>
Fans of Sherlock Holmes appreciate the importance of the dog that didn't bark -- a significant clue. So too should investors. As readers of this magazine keep reminding me in their letters, the United States is running a large budget deficit. These huge annual deficits have now been a part of our life since Ronald Reagan's first budget back in 1981. But inflation is lower today than it was before this inflationary period of budget busting. We have had the furnace on full blast since 1981, but the house isn't getting any warmer. This may be telling us something about the deflationary climate outside. <p>
The long-term rise in the unemployment rate is also a deflationary sign. Thirty years ago, unemployment in Western Europe rarely got above 4 percent; today it rarely gets below 7 percent. Something similar, if less dramatic, has happened in the United States. Thirty years ago we sang dirges and worried about a depression if unemployment in the U.S. reached 6 percent. Today when unemployment sinks to 6 percent we sing hosannas -- and worry about inflation. <p>
Two of the leading theories about why economies move through long-term cycles also suggest that the world economy is moving into a deflationary era. Proponents of the generational theory, for instance, say that policy makers, like generals, are always fighting the last war. A generation that grew up hating and fearing deflation will be slow to recognize inflation and bad at stopping it. For instance, the generation that remembered the inflation associated with the American Civil War was so worried about controlling inflation that it tightened the money supply even in the face of the persistent deflation and economic depressions of the 1880s and 1890s. The inflation associated with World War I may have helped bring on the Great Depression; policy makers were trying so hard to keep inflation at bay that the Fed raised interest rates in 1929.<p>
Our leaders today are as fixated on inflation as any of these predecessors. They are used to thinking that recessions are temporary inconveniences, while inflation is the real problem. That bias leads them to focus on keeping labor costs down by firing all the striking air-traffic controllers, as Ronald Reagan did, or to put increasing trade with China above pressing the Chinese government on its labor practices, as Bill Clinton has done. These policies, right or wrong, both arise from a conviction that the supply side of the economy is the important one.<p>
During the 1980s, policy makers tended to forget about the demand side. But economies don't just get into trouble when supply-side shortages cause prices to rise; they also slide downward when weak demand makes prices fall. Supply-side economics generally aims to increase the supply of goods at a given price level -- by cutting taxes, the cost of labor, and other factors that drive prices up.<p>
This is smart thinking when prices are on their way up, but if the demand side of the economy is weak, supply-side economics just makes things worse. If workers already can't buy enough cars to keep the economy moving, cutting their wages isn't going to help.<p>
Another view, however, holds that changes in the global economy, like the shift from an inflationary to a deflationary environment, are usually driven by big changes in technology. Here it's important to understand that any technology has both inflationary and deflationary tendencies over different time periods. For example, the explosive growth of railroads in the mid-19th century, financed largely with foreign capital, started a boom in the U.S. Add in the massive debt-financed spending of the Civil War, and, presto, inflation.<p>
But as new railroads opened new farming and mining areas around the world to commercial exploitation, supply of such goods as wheat rose faster than demand -- leading to the falling prices of a deflationary era that lasted until World War I.<p>
Something similar happened in the 1920s. The new mass-production techniques pioneered by industrialists like Ford led to huge productivity increases. At first this set off an investment-led industrial expansion; factories were built to produce cars, refrigerators, and other goods using the new improved techniques. But once again, supply outstripped demand, and the global economy tilted toward deflation in the Depression.<p>
In the 1980s and early 1990s, we have seen another global expansion based on enhanced productivity. The use of computers in manufacturing and services has helped slash production costs. So has the industrial revolution in the third world. Factories in China and Bangladesh now produce goods for markets in Indianapolis and Oakland.<p>
Right now, it's impossible to tell if this technological boom will follow the pattern of the railroad-led boom in the last century. This investment will certainly create its own demand, and the boom will feed on itself. People building new factories in the low-wage countries of Asia and Latin America place lots of orders for new equipment and construction materials. New factories need new power sources and new highways. During this expansionary phase, the danger is that the world's demand for certain kinds of goods -- capital goods certainly, but also raw materials such as concrete, copper wire, and fiber-optic cable -- will outstrip supply, sending prices into an inflationary spiral. In periods like this, central banks must guard against economies that tend to overheat. <p>
But sooner or later, the new factories will come on line and begin pumping goods into the economy. If the supply of new goods is greater than the demand for them, then the economic dynamic will change. Prices will fall, factories will become unprofitable, companies will default on their debts, and layoffs will reduce demand even further. <p>
As high-wage workers in advanced western economies lose their jobs either to machines or to low-wage workers, economic demand stagnates and falls, even as the global supply of goods increases. The supply-side boom of the global expansion gives way to a demand-side bust.<p>
Nothing is certain in economics. The governments of the world could pursue policies that try to create demand by raising wages in the developing world as quickly as possible. Investors who see signs that demand-creation policies are cropping up in China, Malaysia, or the U.S. shouldn't worry about a deflationary winter. On the other hand, if policy makers stick only to the strategies of inflation-fighting, it might be wise to get your portfolio a nice fur coat.---------------

						July/August 1994  <p>Worth magazine/Features  <p> AMERICA'S INFLATION ANXIETY <p>How inflation became the bete noire of the economy -- and changedthe national character.  <p> By Joseph Nocera  <p> Earlier this year, when Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspanbegan pushing up interest rates -- an action that killed thebull markets in both stocks and bonds -- he cited a single reasonfor bringing the party to an end: the threat of inflation. WasGreenspan throwing out the bull with the bathwater? After all,it wasn't as though inflation had become a big problem. The consumerprice index was still signaling modest price increases (an annualrate of about 2.5 percent). Plus, it had been well over a decadesince any serious bout of inflation had infected the nation.Yet Greenspan said the phantom loomed so huge on the horizonthat radical measures had to be taken. He cited half a dozensignals, among them: The economy was overheated; the growth inGNP was at levels not seen in decades; the price of gold wasrising. Inflation, he seemed to be saying, was so great a scourgethat we would be better off living with less economic growth,higher interest rates, and an end to the bull market.   <p> A strong case can be made that in his obsession with inflation,Greenspan is fighting the last war. The national economy haschanged markedly in the past ten years, and it's quite reasonableto argue that ongoing productivity improvements and heightenedglobal competition will go a long way toward keeping inflationin check. Yet for anyone who lived through the age of inflation-- the period from 1978 to 1982, when rising prices chipped awayat our national self-confidence -- it is not hard to understandwhy the Fed chairman would find inflation so overriding a concern.Even now, after all this time, it is nearly impossible to overstatehow frightening inflation was at the time, how dramatically itchanged us. It had as profound an effect on one generation ofAmericans as the Depression had on a previous generation.   <p> Inflation splintered the status quo every bit as much as theVietnam War did. It helped fuel the rise of special-interestpolitics, causing Americans to become selfish in a way they reallyhadn't been before. If during the Depression people respondedby helping each other out as best they could, inflation had theopposite effect. It created an ethos in which people felt justifiedin cutting special deals for themselves, even when the net effectof those deals was to make things worse for everyone else. Whenevera union chief won a demand that his members receive wage increasesexceeding the cost of living, inflation worsened. Whenever theelderly lobby won a demand that automatic cost-of-living adjustmentsbe tacked on to Social Security payments, that action also fueledinflation. When government officials argued that the "spiralof inflation" could only be stopped if Americans were willingto sacrifice for the common good, they got nowhere.  <p> Inflation changed politics, too. Just as the Depression pavedthe way for Franklin Roosevelt and 20 years of Democratic controlof the White House, inflation helped bring down Jimmy Carterand set the stage for the Reagan-Bush years. Despite a numberof memorable achievements, the enduring image of Carter is thepicture of a sincere, pained man pleading with the nation toaccept its part of the shared sacrifice that he felt was requiredto beat inflation.   <p> Most enduringly, inflation altered the relationship of the middleclass to its money. The old behaviors and values that had beenswept in by the Depression -- thrift, an aversion to financialrisk, a belief that the bank was the only safe place for one'smoney -- were washed away by inflation and replaced by a newset of behaviors and values. If you want to understand why peoplebegan running up credit card bills or why they began moving theirmoney out of trusty savings accounts and into money market fundsand other more exotic financial vehicles, then you have to understandwhat happened during the age of inflation. Quite simply, inflationmarked the moment when the financial life of the middle classcould never again be simple or ordered or easy.   <p>   <p> It is almost impossible to know what causes inflation. Thatis mainly why it is so difficult to eradicate once it sets in.The classic definition calls inflation the result of "too muchmoney chasing too few goods." That's the simplest explanation,and it also explains Greenspan's actions: By raising interestrates, he is effectively making money itself more precious.  <p> It is almost universally believed that inflation's initial spurwas Lyndon Johnson's infamous "guns and butter" strategy of thelate 1960s: his decision to finance the Vietnam War effort andthe Great Society programs by creating a budget deficit insteadof raising taxes. Yet the experience of the 1980s strongly suggeststhat budget deficits are not inevitably inflationary -- as longas government resists the temptation to print more money to payoff its own debts.   <p> Many conservative economists, such as Milton Friedman, linkthe age of inflation to Richard Nixon's 1971 decision to takethe dollar off the gold standard. OPEC also played a crucialrole in reducing the purchasing power of the dollar; the cartelraised oil prices at will during the 1970s, creating severe economicproblems in America. There were food shortages that had inflationaryconsequences, as any shortage must. And during the 1970s, productivity-- which had risen steadily for two decades -- stopped goingup. Thus, large wage increases were not matched by productivityincreases. To oversimplify, more money was chasing the same goods. <p> The crucial point is that once the cost of living began to rise-- for whatever reason or group of reasons -- it was extraordinarilydifficult to get under control. Inflation became a psychologicalphenomenon as much as anything. Americans were used to a risingstandard of living and, at least back then, saw no reason whythis shouldn't continue. When inflation picked up, workers wouldclamor for higher wages. Businesses, anticipating wage hikes,raised prices to protect their profit margins. Which triggeredmore inflation. Which triggered a new round of wage demands.Which triggered a new round of price increases. The expectationof inflation actually created inflation. Cost-of-living allowancesbecame a fixture of every union contract and government program,virtually cementing the upward spiral in place.  <p> Presidents and their advisors tried to control it. Nixon, seeingprices shoot upward during his first term, imposed wage and pricecontrols for three months. This was a disastrous experiment.Once the controls were lifted, prices simply exploded. Then,after the first frightening outbreak of double-digit inflationin 1974, Gerald Ford instituted his widely ridiculed Whip InflationNow program, complete with WIN lapel buttons. Still, within twoyears, the rate of inflation as measured by the CPI was lessthan 5 percent a year. Ford's problem was that in focusing exclusivelyon inflation, he had ignored rising unemployment. But then, inthe eyes of most economists, that was the classic trade-off:To beat down inflation, it was generally believed, you had tobe willing to create some economic suffering. Unemployment hadto rise. This would increase competition for jobs and make unionsthink twice before asking for fat wage increases. As the economyslowed, companies would also have more trouble pushing throughprice increases. The problem of "too much money" would be solved. <p> And then came Jimmy Carter....  <p> Carter came to office in 1976 with almost no understanding ofmacroeconomics and with a stunningly unrealistic view that hecould handle everything at once. He planned to get inflationunder control, to bring down unemployment, to balance the federalbudget, and to add dozens of new federal programs. As for theclassic trade-off between inflation and unemployment, Carterwould not face the notion that it even existed. Advisors whourged him to get "his" recession out of the way early, as theyused to phrase it -- were ignored. "High unemployment is a morallyunacceptable way of combating inflation," he said in his firstpronouncement on the subject, "and I totally reject that approach." <p> So what did that leave him with? Not much, as it turns out.Carter seemed to think that he could kill inflation merely throughpersuasion. He thought he could talk America in off the ledge.His inflation-fighting plans always revolved around a complicatedseries of voluntary wage and price guidelines that both businessand labor were supposed to abide by. Voluntary guidelines couldwork only if Carter enforced them from the bully pulpit of theOval Office. Yet when it came to doing so, Jimmy Carter was infuriatinglytimid. Within the White House, for instance, he would encouragehis staff to stand up to labor, then the greatest special interestof them all, but in the end, he would always capitulate. Thishappened most vividly in late 1977, when the administration'ssudden change of heart allowed the United Mine Workers to extracta 37 percent wage increase from the nation's coal companies aftera bitter strike.  <p> It was the same with big business. The administration's Councilon Wage and Price Stability -- the White House bureaucracy chargedwith monitoring the guidelines -- would catch some company raisingprices far beyond the maximum allowed and would bring these violationsto the president's attention. Carter never did anything aboutit. The strongest action he ever took against any company wasto cancel a scheduled lunch at McDonald's because it had raisedthe price of Big Macs.  <p> Inevitably, inflation began creeping up soon after Carter tookoffice. Having fallen to 4.9 percent in 1976, Ford's last yearin office, the CPI rose to 6.7 percent in 1977, Carter's firstyear as president. Then, in the first three months of 1978, foodprices rose 15 percent, gasoline 11 percent, and medical costsmore than 9 percent. Inflation crept forward so steadily, soresolutely, that many concluded that rising prices were partof the natural order of things. Charles Schultze, head of theCouncil of Economic Advisors, came to the astonishing conclusionthat the core inflation rate -- the amount of inflation thatresulted "naturally," without any external events like an OPECprice hike or a sudden food shortage -- was 6 percent.   <p> By the end of 1978, inflation stood at 9 percent, nearly twiceas high as when Carter took office. Inflation had become a seriousmenace. "It is impossible to overestimate the importance of theinflation issue," began a late-1978 memo written by Gerald Rafshoon,the president's media advisor. "It affects every American ina very palpable way. It causes insecurity and anxiety. It threatensthe American Dream." In this, he was surely right.  <p>   <p> If you're too young to have been fully aware of the age of inflation,or if you've washed away the memory in the intervening decadeof bull markets and low inflation, it's worth taking a momentto conjure it up again. To do so is to understand what's motivatingAlan Greenspan right now.  <p> During the age of inflation, Americans had to wait in line forhours to buy gasoline -- at prices that were twice what theyhad been just weeks before. A trip to the supermarket was a debilitatingexercise; from one visit to the next, one's money bought palpablyless. Theodore White, the great chronicler of presidential campaigns,would later recall the way Americans "winced and ached. Somemysterious power was hollowing their hopes and dreams, theirplans for a house or their children's education. ...  (T)hosewho still held war bonds  ...  or put their money in savingsbanks -- all those had been cheated. What they saved today would ...  be worth half as much five years later."  <p> That's what inflation felt like.  <p> And no one could do anything about it except adjust. Americanscoped with this new economic reality just as they had once copedwith the reality of the Depression. Those who lived on fixedincomes devised strategies to keep their income rising. Wivesjoined the workforce by the millions. "It turns out that peoplecan scramble and keep up longer than you think they can," economistBarry Bosworth, one of Jimmy Carter's chief inflation fighters,once remarked. That of course is also what made stamping outinflation so difficult: Americans spent as much time adaptingto it as they did complaining about it.   <p> In retrospect, three changes seem most significant. First, homeownership took on a new kind of importance: a financial importance.As inflation drove up the price of houses, people began not somuch buying homes as investing in them; the down payment wastheir equity stake. For most families, the house was their largestand most important financial asset, the one asset whose valueseemed to go in only one direction: up. When people latched onto this fact, a mad scramble ensued, as Americans used everydollar and bit of leverage they could find to buy the most expensivehouse possible. (Between 1975 and 1978, home mortgages in Americarose from $479 billion to $737 billion.) Years later, Americanshad become so accustomed to seeing their houses rise in valuethat they forgot they could lose value as well. When home pricesdid finally begin going down, at least a little, in the early1990s, it came as an enormous shock.  <p> Second, people began taking their money out of bank passbookaccounts -- where, by law, interest was fixed at 51/4 percent-- and began putting their savings in money market funds. Thesefunds were offering market rates of interest, which during thepeak years of inflation could get as high as 17 and 18 percent.This wholesale transfer of money would have consequences thatare still felt to this day. At that moment, banks and S&Ls losttheir grip on the middle-class saver, a grip that they've neverbeen able to regain. Instead, the brokerage houses and mutualfund companies that ran the nation's money market funds gainedaccess to millions of Americans who had never before even thoughtabout investing. This is when the old Depression-era fear offinancial risk came to an end; even though money market fundslacked federal deposit insurance, people were willing to usethem because they offered the only hope of having their savingskeep pace with inflation. It also began the slow process by whichmillions of people went from being savers to being investors.Once their money was in money market funds, it never returnedto the bank. And once the 1982 bull market began, it was almostnatural for that money to make its way into stocks. Mutual funds,which were insignificant prior to the 1980s, now hold $2 trillionin assets and are among the most powerful of financial vehicles.Their current prominence is directly traceable to the age ofinflation.  <p> Finally, the age of inflation induced Americans to borrow asthey'd never borrowed before. In just three years, 1975 to 1978,consumer borrowing increased by 60 percent, a rate of increasethat hadn't been seen since the 1950s. But in that earlier time,interest rates were low, consumer desires were exploding, andthe rapidly expanding middle class was full of optimism aboutthe future. The conditions for borrowing were ideal. In the 1970s,by contrast, interest rates were at historic heights, and Americanswere decidedly pessimistic about the future. Yet the middle classin the 1970s was outborrowing its 1950s counterpart. Historically,whenever consumer debt reached 2.5 percent of total consumerdisposable income, it would be followed by an immediate slowdownin borrowing. In 1978, consumer debt regularly topped 3 percentof disposable income, yet there wasn't so much as a hint of aslowdown. Thrift, perhaps the most powerful of all financialhabits, was suddenly outmoded. In a time of double-digit inflation,simply saving money wasn't virtuous; it was foolish. It meantpaying for tomorrow's more expensive goods with yesterday's diminisheddollars. Borrowing, on the other hand, meant purchasing yesterday'sless expensive goods with tomorrow's inflated dollars.  <p> In a paper titled "Social Changes Affecting the Consumer FinanceIndustry, Period 1980-2000," Dana Bramlette and Anthony Weiner,two futurists at the University of Southern California, codifiedthe changing values evolving from the age of inflation. Speakingof the baby-boom generation, just then inching toward middleage, they declared, "The traditional values espoused in PoorRichard's Almanack (have been) turned upside down," replacedby a new set of cultural assumptions, such as:  <p> 1. It doesn't pay to save for a rainy day.  <p> 2. Buy now, pay later: Prices will invariably go up, and thepurchasing power of your dollar will invariably go down.  <p> 3. Stretch your financial obligations over as long a periodof time as possible.  <p> 4. Borrowing improves your credit rating.  <p> 5. Pay your bills as late as you can (without jeopardizing yourcredit rating).  <p> Thus did America cope with inflation; thus did America change. <p>   <p> The most memorable political figure to emerge from the age ofinflation was not Jimmy Carter but one of his aides -- a rathertoothless aide, as it happens, with a title that was all butmeaningless. The aide was a genial, uninhibited, outspoken professorof political economy, on leave from Cornell University, by thename of Alfred Kahn; his title was inflation czar. Within theWhite House, he had no power. Nor did he have the temperamentto acquire power. What he had, mainly, was the kind of irrepressiblecandor that one rarely sees in a political figure.  <p> Kahn is the only presidential aide in history to call the Araboil producers "schnooks." He once described Carter's wage andprice guidelines -- which he himself was supposed to be administering-- as "those stinking guidelines." Another time, after he hadsaid once too often that he thought the country was headed fora "real depression" if inflation wasn't stopped, he got a callfrom Stuart Eizenstat, Carter's chief domestic advisor. "Fred,"said Eizenstat gently, "please try not to use that word. It scarespeople." A few days later, Kahn was delivering his stock speech,and when he got to part where he usually predicted a depression,he said, "We're going to have a  ...  I don't care what you callit. Let's call it a banana."   <p> It wasn't candor that made Fred Kahn wrong for the job, though.He simply had nothing to add to the administration's store ofanti-inflation ideas, something he freely admits. "I could neverthink up enough magic bullets," he says now with a small sigh.Eventually, he came to the conclusion that no one could -- noeconomist, at least. Inflation, he once wrote Carter, wasn'tjust a matter of economics. "It is a deeply sociological, psychological,political phenomenon. It is  ...  a reflection of a society indissolution (resulting from) a weakening of the social fabric....  To turn responsibility for devising policies and programsfor dealing with that kind of deeply social phenomenon to a groupof professional economists is in very large measure to turn itover to the wrong kinds of people."   <p> Undoubtedly, such sentiments were more correct than not. ButCarter didn't need a philosopher. He needed a hit man. Kahn'sappointment coincided with the onset of double-digit inflation.And there wasn't a thing Kahn or anyone else in the administrationcould do about it. In December 1978, OPEC raised oil prices 14percent. The following month, the producer price index, an importantinflation indicator, rose 1.3 percent in a single month, whichtranslated to a 16.8 percent annual rate. In April 1979, theTeamsters announced a new three-year contract that called fora 30 percent wage hike. Over the course of the spring of '79,meat prices rose 85 percent. And then that June, OPEC did itagain, announcing a near doubling of oil prices, from $12.50a barrel to $22 a barrel. Carter, returning home from a summitmeeting in Tokyo, skipped a planned trip to Hawaii to take commandof the looming crisis. He did so by making a speech -- the mostfamous speech of his entire presidency, and one that would hauntthe Democratic Party for the next decade and more.   <p> The speech has since come to be labeled the malaise speech,though as has been often noted since, the word malaise was neveractually uttered by the president. Its tone, however, was unquestionablygloomy, brimming with the notion that we had lost our way asa nation and that inflation was part of the proof of that.  <p> The speech had been the subject of vigorous argument withinthe White House. Of the Carter aides who believed the malaisespeech was a terrible mistake, the most vehement was Vice PresidentWalter Mondale; his argument was directly connected to his senseof how people were reacting to inflation. "He rejected the diagnosisthat the country was suffering from some sort of ... emotionalcollapse," wrote Elizabeth Drew in The New Yorker. "He arguedthat the need was not to scold people for being 'selfish,' butto respond to what was bothering them."  <p> To read old memos written by Carter's advisors is to wonderif they were living in a parallel universe. "Our (anti-inflation)activities have to be visible, sustained and planned," a Carteraide named Anne Wexler wrote the president, echoing the wordsof a hundred similar missives. "They must build on each otherand reinforce a constant theme, rather than appearing to be adhoc reactions to current developments." But what activities wasshe talking about? And how would they be planned? And how wouldthey reinforce a constant theme? And what was the theme, anyway?Inflation fighting had devolved into wheel spinning.  <p> A large part of the problem was that there weren't enough peopleworking in the Carter White House who were personally affectedby inflation. Many of Carter's aides were in their 20s or early30s -- chief of staff Hamilton Jordan, for instance, was 32,press spokesman Jody Powell just a few years older. Young andsingle, living in one-bedroom apartments and making more moneythan they'd ever seen in their lives, they were oblivious tothe psychological and economic pressures inflation placed onmiddle-class families. "Back then, a prime rate of 20 percent(a figure reached in 1980) didn't mean a thing to me," says DavidRubenstein, who was all of 26 when he worked as a White Housedomestic policy aide. "Now I think, 'My God! How did people buyhouses? How did the economy function?'"  <p> Kahn's aide Al From, who now runs the Democratic LeadershipCouncil, an organization founded in 1985 to push a centrist Democraticagenda, was one of the few in the Carter White House who actuallyfelt the pressures of inflation. Though less powerful than thelikes of Jordan or Powell, he was older. He owned a house andwas raising a family, for which he was the sole provider. Perhapsthat is why he was one of the few Carter aides who could clearlysee how fundamentally pointless the administration's anti-inflationprograms had become.  <p> Again and again, From tried to make the White House see thatall the anti-inflation programs in the world didn't mean a thingif they didn't drive down the rate of inflation. But his colleaguesdidn't understand -- not until it was much too late -- that inflationwas the overriding concern of the middle class. It used to infuriateFrom the way the liberals in the administration tried to castinflation as an issue affecting only the weak and the poor: "Sucha portrayal of inflation's impact is likely to create a negativereaction among the much broader constituency of middle Americanswho are reeling from high inflation," he fired back. "(I)ts greatestdanger is to our economic security, the security that most Americansare seeking." Unemployment was the historic Democratic issue,but unemployment only affected the unemployed. Inflation affectedeverybody. That was the cruel political calculus.  <p>   <p> In the fall of 1979, the central battle in the war against inflationmoved away from the White House. That October, with the WhiteHouse efforts having proved ineffective, the battle was joinedby Paul Volcker, who three months before had been appointed byCarter to head the Federal Reserve. Volcker's efforts were sustainedand serious, and they caused wrenching hardships. But when hewas done, he had successfully broken the back of inflation. Fromthat point forward, inflation fighting would always be the Fed'stop priority.   <p> Volcker's weapon was the Federal Reserve's control of monetarypolicy -- that is, the ability to control the nation's moneysupply. Traditionally, the Fed had influenced the money supplyindirectly, by fiddling with interest rates, moving them up ordown a quarter of a percent at a time. Volcker was convincedthat this approach was too incremental. He decided that the FederalReserve should control the growth of money directly, by regulatingthe amount of money the nation's banks had to hold in reserve."In effect," he later wrote, "our emphasis would shift from controllingthe price of money to its quantity." He was choosing, that is,a radical solution, never before tested in the real world, thathad long been promoted by a group of conservative economistsknown as monetarists. Their champion was Milton Friedman, a staunchproponent of the idea that the best way to influence the valueof the dollar was to restrict the total number of dollars washingthrough the economy. To fight inflation, this essentially requiredkeeping the growth of the money supply in line with the growthof the economy.  <p> "More focus on the money supply ... would be a way of tellingthe public that we meant business," Volcker wrote. "People don'tneed an advanced course in economics to understand that inflationhas something to do with too much money. If we could get outthe message that when we say we're going to control money, wemean we're going to deal with inflation, then we would have achance of affecting ordinary people's behavior." But that's notwhat happened at first. Interest rates, loosed from their moorings,went crazy. The prime rate, which had been hovering in the 12percent range, jumped to 15.75 percent that fall. And inflationitself kept rising. In January 1980, the Labor Department confirmedthe country's worst fears: The CPI had risen 13.3 percent in1979 -- the largest one-year increase since the late 1940s.  <p> Two days later, Carter released his annual economic report toCongress, which has to rank as one of the most pessimistic documentsever issued by an American president. In the report, the administrationsaid that it anticipated that the gross national product woulddrop by 1 percent in 1980 while unemployment would rise to 7.5percent. In other words, the president of the United States waspredicting that the country would be thrown into a recession-- in an election year! This wasn't just an unusual admission;it was unheard of. In the same report, Carter predicted a secondstraight year of double-digit inflation, something America hadn'tseen since World War I. A new word was added to the nation'spolitical discourse: stagflation. This wasn't supposed to bepossible under the theory that described the seesaw trade-offbetween inflation and unemployment. Now, it appeared, the wholeseesaw was sinking into the muck. Volcker again: "(T)here wasa palpable sense of growing political panic as well as economicdistress."  <p> Panic and distress accelerated in the following month. On February22, 1980, the Labor Department announced the sharpest rise yetin the CPI -- 1.4 percent, a figure that projected to an annualrate of 18 percent. While this might seem like just another numbinginflation report, it was not. The nation seemed to be seizedby the notion that the great postwar economy was on the vergeof disintegrating. The rise in the CPI was the highest one-monthgain since the Arab oil embargo of 1973. And it was accompaniedby the news that the major banks were raising their prime rateby three quarters of a point, to 16.5 percent -- the single largestone-day rise in a decade. When the bond market opened the followingMonday, it crashed.  <p> The news had a galvanizing effect on the Carter administration,which reacted, for the first time in four years, with a realsense of urgency. Carter announced that inflation had reached"a crisis stage" and asked his advisors to come up with yet anotherinflation-fighting plan. Shortly afterward, he and his aidesbegan a series of extraordinary private meetings with the congressionalleadership in a dramatic attempt to rewrite the 1981 federalbudget, which Carter had submitted to Congress a few weeks earlier.That original budget, which assumed a deficit of $15 billion,had been greeted with derision, especially on Wall Street, whichsaw an out-of-balance budget as sending "the wrong signal" aboutinflation. Three weeks later Carter announced that the budgetwas in balance -- and he unveiled a new, tougher inflation policy.Naturally, it resulted in the biggest disaster of all.  <p> Little in Carter's tough new inflation policy was new or tough.Except for one new wrinkle, it was (sigh) typical Jimmy Carter.Along with new wage and price guidelines and a freeze on federalemployment, Carter had slipped in a program to place federalcontrols on consumer credit. He was trying to rein in creditcard debt, which of course had accelerated greatly. This wasthe first inflation-fighting idea that Fred Kahn could claimcredit for. Kahn believed that Americans were using their creditcards to sustain a lifestyle that inflation was pushing out ofreach, an act of trying to keep pace with inflation that onlyfueled it.  <p> What happened next was amazing. The entire country simply stoppedborrowing. "No one had ever seen anything like it," recalls Volcker.Kahn made speeches suggesting that people cut up their creditcards, and thousands did so and sent their sliced-up cards tothe White House to show that they supported the president's program. <p> It was quickly apparent that cutting up their credit cards wasthe worst thing they could have done, for both Carter and themselves.For months, consumer borrowing was the only thing that had keptthe recession at bay; when the borrowing stopped, the economycollapsed -- "within a matter of days," says Volcker. Embroiledin a nasty fight for the nomination, grappling by then with thehostage crisis in Iran and the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan,with his popularity at an all-time low -- this was the momentthat Jimmy Carter finally got "his" recession.  <p> As quickly as he decently could, Volcker undid the credit controls.By July, they were gone. He also temporarily loosened the moneysupply to revive the economy. Meanwhile, the balanced budgetwas quickly jettisoned as Congress added billions in additionalspending to put some life back in the economy. Interest ratesplummeted, the recession ended almost as quickly as it had begun,and even the CPI slowed down for a few months, though not enoughto prevent a second consecutive year of double-digit inflation. <p> But it was too late for Jimmy Carter. Everything he had triedhad failed, and he had nothing left. He was done trying to fightinflation. Not long before the election, Kahn tried to get Carterto take a large army contract away from Kerr-McGee, an Oklahomaoil company, which the Council on Wage and Price Stability hadfound in violation of the price guidelines. But then the armyweighed in, claiming that the Kerr-McGee contract was importantto national security, and that was that.  <p> And all the while, Carter's opponent in the general election,Ronald Reagan, was using inflation as a stick to bludgeon thepresident with. The first page of the first campaign memo Reaganreceived, back in 1979, had said, "By a wide margin, the mostimportant issue in the minds of voters today is inflation." Henever forgot it. "When (Carter) took office," Reagan used tosay in his stump speech, "inflation was 4.8 percent, and he saidhe was going to do something about it. And he did. It's now averaging16.4 percent." A week before the election, the two men held theirone and only debate. Reagan was well ahead in the polls, buttoward the end of that debate, he administered the coup de gracewhen he looked into the camera and asked: "Are you better offthan you were four years ago?"  <p> Thanks to inflation, we were not better off, and we knew it.At that moment, Jimmy Carter's last, flickering hopes of winningreelection were gone for good.   <p>   <p> In the end, of course, Volcker's monetary solution took, butit was a brutal thing to live though. In 1980 and 1981, the policypushed the nation into the most wrenching recession since theDepression. That recession wrung inflation out of the economy.And Ronald Reagan did his part, too. When the nation's air-trafficcontrollers went out on strike in 1981, six months into his presidency,Reagan took the kind of action that Carter never could. He firedthem all. As cruel as this action was, it sent an unmistakablesignal: Inflationary wage settlements were over. Companies couldforce tougher terms on labor, and the government would not interfere.Whatever one thought of this stance as social policy, as economicpolicy, it worked.   <p> The CPI rose just 3.8 percent in 1982, and it stayed in thatgeneral range for the rest of the decade. That's not to say thatpeople didn't continue to treat their homes as an investment,to chase the higher yields they had become accustomed to duringthe age of inflation, and to continue to rely increasingly oncredit cards and consumer borrowing. They did all of these things,and they do to this day. The age of inflation had done its work:As surely as had the Depression, it had changed the way the greatAmerican middle class thought about and dealt with its money. <p>--------------- <p>This article is adapted from "A Piece of the Action: How theMiddle Class Joined the Money Class" by Joseph Nocera, copyright1994, to be published this fall by Simon & Schuster.  <p>  <hr>  <p>Copyright 1994 Capital Publishing Limited Partnership.

It depends on how soon the economy slows.<p>By Jim Jubak<p>In early April, any bond trader with two Treasurys to rub together knew that short rates were going to 3.75 percent. Indeed, the Federal Reserve bumped rates to that level on April 18. The dust had barely settled on the rate hike when bond traders started talking of a move to 4 percent, possibly around the Fed's mid-May meeting.<p>The question of the hour: Will a boost to 4 percent be the last? Answer: It depends. Until the economy responds with slower growth, the Fed is likely to keep raising rates. Signs that the economy is slowing aren't easy to spot, but bond traders are scanning the horizon. "What the bond market wants to see is good news in the tea leaves," says Barbara Kenworthy, fixed-income-portfolio manager for Dreyfus. Good news, to the bond market, is slow growth.<p>Look hard, and you'll find some such news. Commodity prices have come down a bit - April's rate hike choked a rally in gold. Housing sales have slowed, and auto sales are growing at a slightly less explosive rate - although that may be because manufacturers can't keep up with demand, which could be inflationary. Long bond rates, beyond 15 years, moved lower the day after the Fed's April hike.<p>Bond traders think they see the light at the end of the tunnel. "When we had the first 25 basis-point hike, everybody was saying 50 to 100," Kenworthy says. "Now that we've had a 75 basis-point hike, there's not so far to go. If we can just get to the point where people believe the Fed."<p><p>

After the quake and the snows, it's all guesswork<p>By Jim Jubak<p>Listen carefully and you can almost hear economists ratcheting up their forecasts. The economy is much stronger than these folks thought it would be when they made their predictions in December 1993. But the California earthquake and a winter of storm upon storm make the numbers for the first quarter tricky guides for the rest of 1994. For instance, was January's 22 percent drop in housing starts simply a result of the weather? How strong would the economy have been without weather-related events? And how have they changed the trend line for the year? <p>At the end of 1993, the consensus expected growth of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent in 1994. That was when everyone still thought growth in the fourth quarter of 1993 had been 5.9 percent.<p>Now that 5.9 percent has been revised to 7.5, the consensus for 1994 has risen to between 3 percent and 4 percent. Jeff Thredgold, chief economist at KeyCorp, the nation's 11th largest bank, sees 3.5 percent growth for the first quarter, "once you cut through the noise from the earthquake and the snow." Growth, Thredgold says, will be 3 percent to 3.3 percent for the second and third quarters.<p>As for the fourth quarter, amateur economists should watch mortgage rates, says Thredgold. Rising rates will definitely throw cold water on home building and associated industries. If rates rise to 8.5 percent in the fourth quarter, take 0.3 to 0.5 percentage points off of the growth rate.<p><p><p>

						<p><p>By Suzanne Costas<p>Northwestern University economist Robert Eisner has a different view of the budget deficit from most of his colleagues. He thinks it's largely benign and that President Clinton's newfound budget-cutting zeal has more to do with politics than with securing the nation's economic future. Eisner has written a new book explaining this nearly heretical position--The Misunderstood Economy: What Counts and How to Count It, published this month by Harvard Business School Press. He talked with Worth senior writer Suzanne Costas.<p>
Q: Can we really afford to be so unconcerned about the deficit? Mainstream economists have argued that the deficit threatens to sap the country's long-term economic health, that it leads us to consume too much and save too little.<p>A: We should not only be unconcerned, but we should reject that argument vigorously. Ross Perot has said we're spending our children's money. That's ridiculous. Our children's money hasn't even been printed yet. Whenever our children need money, [Federal Reserve chairman] Alan Greenspan or his successor can print them all the money they need. What our children are going to need to be productive are factories, plants, equipment, buildings, houses, and most important, education, the know-how to be productive citizens. <p>
Q: During his presidential campaign, Clinton promised increased investment in social programs. But the budget he presented to Congress in February offered primarily steep spending cuts. Why?<p>A: My gut feeling is that he still wants to invest in our future. But he's been influenced by stupid dogma. People think we haven't got the money, but the fact is, money can be gotten. The problem is a self-created one. Clinton can't spend without cutting elsewhere, because that's what's been legislated. The big economic package Clinton got through last year stipulates that you can't increase spending in one place without cutting it somewhere else. But he hasn't seen fit to defy that, to ask that it be changed. Except for emergencies like earthquake relief, it leaves him seriously bound.<p>
Q: You claim that deficits are okay provided income is growing faster than debt. But that hasn't been happening.<p>A: It's true that income hasn't been growing faster than debt. But depending on what happens with health care, the latest budget figures for fiscal '95 indicate that the deficit will be about $170 billion. That's less than what you'd need to keep the ratio of debt to general domestic product constant. By the end of fiscal '95, the debt is projected to grow about 5 percent and the GDP is forecast to grow about 6 percent. This implies that the ratio of debt to national income will not be rising.<p>
Q: What do you think of Greenspan's decision to raise short-term interest rates?<p>A: I think it's a bad thing to do. It only discourages investment spending. Those who want to reduce the deficit should deplore what Greenspan has done. One of the things that's brought the deficit down has been low interest rates. But from my point of view, what's bad about raising interest rates isn't that it will raise the deficit, but that it discourages investment in business and residential housing.<p>But there's a strong feeling among bankers that inflation is terrible, and bankers have a big influence on the Federal Reserve. They raise a hullabaloo. Bankers lend money long-term, and they borrow short. If inflation rises, the bank finds it has to pay a higher rate of interest, yet it's stuck with returns on loans it made at a lower rate of return some years ago. So banks take a licking if inflation goes up.<p>
Q: According to your calculations, the deficit isn't as large as we think it is. How did you reach that conclusion?<p>A: That's a fairly simple matter. If the government spends $200 billion more than it takes in a year, then at the end of the year the public has $200 billion more of government bonds than at the beginning of the year. Bonds, bills, treasury notes. But remember, at the moment there's an outstanding government debt of more than $3 trillion. Then there's inflation of 3 percent over the last year. Well, that means that the existing $3 trillion in bonds that the public already holds loses 3 percent of their value. They're worth $90 billion less because of inflation. So I would say the real deficit is not the $200 billion more of government bonds that the people hold but the $110 billion more they have after adjusting for inflation.<p>There's another important correction. When private business reports a profit or loss [on its income statement], it only includes in its account of costs the depreciation on past investment, which is virtually always less than the expenditures for a new investment. Now, if corporations included all of their current capital outlays instead of depreciation, which is what the federal government does, many, if not most, businesses would be reporting losses. So if you replace what the Office of Management and Budget has called investment-type spending with an estimate of depreciation on the existing capital, you'd knock off another $80 billion to $90 billion from the measure of the deficit.<p>
Q: Former senator Warren Rudman and other deficit hawks say your theories are fairy tales and that you forget we have to pay interest on the money we borrow. Fifteen cents of every dollar earned goes toward paying interest on the government debt. How do you respond?<p>A: That argument is completely fallacious on several counts. For one thing, the interest is not nearly as large as people make out, although that's not my main argument. It's about $200 billion a year at this point, and $200 billion is about 3 percent of GDP, so it's three cents on every dollar people earn, and that's no huge amount. The second thing wrong with that argument is the interest is not a burden on the American people. The interest is paid to the American people. In fact, I could argue that we'd be better off if the government were paying more interest. A lot of people who are receiving this interest are people living on their Treasury bills and bonds, either directly or through their pension funds or insurance policies or whatever. If you want to imagine that people pay taxes to pay the interest payments, okay. They're paying taxes and they're getting interest back, so it's a wash.<p>
Q: Some other economists argue that the real reason the public hates deficits is that voters simply don't trust the government. Aren't you sidestepping that issue by concentrating on recalculating all the numbers?<p>A: Well, there are a lot of things mixed in. We don't feel that we're getting our money's worth, that's true. To a considerable extent, it's a kind of selfishness, which is almost inevitable because too many of our taxes are not tied directly to what they deliver. Everybody wants to cut spending but not the spending for their district. It's the same with taxes. People want to see their taxes cut but not their benefits. I've long suggested we ought to earmark taxes and mean it. We have taxes for airport-construction funds, for example, but then we don't use the money for that purpose. There's also a certain amount of racism fueled by ignorance. I think there's a notion that the taxes being paid are helping the poor, and there's this notion that the poor are black, that they're loafers, that they're all on drugs and having illegitimate babies. That's what a lot of people have in mind when they say they want their taxes cut.<p>
Q: In other words, you are saying that a large measure of our problem is that the public assumes the government should run its finances like a family does, that it should watch its spending and avoid debt. <p>A: The remedy for recession, from the individual's point of view, is to pull in his horns. Paradoxically, if everybody does that, it simply makes matters worse. A business firm may feel it's a good idea to lay off employees and economize, and they're right. But if all the businesses lay off employees, they hurt each other. Those employees who've been laid off are no longer the customers of the other firms. What's true for the part is not necessarily true for the whole. That's the reason it's very important that the federal government be free to spend.<p><p><p>

						<p>In the last 20 years American women saved the economy; in the next 20 they could bring back the servant class.<p>By Walter Mead<p>Happiness, say the Japanese, is an American salary, an English house, Chinese food, and a Japanese wife. Unhappiness is English food, a Chinese salary, a Japanese house, and an American wife. The Japanese and other global sexists couldn't be more wrong. <p>In the long run the economic vitality of this nation's women is the single most important edge the U.S. has over its major industrial rivals in the race to build a 21st-century economy. Along the way, American women will create the most profound change in our society since the emancipation of the slaves. At least one part of that change, however, will seem ironic. The greater participation of women in the workforce on a more equal basis--a movement toward economic equality built on an end to discrimination based on gender--will wind up increasing the economic stratification of women. We will witness the rebirth of the servant class. <p>Real inflation-adjusted wages in the United States have been falling since 1973. That would have spelled disaster for countless families if women hadn't picked up the slack. Real family income has actually managed to rise during a period of falling wages, because more women have gone to work.<p>Women and the two-income family have also bailed out the U.S. economy. Falling family incomes would have meant disaster for the entire economy; if consumers can't buy, producers can't sell. The current economic recovery is based on an upsurge in consumer confidence and a climb in consumer spending, much of it financed with debt. The two-income family not only gives households more money to spend but more confidence about spending it. In an economy of continuing layoffs, most families have figured out that two incomes are more reliable than one. <p>Nothing indicates that women will play a smaller role in the U.S. economy in the future. In the closing years of the 20th century, 51 percent of the new entrants in the American labor force will be women. And this workforce will be better educated. In 1960, 5.8 percent of American women had completed four years or more of college education; in 1992, 18.6 percent had. By educating and employing its women, and by reducing sex-based discrimination in the workplace, the United States is in effect doubling the size of its pool of talented workers and entrepreneurs at a time when all of the industrialized world is worried about looming labor shortages created by a graying population.<p>Reaching this point has been a long, slow slog. In the 1830s and 1840s, less than 5 percent of free married women worked outside their homes--and 70 percent of those working women were employed as domestic servants. By 1870, only 13 percent of American women worked outside the home. (Of course, most women worked in the home or on the farm; the 19th century in the United States was not an age of female leisure.)<p>The 20th century saw a steady increase in the number of women working outside the home and an even greater expansion in the opportunities open to them. By 1970, 40 percent of American women worked outside the home; by 1991, census figures showed that 69 percent of working-age American women participated in the labor force--compared with 89 percent of working-age men. <p>The expansion in opportunities for women has been even more dramatic. In the 1950s, 2 percent of M.B.A. graduates were women; by 1989 that figure had jumped to 37 percent. As late as 1970 only 18.5 percent of all managers, executives, and administrators in the United States were women; in 1992, 42 percent of them were. <p>Not that the problems have all disappeared. Only about 5 percent of America's senior executives are women. And most women who work don't make very much money. The figure that we all know--that the median earnings of women are only 70 percent of men's --understates the way that women are disproportionately concentrated in industries that don't pay much to anyone. According to the Institute of Women's Policy Research, only 10 percent of working women make more than $12.67 an hour; 45 percent earn less than $6.33 an hour.<p>These are serious problems, but the long-term trend is clear. Large and increasing numbers of women are entering professions once closed to them. Each succeeding generation of women enjoys more opportunity and fairer treatment than their mothers. Even professional economists--trained to look for the dark side of almost every trend--can imagine a day when women will finally receive the equality they should have had all along. <p>Well, American women anyway. Women in Germany and Britain are perhaps a generation behind their American sisters in penetrating the upper levels of business and the professions. In southern Europe they lag even farther behind; in Japan, women face almost insuperable obstacles. The percentage of American women in administrative and managerial positions is almost twice as high as in Germany and almost five times higher than in Japan. <p>Many people think we have already seen most of the economic and social effects of the emergence of working women. Not so. Before this revolution is finished, our society will organize both work and family in very different ways from those we know today. <p>For example, in the past, work was often divided into higher-paid "men's jobs" and lower-paid work reserved for women. Women were secretaries, telephone operators, and receptionists. American education benefited from a large supply of intelligent professionals who had few alternatives to teaching as a career; the Catholic church, for example, was able to staff its parochial schools with women for whom that and nursing were the sole professional choices. <p>The quality of workers available in many of these low-paid but demanding fields has declined as educated women seek better-paid employment. What was once "women's work" has been redefined as "entry level." Young people just out of college now do photocopying and faxing--hoping to learn enough to help them move up the ladder. A hierarchy based on race and sex is yielding to one based more on age. <p>Look at another example. Before the 19th century, Europeans and Americans--like many people all over the world--tended to work and live in the same place. Master craftsmen lived above their workshops; merchants lived over their stores. Apprentices, helpers, and servants lived and sometimes ate with their boss. <p>This began to change with the industrial revolution. A separation took place. Work and the workplace belonged to the dark world of Darwinian struggle in the satanic mills. The home, where women were generally confined, became the abode of domesticity, of sweetness and light. Women--"hearth angels," some called them at the time--were carefully insulated from knowledge of the dark forces of the world of work. The sentimentalization of home life meant that women received respect in society--as mothers and wives--but were denied any real place in the world. <p>What we see today is the reversal of this process. As women move from the sphere of domesticity back into the world of work, workplaces are becoming more domestic and homes are becoming more involved in work. The working and living places of tomorrow will be more like what our ancestors knew than like the suburban segregation of the recent past. <p>As work places increasingly offer parental leave and elder- and child-care benefits, family concerns and sometimes family members are seen and heard more frequently at the office. Meanwhile, the office is also moving closer to home. The daily rituals of the American workplace--long commutes to offices and factories far removed from neighborhoods and the schools--only made sense as long as employees had no serious family responsibilities. The entrance of women into the mainstream of the workforce and the changing division of labor at home, with husbands taking on more domestic responsibilities, imply revolutionary changes in the American office. Companies will move to smaller buildings scattered in the suburbs and linked by faxes, modems, and, perhaps, video-conference facilities. Today, 7 million Americans work at home; experts predict 25 million telecommuters by 2000. <p>Other changes may be less benign. Because people tend to marry those of similar social and educational background, the continuing rise of women in the professions is likely to increase social stratification in the United States, as women with high incomes marry men with high incomes. Joint incomes of $200,000 per year or more will not be uncommon in those families. On the other hand, in families where both husband and wife are in unskilled, low-paid jobs, incomes will lag farther behind. Their income deficit will effectively double.<p>The wealthy double-income families will have the ability to hire the day-care workers, nannies, and housekeepers that they need to keep the domestic establishment humming while both partners pursue high-pressure careers. The dual-income economy will also provide a steady supply of low-paid women who must work to keep their families above water. My father's mother, like most of her generation, assumed that even middle-class people had servants. That time may be upon us again.<p>Although at least some of the changes wrought by this new economy will be a mixed blessing for some individuals, the news for the economy as a whole is solidly positive. Eat your heart out, Japan. The United States is going to keep surprising the rest of the world with its dynamism and creativity until other countries figure it out:  Women are half of the human race. To discriminate against your mothers, sisters, and daughters on behalf of your fathers, brothers, and sons is, as Antoine Boulay de la Meurthe once said of one of Napoleon's missteps, worse than a crime. It's a blunder.<p>Walter Mead is the senior policy advisor at the World Policy Institute at the New School. Research assistance: Jamie McClelland.<p><p>

						<p>Good inflation numbers aren't enough anymore<p>By Jim Jubak<p>The numbers gave wall street a choice--and the Street picked gloom. An investor couldn't ask for a clearer indicator of the psychology that is emerging in the stock and bond markets.<p>February 17 began with a bond-market rally leading the stock market upward. Consumer prices were unchanged in January, the Labor Department announced as the market opened. Analysts had been expecting this inflation indicator to come in at 0.3 percent. With inflation even weaker than predicted, interest rates on 30-year Treasury bonds fell to 6.39 percent, from 6.46 percent the previous day.<p>But that was only half of the day's news. By 11 a.m. the markets had reversed. A survey out of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported solid growth in manufacturing in the region (once thought to be good news) and an upturn in prices. Just over 30 percent of the purchasing managers in the businesses surveyed reported paying higher prices. That level is the highest since December 1990.<p>Forced to pick between good national inflation news and bad regional inflation news, the market headed down. The long bond sank in price and rose in yield to 6.54 percent. That marked the first time the bond has been above 6.5 percent since August 1993. Now that bonds have reached that interest-rate marker, traders are looking at a move toward 6.75 percent. Investors who look at the economy and don't see inflationary signs to justify the market's move should remember that mass psychology is extraordinarily good at fulfilling its own prophecies. <p><p><p>
