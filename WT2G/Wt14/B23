<h3>CHILD DAY CARE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</h3><br><p>

<b>1.  Introduction</b><br><p>

     One and a half billion children will be born in the decade of the 1990s, and an increasing
percentage will survive their first year of life.  However, given economic conditions worldwide,
these children will increasingly live in poverty and be raised in situations which threaten their
chances for optimal human growth and development.<br><p>

     Survival rates, as measured by infant mortality rates (IMR, deaths per 1000 births),
indicate that more and more children are surviving and living beyond the first year.  Because of
this, today there is an increasing focus on the quality of life for those children who survive. 
Feeling that the IMR does not adequately portray children's potential to thrive,  UNICEF
developed the Under 5 Mortality Rate (U5MR) to measure children's well-being.  The U5MR is
an indicator of the overall resources directed toward children.  It takes into account the nutritional
health and health knowledge of mothers, the level of immunization and use of Oral Rehydration
Therapy (ORT), the availability of maternal and child health services (including pre-natal care),
income and food availability within the household, the availability of clean water and sanitation,
and the overall safety of the child's environment. (UNICEF 1989, pg. 82)  In essence the U5MR
attempts to take into account the context within which the child lives.<br><p>

     A focus on the context is appropriate given that the latest research on the relationship
between health, nutrition and stimulation argues convincingly that an adequate food supply is
necessary but not sufficient to assure a child's optimal development.  This is also true for access to
micro-nutrients, education, and  absence of disease. Children's growth and development is
fostered when all these variables are present, within a caring environment. (Engle, 1992, Levinger,
1992, Myers, 1992, Zeitlin, 1993).    For some children this environment exists within the family. 
Increasingly, for large numbers of children a caring environment needs to be created within a child
care setting.  <br><p>

     For the purpose of this paper <i> child care is being defined as any care provided to the
child outside his/her home that involves non-familial caregivers.</i>  In this paper I will not
address the issue of whether or not child care is a good thing for children.  While that debate
continues to take place in several arenas, in many ways it is academic.  There are millions of
children worldwide who, for a variety of reasons, need to be cared for by other than their parents
and extended family members  for a good portion of the day.  The focus of this paper is on how to
promote children's optimal development in these alternative settings.<br><p>

     I will begin with a brief overview of children's needs from birth until the age of six, the
years when the quality of child care is critical.   Second, I will turn to a discussion of what
constitutes CARE for young children and what that means in relation to designing child care
settings.  Third we will focus on alternative models of child care -- what they look like, who is
involved in creating them and what that means in terms of programming and funding.  To help
illustrate the different ways child care programs have come into being, and who is involved in the
process, there will be a presentation of three case studies -- one from Colombia, one from
Malaysia and the third from India.  I will conclude with a brief description of the role of the health
sector in promoting quality child care and some remarks about the importance and value of
bringing lessons learned in developing countries to apply in the USA.<br><p>

<b>2.   A Child's Key Needs from Conception through the Early Years</b><br><p>

     Survival and healthy development cannot be achieved without significant attention to
young children, from their conception through age six. As physicians you know that the basis for
good physical health must be established during the early years.  This is also true for cognitive,
social and emotional health.  The dependence and rapid growth typical of infancy and early
childhood make young children particularly vulnerable to a variety of health, nutritional, psycho-
social and other environmental conditions.  Those living in poverty are particularly at risk of poor
physical and psycho-social development.  Thus, in terms of physical, intellectual, emotional and
social well-being, the period from conception to age six is an essential key to subsequent growth,
development and ultimate productivity. <br><p>

     Pre-natally through the sixth year there are several distinct stages. They include: intra-
uterine, intrapartum (the birth itself), postpartum (birth to one month), early infancy (the first six
months), late infancy (6-12 months), toddler (one to three years), and the pre-school child (3-6
years of age).  <br><p>

     Children have different needs, depending on where they are within these stages.  The
younger the child, the more difficult it is to disentangle the physiological and psychological factors
within the environment that govern health.  The youngest children are completely dependent on
adults.  As they become toddlers, environmental cleanliness, encouragement of eating, and
vigilance in terms of the child's safety are of utmost importance.  The pre-school child is more
self-reliant and in many cultures children at this age become caregivers themselves.  These
developmental differences become important in designing appropriate child care environments.  A
delineation of developmental differences is provided by Donohue-Colletta (1992) for three age
groups that are frequently included in child care programs.  She defines the needs as
follows:<br><p>
<pre>
     Infants (birth to 1) need:
           protection from physical danger
           adequate nutrition
           adequate health care
           adults with whom to form attachments
           adults who can understand and respond to their signals
           things to look at, touch, hear, smell, and taste
           opportunities to explore the world
           appropriate language stimulation

     Toddlers (1-3 years of age) need all the above and also require:
           support in acquiring new motor, language and  thinking skills
           a chance to develop some independence
           help in learning how to control their own behavior
           opportunities to begin to learn to care for themselves
           daily opportunities to play with a variety of objects

     Children ages 3-6 (and above), in addition to the above, also need:
           opportunities to develop fine motor skills
           encouragement of language through talking, reading, singing
           activities which will develop a positive sense of mastery
           opportunities to learn cooperation, helping, sharing
           experimentation with pre-writing and pre-reading skills  (pg. 65)
</pre><br><p>
     What is clear from this listing is that a variety of inputs are required to support children's
growth and development.  An important thing to note is that <b>all the inputs require someone
to interact with the child. </b> Very young children are not capable of obtaining what they need
on their own.,  But more important, children need to interact with caring adults in order to thrive. 
The importance of adult-child interaction is underscored by the latest research which addresses
specifically the relationship between health, nutrition and development, all of which are parts of
the care provided to children.<br><p>
 
<b>3.  Children's Requirements for Care</b><br><p>

     The quality of <b>Care</b> the young child receives determines his/her development. 
Engle (1992), defines care as <i>the provision in the household and community of time,
attention, and support to meet the physical, mental and social needs of the growing child.</i> 
<b>Care</b> includes much more than keeping the child safe and free from harm.  Caregiving
behaviors include: breastfeeding; providing emotional security and reducing the child's stress;
providing shelter, clothing, feeding, bathing, supervision of the child's toilet; preventing and
attending to illness; nurturing and showing affection, interaction and stimulation; playing and
socializing; protecting from exposure to pathogens; and providing a relatively safe environment
for exploration.  (Zeitlin, 1991, Myers, 1992)  A second set of caregiving behaviors includes the
use of resources outside the family, including curative and preventative health clinics, prenatal
care, the use of traditional healers, and members of the extended family network. (Engle, 1992)
All these behaviors are a part of supporting the development of young children.<br><p>
  
     The type of caregiving behavior required depends to a large extent on the child's
developmental age and the health and nutritional risks the child is facing.  For example, during the
first year of life the child is at the greatest risk of mortality.  During late infancy (or when
complementary foods are introduced) and during the toddler period the child is at greatest risk of
growth faltering.  <br><p>

     While growth faltering may be the result of inadequate nutrition, there is clear evidence to
suggest that it is also linked to the way young children are fed.  <b>Feeding is more than giving
children food; it includes the interactive process that accompanies the intake of food.</b> 
The interactive caregiving provided during the feeding process can have a profound effect on the
child's later development. <br><p>

     Studies comparing children who are well- and poorly-nourished suggest that there are
positive <b>Caring</b> practices associated with children with better nutritional status, even
though the children come from the same type of environment as their malnourished peers. (Zeitlin,
1993)   <br><p>

     In the context of feeding, <b>Caring</b> practices include frequent physical contact,
being consistently responsive to the child's needs and showing affection to the child. <b>
Care</b> also includes <i>active feeding</i> that means being aware of how much the child is
eating, offering the child a second helping, assisting the child in the use of a utensil instead of
expecting complete self-feeding, and offering praise for eating. (Engle, 1992)<br><p>

     The studies of feeding are but one example of current research that shows the powerful
effect of the interaction between the child and the environment on growth and development. 
Another example comes from longitudinal studies of children growing up in poverty.  In Hawaii,
Werner (1982) was able to identify children who were able to thrive even though the conditions
under which they were raised suggested they would be malnourished and not develop well.  She
termed those children that did well <i>resilient. </i> Those characterized as resilient evidence
greater autonomy and competence (pg. 158) and clearly did better developmentally and over time
than their non-resilient peers.  They did better because they were able to "elicit predominantly
positive responses from their environment."  These children were also found to be "stress-
resistant" compared to children who elicited negative responses from their
environment.<br><p>

     In her research, Werner sought to identify what makes some children more resilient.  She
concluded, as have others, that <b>the differences between children who thrive and those
who falter are determined by the type of interaction that occurs between the child and the
environment. </b> Critical in that environment are the people with whom the child interacts. 
The child's ability to thrive is greatly enhanced by the kind of care the child receives from those
around him/her.  Children who are nurtured, responded to positively, talked to and loved do much
better than children who are neglected or receive only cursory attention.<br><p>

     Given the importance of the people in the child's environment, it is critical that any model
of child care pay particular attention to the quality of interaction between the caregivers and the
children.  <br><p>
     
<b>4.  Models of Child Care</b><br><p>

     First and foremost, it must be emphasized that mono-dimensional programs (e.g. those
that provide only a nutrition supplement or focus only on immunization, or even provide only pre-
natal care for the mother without adequate follow-up once the child is born), are much less likely
to be successful than multi-dimensional programs. Mono-dimensional programs, which may meet
short term goals, are not likely to be sustainable over time.  It is rarely helpful to impose a single
solution that ignores the need for individuals and communities to control their own destinies.
<br><p>

     Multi-dimensional programs, on the other hand, are built on an awareness of the
importance of meeting the multiple needs of children and their families.  They are generally
created from a culturally-sensitive understanding of people's beliefs, perceptions, needs and
concerns, and the services they provide meet the intersecting needs of children and families.  An
example would be a program that provides children with a nutritional supplement in a child care
setting which also provides children with stimulation and emotional support.  Another component
of such a program would be work with parents to improve family nutrition.  Thus a given in all
the models being presented is that they take a multi-dimensional approach in providing services
for the child and family.<br><p>

     Given that a successful child care program needs to take into account the multiple needs
of children and of the families, the question is, what alternatives are available?   There are several
dimensions that help define alternatives.  These include: the reasons for creating the child care--
the <i>purpose;</i> who is responsible for establishing the child care--the <i>sponsor;</i> 
what the child care consists of--the <i>structure;</i> and how it is financed--the
<i>funding.</i><br><p>

<i>A.     Purpose</i><br><p>

     Child care programs are established for a number of reasons.  In some instances they are
set up explicitly to support women's increased participation in the work force. An example of this
are the child care centers created in Eastern European countries. Child care was provided for all
working women.  There was a clear expectation that women would take advantage of these
centers and return to work as soon as feasible after the birth of a child.  In general the child care
provided in these centers addressed a full range of children's needs, even though the motivation
for creating the child care was to get women into the labor force.<br><p>

     Another motive for creating child care is to provide a healthy and stimulating environment
for children who are at risk of delayed or debilitated development, regardless of whether or not
the mother is working outside the home.  An example of this comes from India where the
Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program provides support to pregnant and
lactating women.  It also provides health surveillance and a nutritional supplement for young
children 0-3,  and health, nutrition and education for children 3-6 years of age.  In this instance the
child care program was created primarily to support the healthy development of
children.<br><p>

     Whatever the motivation for the creation of a child care program, in order for it to be
successful it must take into account the needs of both the family and the child.  While this may
seem obvious, it has not always been the practice.  In the early 70s there were a number of mono-
dimensional nutrition programs that focused almost exclusively on one aspect of a child's need. 
While some of these programs produced short-term gains for the child, they were largely
unsuccessful in enhancing the quality of life for the child and did nothing to help parents create an
environment within which children could thrive.  A notable example comes from Chile where a
nutrition recuperation program was established that institutionalized malnourished infants until
they had gained appropriate weight for age. Many children successfully 'graduated out' of the
recuperation centers, allowing the program to achieve some important short-term political goals
focused on decreasing infant mortality during the first year of life. Once the children were
returned to their homes, however, the gains were not maintained.  The program had done little to
help change the environment within which children originally became malnourished.  Thus the
great majority of the children became malnourished once again, and many of them died.  (Evans,
1978)  Therefore, even when the primary focus may be the mother or the child, program planners
need to also consider how the program will affect on the other group.<br><p>

     The purpose of the program is related in large part to who sponsors the creation of the
child care program.<br><p>

<i>B.     Sponsors</i><br><p>

     There are several different kinds of organizations that can be responsible for sponsoring
child care.  These include government, non-governmental organizations, employers and private
individuals or groups.  Within each of these, there is yet another breakdown according to sector. 
For example, child care can be developed by the Ministry of Health, a Ministry of Social Welfare,
a Ministry of Labor, a Ministry of Women and Youth Affairs, or the Ministry of Education.  In
turn, the sector sponsoring the child care will play a strong role in determining the definition of
quality within the program, the curriculum to be implemented, expectations in terms of staff
qualifications and training, the types of materials available to the children, and the relationship
between the sponsors of the programs and the families they serve.<br><p>

     As a result of differences in sponsorship, a program provided by private business in
response to government policy, which mandates that business with a given number of women
employees must provide child care, might well look quite different from a child care program
developed by the Ministry of Health to address health and nutrition issues in an urban squatter
settlement.  While the former may be concerned only with providing custodial care and meeting
the 'letter of the law' with little regard to what happens for children on a day-to-day basis, the
latter would put considerably more emphasis on assuring the children were receiving adequate
nutrition through the program.  A private individual, on the other hand, might be more attuned to
the needs and expectations of parents than to the needs of the child.  The program she develops
would reflect her understanding of her potential market.  <br><p>

     Thus an understanding of who is sponsoring the child care is closely related to motivation. 
It is also important in determining the structure of the program. <br><p>

<i>C.     Structure:</i><br><p>

     Structure refers to such things as the physical location of the program, the age groups
being served,  the hours of operation, staffing and the flow of the day.  <br><p>

     Child care programs can either be located in centers--which may or may not be purpose-
built--and in homes.  Increasingly people are rejecting the high costs of constructing centers that
house large numbers of children.  They are turning to the creation of family day care homes within
a neighborhood or community.  While these cater to a fewer number of children in each setting,
there are more opportunities for cross-age groupings, fewer transportation problems, the
likelihood of a more 'familial' environment for the children, employment opportunities for the
women who operate the family day care, and much lower overhead costs.   Frequently family day
care also builds on traditional systems of informal care that already exist within a
community.<br><p>

     In terms of age groups, when center-care is created children are frequently segregated by
age, with the youngest children (birth through two years of age) being cared for in 'creches', and
the pre-school aged child (3-6 or school-entry age) provided for in a more educationally-oriented
'pre-school' or 'kindergarten'.<br><p>

     The hours that a program operates differ primarily according to the purpose of the
program.  If the child care has been created to support women's work, then the programs are
likely to be available on a full-day basis.  Within some Eastern European countries, for example in
Romania, there are full-week child care programs where parents drop the children off Monday
morning and collect them Friday evening.  If the program has been developed to provide children
with school-readiness skills, then it is more likely to be a half-day program that may or may not
adequately meet the needs of parents. <br><p>

     Staffing is of critical importance.  In general staff for child care programs are drawn from
the least well-educated strata within a community, primarily because of the low status and low
pay associated with being a child care provider.  It is assumed that any woman can be a child care
provider.  This is a faulty assumption.  Given the importance of the early years in terms of
children's later growth and development we should be giving priority to recruiting well-educated
and competent individuals to work with young children.  And they should receive appropriate pre-
and in-service training.  What happens is that women recruited to serve as child care providers
take on the task because they are not qualified to do anything else.  Then, if they receive training
they quickly seek out other opportunities to put that training to use in a higher paying job.  This
leads to very high turnover rates.  In a recently instituted family day care program in Bolivia the
turnover rate in the first two years was 35%.  This provides little continuity for the children in the
program.<br><p>

     The flow-of-the-day, commonly known as the daily schedule or daily routine, is generally
structured to meet the goals of the program and also to respond to children's developmental
needs.  Thus nutrition programs will have regularly scheduled snacks and meals and a
considerable amount of the caregiver's time will be devoted to preparing these meals and cleaning
up afterwards.  In many of these programs children spend a great deal of time waiting.  On the
other hand, in an educational program the caregiver devotes a greater proportion of her time to
creating an environment that supports educational goals, but the children's health may not be
monitored effectively.<br><p>
     
<i>D.     Funding: </i><br><p>

     The issue of funding is closely related to sponsorship.  Sponsors are frequently funders,
but not always.  Funders include government, international donor agencies (such as UNICEF,
USAID, World Bank),  foundations (the Bernard van Leer Foundation) non-governmental
agencies (international and national ones), employers, and private entrepreneurs.  An additional
group in this category is parents.<br><p> 

     Funding for child care programs shifts over time.  While many international donor
agencies are willing to provide funds to get a program started, they are unwilling to pay the costs
of the program over time.  For programs that are successful there is a shift from donor agency
funding to some mix of government, NGO and community funding when the program becomes
established. This is particularly true for those programs designed to serve the poorest
families.<br><p>

     Now that we have talked about the general dimensions of program models, I will shift to a
description of three very different kinds of programs, illustrating some child care possibilities
developed internationally.<br><p>

<b>5.  Case Studies</b><br><p>

 <b>Colombian Community Child Care and Nutrition Project.</b>  One of the largest
systems of family day care is currently operating in Colombia.  It is the Colombian Community
Child Care and Nutrition Project that began in 1990.  The program supports <i>Homes for well-
being,</i> a community-based, non-formal programme providing services for children from birth
to seven years of age.  The program relies heavily on community involvement.  People from the
community participate in an initial assessment of needs that helps determine the number of homes
required.  They also participate in selecting the women who will be the care providers.  Local
associations are responsible for managing the overall effort.<br><p>

     Community mothers, with assistance from volunteers on a rotating basis (mothers whose
children are in the home), provide care for up to 15 children in their home.  The community
mother receives training in child development, family and community relations, nutrition and
health.  Financial supports for the program include food to assure proper nutrition for the
children, and the mother is given a loan to upgrade her home to accommodate the children in the
program.  <br><p>

     The program is supported nationally by the <i>Instituto Colombiano de Bienstar
Familiar</i> (ICBF), working in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Health, the National
Apprentice Service, the Institute of Territorial Credit and other governmental and private
organizations.  The project was begun with World Bank and other donor monies.<br><p>

     The program has been evaluated. While children in the program had significant cognitive
and social gains, there were no significant nutritional benefits. (Myers 1993)   The nutrition
supplement provided to children accounts for half the costs of the program.   Yet despite this high
investment,  the program did not have a positive nutritional impact on the children.  As has been
found in other nutrition supplementation projects, the lack of improvement in nutritional status is
likely to be the result of parents believing that their children receive their full daily nutritional
requirements through the program and therefore they do not feed the child at home. In reality only
50-70% of the child's nutritional needs are provided by the program. Parents need to be educated
about the importance of continuing to feed the child at home.  Thus, while the effects on psycho-
social development are positive as a result of the program, these are moderated by low nutrition.
As a result of the findings of the evaluation the program is being redesigned.<br><p>

<b>Malaysian</b><i> Sang Kancil,</i><b> Community-based Services Project. </b> The
<i>Sang Kancil</i> Project was developed within the squatter settlements of Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia.  It was begun in 1978 by the health sector in an attempt to meet the health needs of
those living in urban squatter settlements.  The rationale for working in squatter communities was
based on the fact that they are a growing phenomenon in the developing world, constituting
nearly 50% of the total urban population.  It is widely recognized that the environment within
squatter settlements is threatening to people's health--physically, mentally and in terms of psycho-
social development. <br><p>

     In Malaysia there was difficulty in providing services for squatters because they occupy
the land illegally and thus are not entitled to city services (water, sewage, medical care, education,
etc.).  Nevertheless many squatter settlements are stable communities, including people from a
variety of income levels.  The stability comes from affordable housing within the settlement that
may not be available outside, well-developed support systems, and/or leadership positions within
the settlement.  <br><p>
     
     Developers of the <i>Sang Kancil</i> project, University faculty in collaboration with
Ministry of Health personnel, used a strategy that recognized, valued, and built upon the complex
social systems that exist in the settlements. While the health sector personnel who began the
project were interested in establishing primary health care centers within kampungs (districts) in
the settlements, they began their efforts by conducting meetings with community members to
determine their needs and priorities.  The community wanted a child care programme and income-
generating activities for women.  Health care was not seen as a priority.  Program planners
listened to the community.  Rather than building a health center, they established a pre-school and
an income-generating project.  When these were well established, then it was possible to
introduce primary health care, which is now widely accepted. <br><p>

<b>India,</b><i>  Mobile Creches</i>.   India is a country that has had legislation in support of
employer-sponsored child care since 1964.  For many years it was not enforced.  However, there
is continuing pressure for industries to comply.  Within the construction industry there was
particular concern about the welfare of the numerous women workers and their children. 
Construction sites are dangerous places for young children.  Women are not able to rely on
extended family members to care for their children. Further, with the frequent moves required as
buildings are completed and new ones begun, women and children are forced to relocate
frequently.  Thus a program of early childhood care and development was begun for these
workers and their families on site.  A variety of private voluntary organizations, working with the
construction industry, created the <i>Mobile Creches</i> system, which began in 1969.   The
child care programme is established where the women are working, and moves from site to site as
buiildings are completed and new ones begun.  <i>Mobile Creches</i> have also been
established to serve the children of street cleaners, rag pickers, and other families representing the
lowest social status groups in India.<br><p>

     There are three levels to the programme, all of which exist under one roof, based on the
age of the child.  The first is a creche for infants and young children (from 3-4 weeks to age
three).  Here the focus is on health and nutrition since most of the children are malnourished when
they enter the programme.  There is an emphasis on providing them with proper foods and
educating the parents about nutrition. <br><p>

     The second level is the nursery programme for 3-6 year old children. Within the nursery
programme the health and nutritional status of the child remains an important part of the
programme.  The children are monitored weekly by a physician, and growth charts are kept on the
children. In addition, however, there is an emphasis on cognitive and psycho-social development. 
One of the goals is to help prepare the children for the formal school system. <br><p>

     The third level is an elementary programme for children from 6-12 years of age.  The
elementary programme was developed for children who traditionally would have been taking care
of their younger siblings.  Because the siblings are now in a child care programme, the older
children could be going to school.  However, there is considerable prejudice against these children
who come from the poorest families.  Because their home environments have not prepared them
for school, they do poorly.  Teachers do not want them in their classrooms.  The<i> Mobile
Creches </i> elementary programme was developed to prepare these children to enter school and
be placed within an age equivalent grade.  <br><p>

     Staff within the <i>Mobile Creches</i> system is drawn from the lower middle class. 
(Because of the longevity of the effort, there are now women teaching in<i> Mobile Creches</i>
who were once children in the <i>Creches</i>.)  Very soon after the programme began it
became evident that traditional teacher training institutes did not prepare people adequately for
work in the programme because of the unique needs of the families and children served by
<i>Mobile Creches.</i>  Thus, over time,<i> Mobile Creches</i> developed their own staff
training programme.  The training they have developed is also offered to NGOs and government
child care programs serving young children on other settings.  As the program has evolved,
classes in adult education have been added. There are literacy programs, nutrition classes, and
political discussion groups. Thus what began as a child care program has evolved into a much
larger development effort.<br><p>

<b>6.     The Health Sector and Child Care</b><br><p>

     Why should the health sector be concerned about child care?  There are  two basic
reasons.  The first is that the health sector has a significant role to play in quality assurance.  The
second is that child care can be used as a vehicle for meeting  maternal and child health goals.
<br><p>

     <i>The health sector has a role to play in the assurance of quality programs.</i> 
Programs for young children are expanding rapidly throughout the world. To be of quality, they
require a health input.  This is recognized in most countries and stringent health standards have
been developed.  In most of cases the 'ideal' is established as the 'bottom line'.  And while it would
be wonderful if developing countries could  meet these standards, in reality they cannot. What this
means is that the great majority of child care centers are never accredited.  Because they do not
meet government standards, they are not eligible to receive government support.  This means that
they continue to operate at a substandard level, never gaining access to the resources that would
help them improve the quality of their services.<br><p>

     To be supportive of child care,  the health sector needs to adopt a more flexible approach
in the development of health standards. Health standards should be based on the realities of the
context within which child care is going to be provided. In South Africa, for example, an attempt
is being made to set health standards in line with the resources of the community. Standards for
child care are being established in a step or stage process.  People from the Ministry of Health
meet with community members and together they decide what the minimal standards should be. 
When the community has met those standards, the government provides some funds to support
the child care system.  Upon receipt of those funds the community is able to upgrade its services,
thus meeting the standards at a higher level, giving them higher accreditation and access to
additional resources.  Communities with greater resources to begin with are expected to meet
higher standards.   This step system allows communities to gain access to necessary resources to
continue to upgrade their program.<br><p>

     <i>Child care programs can serve as an entry point to communities not currently
receiving health services.</i>  In some areas of the world Western medical practices and services
are not easily accepted.  Services may be underutilized because people lack an understanding of
the benefits.  Because they are socially attractive and acceptable, child care programs can serve as
an entry point into the community.  Once the child care program is firmly established, it is then
possible to introduce other development efforts, some of which promote health.  Thus initially the
health sector might begin working in the community by supporting projects that are not
necessarily health-focused.  Overtime, however, the project could add health components for the
families and broader community.   The Sang Kancil project in Malaysia is a good example of this
approach.<br><p>

     <i>A cost-effective way of delivering health care is to become collaborators in the
provision of child care.</i>  Child care programs present an excellent opportunity for the
delivery of  health care and health monitoring that would otherwise be provided through maternal
and child health (MCH) services.  The introduction of such activities can constitute a considerable
extension of existing health care services and provide the possibility for the development of
community-based primary health care that includes not only children but mothers and families as
well.<br><p>

     By working through child care programs, health professionals can assess the role that
community members can play in health promotion.  By working with and training child care
providers it would be possible to assess the extent to which people from the community, with
basic training in screening, disease management and nutrition, can complement the health and
welfare sectors and provide a meaningful extension to primary health care programs.<br><p>

     What needs to happen within the health sector for it to work more effectively with child
care programs? <br><p>

     <i>Health care professionals need to incorporate a broader definition of health into the
way they view and work with people. </i> A broad definition of health and child development can
make health workers at all levels more effective in their work with young children and their
families.  The more that health personnel at the local level can be involved in prevention and the
promotion of health, the more likely that child care providers will be responsive to what the health
sector has to offer.  All too often health professionals come in and tell others what to do without
being sensitive to either the realities of the environment or the traditions of the people.  If people
feel their way of life is valued, then they are more open to making changes.  Further, the
involvement of  local families in the planning, provision of and evaluation of child care programs,
including health, education and development activities, strengthens local understanding of the
health needs of children and improves the manner in which child care is organized and
used.<br><p>

     <i>Health professionals need to expand their own understanding of and promote all
aspects of child development. </i> Many training courses for doctors and other health
professionals focus almost exclusively on physical growth and development.  Few provide an
understanding of the processes involved in children's cognitive, social and emotional development. 
A broader understanding of all aspects of children's development would allow health professionals
to provide a much broader view of the child in their work with parents.<br><p>

     <i>Health professionals need to take a more pro-active role in the development of
appropriate health training for child care providers. </i>There is a set of basic health messages
and practices that can be carried out by people with relatively low levels of training.  Supervision
and support, however, from the formal health sector are imperative, as is support from the
educational sector and from social welfare.  This support could be in the form of training
programs, training guides, operational manuals, many of which are available through UNICEF,
WHO and other public and private organizations.  Support can also be provided through regular
contact between child care programs and workers in these specialized areas.<br><p>


<b>7.     Bringing the Lessons Home</b><br><p>

     Attention is increasingly being paid to a movement known as Lessons without Borders. 
This movement is based on a realization that the problems faced in the Majority World are similar
to those being faced by populations within the USA.  There is also a recognition that the lessons
learned from the successful programs in developing countries might well be applicable in the
USA.  Currently groups like Save the Children, which has both an international and a national
office, are seeing the parallels between what they have supported elsewhere and what can be
applied here.  They are in the process of bringing the lessons home, as are others. <br><p>

     While communication systems make the sharing of experiences across borders a
possibility, the key to making them work is an openness of mind and spirit.  Our own professional
training provides us with an artificial division of the child.  We are trained as physicians,
psychologists, educators, and social workers to view the child from the perspective of a given
discipline.  This has created suspicions, jealousies, and a lack of understanding that have gotten in
the way of us working together to promote the healthy development of all children. When we are
able to break these barriers, it will be to the benefit of all.  Margaret Alva expressed it well when
she said, <br><p>
     <pre>
     ...a child is born without barriers.  Its needs are integrated and it is
     we who choose to compartmentalize them into health, nutrition,
     hunger or education.  Yet the child itself  cannot isolate its hunger 
     for food from its hunger for affection or its hunger for knowledge. 
     The same unity extends to the child's perception of the world.  The child's
     mind is free of class, religion, colour or nationality barriers, unless we 
     wish it otherwise.  It  is this intrinsic strength in the unity of the child 
     that we need to exploit, for building a better world.

<p>
<p>
<p>
     In most parts of the developing world children under the age of 15 and
women of reproductive age constitute more than 50% of the population.  The
rapid growth and early acquisition of motor and cognitive skills typical of
infancy and early childhood and the unique biosocial characteristics of
reproduction, make children and women vulnerable to a variety of health,
nutritional, psycho- social and other environmental conditions.  Those living
in poverty are particularly at risk of poor physical and psycho- social
development.<p>
<p>
          Poverty and its correlates form the complex of factors 
      most commonly identified as threatening children's well-
      being. Such correlates include lack of adequate 
      nutrition; lack of health, educational, and other social 
      services; poor sanitary conditions and lack of environ-      mental
hygiene; overcrowding within the home and/or       community; lack of adequate
attention from caretakers;       intra-familial stress due to lack of resources
and the
          effects of the physical environment.<BR>
                                               Halpern, 1982, p.20<p>
<p>
     In recognition of these threats to all people's well-being, the World
Health Organization has made a commitment to bring health care to all parts of
the world by the year 2000. There are two levels at which this must take
place--at the level of basic <u>survival</u>, and in order to promote long-term
<u>development</u>.  At the survival level WHO has developed "high profile"
programmes aimed at capturing people's attention, interest, and commitment. At
the development level WHO has been promoting primary health care, described
as:<p>
<p>
          essential health care made universally accessible to
          individuals and families in the community by means 
          acceptable to them, through their full participation
          and at a cost that the community and country can afford.
          It forms an integral part of the country's health system
          of which it is the nucleus, and of the overall social
          and economic development of the community.<BR>
                                             WHO/MCH, 1981, p.8<p>
<p>
     Because of the immediacy and graphic nature of survival, it is possible to
mobilize national and international support for programmes which promote
survival. Development, on the other hand, requires a long-term commitment to
meeting the multiple needs of a population through multi-sectoral programmes
which promote well- being, particularly among those most at risk.  As noted:<p>
<p>
<p>
          The most effective approach to achieving a satisfactory
          status of health is multi-sectoral, preventive and
          requiring the coordinated efforts of all the sectors 
          that can contribute directly and indirectly to the
          promotion of well-being, and this approach should
          include day care.<BR>
                                            WHO/MCH, 1981, p.8<p>
<p>
<p>
     WHO has recognized that day care and pre-school, more broadly referred to
as early childhood care and education (ECCE), programmes have the potential to
reach many of the world's children and their families.  The question is how to
use ECCE systems to achieve primary health care goals.  A strategy is suggested
in this paper, a strategy which focuses on systematically examining early
childhood care and education programmes, and assessing their potential for
delivering primary and maternal and child health care components. Further, an
argument is made for the increased involvement of the World Health Organization
in the development of integrated services for young children and their families
through early childhood care and education programmes. <p>
<p>
     The Introduction, Section I, provides information on the needs of young
children and their families, and presents an argument in support of an
integrated service delivery approach. Section II contains a description of some
of the factors which would facilitate the integration of PHC/MCHcomponents into
ECCE programmes, and some of the constraints to such an effort. Before
developing a strategy, however, it should be recognized thatthere are a variety
of ways in which PHC/MCH services are already a part of ECCE efforts. The
continuum of current linkages is described in Section III. To date, the
approach has not been systematic.  There is a need to make the integration more
explicit and to develop a range of interventions to further promote the
maternal and child health components of primary health care in ECCE settings.
To start the process, a typology of ECCE programmes is needed. In Section IV
there is an overview of three typologies, or ways of categorizing, early
childhood care and education programmes, that provide a framework for
decision-making in relation to the introduction of appropriate health care
methodologies and materials into the range of ECCE programmes that exist.
Within Section V a variety of ECCE programmes are described in detail which
demonstrate the interaction of the variables within the three typologies. In
the concluding section, Section VI, an attempt is made to define the primary
health care components that could be introduced into the systems of early
childhood care and education suggested by the typologies.  Using the
hypothesized possibilities, it is then possible to develop strategies for WHO's
involvement in promoting the maternal and child health care components of
primary health care within ECCE systems. This paper is designed to serve as a
point of departure for an ongoing discussion.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<b>A. The Need</b><p>
<p>
     Young children, from birth to six years of age, are developing rapidly--
biologically, cognitively, and psycho-socially.  Basic physical, mental, and
social structures are being set into place during the early years.  There are a
variety of environmental conditions that promote the healthy development of
these structures.  They include:<p>
<UL>
<LI> adequate provision for health, safety, nutrition and shelter;<BR>
<LI> consistent caregivers;<BR>
<LI> adult and peer models of appropriate cognitive and social behavior, and
     opportunities to interact with these models;<BR>
<LI>appropriately communicated and consistent expectations and limits;<BR>
<LI> a recognition of and allowance for children's individual interests and
    developmental pattern;<BR>
<LI>a physical and social envrionment that encourages active exploration
       and provides opportunities for learning;<BR>
 <LI> feedback, both positive and negative, that provides the child with a
  positive sense of self and a trust of others.<BR>
</UL>
<p>
<p>
     The quality of the environment in which millions of children are growing
up in developing countries is inadequate by any number of criteria.
Overcrowding, lack of potable water and sewage facilities, lack of adequate
food, and inadequate caretaking characterize the environments of many young
children.  Frequent infection (most commonly diarrhea), and malnutriton account
for over 50% of all infant mortality in developing countries. To be able to
effectively manage incidents of diarrhea would be to significantly decrease
infant mortality.  As noted in the World Banks <u>World Development Report
1984</u>,<p>
<p>
<p>
          Mortality from diarrhea in the developing world is two
          to three times higher than it was in today's developed
          countries when overall mortality levels were similar.
          Diarrhea is a disease of the poor, primarily of poor

children.  It accompanies malnutrition and is exacerbated
          by poor sanitation, lack of elementary health services,
          and lack of the basic education that might allow parents
          to take the necessary precautions to prevent it.<BR>
                               World Development Report, 1984, p.73<p>
<p>
      While food availability is one of the critical factors in any situation
where malnutrition is endemic, sanitation and food preparation are also
important variables. Where improvements in the quantity of food available to
mothers for use in feeding infants and young children may not be feasible, much
can be done to improve the well being of infants and young children by assuring
that available food is appropriately prepared, provided and preserved. <p>
<p>
     It is becoming increasingly apparent that improper nutrition, poordisease
management and inadequate affective stimulation and care of the child are all
conditions which interact to influence patterns of morbidity and mortality.
Severe malnutrition, disease, and infection suffered during early years have a
permanent effect on later development, not only because of the consequences to
the child's physical well being, but because these variables interact with and
have an impact on the child's social environment.  The behavioral effects of
malnutrition, disease and infection in young children include such things as
apathy, reduced responsiveness to people and the environment, and the inability
to attend to tasks. As a result, the child is less "engaging"; caretakers find
the child less appealing and fail to provide the child with the stimulation
that is needed to promote development. A vicious cycle is created, which
results in poor developmental outcomes. To have an impact on the child's growth
and development an integrated system of care must be provided-- one which
addresses the physical, cognitive and psycho-social needs of the child and
family.<p>
<p>
     The goal of health and social programmes is to bring basic services to all
people. To do this a range of strategies is needed. The creation of primary
and/or maternal and child health care centres constitutes one strategy. Yet, in
many developing countries these may not as yet reach the high risk groups;
families living in rural and urban slum settlements have typically been
underserved.  There are several reasons for this:<p>
<p>
      1. The resources available to health and social planners concerned with
      long-range development issues have traditionally been scarce and have
    not permitted the extension of services to hard to reach groups. <p>
<p>
      2. This has been exacerbated by the tendency to try and establish health
       care services based on Western models without any differentiation of
    varying needs among social groups. <p>
<p>
      3. The fact that preventive health care is not often seen as a priority
      by traditional and low-education groups has, in turn, served to limit
    their service-seeking bahaviour.  Where maternal and child health
services are available they are often seen as sources of therapeutic
or remedial rather than preventive care.  <p>
<p>
      4. Moreover, planning by the health and social sectors, has typically
    failed to incorporate many of the perceived needs and expectations of
  the communities for whom the planning has been undertaken.  As a <p>
         result, the services that are available have neither attracted the
    attention, nor inspired the confidence, that would have ensured their
  appropriate utilization.<p>
<p>
     Therefore, the challenge is to find alternative ways of delivering primary
health care services, particularly to low-income families in both urban and
rural settings. One possible alternative is to integrate primary health care
into systems of early childhood care and education.  As an introduction to this
alternative, we will briefly examine some of the socio-demographic trends which
lend support to the idea that ECCE systems might provide an avenue to reaching
those most in need.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>B. Socio-demographic trends</b><p>
<p>
     Throughout much of the Third World the pattern of family structure, female
employment, and residential mobility has been changing rapidly over the last
decade.  As a result of migration and industrial employment patterns, the
extended family system of traditional societies is being replaced by a nuclear
family system which often fails, by virtue of its limited number of adults, to
provide the care and support required by children.  In addition, in both urban
and rural environments, there is an increase in the number of women headed
households.      <p>
<p>
     New economic pressures on, and possibilities presented to, women in urban
areas means they increasingly work outside the home, often for long hours and
following finite schedules that limit their availability and the time they can
devote to child care.  In addition, siblings, who have traditionally been
responsible for the care of younger children, are attending school at an
increased rate, and grandmothers are themselves a part of the labor force.  In
rural areas women often work in the fields.  While in many cultures women have
historically consistuted a majority of the agricultural work force, in other
settings the out-migration of men, seeking employment in other locations, has
increased women's agricultural role.  In addition, in some agricultural
settings plantation economies and cash crop production have meant that there
too women are increasingly being exposed to demands of rigid time and work
schedules similar to those common in urban environments. While the literature
would suggest that women's work outside the home produces direct benefits for
children, there are also costs (Engle, 1980). <p>
<p>
     Women's changing role and entry into economically productive roles makes
new demands on women's time.  Yet, care of children, particularly young
children, is still the woman's responsibility. Her responsibility for the
well-being of the child starts with conception.  During pregnancy the woman's
diet and health are important in determining fetal outcome.  It is estimated
that a nutritional anaemia afflicts close to half of all women of childbearing
age in developing countries, and more than 70% of pregnant women suffer from
malnutrition (Sivard, 1985). These data suggest that more than half of the
children in developing countries enter the world under less than optimal
conditions.<p>
<p>
     After birth, the mother is responsible for the safety, care and feeding of
the child, and, to varying degrees, for providing stimulation for the child's
cognitive and psyco-social development. New demands on women's time and energy
make it increasingly difficult for women to provide the kind of <p>
care their children need. With the loss of the extended family as a support
system in caring for young children, there has been a rapidly increasing demand
for child care outside the home by individuals other than family members.<p>
<p>
     The response to the demand has varied;  it has reflected the socio-
economic conditions of those in need of day care, the countries in which they
live, the resources available to the health, public welfare, and education
sectors, and the involvement of private voluntary organizations. The response
has also been pervasive in the sense that peoples in all parts of the world
have developed systems of care for young children. For this, and a number of
other reasons to be described later,  it would appear that these systems of
child care could be utilized for the delivery of primary and maternal and child
health care services. This paper describes the range of programmes that exist
and suggests ways in which primary health care can become an integral part of
what is provided through these programmes. Before beginning the discussion,
however, it is necessary to define what is meant by the term "early childhood
care and education".<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>C. Definition</b><p>
<p>
     In the literature there are a range of terms that refer to care of young
children (from birth until the age at which the child enters the formal school
system--generally between the ages of 5 and 7), outside the home.  For example,
the word, "Creche", generally refers to services for children under the age of
2. "Child Minding" generally refers to care in the home by neighborhood women,
serving children from birth through the early primary years. "Daycare"
generally describes full-time care provided for children of women working
outside the home. And, there are "pre- school" programmes that are designed to
prepare young children for entry into the formal primary school system. Rather
than using any one of these terms to include the others, the term <u>Early
Childhood Care and Education, (ECCE)</u> has been chosen as the rubric under
which all the variations are to be considered.<p>
<p>
     Thus, for the purposes of this paper, early childhood care and education
will include all those situations where: (1) the care of the child is
tranferred from the parent to a caregiver who is outside the family system; (b)
this transfer is formalised in the sense that there is a recognized economic
value to the care being provided (whether or not the parent is actually
involved in direct payment); and (c) there is a definite pattern to the care
being provided over time.  This definition excludes situations where members of
the extended family take on care-giving responsibilities.  It also excludes
situations where occassional care is needed or given (e.g. babysitting) on an
irregular basis.  <p>

<b>II. FACTORS AFFECTING THE USE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND
EDUCATION</b><p>
<b>PROGRAMMES FOR THE DELIVERY OF MCH COMPONENTS OF PHC</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
                             No sector involved in socio-economic development
<p>
                             can function properly in isolation. Activities in
one impinge on the goals of another...Primary health care, too, requires the
support of other sectors; these sectors can also serve as entry points for the
development and implementation of primary health care.<p>
<p>
                                                   WHO/UNICEF, 1978, p.16<p>
<p>
<b>A. The potential and the complexity</b><p>
<p>
     One sector that is an obvious point of entry for primary health care is
the early childhood care and education sector.  When one begins to examine that
statement, however, a problem is immediately apparent: ECCE is not a sector.
Those programmes that can be classified in one way or another as an ECCE effort
are found within more than one sector.  ECCE programming touches and relies on
a multiplicity of sectors. While this opens up possibilities, it also presents
problems since it is difficult to identify a single entry point for the
development of collaborative programming.<p>
<p>
     The difficulty of working within a variety of sectors is only one of the
dimensions to be considered in developing an intervention strategy. In order to
determine the reality of introducing primary and maternal and child health care
into existing ECCE systems, more information is needed about the supports for
integrating the systems, and the constraints to such a process. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>B. Positive/Supportive factors</b><p>
<p>
     There are a variety of characteristics of early childhood education
programmes which would suggest and provide support for their usage for the
delivery of the MCH components of PHC.<p>
<p>
          1. <u>Early childhood care and education programmes exist in some
form in all parts of the world</u>.   They have been begun under the trees in
rural Africa, and organized in the steets of Chile. They have also been
developed through national initiatives devoted to promoting the healthy growth
and development of all children, as in Mauritius and parts of southeast Asia.
While in many instances an infrastructure exists to support these programmes,
they are frequently underutilized in terms of the range of services that could
be provided. In general, those programmes not sponsored by <p>
the health sector have not taken up the health care and health monitoring needs
of children and mothers.  Even fewer have responded to the opportunities
presented for complementing, and building on, existing primary health care
activities, and for creating opportunities for cognitive and psycho-social
stimulation. For example, many feeding programmes focus all their energy on
providing nutritional supplementation to young children; they are unaware of
the necessity for psycho-social stimulation, and the potential that their
programme offers to provide such stimulation.<p>
<p>
          2.  While ECCE programmes generally reach only a small percentage of
the eligible population, <u>they have the potential to reach a large percentage
of the population</u>.  In many developing countries approximately 40% of the
population is under the age of 15. More than a third of these are under the age
of 5 (World Bank, 1984, p.67).  By taking into account young children's
families, ECCE programmes can touch the lives of more than half the population.
         <p>
<p>
          3. <u>ECCE services are expanding rapidly</u> due to increasing
demand. The demand has come from urban and rural communities, from those
wanting better health care, from those concerned with supporting the child's
cognitive development, from those seeking a safe place for their child. The
demand is illustrated by the increase in the numbers of ECCE centers available
over the years.  For example, in Kenya in 1968, ECCE programmes served 175,000
children; by 1980 that number had increased to 300,000.  The increase is much
more dramatic in Tanzania. In 1969 there were only 280 centers.  By 1980 there
were 3,500.  Even so, the programmes which exist serve only 6% of the eligible
population. (Otaala, 1981, p.49) There is still a lot of room for growth, and
there is a demand that will lead to the development of an increased number of
ECCE programmes.<p>
<p>
          4. <u>Early childhood care and education programmes have a social
attractiveness and acceptability that invites participation from families that
might not avail themselves of primary health care services</u>.  For peoples in
many parts of the world, early childhood care and education programmes are a
priority. Given a choice, a community may well begin by creating an ECCE
programme. An example comes from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia where the health sector
was interested in establishing health care services. But, the community was
interested in early childhood care and income generating activities.  Once
these were esablished, then the community was open to the development of health
care services. Thus, support for and the utilization of early childhood care
and education programmes, in many settings, may be more regular than is often
the case with health care and family planning services.<p>
<p>
          5. <u>Primary health care is a logical extension of the current
services</u> being provided within early childhood care and education
programmes--be they only custodial care or educational. For example, a
non-formal education programme for pre-school aged children in Puno, Peru, has
been used as the base for the implementation of a number of health programmes.
It provided a setting for a regional immunization programme, touching the lives
of families in the community as well as the children served in the programme.
Health care is a part of the child's total development, and as such should be
seen and provided within the context of children's services.<p>
<p>
          6. <u>Early childhood care and education programmes are a way of
promoting family and community as well as child development</u>, thus meeting
<p>
primary health care goals for the population in addition to meeting the needs
of the young child.  As noted in an evaluation of a parent education program in
Indonesia,<p>
<p>
          Clearly the programme, while concentrating on mental<p>
          stimulation of children, touches many other areas of<p>
          concern of women--health, nutrition, family planning,<p>
          participation in community affairs.  As confidence and<p>
          competence grow, women contribute not only to their own<p>
          development, but to community and national development.<p>
          A child development program becomes increasingly <p>
          connected to over-all development objectives. <p>
                                                Stein, 1985, p.10<p>
<p>
          7.<u>Early childhood care and education programmes are gaining
national and international support</u>. In a number of instances in Latin
America and South East Asia, national legislation exists which supports the
development of ECCE programmes. Frequently such enabling legislation is
connected with Labour Law which requires businesses with more than a given
number of women employees to provide day care.  Legislation supportive of ECCE
programming may also be promoted by the education sector.  In Southeast Asia
the result of government support for the development of educationally focused
pre-school programmes has lead to the lowering of the school entrance age; it
is now 5 years of age in Burma and Sri Lanka, and Thailand is aiming to achieve
the same goal (UNESCO, <p>
1983, p.7).<p>
         8. <u>Many of the health and nutritional problems associated with
conditions of poverty, if identified early, can be managed using appropriate
and simple technologies</u>.  Technology in this instance is meant to include
"not only scientifically sound equipment and information but also certain
organizational elements." (Rohde and Hendrata, 1982, p.212). These technologies
are currently available and can be managed by persons with relatively low
levels of training, and delivered through other than health care centres.
There is every reason to believe that the health and nutrition technologies are
suited to most early childhood care and education programmes which are in
place, or could be developed with a minimum of cost and back-up support. An
example of such technologies are the activities and strategies for health
promotion described in <u>Where There is No Doctor</u>. (Werner, 1977).<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>C. Constraints</b><p>
<p>
          l. The <u>multiplicity of mandates</u> which have lead to the
development of ECCE programmes make it difficult to identify an entry point for
primary health care.  Early childhood care and education, because it is closely
intertwined with childrearing, is a phenomenon in which almost everyone feels
he or she should have a say--from those in health to education to public
welfare to community development, to labour. What this means is that there is
no one group that can be approached to work with to better integrate health
care into ECCE service delivery. By looking at Thailand, for example, it is
possible to illustrate the issue. It is estimated that only 2% of the 0-6 age
group are being served through some type of ECCE effort (UNESCO, 1983, p.4).
Yet, even with so few children being served, programmes have been developed by
the following sectors: child nutrition centres are run by the Department of
Health; child development centres are  operated by the Department of Community
<p>
Development; kindergarten, or "head start" centres are run by the Department of
Education; day-care centres are operated by metropolitan city municipalities;
and private enterprise facilities provide services to yet another group of
children.<p>
<p>
     To make things even more difficult, those that are operating programmes
may not be aware of other groups in the community who are operating ECCE
programmes. Those in the private sector frequently do not coordinate their
efforts with those in health, education, or social welfare. And, since the
public sectors have different goals for offering services to young children,
parallel programmes may be developed. In some instances this leads to more
spaces being available within ECCE programmes than there are children in the
community, while in other communities there are no services. An example of this
comes from Iraq where, within two blocks of each other, there are day care
centres run by the General Federation of Iraqi Women and the Ministry of Labor
and Social Affairs.  Both centres operate at less than half of their capacity,
thus greatly increasing per pupil costs. (Evans, 1984).<p>
<p>
          2. The multiple needs of children, requires a <u>multi-sectoral
approach to the integration of the MCH components of PHC and ECCE
programming</u>. Such an approach is consuming of both time and energy, and can
only be developed with the cooperation of all sectors involved.  A successful
approach to multi-sectoral programming appears to be to begin by providing a
core service.  Once that becomes well established, it is then possible to add
additional services.  An example comes from Indonesia where a parent education
programme--which includes weekly meetings, a toy lending library and extensive
follow-up with families--was added to an already successful family planning and
nutrition programme. (Stein, 1985). The existence of the infrastructure
developed in the existing programme allowed the parent education programme to
succeed.<p>
<p>
          3. A primary constraint on using ECCE efforts to implement primary
health care components is that <u>many projects are developed on a pilot basis,
but they neither continue beyond the programme development phase, nor are they
disseminated to other communities</u>. Even though a project shows promise, it
may not have staying power and thus it may not be appropriate to expend limited
resources to integrate PHC/MCH components into the project. Reasons for the
failure of projects have been delineated by authors such as Pyle (1984). The
reasons fall within four categories: resource constraints, lack of political
commitment at various levels; weak demand for services; and organizational,
implementation and management problems (Myers, 1984, p.4).  There are also
issues related to how to take a successful pilot project and disseminate it to
a wider audience.  Many organizational characteristics of community-based
projects necessarily change if the project is to be implemented nationally
(Pyle, 1984).  Thus, before investing in projects it is necessary to ask the
question of whether or not they could successfully undergo these organizational
changes if implemented on a large scale. <p>
<p>
        4. Because of the scarcity of resources, low cost alternative
approaches are being sought for the delivery of health care. <u>Early childhood
care and education programmes are low-cost services</u>. The programmes
arefrequently developed by the community and rely on trained volunteer or
paraprofessional staffing for day-to-day programme operation. What this means
is that those who work in these programmes generally have low levels of <p>
education, and once they receive training they are able to find higher paid
employment in related fields.  This has three implications.  First, programmes
are constantly in the position of training new staff; it is difficult to build
on experience and develop a cadre that can provide role models, peer support
and supervision. Second, health care planners need to be realistic about what
health care components can be introduced in ECCE programmes. Paraprofessional
staff may not have the capacity to develop the skills necessary to deliver
sophisticated health care services, although, as will be described later,
health care technology makes it possible for people with low levels of
education to deliver a wide variety of services. Third, training materials and
methodologies have to be geared to a very practical level, with on-going
support and supervision built into the training system. <p>
<p>
    <p>
<b>D. Overall Perspective.</b><p>
<p>
     In developing a strategy for delivering primary health care to all, the
health care community has been aware of the limits on its resources in relation
to what is required to accomplish the task of providing health to all by the
Year 2000. From the beginning it has been clear that a range of alternative
delivery systems need to be developed. The range of early childhood care and
education programmes that exist offer tremendous potential for delivery of
primary and matenal and child health care into communities.  Where ECCE
programmes are centralized and receive public support, there is a national
system that can be utilized for the introduction of the MCH components of PHC.
Of more interest to the health sector, however, are those ECCE programmes that
serve those most in need of services--the urban and rural poor--that are
unlikely to avail themselves of health services that exist or who live in areas
where health services are scarce.  In some of these areas early childhood care
and eduation programmes have been begun, many through local initiative; others
through the efforts of private voluntary organizations who have implemented an
ECCE programme in response to a community-defined need.  <p>
<p>
     Those involved in planning health care programmes have looked to community
involvement as a way of promoting health care delivery. <p>
<p>
          At the beginning of the past decade, as a consequence<br>
          of the requirements of the extension of health services<br>
          coverage, Member States...concentrated their efforts<br>
          on the organization and training of community resources<br>
          for the promotion of health activities and the delivery<br>
          of some specific services.  The experience has shown <br>
          that these constitute a valuable instrument for the<br>
          extension of health services with primary health care,<br>
          in spite of the fact that their functions, their <br>
          relationship with the institutional system, and the <br>
          training methods show a great variation from country<br>
          to country. PAHO, 1980, p. 76.<p>
<p>
<p>
     Linkage of the MCH components of PHC with early childhood care and
education programmes is seen as an opportunity to further assess the role that
communities can play in delivering quality health and development services to
young children and their families.  In particular, there is interest in 
maximizing the extent to which persons from the community, with basic training
in screening, disease management and nutrition, can complement the health and
welfare sectors and provide a meaningful extension to primary health care
programmes.<p>
<p>
     In sum, while there are a variety of dimensions which must be taken into
consideration when attempting to successfully integrate health, education and
social services for young children and their families, there are some
compelling reasons for using ECCE programmes for the delivery of health care
components. These include the current demand for ECCE programmes and thus their
growth, the fact that these programmes are socially attractive and draw people
not currently served by MCH and/or PHC systems, the need for the identification
and use of low cost delivery systems, and the fact that there is the
possibility for the development of a multi-sectoral approach to meeting the
needs of young children and their families.<p>
     <p>
     So far in the discussion no reference has been made to the current
linkages between the health care community and early chidhood care and
education programmes.  In fact, linkages have been made in both directions.
There are health based programmes that have successfully integrated stimulation
and psycho-social concerns into their programming.  Likewise, there are early
childhood care and education programmes that have integrated a variety of
health care components into their activities.  In the section which follows
there is a more complete delineation of the continuum of linkages which
currently exist.  The continuum provides an understanding of the ways in which
the various services have already been linked, and makes it 
possible to identify the gaps in linkage.      <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>III. IN WHAT WAYS ARE EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCATION
PROGRAMMES</b><p>
<b>CURRENTLY LINKED TO THE HEALTH CARE COMMUNITY?</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     In the discussion to this point the current relationship between the
health care sector and ECCE programmes has not been described. There are
linkages in a number of instances.  It is important to know what linkages exist
in order to understand the state of the art and to know what can be built upon
to make the linkages more complete and useful. <p>
<p>
     The linkages can be envisioned along a continuum.  One end of the
continuum is represented by ECCE programmes that are run and/or financed by the
health sector.  At the other end are those ECCE programmes that have no linkage
with the health care community.<p>

</pre>
<p>
     1. Within the <u>ECCE programmes sponsored by the health sector</u> there
are two major categories:  programmes that are operated exclusively by health
personnel, and those that are part of multi-sector approaches, where the health
sector shares sponsorship. An example of the first type are nutrition
programmes where the primary goal is to rehabilitate malnourished children and
to prevent future malnutrition. Such rehabilitation centres have been
established in residential settings in Chile. The centres focus their attention
on children under the age of two. The child leaves the centre when weight and
height are within the normal range. While in the programme the child also
receives psycho- motor and some cognitive stimulation. (Mauras, 1979, p.18) In
general, these programmes focus almost exclusively on nutrition issues; only a
relatively small percentage have recognized the child's need for physical,
cognitive and psycho-social stimulation.<p>
<p>
     The other category of health sector sponsored programmes includes those
that are part of multi-sectoral efforts to bring integrated care services to
young children.  A good example of this type of ECCE effort is the Integrated
Child Development Services (ICDS) programme in India.  From the beginning, the
programme was designed to provide immunizations and health check ups, referral
services, supplementary nutrition, non-formal preschool education and nutrition
and health education for parents.<p>
<p>
<p>
     2. At the next point on the continuum are <u>ECCE programmes that are
served by health care providers</u>.  Service can be provided in two ways.
First, it can be provided directly to children and their families by health
care providers who come to the ECCE setting and deliver a given service.  For
example, in some instances there are regularly scheduled visits (weekly,
bi-weekly or monthly) to check on the children's general health.  This model of
monitoring children's development is used in Iraq, where a doctor makes a bi-
weekly visit to each ECCE centre to examine children. In other instances health
care providers come to ECCE settings on an irregular basis, but for a specific
purpose (i.e. to give immunizations, to check health standards in the ECCE
setting, etc.).  An example comes from Mauritius were UNICEF has sponsored a
nationwide screening of preschool children by the School Health Servcies.  The
screening takes place within the pre-primary schools.<p>
<p>
     Second, health care personnel can work directly with ECCE providers. The
most common activity within this category is the training and on- going support
of ECCE staff who are expected to deliver quality health care, monitor growth
and development, identify developmental problems, etc., as a part of their work
in the ECCE programme.  When health care personnel work with ECCE staff in this
way they are generally available on a regular basis and can be called upon if
the ECCE providers want more information, or feel a child needs further
observation.<p>
<p>
     3. Moving along the continuum are <u>one-time training courses/workshops
offered by health care staff</u>.  For example, in a given region health care
staff may give a short course on the identification of malnutrition, or on the
use of growth charts, or on necessary health standards for an ECCE setting. The
health care staff generally are not available for follow-up or consultation. At
some time in the future they may offer another course in the same or a
neighboring community.  In these instances it is unlikely for the health care
provider to actually see the ECCE setting, or to interact on a one-to-one basis
with the ECCE staff.  ECCE staff are expected to take what is presented in the
course and apply it in on their own, but they get no feedback from health care
personnel on how adequately they are performing their task.<p>
<p>
     4. Somewhat further along on the continuum are <u>early childhood care and
education programmes that have no formal connection with the health care
sector, but there is an informal linkage</u>.  In these instances ECCE
providers have taken the initiative.  They are aware of the importance of good
health care and attempt to provide a healthy environment for the children and
teach the children good health habits (i.e. to wash hands). In some instances
the health care information is a part of the curriculum.  In other instances
providers seek out and use information that is available to the general
public--pamphlets on nutrition designed to be used with parents, or information
on sanitation developed for the community as a whole, etc.  In addition, ECCE
providers may call upon health personnel to provide a specific service to the
programme (i.e. to test a given child, to teach the group something related to
health care).<p>
<p>
     5. At the end of the continuum are <u>early childhood care and education
programmes that have no linkage at all with the health care sector</u>.  No
services are provided to the ECCE programme by the health sector, and the ECCE
personnel have received no training in health care issues.  Neither have the
ECCE staff sought health care information.  There are a number of reasons why
<p>
the providers in this instance are not linked in any way with the health
sector. First, they may not be aware of the need to think about health care
beyond what they feel they themselves know and can do.  Second, they may be
aware of the need to know more, but there may not be any resources available to
help them learn more about and/or incorporate health care into their daily
work.   Examples of programmes with no linkages to the health community are
those which have been developed by communities with little or no assistance
from public or private agencies.  These "open air" programmes utilize only the
resources available in the community, and while the organizers may have some
sense of what children need, they generally do not have the skills and
knowledge to develop a curriculum to meet children's multiple health,
nutrition, and stimulation needs.<p>
<p>
<p>
     The continuum of health sector and ECCE linkages represents a simplistic
way of categorizing ECCE programmes. To develop useful intervention strategies,
however, more depth of understanding of ECCE programmes is needed. In the next
section three typologies, or classifications, of ECCE programmes are provided.
Each allows a systematic analysis of ECCE efforts that can be used by WHO to
best design intervetions to support the delivery of the MCh components of PHC
within the context of ECCE programming.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>IV. DEVELOPING TYPOLOGIES FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND 
EDUCATION PROGRAMMES</b><p>
<p>
<p>
     A typology is a systematic classification. It provides a way of taking the
range of early childhood care and education programmes that exist and examining
them in a systematic way. By creating a typology it is possible to delineate
some of the important features of ECCE programmes and then to make decisions
about the kind of interface that is needed to utilize ECCE programmes for the
delivery of health care.  In trying to develop a typology that would be useful
to WHO, it quickly became evident that there is no single typology of ECCE
programmes that provides all the information needed to work with ECCE
programmes. There are at least three dimensions that can be used to
systematically classify these programmes, all of which affect their ability to
be used in the delivery of MCH services.  For example, ECCE programmes can be
categorized based on where children are served-- the <u>setting</u>.  They can
also be classified according to who provides support for the programme--the
<u>sponsor</u>. Another classification can be made based on <u>programme
characteristics</u>-- the goals, target population, curriculum, staffing,
materials available, and degree of parental and community participation. <p>
<p>
     All of these typologies are useful and provide important information to
those working with ECCE programmes.  In this section of the paper we will
define the categories within each of these three typologies.  In Section V,
case studies of a variety of ECCE programmes will be provided to illustrate the
interaction between the three typologies.  The setting category will provide
the framework for the case studies. As the range of settings is described in
this chapter, reference will be made to countries within which that particular
setting has been used for the delivery of early childhood care and education
programmes. A more complete description of the programme will be provided in
Section V.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>A. Typology I. <u>SETTING</u></b><p>
<p>
  This typology represents a classification of ECCE programmes based on
where they are located physically. Where ECCE programmes are located will
influence which health care components are delivered and how. In addition, from
the information available it is possible to determine what supports would be
needed if these settings were to be utilized for the delivery of primary health
care services.  The order in which the various settings are discussed does not
suggest priority settings for the delivery of ECCE services. It represents a
continuum of care from the home to the wider community.<p>
1.  In the <u>Home</u>. ECCE programmes where the child receives
the benefit of the programme in his or her home do not meet our earlier
definition of early childhood care and education programmes in the sense the
the parent is the primary caretaker and there is no out-of-home care for the
child.  However, these programmes are important to discuss since they represent
one viable way of providing quality health care and stimulation for the child.
These programmes generally focus on teaching parents or other family members
how to provide for the young child's health, nutrition, cognitive and
psycho-social needs.<p>
<p>
     There are three basic models that fall within this category.  There are
home-based parent education programmes where the ECCE provider-- generally
referred to as a home visitor or home teacher--works on a one-to-one basis with
the mother and child dyad. The primary example to be described in Section V
comes from Peru. Within the second model, parent education occurs in a
center-based setting.  Parent groups are organized and a course is provided,
generally with regular meetings over a defined period of time.  Such a
programme has been developed in Chile. The third model is the CHILD-to-child
system where children are taught basic health care and monitoring and use their
skills and knowledge with younger siblings.  Kenya has used the CHILD-to-child
approach in different ways in different communities.<p>
<b></b><p>
         2. In the <u>Neighborhood</u>.  Within this category are ECCE
programmes that operate in homes in the community. These are generally known as
Child Minding or Family Day Care. These may be developed (by the public or
private sector) as a part of a formal system of care or they may be created
informally as a result of the initiative of the provider. Examples of such
programmes come from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Maldive.<p>
<b></b><p>
         3. At the <u>Work place</u>.  These are ECCE programmes that have
been developed in conjunction with women's place of work--either within the
formal sector or in relation to the non-formal or traditional sector.  In some
instances governments have mandated that businesses in the formal sector, with
a given number of women employees, provide daycare for their employee's
children.  Where there have been mechanisms to enforce this legislation,
industry related daycare--either at the workplace or through the sponsoring or
subsidization of a variety of daycare programmes near the place of work--has
become a reality. These systems have been implemented extensively in the
developed countries.  They are becoming more common in the developing world.
Within India there are examples of industry related ECCE programmes. <p>
<b></b><p>
     In instances of early childhood care and education programmes within
the non-formal sector are those that have been developed in relation to women's
traditional work. A good example comes from Ghana where a programme was
developed in the market place. Another example comes from an agricultural
setting in Senegal. While industry sponsored daycare has been developed largely
as a result of national legislation and policy, the marketplace and
agricultural ECCE programmes have been developed on the community level in
response to a recognition of women's and children's needs in those particular
settings.<p>
<b></b><p>
         4. In <u>children's centres</u>. Within this classification are
all the ECCE programmes that are offered within a centre or building
specifically designed to provide some type of service to young children in the
community.   As can be imagined, this category encompasses a range of ECCE
efforts, and <p>
constitutes the numerical majority of ECCE programmes. Within this category
these are three sub-categories.  There is one that includes what are being
referred to as "open air" programmes.  What characterises these programmes is
the fact that, by and large, they are community initiated and rely primarily on
community resources for their operation and continuation.  Many of them began
in the out-of-doors because no other facilities were available; thus the name
"open air".  Examples come from Zimbabwe, Kenya, and Tanzania in Africa, and
from Chile, Brasil, and Mexico.<p>
<b></b><p>
    The second sub-category are all the ECCE programmes that have been
implemented in primary schools.  The focus of the majority of these programmes
is on preparing children for the primary school; they are offered to children
one to two years before they would enter school. A number of countries within
Southeast Asia (Thailand and Korea) provide examples of programmes operated in
primary school settings. An additional example comes from Haiti. <p>
<b></b><p>
    Integrated care programmes comprise the third sub-category.  These are
ECCE efforts that were developed in an attempt to, from the beginning, meet the
multiple needs of young children, and often their families. The Integrated
Child Development Services (ICDS) programme in India is an example, as are
programmes in Peru and Haiti.<p>
<b></b><p>
          5. <u>In adult and/or community centres</u>. Within this category
are the early childhood care and education programmes that have been developed
in conjunction with a service being provided for adults.  In some instances the
ECCE programmes offered in these facilities were an outgrowth of other center
activities.  In other instances, the ECCE programme was the first service
offered in what was meant to be a primary health care or community centre; it
then served as a drawing point for the community. <p>
<b></b><p>
    The sub-categories under this heading are based on sponsorship.  Those
included are: 1. early childhood care and education programmes operated in
health centres, as in Malaysia. 2. Another set have been developed in
connection with nutrition programming, an example of which comes from
Indonesia. 3. ECCE programmes have also been created in support of women and
development programmes.  Two examples illustrate this sub-category--Iraq and
Brasil.  4. ECCE initiatives developed as a part of community development
efforts constitute another sub-category.  Bolivia is used to exemplify the
case.  5. And last, but not least, are ECCE programmes operated by religious
denominational groups.  Programmes in Swaziland are described as an example of
the impact of programmes within this sub-category.   <p>
<b></b><p>
    Thus the typology based on <u>setting</u> provides five large
categories of programmes.  What becomes clear as the different programmes are
reviewed is that it is not enough to know <u>where</u> the ECCE programme is
located.  It is also important to know <u>who</u> in involved in creating and
implementing the ECCE programme. (In fact, within the fifth category of
setting, sponsorhip became a way of defining sub-categories.) Therefore, a
typology based on <u>sponsorship</u> <p>
is also an appropriate way to categorize ECCE programmes. <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>B. Typology II. <u>SPONSORS</u> (Funders and Implementers)</b><p>
<b></b><p>
     An important aspect of early childhood care and education programmes is
sponsorship. There are two aspects to sponsorship: programme funding and <p>
programme implementation or operation. It is not uncommon, for instance, for
those who provide initial funding and/or technical support for the programme to
have a time-limited involvement. The expectation is that after the programme is
established it will be maintained, at some level, by the population being
served. In other instances, funders and operators are one and the same. Those
responsible for funding the programme actually operate the programme and
maintain it over time.  <p>
<b></b><p>
     The ability to deliver MCH and/or PHC services through early childhood
care and education initiatives will depend on who funds and/or implemements the
programme. Thus, in seeking ways to introduce primary health care into ECCE
settings it is important to be able to differentiate between those who provide
initial support and those who maintain the programme over time.  It is
necessary to acknowledge and plan for the fact that funders and implementers--
in the short- and long-term--play different roles in ECCE programming, and they
would have different roles in the introduction and/or upgrading of public
health care services. More importantly, however, to develop a successful
intervention strategy, it is necessary to understand the organizational and
bureaucratic structure within which the sponsor operates.<p>
<b></b><p>
     Sponsors of ECCE programmes can be divided into four groups. 1. There
are the multi-national donors who do programme planning from an international
perspective.  2. There are governmental agencies and organizations whose
involvement in ECCE activities is based on nationally defined needs, goals and
resources. 3. There are also a range of non-governmental and private voluntary
agencies that operate either internationally or nationally.  4. And, last, but
not least, are community-based sponsors--existing groups that create an ECCE
programme or groups that have been organised specifically for the purpose of
developing an ECCE programme.<p>
<b></b><p>
         1. <u>Multi-national donor agencies</u> generally provide
short-term support.  Included in this category are agencies and organizations
such as WHO, UNICEF, UNESCO, USAID and other bi- lateral donor agencies.  In
general, these groups establish target populations to serve, develop an agency
policy about how that group is to be reached, and then work with appropriate
national ministries to develop programmes for the target population, based on
national goals and resources.  In general, these agencies provide funding and
technical assistance which supports programme development; they do not provide
funding for on-going programme support.<p>
<b></b><p>
         2. <u>Governmental</u> ministries, agencies and organizations
frequently play the role of funder and implementer.  These agencies are
mandated to carry out national policy.  If early childhood care and education
programmes are seen as a national priority, then a governmental ministry will
be charged with the responsibility for developing, implementing and operating
related programmes.  Sometimes only public sector funds are used in the
development of national programmes.  In other instances, the government
encourages private sector involvement as well.  One of the challenges of
working with ECCE programmes is that they have been developed by and operated
under the mandate of a variety of national ministries, including education,
welfare, health, labour, social affairs, women's affairs, agriculture, or some
combination of these.   <p>
<b></b><p>
     Within each of these ministries the rationale for the development of
ECCE programmes, the population to be served, specific programme goals, the

curriculum, staffing, and resources available to the programme are quite
different.  In order to work with government officials within the various
ministries, it is important to know their bias and concerns if they are to be
approached to expand the range of services they currently provide. For example,
it will take a different strategy to work with the Ministry of Education than
it will to work with the Ministry of Labour; the rationale for their
involvement in ECCE programming is different, they serve different
constituents, and implement different types of programmes.<p>
<b></b><p>
     It is also important to recognize that governmental involvement in
early childhood care and education programmes occurs at the regional or county
level, and at the city or local level, as well as at the national level. While
being responsive to national policy, the regional and local government groups
frequently have a great deal of autonomy in establishing priorities and
creating programmes designed to meet the specific needs of their constituency.
             <p>
     There is yet another set of quasi-governmental agencies/organizations
that have been very involved in the development of early childhood care and
education programmes.  These agencies are generally established through special
funding and have been created to fulfill a particular mandate. In many
instances those working in these agencies have the freedom and resources to
develop innovative programmes that can be put into place relatively rapidly;
they do not have to operate within the bureaucratic structure which exists
within many ministries. Examples of such agencies include the Children's
Foundation in Venezuela, a child welfare agency headed by the First Lady of the
Republic.  A comparable institute also exists in Ecuador (Instituto Nacional de
Ninos y la Familia). The General Federation of Iraqi Women is yetanother
example.  All of these agencies have had a significant role in the development
of early childhood care and education programmes in their country.<p>
<b>               </b><p>
        3. <u>Non-governmental (NGO), Private Voluntary Organizations
(PVO)</u>. These groups exist outside any governmental structure. They can be
found within the international community, or they may operate at the national
level,
<b>or their scope may encompass only the local community.</b><p>
              a. At the <u>international</u> level there are a variety of
groups, organized primarily around the provision of disaster relief and/or
nutritional supplementation. Included in this category are such groups as Save
the Children, Christian Children's Fund, Oxfam, The International Red Cross,
CARITAS, etc.  These groups were originally formed to address <u>survival</u>
issues. At this point in time some of the groups are examining the long-term
impact of their programmes and are in the process of attempting to create
additional programmes aimed at <u>development</u>. For example, Christian
Children's Fund, a child sponsorship organization, uses some of its monies to
create schools and community development centres which address the multiple
needs of the child and community rather than only providing nutritional
supplements to the sponsored child.<p>
<b></b><p>
               b. At the <u>national</u> level there are church-related and
welfare organizations that have developed a range of ECCE programmes.  In
addition, there are women's voluntary organizations which have seen the need
for early childhood care and education programmes and have taken the initiative
to develop such programmes within their country.  For example, the Botswana
Council of Women, a private voluntary membership organization, has raised the
funds necessary to establish day care centres to support women's increased
involvement in the wage economy. <p>
<b></b><p>
         4. At the <u>local</u> level there are programmes that are
developed by and from within the community.  These are either begun by an
existing group or a community group evolves to work specifically on the
development of an ECCE programme. In either instance, the community perceives a
need for child care and a programme is created. Sometimes the programme begins
with support from an agency or organization outside the community; it is
maintained by community members once it is underway.  This generally occurs
when international donor agencies are involved in community development efforts
within a community. In other instances the community begins the programme, and
once it has proven viable the community is able to secure resources from
outside the community (governmental or non-governmental) for continuation of
the programme.   This has occurred in Zimbabwe where communities have begun
schools in any space that is available. Both the government and national PVOs
have then provided some training and resources to upgrade the services
provided.<p>
<b></b><p>
     Private voluntary organizations and non-governmental agencies are
financed through a variety of mechanisms.  Some operate on the basis of
subscriptions. The UN related organizations are a primary example. A second
source of funds are individual gifts/private philanthropy.  In addition,
individual volunteer time and energy are critical to the operation of most PVO
organizations, particularly those that operate at the community level. Many
community-based ECCE programmes are able to exist because local resources are
available to the programme.  These take the form of: cash, in-kind goods, and
labour (meal preparation, construction and maintenance of facilities). Other
PVOs charge fees for the programmes they operate, recuperating the costs of the
programme by participant reimbursement.  The amount a given NGO/PVO is able to
spend on ECCE activities is determined by the organization's mandate and
related budget.  The potential for these groups to expand their service to
young children varies greatly among the NGO/PVOs.<p>
<b></b><p>
     In sum, there are a range of sponsors that can and have been involved
in the development of early childhood care and education programmes. Sponsors
play a variety of roles--from helping to make communities aware of the need for
ECCE programmes, to providing initial funding and technical assistance in
support of the effort, to providing the necessary on-going support to allow the
programme to operate.  Each organization has its own reason for being involved
in early childhood programming.  The motivation behind a group's involvement
will, to a large extent, determine the nature of the programme. Yet, by knowing
the sponsor it is not always possible to predict what happens on a day-to-day
basis with the children being served. There are a number of variables that help
to determine the nature of service provision. Within the third typology,
<u>programme characteristics</u>, an attempt is made to categorize ECCE
programmes on the basis a variety of these dimensions.<p>
<b>     </b><p>
<b>C. Typology III. <u>Programme Characteristics</u></b><p>
<b></b><p>
     This typology classifies ECCE programmes by the characteristics of the
programmes themselves, regardless of where they are located or who sponsors
them. This typology is based on what the programme looks like on a day-to-day
basis.   It is important to have an understanding of programme characteristics
in order to make an assessment of whether or not it would be worth investing
valuable resources to link with a specific effort, and if so, what would be
needed to add a health care component to an existing programme. There are
two major sub-categories within this typology: external programme
characteristics, which have to do with the position and acceptance of the
programme in the community; and internal characteristics, including the
existing focus, content, structure, actors and resources--all the things that
contribute to the day-to-day reality of the programme.  <p>
<b></b><p>
          1. <u>External</u> characteristics.  Included in this sub-category
are the elements of a programme that let you know whether or not it is an
integral part of the community.  If the ECCE programme is well respected and a
part of the fabric of the community--rather than on the periphery of people's
lives--then there is a much greater likelihood that additional programme
components will be accepted and utilized by the people. There are a variety of
dimensions to be examined to know whether or not the programme is an integral
part of community activities.  These include:<p>
<b></b><p>
               a. <u>The physical location of the ECCE programme</u>.  Is it
located within easy reach of those being served?  If not, then it is unlikely
that it is successfully serving those most in need. An example of an
inappropriately placed programme was a nutrition recuperation programme
operated in Chile. The programme was developed in response to public outrage at
high rates of infant mortality due to malnutrition.  A series of recuperation
centres were established in refurbished homes in upper class neighborhoods.
One of the reasons for using the homes was to create an atmosphere that would
be less intimidating and cold than many hospitals. It was presumed that mothers
would feel more comfortable visiting and spending time with their children in a
home rather than in a hospital. <p>
<b></b><p>
    Another reason for locating the centres in the upper class areas of the
city was to assure that the programme had high visibility, demonstrating the
government's responsiveness to the need. To further promote visibility,
volunteers--upper class women--were asked to provide stimulation to the
children in the centres. These women became very involved in the programme.
However, the parents did not.  While the atmosphere was less like a hospital
setting, the neighborhoods where the centres were located were more
intimidating than hospitals. There was a great sociological/psychological and
physical distance between the recuperation centres and the child's home. Thus,
mothers seldom visited their children.<p>
<b></b><p>
      When the child was ready to go home--after having gained weight and
attained appropriate developmental milestones--the child was returned to a
family to whom the child was a stranger. Nothing had been done within the
context of the child's environment to assure that malnutriton would not
re-occur. Not too surprisingly, many of the children returned to the
recuperation centres several months later, once again suffering from
malnutrition (Colombo, et al., circa 1979). Thus, while the programme met some
short-term goals--decreasing infant mortality and malnutrition during the
child's first year of life--long-term goals were not realised.  The
socio-cultural and environmental variables that were a part of the cause of the
malnutrition were not addressed.  The programme was never embraced by the
community; it remained on the periphery until it was redesigned to include
parents in a significant way.<p>
<b></b><p>
               b. <u>The history of the programme within the community</u>.
Do the people within the community talk about their programme with pride? Has
it been able to meet community needs over time?  If the programme is seen as
providing 
quality services, then it is likely that the addition of other programme
components will be accepted. An example of this is the Sang Kancil programme in
squatter settlements in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  In this instance the medical
community was interested in creating maternal and child health services, but
there was little community support for the effort.  However,community members
were interested in creating an early childhood care and education programme and
income generating activities for women.  Those developing the programme were
responsive to community expressed needs.  Then, once the preschool and income
generating activities were well established and an integral part of the
people's lives, maternal and child health services were initiated in
conjunction with the existing programme and readily accepted (Yusof, 1982).
<p>
<b></b><p>
               c. <u>The extent and type of parent/community participation
in the programme</u>. Within current development planning, one of the
strategies most frequently advocated is to have strong community participation
in programme development--from the definition of the need, to development of a
plan of action, to project implementation, to evaluation of outcomes.  While
this strategy is utilized in the development of many basic services programmes,
it is seen as particularly important in relation to early childhood care and
education.  Within developed countries a strong argument has been made that the
community is the most appropriate level of social organization to implement and
manage child care systems (Bronfenbrener, 1980; Center for the Study of Public
Policy, 1971). It is argued that since parents are the policymakers in most
areas of their young children's lives, their involvement in the design and
operation of a early childhood care and education centre increases the
likelihood of continuity of experience between the home and school for the
child. This same argument is being made for parental and community involvement
in the implementation and management of ECCE programmes in developing
countries.   In an evaluation of an ECCE programme in Thailand, Siegel
states:<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
         
<pre>
          When parents and village leaders have participated
          in planning of a centre before it opened, utilization
          and development of such centres have been the greatest
          ...Moreover, where parents have provided funds for, 
          and helped in constructing the centre, mothers become
          more deeply involved in the programme and transfer
          some of the child's day care experiences to the home.
                                               1973, p. 396
</pre><p>
The general consensus is that the greater the level of community
involvement, the more likely it is that the programme will meet community needs
and become an integral part of community life.  <p>
     However, the extent to which parents can and will become involved in
early childhood care and education progrmmes is affected by a number of
variables.  For example, there is <u>cultural variance</u> in the extent to
which it is deemed appropriate for parents to be involved in the eduation of
their children. In some societies women are responsible for care of the child,
but do not play a role in educating the child. Thus, they would not feel they
should be a part of the child's on-going education.  Another influence on
parental involvement is <u>the colonial tradition of education</u>, which
directly and indirectly lets parents know that once the child enters the formal
school system, the school takes on the responsibility of educating the child;
parents are not a part of the educational process.  Yet another variable is the
<u>time</u> that parents have available to be involved. Where early childhood
care and education programmes have been developed in response to needs for day
care, women are likely to have little, if any, time to be involved in the
day-to-day activities of the programme.  Other variables that affect the extent
of parent and community involvement in ECCE programmes are related to the
<u>political structure</u> of the programme--how it is organized and the extent
to which control for the programme is centralized or decentralized.  Where the
programme is designed and introduced from outside the community, there may be
little room for parent and community involvement. <p>
<p>
     2. <u>Internal</u> characteristics. The second sub-category of
programme characteristics has to do with all the things that affect the day-
to-day operation of the programme. Included in this sub-category are: a. the
target population and programme goals; b. the curriculum and services offered;
c. staffing; d. regulations and monitoring; e. materials available; f.
evaluation mechanisms in place; and g. the potential for dissemination and
replication.<p>
<p>
               a. <u>The target population and programme goals</u>.  To a
great extent programme goals are derived from an assessment of what is needed
by the children to be served. From the literature on early childhood care and
education programmes it is clear that at least the following categories of
children are provided for in ECCE settings:<p>
<b></b><p>
               (1) Children within specific age groups (i.e. those who will
enter the formal school system the following year), attend ECCE programmes in
order to be better prepared to enter the formal education system and/or have
enough basic education to receive vocational training.<p>
<b></b><p>
              (2) ECCE programmes are developed for children from low
income families in order to ameliorate environmental differences that put them
at a disadvantage when they enter the formal school system. The ultimate goal
of many of these programmes is to break the cycle of poverty.<p>
<b></b><p>
              (3) ECCE programmes have been provided for children of women
involved in the wage economy and income generating activities.  Such custodial
care is also provided to children of women involved in educational/training
programmes, making it possible for them to participate in these activities in
order to gain new knowledge and skills.  At a mimnimum these ECCE programmes
provide a safe place for children when their mothers are not available to care
for them.<p>
<b></b><p>
               (4) Children suffering from malnutrition have been provided
for through rehabilitation programmes. In some instances, psycho- motor
stimulation is also a programme activity.<p>
<b></b><p>
               (5) Developmentally disabled children and those with special
medical, therapeutic and educational needs, are provided with the specialized
services that their condition requires.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>               (6) ECCE programmes are designed to meet the special needs of
children at risk due to family stress or transition. The programme goal is to
give them a secure environment and consistent caregiver, for at least a part of
the day.               </b><p>
<p>
<p>
               (7) A programme may be developed for children within a given
geographic region, providing them with the services that will support their
growth and development and bring them to an equitable position with children
from other regions of the country (i.e for rural children who lack stimulation,
or for children in urban squatter settlements who may lack adequate
caregiving).<p>
               (8) Children from other than the dominant cultural group may
be provided with experiences that will better prepare them to participate in
the formal school system (which is generally designed on the values and norms
of the dominant culture).<p>
<p>
               (9) ECCE programmes are also designed to meet community
development goals. In these instances, while providing direct service to
children, the ECCE programme is used as a way of reaching parents and other
community members, and ultimately getting them involved in developing a range
of basic services for the community.<p>
<p>
<p>
     These categories of target populations and programme goals are not
meant to be exhaustive, nor are they mutually exclusive.  Rather, they are
illustrative of the ways in which people have defined specific child
populations in need of ECCE services, and the goals associated with different
ECCE efforts.                    <p>
<p>
<p>
              b. <u>The curriculum and services provided</u>.  In this
instance, curriculum refers to the child's total experience in the ECCE
programme. Services refer to the specific activities provided for the child.
Generally programme developers clearly define the services to be provided,
based on their perception of what will meet the particular needs of and goals
for the target population.  In many instances the service has a singular focus
(i.e. it is a feeding programme for the prevention of malnutrition; a cognitive
stimulation programme to prepare children for the primary school system; a
custodial care setting where children are kept from harm). In many settings,
programme developers are not seeing the "curriculum"; they are not addressing
the multiple needs of children--the need for safety, good health, and physical,
psycho- social and cognitive stimulation. Opportunities are lost when staff are
not aware of the range of developmental needs and the activities that could be
provided to promote children's overall growth and development.<p>
<p>
               c. <u>Staffing</u>.  In almost all countries of the world,
early childhood care and education programmes have access to very limited
resources. Thus, whenever possible, para-professionals and volunteers provide
the staffing. In many instances training opportunities are limited. This is
justified by statements to the effect that any woman, because she is a woman,
can "take care" of children; there is no need to give her training. As a result
of the assumptions that child care is women's natural work and that little
training is needed, the work of child care providers is not valued.  Thus, pay
is minimal, if received at all.  <p>
<p>
     Some of the consequences of the low status and low pay are that those
with education and a range of job options do not seek positions within ECCE
programmes.  Thus programmes are staffed by those with limited education and
few options for other employment. If they are fortunate enough to receive
some training, they frequently move on to higher paid positions in other
fields. Yet, to have a quality ECCE programme, that is meeting the needs of
young children, it is necessary to have well trained staff who receive on-going
training and supervision in a curriculum that they believe in and
understand.<p>
<p>
     The challenge to those interested in introducing a programme component
into an ECCE setting is to make a realistic assessment of staff capabilities in
order to create appropriately focused training methodologies and materials. The
next challenge is to create a training of trainers system that would allow the
pre- and in- service training of teachers to occur on a regional level in order
for it to be relevant to the geographic and cultural setting.  The need for
such a system has been identified by those currently involved in pre-school
education in Eastern and Southern Africa:<p>
<pre>
          Regional training of pre-school teacher trainers is
          a need which has been identified and expressed within
          the Eastern Africa Region...If this need is met, it 
          would contribute some solutions to some of the current 
          problems in Pre-schooling...Qualified teachers would
          enhance the existing low image of pre-school workers.
          In addition, governments would be more willing to
          employ trained personnel on permanent bases. This
          would solve some of the current renumeration problems
          as well as offer better conditions of service. 
                                  Mbikusita-Lewanika, 1982, p.33.
</pre>
<p>
          d. <u>Regulations and monitoring</u>.  The purpose of regulations
and monitoring is to assure that children are being provided for in a safe,
heathly environment. Within the early childhood care and education literature
there is considerable discussion of issues related to regulation and
monitoring, illustrating the inherent tension between adequate standards of
health care provision and what can realistically be provided within a given
context (Zigler, et al., 1983; Ruopp, et al., 1979; Nelson, 1982). A related
tension is between standardized national norms and allowance for regional and
local variation. These tensions exist even in developed countries where there
are relatively more resources available to providers to make adequate provision
for the care of young children. The issue is exacerbated in developing
countries with little or no resources available for ECCE programming.<p>
<p>
     There is no question that young children should have a safe, healthy,
stimulating environment within which to play and learn.  The problem is that
the definition of the "bottom line" in these areas differs, depending on the
value system of the definer (Steiner, 1981; Harman, 1978). To some extent value
differences can and should be worked out in the goal setting process.  As goals
are established, they can be translated into operational terms which then
define standards and regulations.  Standards and regulations are frequently
developed in the following areas:<p>
<p>
          - the physical environment (inside and out): size, structure,
light,             air, safety, sanitation, etc.<p>
<p>
         - staff-child ratio and/or group size<p>
<p>
<p>
          - staffing--structure, training and/or credentials of
providers<p>
<p>
         - months of operation, length of day<p>
<p>
          - fees and financing<p>
<p>
          - services to be provided<p>
<p>
      Unfortunately, the balance of attention in early childhood care and
education programmes is frequently given to regulations and monitoring of the
<u>static</u>, easily measurable dimensions of a programme (i.e. the number of
square feet/child, the number of toilets, etc).  The more <u>dynamic</u>
dimensions which speak to the programme process, and which are associated with
quality programming (i.e. the patterns of adult-child, child-child and
child-environment interactions) are not so easily addressed in regulations nor
accessible through simple monitoring techniques.  However, they should be
included in the monitoring process.<p>
<p>
     The over-arching issue in thinking about regulations and monitoring of
ECCE programmes is that they represent a mix of public sector developed and
supported programmes and private initiatives often characterized by families
and communities working to develop systems that meet their particular needs.
The early childhood care and education literature would suggest that on the one
hand early childhood care and education will remain far more personal and
informal than other kinds of social programmes, yet, on the other hand, there
needs to be a means for assuring that quality experiences exist for children.
It is necessary to develop regulations while recognizing that family and
community values will vary across the range of settings that will, of
necessity, continue to exist (OEF, 1979; Bruner, 1980; Bronfenbrenner, 1980;
Clarke-Stewart, 1977). <p>
               <p>
              e. <u>Materials and resources</u>.  Some ECCE settings have
enough resources to make a variety of materials available--to the providers and
the children.  More commonly, however, ECCE programmes have few materials.
Providers are encouraged to make use of locally found objects to create things
for the children to play with and learn from.  In introducing a health care
component into the range of settings, it will be necessary to think about the
materials and resources that need to be made available to providers to
appropriately implement health care activities.<p>
              f. <u>Evaluation</u>.  In the majority of cases those
involved in developing early childhood care and education programmes respond to
an expressed need, bringing to the situation their knowledge and experience,
and the programme either succeeds or fails--or lies somewhere along that
continuum.  Frequently programme developers are not able to step back from
their day-to-day actions and responsibilities in order to understand what is
happening in the process.  Thus, regardless of the outcome, they are not able
to look at what happened along the way.  In order to assess programme
effectiveness, it is necessary for programmes to develop a <u>formative</u>
evaluation process to monitor on-going activities, and a <u>summative</u>
evaluation procedure to be able to assess whether or not programme goals are
being met.  This will be particularly important as an attempt is made to add or
upgrade 
programme components--to know whether or not appropriate procedures are used
to introduce the components and to assess if health care services are being
delivered effectively in the ECCE setting.<p>
<p>
               g. <u>Dissemination and Replication</u>.  Because of its
commitment to meeting the basic health needs of all by the year 2000, the World
Health Organization is necessarily seeking ways to have a widespread impact as
effectively and efficiently as possible.  Thus, it is logical that they would
seek to coordinate their efforts with successful large-scale ECCE programmes.
Few of these exist, and they seldom reach those most in need.  Thus, a second
strategy is to seek out successful projects serving those most at risk which
have the potential for "going-to-scale".  In this instance, going-to-scale
refers to the process of taking small-scale projects and developing them into
programmes that attempt to reach as many potential beneficiaries as possible--
regionally, nationally or even worldwide (Myers, 1985, p.1).<p>
<p>
    One of the problems with developing linkages with ECCE programmes that
appear to have the potential to go-to-scale, is that it is difficult to predict
what needs to happen for small-scale efforts to be implemented on a broader
basis. For example, in Pyle's (1984) review of seven successful pilot projects
in India, he identifies project characteristics which would necessarily change
if the projects were to be implemented on a national scale.  The organizational
and political factors that would come into play once the project moved beyond
its current boundaries would dramatically change the way in which the project
would operate.  There is some question as to whether or not these changes could
be made while maintaining the integrity of the project.<p>
<p>
    For example, in many successful projects community participation is
sought and highly valued.  In fact, community members frequently have
administrative control of a project.  They have autonomy in decision-making and
are encouraged to be flexible in developing solutions to their problems. In
going-to-scale, project administration would change; it would become
centralized, more rigid and part of a beauracracy.  This raises the question as
to the role of community participation when successful small-scale pilot
projects go-to-scale and are implemented on a region- or nation-wide basis.
Community participation and involvement, as well as other dimensions of
successful small-scale projects,  needs to be carefully examined if the
intention is to develop primary health care components that can become an
integrated part of currently successful projects that apparently have the
potential to expand and be disseminated to a wider audience.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>     In sum, there are a variety of programme characteristics that interact
with one another to produce an ECCE programme.  Because of the interaction of
the variables, each ECCE programme is unique.  This is evident in the next
section where case studies of a number of early childhood care and education
programmes are described in some detail. </b>
<p>
<p>
  <b>V. CASE STUDIES OF SELECTED EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCATION
PROGRAMMES</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     Within this section there will be a description of a range of early
childhood care and education programmes.  Programmes have been chosen to
illustrate the typology based on <u>settings</u> within which ECCE programmes
are most commonly found. Then, within the description of the programmes the
reader will be provided with information relevant to the other two typologies:
<u>sponsors</u> (funders and implementers/operators), and <u>programme
characteristics</u>.  The basic categories within <u>settings</u> are: in the
home; in the neighborhood; at the workplace; in centres for children; and in
facilities created for adults and/or the community at large. <p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>A. In the home.</b><p>
<p>
     As was indicated earlier, the in-home setting somewhat violates our
criterion for an early childhood care and education programme in the sense that
the caretaking function has not been transferred from the mother to another
individual.  In fact, in many of these programmes there is an emphasis on
fortifying the role of the mother as the first and most important provider or
teacher for her child.  These programmes are included in the discussion
because: (1) they have been demonstrated to provide important care and
stimulation to the young child, (2) they are frequently designed to target the
hardest to reach children, and (3) the process of working with a family member
is an example of a way to deliver health care services--for the young child and
other family members. <p>
<p>
     There are three types of programmes included in this category. (1) There
are  those that are designed to work on a one-to-one basis with the mother in
the home. Here the example is from Peru. (2) There are those that work with
parents--usually mothers--in a group, as found in the <u>Padres y Hijos</u>
programme in Chile. (3) Third are the programmes that focus on training older
children who then educate their siblings and family. The CHILD-to-child
methodology, as illustrated by a programme in Kenya. <p>
<p>
<p>
          l. An example of <u>in-home parent training is home visiting</u>,
exemplified by the Non-formal Home-based Initial Education Project (PRONOEI-BH)
implemented in Peru.  The project, an adaptation of the Portage Model developed
in the U.S.A., was begun on a pilot basis in 1977, in 2 urban settlements
(<u>Pueblos Jovenes</u>) in Lima, and in four rural villages near the city of
Cuzco.  The goal is to affect the child's development through the parent. Thus
the parent is the immediate focus of the intervention. The programme "attempts
to assure that parents acquire adequate childrearing and <p>
caretaking skills and to guide and help them implement these skills in their
daily routine." (Jesien, et.al., 1979, p.7) Those designing the programme were
aware of all the demands on families living in poverty.  Thus, the intent of
the programme was not to create yet another demand on already scarce time and
energy resources, "but rather to enhance the quality of the interaction between
child and parent in the time that is available." (Jesien, et.al., 1979, p.7).<p>
<p>
     In the programme, non-professional community women are trained to provide
weekly home visits to the mother and child dyad.  In Lima, the home visitors
(<u>animadoras</u>) had an average of a tenth grade education; in the rural
area around Cuzco <u>animadoras</u> had a fifth grade education.  In both
instances the home visitors were provided a total of four weeks of training in
child development, teaching techniques, construction of educational materials,
(Loftin, 1979). <p>
<p>
     During the first project year, each <u>animadora</u> worked with ten
families and, with the aid of a supervisor, developed an individualized
curriculum for the child (between the ages of 3 and 5), based on his or her
developmental level.  The <u>animadora</u> used a developmental profile with
the child and mother.  The profile summarizes diagnostic indicators which
define the child's developmental level on a range of dimensions. From the
profile the <u>animadora</u> suggests specific activities that the mother can
use with the child during the week to stimulate the child's development. <p>
<p>
     During the pilot year home visits were made on a weekly basis and
generally lasted for an hour. (The average number of visits a family received
during the first year of the programme was 31.6 in Lima; it was 24 visits in
the rural areas.) During the year there was a teacher's strike, and high rates
of illness, both among home visitors and the families visited. These factors
contributed to the few number of visits.<p>
<p>
       A research design was implemented as a part of the project so that
outcomes could be determined. In both the urban and rural settings control
groups were established, permitting appropriate pre- and post-testing
comparisons.  The findings indicated that those children who participated in
the programme clearly gained from the experience. What was particularly
important from the findings was the fact that children in the rural areas that
were in the programme were at age-appropriate developmental levels at the end
of the year; the children in the control group lost ground developmentally over
the year.  Those operating the programme argue that this finding indicates the
importance of providing early childhood care and education programmes for
children living in poor rural environments (Jesien et. al., 1979, p.22). <p>
<p>
     A cost analysis was done to determine if a home visiting programme of this
type was a valid way to use limited resources. It was estimated that it cost
U.S. $47.60/family in Lima and U.S. $55.68/family in the rural areas (in 1979
dollars) to deliver the programme during the first programme year.  These costs
included the high costs of starting-up a programme. It was estimated that in
subsequent years the programme could be deliverd at the cost of U.S.
$25.13/family -- a cost less than or equal to other non- formal preschool
education programmes in Peru. The authors of the evaluation conclude their
report with the following statement:<p>
<p>
<p>
After reviewing the project's results the Peruvian educational authorities
validated the home- based methodology as a cost effective and viable
alternative strategy for providing preschool services to urban and rural
poverty families.  Plans are underway for a significant expansion of program
sites and the extension of services to families with children 0-3 years of
age.<p>
                         Jesien, et. al., 1979, p.23 <p>
<p>
The Ministry of Education is presently using an adaptation of the model with
children from birth to two years of age in several urban areas along the coast
and in Puno, a rural area in the altiplano. Funding for the project was
provided by the Peruvian Ministry of Education and the Cooperative Educational
Service Agency of Portage, Wisconsin (CESA 12), through a grant from USAID.
Project planning, development and implementation were carried out by the
National Institute of Educational Research and Development (INIDE), and the
General Directorate of Initial Education (DIGEI).  Technical assistance was
provided by a team from the U.S.A. based Portage Project.<p>
<p>
          2. The second type of in-home programme is where <u>parents are
worked with in groups and expected to apply what they have learned as they care
for their child at home</u>.  An example of this type of ECCE programme comes
from Chile.  Known as the <u>Padres y Hijos</u> programme, it focuses on
working with groups of parents, representing the poorest of the poor, to better
the quality of family and community life.<p>
<p>
     The programme was begun in 1979 by the Centro de Investigaciones y
Desarrollo de la Educacion (CIDE), a private research and development center in
Chile. They began by working with 50 groups of 20 families living in the
Province of Osorno. Later an additional 18 groups were established in Santiago.
All families who participate in the programme have children between the ages of
4 and 6. <p>
<p>
     The programme consists of weekly meetings led by local people who are
trained to run the groups.  During the meetings a series of "themes" are
introduced.  There are 12 themes presented during the year. Each is designed to
be the focus of discussion and activity for a month. At the weekly meetings the
leader presents pictures that depict common incidents from the people's lives.
The pictures portray daily events that offer opportunities for stimulating the
child's learning.  The leader guides the discussion, focusing on what the
picture shows, what the child is doing developmentally, and what the parent can
do to support the child's learning in that situation.  Parents then talk about
things they can do with the child during the week.  They come up with
activities and games they can use with the child.  Toys are also available.
Parents can take them home for the week, or use them as models and make their
own.<p>
<p>
     While the programme has not undergone a formal evaluation, those operating
the programme feel it is a cost-effective way of working with parents to
educate them about child growth and development. The group meetings also serve
as a catalyst for the development of other community-based activities that
ultimately improve the standard of living within the community (Mauras, et.
al., 1979, p.18).<p>
<p>
<p>
          3.  The third type of programme within this category are <u>those
that focus on teaching older children to educate and care for younger
siblings</u>. The best example of this methodology are the CHILD-to-child
programmes.  They are aimed at giving older children the skills and knowledge
needed to improve the health and nutritional status of their younger siblings,
and the family.  The CHILD-to-child programme was conceived during the
International Year of the Child (1979), and has been established in a number of
developing countries.  Funded by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA)
in London, it is jointly sponsored by the Institute of Education in London and
the Tropical Child Health Unit of the Institute of Child Health, University of
London. The idea behind the programme is that elementary school-aged children
can be taught basic health care that they can provide to their younger
siblings.  <p>
<p>
Simple preventive and curative activities as well as games, play and
role-playing can be taught to children in school, so that they may pass ideas
on in the family or community environment.  Initiatives and encouragement from
government and other official sources help support teachers and older children
in their activities.<p>
                 Morley, et. al., 1984, p.1          <p>
<p>
<p>
In various programmes children have been taught to identify malnutrition by
taking an arm measurement; they are taught the dangers of dehydration which is
associated with diarrhea and learn how to make the water, salt and sugar
solution to combat dehydration. They are also taught about safety and how to
prevent disease and other health problems.     <p>
<p>
<p>
     While the development of support materials has occurred at the University
of London, regional and national workshops are held so that the 52 countries
where the programme operates can adapt the programme to meet their particular
needs.  For example, a regional workshop was held in Kenya in 1979. When Kenyan
participants from the fields of education, health, and social work came
together they determined that management of diarrhea should be the first focus
of a CHILD-to-child programme in Kiambu Province. Training and support was
provided in how to implement such a project, and outcomes were monitored.  To
determine the success of the effort, the evaluation focused on measuring
changes in knowledge, attitudes and skills, and comparing the number of
diarrhea cases brought to the hospital before and during the project. (Otaala,
1981, p.94).  The pilot project proved successful; the model was then
implemented in other villages in the area.<p>
<p>
<p>
     The programmes described in the category of "in the home" settings all
illustrate ways in which family members have become the focus of early
childhood care and education programmes in an attempt to impact young
children's health, growth and development.  These programmes are all designed
to build upon and strengthen traditional patterns of caregiving.  They seek to
have an impact on the child's development within the most natural setting--the
home. In the next category are those early childhood care and education
programmes that operate within the next most natural setting--the
neighborhood.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>B. In the neighborhood.</b><p>
<p>
     Within this category are early childhood care and education programmes
that most closely approximate home care.  Generally known as "family day care",
these programmes operate in homes in the neighborhood. The examples come from
Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador.  In all instances the provider or caregiver
is a woman who provides care for a small group of children in her own home.
There are two kinds of family day care providers.  First, there are women who,
under their own initiative, decide to care for other children.  These women may
or may not be connected with a formal network of providers.  Of more interest
in terms of the current review, however, is the second group.  These women are
part of a formalized system developed and supported by a public or private
organization. These systems would provide a means of reaching children and
families not currently receiving appropriate health care.<p>
<p>
     One of the largest systems of family day care was developed in Venezuela
where there is a tradition of commitment to meeting the needs of young
children.  This commitment is evident in the activities of the Children's
Foundation, a private sector, quasi-governmental organization, presided over by
the First Lady of the Republic.  Since its founding in 1964, the Foundation has
been responsible for developing a variety of programmes for children.  In 1974
the Day Care Home Programme (DCHP) became the focus of Foundation activity.
The DCHP was developed and implemented as an integral care initiative, in
collaboration with FUNDACOMUN, the National Housing Institute, the Ministry of
Public Works, the Ministry of Health and Social Services, the Venezuelan
Institute of Social Security, and the National Institute of Nutrition.<p>
<p>
     The programme was begun in recognition of the needs of women and children.
"In a society in which women are joining the workforce in massive numbers, a
system of day care provision which assures comprehensive care for young
children is a need that comes from the basic rights of both the mother and the
child."(Ruesta &amp; Vidal, 1980, p. ix)<p>
<p>
     In attempting to meet the needs of families living in poor neighborhoods
in and around Caracus, the Day Care Homes Programme was created. It was
designed on the premise that quality care could be made available to young
children (0-6 years of age) within their neighborhood. Thus, within the
programme children are provided with custodial care, nutrition, health, and
education in a family environment--a family day care home. The programme allows
mothers working outside the home to be assured that their children are safe and
well cared for during the hours the mother is away.  <p>
<p>
     The Care Mother, as the provider is called, is expected to provide care
for 5 children under the age of six. Frequently Care Mothers have children of
their own in the programme. Women chosen as Care Mothers are between the ages
of 18 and 50, in good health, and must enjoy working with children. They are
selected after an interview, a visit to see their home, an assessment of
theirfamily, and a determination of whether or not the home is convenient to
other children in the neighborhood. The home is open from 6:00 A.M. until 6
P.M. The Care Mother receives a stipend of U.S. $1.54/day (in 1979 dollars),
for the care and feeding of each programme child.  This is supplemented by U.S.
$.23/day/child from the child's mother.<p>
<p>
<p>
     From the beginning the programme was designed to be comprehensive.  The
intent was to serve families in the communities where they live, linking them
to appropriate health and social services as needed.  Thus, an elaborate
training/supervisory support system was developed to assist the Care Mother.
Each group of 20 day care homes is served by a technical support team
consisting of a social worker responsible for maintaining administrative and
quality control; a health worker who establishes linkages with the appropriate
public sector organizations to assure preventative and curative health services
for the child; and a teacher who develops educational activities to be carried
out in the home.  There is a neighborhood Coordinator for each 60 homes (or 3
technical teams). Legal services are also provided. For each 8 neighborhoods
there is a person responsible for providing legal services and consultation to
the Care Mother and the families being served.  At the height of the programme
there were 1,260 day care homes in existence, providing services to 3,000
families.<p>
<p>
     An extensive evaluation of the DCHP was conducted in 1978, under the
sponsorship of UNICEF.  The evaluation was conducted by the Planning Office of
the Children's Foundation, with technical assistance from High/Scope
Educational Research Foundation.  The evaluation documents the program's level
of implementation, the extent to which it was meeting defined needs, and the
usefulness of the model in providing integral care to young children. In
addition, it examined the strengths and weaknesses of the training/supervisory
support system that was established.  No pre- programme data were collected, so
a case study and community survey approach was taken in the evaluation.<p>
<p>
    Basically the evaluation was favorable.  It determined that children in the
programme were well cared for and were receiving needed nutrition and health
services.  It was more difficult to assess the degree to which they were
receiving needed educational services since there were no pre-programme
measures of children's cognitive development. Recommendations from the
evaluation focused on ways in which the training/supervisory support system
could be changed to clarify roles and be more effective. <p>
<p>
     Even though it was assumed that by using neighborhood homes it would be
possible to avoid some of the massive costs associated with the construction
and maintenance of centre-based programmes, the DCHP model developed in
Venezuela was costly ($1,029 U.S./child/year).  Of this $804 was paid by the
Children's Foundation, $59 by other institutions and $166 by the community.  Of
the Children's Foundation's contribution the break down of costs was as
follows:<p>
<p>
               Direct attention to the child           18%<p>
(stipend to Care Mother)<p>

<p>
<p>
     As noted, primary funding for the programme was provided by the Children's
Foundation, headed by the First Lady of the Republic.  What that <p>
means is that the directorship of the Foundation changes as a result of changes
in national leadership. Since the evaluation took place there was a change in
the national government. Thus there is a new First Lady.  She has her own
interests, and has not maintained the funding for the DCHP.  Some Care Mothers
are continuing to provide services on their own, but there is no longer the
financial or moral support they need to continue their work. Perhaps if the
collaboration with various ministries and national organizations which
characterised the work from the beginning had been financial as well as
programmatic, funding would have been more broad-based, allowing the programme
to continue even though one funding source decreased its support.<p>
<p>
     Fortunately there are successful models of family day care that are much
less costly, and because they are community initiated and supported, they may
be more durable as well. For example, there is the Home Day Care Center
Programme in Cartagena, Colombia.  In this instance team members from the
Cartegena Office of Slum Renewal were aware of the prevalence of working
mothers in a low-income area of Cartagena and the need for a "healthy and safe"
day care situation for the children.  Building on an informal network of
neighbors already providing care for one another's children, three women were
identified who were willing to provide care for 10 neighborhood children
between the ages of 2 and 4.  The day care home provider was given training,
and a "promotor" worked with each mother.  The promotor was in charge of the
menu, clean-up, monitoring children's health, and providing cognitive
stimulation for the children. In essence, the promotor modelled what could be
done with young children.       <p>
<p>
     The day care homes were never seen as formal school environments.
Further, there was an open door policy.  Neighbors were invited to come in and
take part in the activities with the children. And, they came. The open door
policy provides an arena within which community members can informally learn
about child care.  Over time, community involvement in the programme has
increased; neighbors assist the day care home provider.  The promotor's role
has been taken over by community people. (Note: from the materials reviewed, it
is unclear whether the promotor has withdrawn from the programme or maintained
a low-profile position.)<p>
<p>
     The Cartagena day care homes opened in August, 1976.  By December, 1978
costs for operation of the programme for the first 29 months of the programme,
were U.S. $161.40 (in 1978 dollars) for each child ($13.45/child/month).
Included in the costs were: preparation and equipment of the homes, salaries
for the programme promotors and one coordinator; subsidies to the day care
provider; food; medicine; educational aids; and maintenance (UNICEF, 1979,
p.14).<p>
     <p>
     The Cartagena Home Day Care Center programme had an interesting off-
shoot.  About 6 months after the programme began there was a community meeting
to evaluate what had been accomplished.  There was a great deal of interest in
and support for the programme that had developed.  Community members were
interested in expanding the services to other children in the community as
well.  Funds were not available to provide promotors to work with other
mothers; neither were there funds available to provide stipends for additional
providers.  So, members of the community volunteered to provide care for young
children in their homes.  These volunteers agreed to work with 10- 25 children
under the age of four.  These children are selected by the volunteers and come
to her home in the mornings.  They are provided with a morning snack by the
Colombian Institute of Family Welfare; this consists of bread and hot cereal.
  The volunteers receive some training and support from staff members of the
Office of Slum Renewal (OSR). The emphasis in training is on giving volunteers
a knowledge base in child care and basic health, and developing attitudes and
skills that will help the volunteers work with the young children.  They are
also trained to give vaccinations and do periodic growth monitoring. The cost
of this programme is U.S. $4.00/family/month.<p>
<p>
     An informal evaluation of the programme suggests that it has had an impact
on childrearing practices in the community. Parents appear to have a better
understanding of child development; they are less punitive and they spend more
time doing things with their children.  The programme has impacted the
community in other ways.  Community development efforts have evolved from the
programme.  For example, initiatives were taken to pave the roads near the home
day care centers, and money was raised to improve sanitary conditions in the
centers. (UNICEF, 1979, p.16)<p>
<p>
     Yet another example of a family day care programme can be found in Tarqui,
a small community on the outskirts of Quito, Ecuador.  Within this community a
day care center had been established for 3-5 year old children. It was meeting
the needs of many families in the community. Yet there were still children
being left at home alone while their mothers went to work.  A survey was done
in the community to identify families with children in need of care.  Community
leaders, who had participated in the survey, came together to determine how to
meet the needs of these families. In the meetings that followed, a family day
care system of provision was presented as an alternative to the creation of
another center.  The idea took hold.  <p>
<p>
     Based on their interest, their location in the community, the adequacy of
their homes, and their personal characteristics, six community women were
chosen to become day care providers.  These six mothers received some initial
training in child development, health, and nutrition; regular in-service
training is also provided.  They are supplied with a small table and chairs.
They are also given appropriate toys.  They are provided with food supplements
for the children, and regular medical check-ups are provided through the Tarqui
Cooperative, which serves as the base for the programme.  The Director of the
programme is responsible for programme administration, training and supervision
of the day care mothers, linkage with the Cooperative and other organizations
which provide support to the project, and monitoring of programme progress. She
has an assistant who works with her. An extensive evaluation has been conducted
since the project began.  Results of the evaluation will be available in
December, 1985.   <p>
<p>
     Through a grant from USAID, partial funding for the project and technical
assistance were provided by the High/Scope Educational Research Foundation.
The project was designed and implemented through a cooperative agreement
between the Fundacion Mariana de Jesus, the Cooperativa de Tarqui and
High/Scope. From the beginning, funds were sought for project continuation once
external funding was withdrawn.  These have been obtained from the Instituto
Nacional de Ninos y la Familia (INNFA) to support operational costs of the
programme. (It is interesting to note that INNFA is the Ecuadorian equivalent
to the Children's Foundation in Venezuela. Hopefully this programme will not
have the same fate as the Day Care Homes Programme in Venezuela.)<p>
<p>
<p>
     A somewhat different type of neighborhood early childhood care and
education programme is found in Maldive. In that country children are expected
to be able to read <u>before</u> they are admitted to primary school.
Traditionally it has been the responsibility of mothers--usually in small
groups--to teach their children (ages 4-6) to read the Koran in Arabic.  They
also teach the children to do basic reading in Divehi, the local language.
These activities occur in homes in the neighborhood and are called
<u>kiyavaage</u> schools. Even where Kindergartens have been established, many
of the <u>Kiyavaage</u> schools continue.  (UNESCO, 1983, p. 16, 20). This is
an example of a community initiative that could be built upon and supported by
the formal sector.<p>
<p>
<p>
     The programmes included in this category all provide some type of care for
the young child in his or her neighborhood in a form which most closely
approximates home care. Some of these projects were initiated from outside the
community; others have evolved as a result of individual and/or community
initiative. By and large, they are designed to provide care for children whose
mothers are working outside the home.  In the next category of early childhood
care and education settings are those programmes which have been developed in
response to the same need.  However, rather than being offered near the home,
the ECCE programmmes described are offered in connection with the workplace. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>C. At the work place.</b><p>
<p>
          When describing ECCE programmes in relation to the work place there
are basically two sub-categories: programmes located at businesses which are a
part of the the formal sector, as illustrated by the Mobile Creche programme in
India; and programmes such as those found in Ghana and Senegal which have been
developed to support women's traditional work.<p>
<p>
               1. <u>Formal work sector child care</u>. One way in which
governments have given support to early childhood care and education programmes
is through legislation which mandates the development of employer sponsored
child care. In some countries there are mechanisms to enforce the legislation;
in other instances the legislation exists, but little or nothing is done to
make employers comply. <p>
<p>
     India is a country that has had legislation in support of employer
sponsored child care since 1964. For many years it was not enforced. However,
over the years there was pressure to comply.  Within the construction industry
there was particular concern.  Many women are employed within the industry, and
with the frequent moves required as buildings are completed and new ones begun,
women and children are forced to relocate.  Women are not able to rely on
extended family members to care for their children.  Thus a programme of early
childhood care and education was begun for these workers and their families. A
variety of private voluntary organizations, working with the construction
industry, created the "mobile creche" system, which began in 1969.   The early
childhood care and education programme is established where the women are
working, and moves with them from site to site. Mobile Creches have also been
established to serve the children of street clearners, rag pickers, and other
families representing the lowest social status groups in India.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     There are three levels to the programme.  The first is a creche for
infants and young chidlren (from 3-4 weeks to age three).  The second is called
a nursery programme and is for 3-6 year olds.  The third is an elementary
programme for children from 6-12 years of age.  Within the creche programme the
primary focus is on health and nutrition. The majority of the children are
malnourished when they enter the programme.  Thus, there is an emphasis on
providing them with proper foods and educating the parents about nutrition.
Within the nursery programme the health and nutritional status of the child
remain an important part of the programme.  The children are monitored weekly
by a physician, and growth charts are kept on the children. In addition,
however, there is an emphasis on cognitive and psycho-social development.  One
of the goals is to help prepare the children for the formal school system. <p>
<p>
     The third level, the elementary programme, was developed for children who
traditionally would have been taking care of their younger siblings.  Because
the siblings are now in an ECCE programme, the older children could be going to
school.  However, there is considerable prejudice against these children who
come from the poorest families.  Because their home environments have not
prepared them for school, they do poorly.  Teachers do not want them in their
classrooms.  The elementary programme was developed to prepare these children
to enter school and be placed within an age equivalent grade.  One part of the
teacher's role in the Mobile Creche programme is to help dispell some of the
prejudices.  She is responsible for creating linkages with the schools so that
local primary school teachers know what the children are learning in the mobile
creche system and have an understanding of what these children can learn.<p>
<p>
     Staff within the mobile creche system are from the lower middle class.
Originally the staff received their training within the traditional teacher
training institutes.  However, it was discovered that this training was not
adequate to meet the unique needs of the families and children served by the
mobile creche programme.  For example, they discovered that staff needed to be
able to do public relations work to convince parents to send their children to
the programme. They also needed training in basic health care and hygiene.
Thus, over time, the Mobile Creche programme developed their own training for
staff. Those with the aptitude are given additional training in nutrition,
community work and medical social work.<p>
<p>
     As the programme has evolved, classes in adult education have been added.
There are literacy programmes, nutrition classes, and political discussion
groups.  As of January, 1977 there were 68 creche programmes (UNICEF, 1979,
p. 7).  This provides important care and education for only a very small
proportion of India's more than 109 million children under six years of age. <p>
<p>
     While the development of employer sponsored early childhood care and
education in India was motivated by the need to provide care for children of
working women, a different motivation has led to the development of employer
sponsored child care in Swaziland, where few women are employed by industries.
A social worker employed by the largest pulp producing company in the country
argued that "the children of workers are the workers of the future.  By
providing them with preschool education they will have a solid educational
foundation and make better workers." (Evans, 1983, p.29). She convinced the
company to help support the development of preschool programmes.  They agreed
to donate company land, build the facility, and pay the teacher in one 
location.  In two other locations they have provided the land.  The Ministry of
Education provided the monies for constructing a building and paying the
teacher's salary at one of the sites.  At the other site a church is being used
and school fees pay the essentially volunteer teacher.<p>
<p>
     Another type of preschool has been developed within Swaziland in relation
to industries.  These are schools for the children of middle management,
indigenous staff and for the children of expatriates living on the estate.
These schools are designed to prepare the children for primary school; children
are taught English and socialized into the formal school system.<p>
<p>
     Thus, while there are a variety of purposes for the development of
employer-sponsored ECCE programmes, it is a phenomenon in both the developed
and developing world which is supported by national legislation. In many
countries legislation exists, but it has not been built upon.  The potential of
employer-sponsored ECCE programming has not been realised. There is no
legislation to support ECCE programming in the informal work sector, yet it too
is a growing phenomenon.<p>
<p>
<p>
               2. <u>ECCE programming in the informal work sector</u>.   In
general, planners have not understood the necessity of developing child care
programmes to support what has been viewed as women's work which is "compatible
with child care".  The question is, what work is compatible with child care? As
noted by Engle (1980) in a paper on the intersecting needs of working women and
their young children,<p>
<pre>
          The concept of "compatability" is desperately in need
          of definition.  Agricultural work, work in the home,
          work near to the home, and work in sales have all been
          considered to be compatible with child care.  However,
          it seems quite clear that a woman accompanied by one or
          more small children will be less efficient in her time
          use than a woman unaccompanied. p. 24.
</pre>
     Engle then goes on to describe a number of studies that have attempted to
look at the relationship between a woman's work efficiency and her productivity
as related to child care responsibilities.  The studies provide different
results, based on child and adult variables that must be considered in each
situation. But, regardless of what academic studies indicate, women involved in
the various activities have obviously felt a need for child care.<p>
<p>
     Examples of early childhood care and education programmes that are
included in this sub-category are found in the marketplace in Ghana and in
relation to agricultural work in Senegal. In Ghana, the Accra Market Women's
Association was interested in starting a child care programme for their
children while they were involved in buying and selling.  They approached the
Accra City Council, which agreed to fund the programme.  A committee was
formed, consisting of members from the Women's Association, the City Council,
the Department of Social Welfare (which is mandated to oversee ECCE
programmes), the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Water and Sewage.  A
building near the market was refurbished.  It now serves 200 children, from
infancy through 5 1/2 years of age. It operates under the Administration of the
Regional Medical Officer of Health.  Thus, it has a strong health and nutrition
focus.  Mothers of infants are encouraged to come to the centre to 
breastfeed them. Children are provided with a morning snack and a full lunch.
To enter the programme they must have a physical examination and appropriate
immunizations.  Once a month a public health nurse inspects the facilities,
provides immunizations as needed, and completes children's medical charts. In a
report on the project, the following conclusion was drawn:<p>
<p>
The Malata Market Day Care Centre experience has been a successful one largely
because of the support the centre has received from the very initial stages,
from appropriate agencies together with the keen interest of the mothers, who
work in close proximity to the centre.        <br>
                           WHO/UNICEF, 1982, p.23<p>
<p>
<p>
     Another initiative undertaken in relation to women's work place was begun
in Senegal in 1962.  Women who were part of an <u>Animation feminine</u>
center, proposed to those operating the centers (<u>animatrices</u>) that a day
care center be started, where children could be cared for while women worked in
the fields.  The day care was proposed by the women,
to resolve the problem of caring for their young children while they and their
older daughters under-took the arduous task of planting out the rice.
Entrusting the children to older sisters who were still too small to work in
the fields was a solution that did not provide sufficient guarantees of safety:
and leaving them on the edge of the rice fields meant they would be exposed to
all the vagaries of the climate--humidity, rain, direct sun, etc--as well as to
the attacks of wild animals, especially poisonous snakes.<br>
                        Bashizi, 1979, p. 166-167<p>
<p>
      The <u>animatrices</u> agreed to establish the day care programme as long
as the women's centre did not have to pay for the programme. So, mothers shared
responsibility for the programme.  Some planted a community garden from which
the children could be fed while they were in the centre.  Other women rotated
responsibility for taking care of the children and tending the garden.   The
first ECCE centre began in July, 1962, and operated for 2 1/2 months during the
most difficult part of the agricultural season--when the rice crop is
transplanted.  During the first year 110 children between one and five years of
age were provided for in the centre. Since that time day care centres have
spread throughout Casamance (one of eight administrative districts in Senegal).
By 1978 there were 58 centres, serving 6,004 children, ages 6 months to 5 1/2
years. The centres are open from 8:00 A.M. until 7:00 P.M., and generally
operate from one to three months during the year.  Parents pay a fee for the
programme in the form of money, rice, and oil or dried fish.<p>
<p>
      The centres operate under the Department of <u>Animation rurale,
Promotion humaine.</u>  Community developers within the Department quickly saw
the potential of these centres; they could be used as a base from which a
variety of social services could be offered. They began to offer training to
community volunteers who worked in the centres.  They also began to offer adult
education courses in nutrition, health, hygiene, disease prevention, water
purification, etc.  Through the centres they also offer treatment for such
diseases as malaria and conjunctivitis.  <p>
<p>
<p>
     Since the programme began it has received support from a variety of
national private voluntary organizations--ORANA, CRS, UNICEF, and the World
Council of Churches.  At this point an action research project has been
undertaken, with financial and technical assistance support from UNICEF, to
look at some of the following issues:<p>
<p>
          1. Should the ECCE programme operate on a year-round basis?  Or,
should other services be offered in the facility when the ECCE programme is not
provided?<p>
<p>
          2. In the poorest areas, women cannot afford to pay anything for
their children to be in a centre, thus the services are not reaching those most
in need. What can be done to help finance the programme in the poorest area
where women are most in need?<p>
<p>
          3. There is confusion about the division of responsibility for the
programme among the various governmental services; responsibilities need to be
clarified and resolved.<p>
<p>
          4. In some communities the programme has been operating for so long
that it is stagnating.  What needs to happen to rejuvenate the programme?<p>
<p>
          5. The goals for the programme need to be re-examined.  At the
present time there is an emphasis on preparing the children for primary school.
But currently there are not enough places in the primary school for all those
who complete preschool.  Thus, other goals need to be explored. <p>
<p>
     The key to this effort from the beginning has been that the programme is
"essentially and fundamentally a people's initiative". (Bashizi, 1979, p.171).
The goal is to keep it under the control of the community and to continue to
use the programme to support community development efforts while it provides a
much needed service to women and children.<p>
<p>
<p>
     Not discussed, but obviously tremendously important in terms of providing
a nationally mandated employer-sponsored systems of child care, are the ECCE
programmes implemented in Eastern European countries.  Among these countries
there are examples of universal pre-primary education as well as universal
systems of care for the very young child (0-3 years of age). These systems have
required tremendous government and private business investment; it is unlikely
that comparable systems could or should be created in developing countries.
Nevertheless, these systems should be understood in order to learn from the
experience of developing and operating such programmes.  It is also important
to understand the potential for developing ECCE programmes in relation to
women's traditional place of work.  These programmes, however, are more likely
to be unique to a given geographic area. It may be harder to find networks of
such programmes or an organizational structure within which one could work to
implement primary health care components in these community initiated
efforts.<p>
<p>
<p>
     In sum, early childhood care and education programmes operated at the
workplace represent both programmes developed from the top down--those mandated
through legislation--and those developed from the community up--based 
on women's defintion of their needs.   In both the developed and developing
world there is increasing pressure to create early childhood care and education
programmes in relation to the work place.  The systems being developed offer
tremendous potential for the integration of health care and psycho-social
stimulation into what too easily becomes custodial care.<p>
<p>
     <p>
     The <u>work place</u> setting is different from the <u>in home</u> and
<u>in neighborhood</u> setting in the sense that the ECCE programme that is
provided generally operates within a "centre" rather than in a home.  In the
next category there is a description of a variety of early childhood care and
education programmes which operate in centres specifically designed to serve
young children.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>D. In centers for children.</b><p>
<p>
          This category includes all the early childhood care and education
centres that are created specifically to serve young children.  They can have a
variety of purposes and serve various populations within the 0-6 age range.
Obviously this category encompasses a wide range of programmes.  Thus, in order
to develop a strategy for working with these programmes, it is necessary to
create sub- categories, some of which are based on sponsor, and some of which
are based on programme focus. The three major sub-categories included are: 1.
Open-air programmes--those programmes which are generally initiated by the
community, and which rely heavily on community resources for their survival,
and are described in a case study of Zimbabwe.  Mention is also made of
programmes in Kenya, Tanzania, Chile, Mexico, and Brasil.  2. Early childhood
care and education centres--located in the primary school-- developed
specifically to prepare the pre-school aged child for entrance into primary
school. Examples come from Thailand, Korea, and Haiti.  3. Integrated care
center-based programmes for young children, as found in India, Peru, and
Haiti.<p>
<p>
               1. <u>Open air settings</u>. In many developing countries
resources are not available to build early childhood care and education
centres. Yet there is interest in creating an ECCE programme.  In these
instances, "centres" are created wherever a group of children can be brought
together. ECCE programmes that generally occur--or originally began--in open
air settings are included in this category.<p>
<p>
      The primary example to be discussed in this category is Zimbabwe, where,
since independence, massive strides have been made to promote and develop a
range of early childhood care and education programmes. For many years a small
percentage of Zimbabwe's children aged 0-6 years, mainly in urban areas, were
able, through private means, to attend preschools, play centres, and creches.
In the more rural areas, preschools did not exist.  In 1980, the government of
Zimbabwe, through the Ministry of Education and Culture, took the initiative to
plan a national early childhood care and education programme.  The Ministry
established a commission of inquiry into ECCE activities which undertook
intensive nationwide investigations, and produced a report in 1981.<p>
<p>
     According to the report, hundreds of women in the rural areas, with no
support from the government, have started some form of early childhood care and
education activity for their young children.  The push from rural areas for
ECCE programmes has come about as a result of: <p>
<p>
          1) the burgeoning population growth which stands<p>
          nationally at more than four percent; and according to
1982 Census projections, more than 23% of the total population is under 6 years
of age; 2) the need felt by parents to overcome the legacies of the colonial
past by giving children a "headstart" in the schooling and socialization
process; and 3) the pressure of mothers to free themselves for short periods
from child care in order to participate in wage earning or enterprise to
supplement family income. Whatever the reasons, proliferation of self-help
community- supported preschools is occuring in areas where health care,
sanitation and nutrition are marginal. <p>
                               Perry, 1983, p.1<p>
<p>
<p>
     The conditions under which the more than 1000 village programmes operate
vary considerably.  They range from programmes operated under trees, to
programmes in small buildings with mud-daubed walls and thatched roofs, to
programmes that take place in the church sanctuary, to elaborate facilities
constructed and maintained by municipal support.  Many programmes used to
operate in primary school classrooms, but with the rise in primary school
attendance, these rooms are no longer available.  <p>
<p>
     A typical ECCE programme consists of upwards to 85 children, with only one
or two mothers (generally untrained), caring for the children. Parents have
little or no resources to pay for the programme; many use the bartering system
to support their child's participation in an ECCE programme. What this means is
that most teachers receive little or no pay for their work.<p>
<p>
     The ECCE programmes are administered by Parent Committees who are
responsible for hiring the teachers, establishing school fees, and overall
administration of the programme.  The little equipment that is available has
been fashioned by parents, taking advantage of materials found in the area. In
general, equipment, furniture, salaries of teachers and helpers are provided by
parent and community donations.<p>
<p>
     Some of these programmes receive direct or indirect support from non-
governmental agencies, such as VOICE (Voluntary Organizations in Community
Enterprise), OXFAM/US/UK, church groups (Methodist, Catholic, Seventh Day
Adventist, Lutheran) and other special interest groups. At the present time the
Ministry of Community Development and Women's Affairs has been given the
mandate to coordinate ECCE programming throughout the country.  They are
seeking the most effective way to support the community initiative, while at
the same time assuring that quality services are provided. (Evans, 1983,
p.3).<p>
<p>
The Ministry is well aware of the energy generated by the self-help initiative
in the communities and the potential of this large pool of untrained workers
and volunteers to provide paraprofessional support to teaching, management,
building, health services, food and nutrition.  But, preservice and continuing
inservice training will be required for development of responsible and creative
leadership.<p>
                            Perry, 1983, p.6 <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     While the Ministry of Community Development and Women's Affairs has
primary responsiblity for coordination of ECCE activities, it is envisioned
that a range of other Ministries will be involved as well:<p>
<p>
          - The Ministry of Education and Culture will focus on education for
       the 0-6 year olds, and the training of provincial and district
trainers.<p>
<p>
          - The Ministry of Public Service Training, Management Bureau, will
      provide the necessary training facilities at its current centers.<p>
<p>
          - The Ministry of Youth, Sport and Recreation will make outdoor
   equipment.<p>
<p>
          - The Ministry of Labour and Social Services will be responsible for
        children's general welfare, and for the development of special
services for handicapped and problem children.<p>
<p>
          - The Ministry of Local Government and Town Planning is responsible
       for securing land for the programme. <p>
<p>
          - The Ministry of Health will ensure good health standards and
  inspect the facilities.  Health workers will examine children
periodically to identify malnutrition, non-immunization, physical           and
mental conditions.<p>
<p>
          - Voluntary organizations will continue to provide services, in
   accordance with ministry policies. (Ministry of Community
Development and Women's Affairs, 1981, p. 3-4).<p>
     In addition, support has been sought from international donor agencies.
UNICEF (with monies from the Italian government), is providing support for the
development and implementation of a large-scale training scheme to prepare
trainers to work with local teachers to upgrade their skills. The training
programme is currently underway.<p>
<p>
     In sum, Zimbabwe is an example of the evolution from community-based,
open-air initiatives to the development of a national programme in support of
ECCE activities. Communities were creating their own ECCE programmes at the
same time that national forces were moving toward a committment to
education--for young children as well as school-aged children and adults.  In
addition, non- governmental groups and international donor agencies were
willing to collaborate in the effort. Over the next few years it will be
important to follow the progress in Zimbabwe and to assess if the government,
with its limited resources, is able to maintain a coordinated system of ECCE
programmes that provide quality care for young children.     <p>
<p>
     Within other African countries there are other examples of open air
initiatives.  Most notable are those within Kenya, associated with the
<u>harambee</u> movement and in Tanzania in connection with <u>ujamaa</u>
villages. In both instances early childhood care and education programmes have
been developed as a result of self-help initiatives that characterize many
open-air programmes. However, as the programmes have become increasingly
popular, there has been increased national commitment to the further
development of systems of ECCE.<p>
<p>
With the spirit of <u>harambee</u> which followed <p>
<pre>
          independence in Kenya, there was a period of 
          emphasis on good citizenship.  Most recently the 
          major concern has been fostering self-reliance 
          and the full participation of women in development. 
          In this context women have participated fully in 
          developing <u>harambee</u> day-care centers throughout 
          the country.    
                                           Otaala, 1981, p. 30
</pre>
<p>
     In fact, at this point in time the <u>harambee</u> schools constitute 60%
of all the early childhood care and education programming that has been
developed in rural areas. (Otaala, 1981, p. 16).  The centers that have been
developed are operated by local parent committees, and the resources necessary
to implement the programme come from the community. Thus, the setting is more
than likely to be make-shift, at best.  In some communities where the ECCE
programme has been operating for several years the community has built a
facility specifically for the programme.  They are under the jurisdiction of
the Ministry of Culture and Social services, the department of Social Welfare
and Culture, the Department of Community Development and Self-Help Schemes, and
the Women's Bureau.<p>
<p>
     Within Tanzania the same spirit of self-help has led to the development of
ECCE programmes in rural areas.  In 1969, the government supported an
initiative that led to the creation of day care centers for pre-school children
(ages 4-6).  Emphasis was on developing programmes in crowded urban areas and
in <u>ujamaa</u> villages where "mothers are required to work in the villages'
cooperative schemes." (Otaala, 1981, p.49).  Responsibility for the programmes
resides within the Ministry of Labour and Social Services, the Social Welfare
and Probation Division.  A variety of local private voluntary
organizations--<u>Umoja wa Wanawake wa Tanzania</u>, local councils, missions,
and employing organizations--actually sponsor the programmes.  Many of the
centers began as open-air initiatives.  But as there has been increased
government commitment to the development of ECCE progrmmes, there has been
increased governmental support.  The support has taken the form of constructing
facilities and providing village-based training, sponsored by UNICEF. Julius
Nyerere, President of Tanzania, has been a force behind the development of ECCE
programmes.  His rationale for ECCE programmes as an important part of the
development process is based on his view that,"The maturity of a nation can be
judged by how it looks after its children and mothers." (as quoted in Otaala,
1981, p. 53).<p>
<p>
     A range of programmes from other parts of the world might well be
classified as open-air initiatives.  For example, in Chile the "Plaza
Preescolar" operates in an outdoor setting in a town.  The programme was begun
by a community that was interested in developing an alternative to the
expensive traditional pre-school programmes. With technical assistance from
<u>la Fundacion de Jardines Infantiles</u>, a private organization, the
community built a "plaza" or open space where children come together for a
half-day preschool programme. (In the winter time the programme frequently
takes place in the homes of community members.)  Adolescents (<u>monitores</u>)
in the community are trained to work with a professional teacher, providing a
semi-structured educational programme for children.  Those chosen to teach,
young men and women, have an average of seven years of schooling, and are
interested in 
working with children. The Foundation pays for the training and the salary of
the teacher.  They also supply food to supplement the children's diet.
Supplies for the center, and the on- going maintenance are the responsibility
of the community. (Mauras, et al., 1979, p.19).<p>
<p>
     Yet another example comes from Mexico.  It is known as "la Programa de
Atencion Prescolar al Aire Libre."  It was begun in 1974 by the <u>Sistema
Nacional para el Desarrollo Integral de la Familia</u> (DIF), an organization
which develops and supports programmes that meet the needs of
families--particularly those living in the poorest communities.  DIF has
developed a range of early childhood care and education programmes, one of
which is the open-air programme.  The programme is based on the assumption that
early childhood care and education can become a vehicle for community
development.  The programme is designed to make the best use of local
resources.<p>
<p>
     Within the open air programme a Mother's Group is formed; these women
serve as the Board of Directors for the ECCE programme, and they are
responsible for securing a place in the community for the programme--in the
open or in a covered space. Thus, if no other space is available, the programme
takes place in a local park.  Staff for the programme are volunteers--men and
women--who live within the community.  Children between the ages of 3 and 6 are
served by the programme, whose primary goal is to prepare the children to enter
the primary school system.  A curriculum has been developed that is presented
in a straight-forward way so that the volunteers can easily follow it.  Three
variations of the curriculum have been developed: one for urban areas, one for
peri-urban communities, and one for rural Mexico.  In 1979 the programme was
serving 25,000 in the federal district; an additional 140,000 were being served
in other states (Mauras,    et al., 1979, p. 18).<p>
<p>
     There is at least one example of an open-air programme that was initiated
from outside the community. This is found in the Santa Catalina area of Brazil.
In this instance the government was interested in mobilizing the community to
support the development of young children. They determined that one way of
doing this was to make children more visible in the community. In 1984 they
created open-air programmes (<u>La Gaviota</u>) that could be offered
anywhere--in the streets, in open areas, on the beach, in homes. In the
programme, the environment becomes part of the curriculum. People in the
community can see how much children learn from the world around them. Adults
are encouraged to become involved in these ECCE efforts. <p>
<p>
     In all the examples of open air programmes it is evident that they rely
heavily on community support if they are going to survive.  Additionally, they
have been developed in communities that are least likely to be reached by the
more formal traditional pre-school programmes. They also reach children and
families least likely to be served by the health sector. Yet there are many
problems. In describing these ECCE programmes in Africa, Mbikusita-Lewanika
(1982) summarizes some of the issues.<p>
<p>
                                                           <p>
Most of these centres are provided by the communities on self-help bases. The
communities are eager for their children to benefit from any kind of early
childhood care and education, and cannot wait for the governments to provide
these facilities...Since they are provided 
by the communities, they are the cheapest of all children's centres.  On the
other hand, these centres have the poorest facilities; ill constructed or
uncompleted buildings, poor ventilation, dangerous walls and floors,
overcrowding of children, lack of equipment and materials, under-staffed, and
untrained personnel.  p.23<p>
<p>
<p>
     She then proceeds to make an argument for why these programmes should, in
fact, receive the <u>most</u> governmental attention.  Included in her list of
reasons is the fact that those starting the programmes have the fewest economic
resources; early childhood care and education centres in these communities have
the potential to serve as a base for community development; these communities
receive the least in terms of all social services; children from these
communities are most in need of what a quality pre- school can provide; and
last, but not least, people in these communities have demonstrated their
commitment to their children and their ability to create a programme through
self-help initiatives; their efforts should be recognized and supported by the
government (Mbikusita-Lewankia, 1982, p. 23-24).<p>
<p>
               2. <u>In primary schools</u>.  Basically within this category
are programmes designed to meet the needs of "disadvantaged" children living in
urban squatter settlements and rural areas who are seen as having a
disadvantage when they enter primary school. These children, because of their
ethnic, social, regional, or family background, lack the experiences, skills,
and knowledge that more affluent peers bring to the school experience.  As a
result, they do poorly, drop out of school early, and are likely to continue
the cycle of poverty.  In the hopes of breaking that cycle, preschool
programmes have been developed for this group of children so that once they
enter the school system they can compete on an equitable basis with their
peers.<p>
<p>
      Within South east Asia there are a number of examples of national efforts
which have been developed to provide a pre- school experience in the primary
school for the urban poor and rural child.  In Thailand, for example, there
were a number of factors that led to the development of these pre-primary
classes.  First, there was an awareness of the fact that children come to the
formal school experience with very different life experiences, putting some
children at a "disadvantage" in terms of making the most of the school
experience. Second, there was a recognition of the value of quality pre- school
experiences to help prepare the child for later life. Third, there was a
declining birth rate which led to a demand for better education; with fewer
children, families have a high investment in their children's education. Last,
but not least, with the declining birthrate, there was also a decreasing
enrollment in primary schools, and thus classrooms were empty.       <p>
<p>
     In response to these factors the Ministry of Education, through the
National Primary Education Commission, determined to provide grants to target
communities to develop pre- primary programmes, in the primary schools, for 5-6
year olds, to prepare them for the formal school system.  Grants go to "areas
identified as the rural impoverished, the urban deprived, the remote and
barren, and the community with 50% of the children speaking other than Thai".
(Piya-Ajariya, 1983, p.47).  If other communities are interested in
establishing pre-primary programmes they can, but the local education committee
has to bear all the costs.<p>
<p>
<p>
     The Ministry prescribed pre-primary programme includes "fostering of
personality development, desirable values and socially accepted manners, mental
and physical development and nutrition...The emphasis on reading and writing
may be begun in the final phase of the programme." (Pija-Ajariya, 1983, p. 47).
<p>
<p>
     Thailand has other systems of ECCE programming as well. There is a system
of child development centres which are integrated programmes of care provided
for children from age 2- 6, operated by local education committees--consisting
of the health sector, community development workers, community leaders, and
parents.  There are also rural Child Nutrition Centres operated by the
Department of Health, and in urban areas ECCE programmes are run by the
Metropolitan City Municipality. (WHO/SEA, 1972, p.36). <p>
<p>
     As the primary school-based programme has evolved, it has drawn children
away from the child development centres.  To a large extent this has occurred
because parents see the pre-primary programme as "teaching" the child.  Child
development centres are seen as places to "play".  What is currently being
proposed is that the two systems come together and form a continuum of care for
the child from age 2 until entrance into the primary school.  Children would
begin in the child development centres, and at age 5 or 6 they would enter the
pre-primary programme.  The philosophy, curriculum and activities would be
coordinated across the two programmes. (Pija-Ajariya, 1983). (Note: there was
no discussion of how the Ministry of Health programme would or would not be
included in this continuum approach.)<p>
<p>
     Korea represents another example where a pre-school programme, offered in
the primary school, has been developed specifically to meet the needs of the
urban and rural poor. Korea has Kindergartens in the urban areas. Primarily
these serve the child least in need of them--children from affluent families
who could afford to pay the costs of the programme. The Ministry of Education,
again because of decreased primary school enrollment and available space in
schools, is proposing that kindergartens, or pre-primary programmes be offered
in Korea to all children. <p>
<p>
     To help develop the pre-primary programme the Korean Institute for
Research in Behavioural Sciences (KIRBS) has been provided support by UNICEF to
create an appropriate curriculum for the rural and urban poor (ages 3-5), and
to implement the curriculum in areas of most need. (With earlier support from
UNICEF, KIRBS developed a curriculum for 5 year olds that is now the nationally
prescribed curriculum for kindergartens.)  A mid-term evaluation of the project
indicated that "the KIRBS programme is an innovative and effective contribution
towards setting up early childhood education in disadvantaged and remote
areas." (Crellin, et al., 1984, p. 29).  <p>
<p>
     One of the issues raised by the evaluation was the fact that, as
originally proposed, the project was to focus considerable attention on parent
involvement.  When the evaluation occurred there was little evidence of parent
education and/or involvement.  The programme seems to be evolving along the
lines of traditional preschool education. The evaluators raised the question of
whether or not it is most cost-effective to invest in the development of
kindergartens in all areas; they suggested that alternative approaches to the
provision of ECCE should be more fully explored, such as home based teaching
and parent education.<p>
<p>
<p>
     A similar issue was raised at the regional training workshop for
supervisors and administrators of ECCE programmes, held by UNESCO in Bangkok in
l983, where the effectiveness of providing traditional kindergarten programmes
was discussed. It was aptly noted that:<p>
<p>
          Many attempts to prepare children for entry to primary school are
premised on the assumption that there is no need to change the primary school
system but that there is a need to change the child to fit that system.<p>
<p>
                                       UNESCO, 1983, p.6<p>
<p>
     In some countries there is an awareness that the primary school may need
to be changed, or at least an awareness that "compensatory programmes", which
simply introduce children to the traditional system a year earlier, are not the
answer. Malaysia, which, as a result of a 1972 study of drop outs, instituted
many rural day care centres and kindergartens is currently looking at the
effectiveness of these programmes. They are doing a national survey to look at
the status of ECCE programmes in order to make recommendations about future
investment in the field (UNESCO, 1983, p.2). <p>
<p>
     In sum, while a number of countries have developed early childhood care
and education programmes which are an extension of a costly formal educational
system, there is some question about the long-term value of creating these
systems of ECCE provision.  With alternative models it may be possible to
achieve multiple goals--in terms of health care, nutrition, parent education
and community development, as well as education.      <p>
<p>
     Haiti is an example of a country where there have been substantial
development of both single-purpose (educational), and integrated early
childhood care and education programmes. There has been a long history of pre-
school provision in Haiti.  Originally it was developed by the Ministry of
Agriculture and was provided for rural children in order to prepare them to
enter the primary school system.  These were called <u>class enfantines</u>.
The primary focus of the programme was on teaching children to read and write
in French, the language of the primary school system.  In rural areas children
had to complete the <u>class enfantine</u> in order to enter the primary school
system.<p>
<p>
     More recently, however, there has been a national commitment to the
provision of early childhood care and education to all children.  In the
Educational Reform of 1982, a Reform Curriculum was developed, and the primary
school was re-structured.  In this process emphasis was placed on developing
pre-primary programmes, known as Community Integrated Nutrition and Education
Centres (CINEC), for 5 years olds. These are operated by the Ministry of
Education.  In 1984, the Haitian Ministry of Education adopted the CINEC
programme as the official pre-school programme for the country.<p>
<p>
     The CINEC programme was actually proposed in 1976, and between 1978 and
1983, 121 centres were built and equipped by CARE, which worked with the
Ministry of Education to create the programme. Ninety-six of the centres were
built in conjunction with primary schools being constructed with funds from the
World Bank; an additional 25 were built in conjunction with existing primary
facilities.  The CINEC centres currently serve 6,050 of the 146,000 five year
olds.       <p>
<p>
<p>
     The CINEC programme has two levels: the <u>extern</u> programme, designed
to serve those under 5; and the <u>intern</u> programme, designed to serve the
5 year old. Each centre is to serve groups of 50 children in each age group.
When enrolled in the <u>extern</u> programme, children come to the centre once
a month for health and nutrition check-ups. Growth charts are kept on all
children.   In addition, mothers are given food allocations and information on
health and nutrition on a monthly basis in the hopes that children's nutrition
will be improved. In the <u>intern</u> programme, five year old children are
provided with a half-day educational programme in addition to the health and
nutrition programme. When the children enter the programme they are given a
series of tests to establish where they are developmentally. They are measured
in 21 areas; this creates a profile which becomes a way of monitoring
children's performance over time. Those who successfully complete the CINEC
intern programme are guaranteed a place in the public primary schools. (This is
a significant guarantee since at the primary level the public sector serves
only 40% of the children who are in primary schools. The private sector serves
the other 60%.) <p>
<p>
     Teachers (<u>responsables</u>) for the CINEC programme are employed by the
Ministry of Education and receive a salary in accordance with the ministry
scale for primary school teachers.  They generally have completed a minimum of
three years of secondary school and have 6 months of specialised training at a
teacher training college.  Supervision is provided by the Ministry of
Education. Thus, the CINEC system of pre-primary education is well integrated
into the primary school system.<p>
<p>
     Haiti has an equally large system of ECCE programmes which represent
examples of the next sub-category of ECCE center- based programmes--programmes
of integrated care, designed to meet the multiple needs of young children 0-6
years of age.<p>
<p>
               3. <u>In integrated care centres</u>. Within this sub-category
there are two basic types of programmes: those that are provided by an
individual to a single group of children; and those developed on a larger
scale, designed to meet the multiple needs of children from the poorest of the
poor families.<p>
<p>
     Private enterprise schools are developed by the owner/director of the
school.  Generally the individual running the school, expatriate or national,
has received training in early childhood education in a Western country, and
sets about to establish a pre-school in the developing country based on that
training.  In many country surveys of early childhood care and education
programming, these pre-schools are under-reported.  Unless the country has a
good system for registration and monitoring of pre-schools, these schools may
not be counted; they seldom have any formal connection with governmental
agencies or other early childhood care and education systems.  And, while the
pre- schools developed by individuals may be linked to international ECCE
affiliate organizations (such as Montessori), they seldom reach many children
in the country. Thus the programmes of greatest interest in this category are
those which have been developed to meet the needs of large groups of at risk
children-- the poorest of the poor--nationally or regionally.  There are some
notable examples.  There is the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
programme in India.  There is also the non-formal education programme begun in
Puno, Peru.  Yet another example comes from Haiti.<p>
<p>
<p>
     The need for masssive programmes which address the needs of young children
in most evident in a country like India where there are more than 109 million
children under the age of 6--constituting 16% of the population (Sadka, 1984,
p.5.). In 1974 India adopted a National Policy for Children. In the policy
statement, India indicated its commitment to ensure the delivery of
comprehensive child development services to all children. One of the first
targets for the effort were the "poorest of the poor found in urban slums and
urban areas", particularly children in "scheduled cases and tribes." (Sadka,
1984, p.3).  <p>
<p>
     To develop a comprehensive service for these children, the Planning
Commission, in 1972, created 8 inter-ministerial teams that were charged with
the task of developing a programme to meet the following goals:<p>
          o to reduce the incidence of low birth weight and severe
malnutrition among children;<p>
<ul>
          <li> to bring down the mortality and morbidity rates among children 0-6
          years old;<br>

          <li> to reduce school dropout rates through early stimulation
programmes for children 3-6 years old;<br>

          <li> to provide the environmental conditions necessary for mental,
     physical and social development of children;<br>

          <li> to enhance the ability of mothers to provide proper care for their
          children; and<br>

          <li> to achieve effective co-ordination at the policy and
implementation levels among government departments to promote             child
development. (Sadka, 1984, p.12)<br>
</ul>
<p>
     In order to meet these goals it was determined that the comprehensive
programme needed to provide:  non-formal pre-school education; immunizations,
regular, periodic health check-ups, supplementary nutrition; appropriate
medical referral services; and nutrition and health education for women.<p>
<p>
     As the inter-ministerial teams met, it became evident that there were
models of early childhood care and education within which these services could
be provided.  What was lacking was an organizational framework which would
assure that the services were delivered in the community.  Thus within the
programme it was determined that an <u>Anganwadi</u> would be constructed.
(Each <u>Anganwadi</u> is designed to serve a population of 1,000 in rural and
urban areas and 700 in tribal areas.) It serves as the base of operations
within the community. <p>
<p>
     The programme operates through a three tiered staffing system. At the
community level is the <u>Anganwadi</u> worker (AWW).  This person plays the
key role in the community; she is the primary link between community members
and the government. She is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the
programme within the community.  Above the AWW is a Supervisor responsible for
20-25 AWWs. She provides them with on-going training and support.  Above her is
the Child Development Project Officer (CDPO), who provides the linkage between
the ICDS programme and government administration.  The CDPO is responsible for
the 
work of 4 Supervisors (100 AWWs).  A system of pre-and in-service training has
been developed for all staff. The programme operates within the Ministry of
Social Welfare, and is monitored by the Ministry as well as the All India
Institute of Medical Science and the National Institute for Public Cooperation
and Child Development.<p>
<p>
     All families in the area to be served are surveyed to identify the
poorest. Those families with children under 6 and/or where the woman is
pregnant or lactating, are served in the <u>Anganwadis</u>. Regular
examinations are provided by Lady Health Visitors and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives.
Children and pregnant women are immunized on a scheduled basis. Three hundred
days a year food is distributed; the menu is prepared in accordance with local
foods and traditions. Families are encouraged to bring the children to the
centres for regular feeding.  Children's  weight and height is monitored.
Those with severe malnutrition are given additional food supplements, and acute
cases are referred to medical services.<p>
<p>
          A pre-school programme has been developed for 3-5 year olds who
attend the centre three hours a day.  While there is no formally structured
curriculum, the local staff are encouraged to develop activities that stimulate
the child. Frequently there is parental pressure to teach the alphabet and
beginning numeracy.  An additional educational service is non-formal training
in nutrition and health organized for mothers and pregnant women.  These
sessions are open to all women, aged 15-45, with priority given to pregnant and
nursing women and women whose children suffer from repeated malnutrition.<p>
<p>
     Two major evaluations of the programme have been conducted.  One occurred
in 1978 and the second was in 1982. Both indicated positive results from the
programme--in terms of the programme's impact on children, women, and the
community at large (Sadka, 1984 p. 26-35).  Funding for the progrmme has come
from both governmental and non-governmental sources.  The initial costs of
establishing a programme are provided by the Ministry of Social Welfare. The
costs of the supplementary feeding programme are borne by the state
governments; and the on-going operational costs are the responsibility of the
Central government.  International donor agencies have also been involved in
funding aspects of the programme: UNICEF assisted in planning and
implementation beginning in 1975. Since 1982 other international agencies--WFP,
CARE, NORAD, USAID--have been contributing in a variety of ways.<p>
<p>
     The programme began on a pilot basis in 33 of India's 5000 administrative
blocks.  By March of 1985, 100,000 <u>Anganwadis</u> for 100 million people,
were to be established, with the ultimate goal being the delivery of
comprehensive services to all children under the age of 6 by the year 2000.<p>
<p>
     Another community-based programme designed to provide health, nutrition,
and education services is one of the non-formal education programmes which has
been developed in Peru.  Prior to the early seventies, the majority of
pre-school programmes which existed in Peru were available to urban middle and
upper-middle class children. Few attempts had been made to bring early
childhood care and education programmes to other populations in other parts of
the country. In 1972, however, as a part of the Educational Reform, there was a
commitment to providing pre-school education to all children in Peru.  The term
used to refer to education for children ages 0-5 was "initial education". As a
part of the initial education movement two types of programmes have been <p>
developed: there are those which are referred to as formal centres (Centros de
Educacion Initial-CEIs), staffed by professionals; and the non-formal centres
(Programas No-formal de Educacion Inicial-PRONOEI), which are staffed by para-
professionals.<p>
<p>
     Of particular concern in the development of initial education was the
provision of pre-primary education to children in marginal areas--in densely
populated urban areas and in remote rural zones. These areas have been reached
primarily through the non-formal system.  Two basic models of non-formal
provision have been developed. There is a home-based model which was described
earlier in this chapter, and there is a centre-based model. Within the
centre-based programme children participate in a half-day programme, five days
a week.  Within the programme they engage in educational activities, have a
snack or noon-day meal, and are monitored in terms of health and nutrition. <p>
<p>
     Recognizing the diversity of cultures represented in the various regions
of Peru, communities were encouraged to develop models of pre-school education
that met their particular needs. Within Puno, Peru, a non-formal model evolved
that has been disseminated to other parts of the country.  The Puno programme
began in 1967 as a community-based effort to provide nutrition education to
women. But when the initial education movement began, the programme shifted its
focus to the development of a pre-school for Quechua and Aymara children 3-6
years of age.  In 1973 it became known as the "Proyecto Experimental de
Educacion Initial No-Escolarizada de Puno"(PROPEDEINE). Located in the
altiplano region around Lake Titicaca, the programme operates in simply
constructed Children's Houses (<u>Wawa Wasis and Wawa Utas</u>). The children's
house is constructed by community members, who donate the materials as well as
their time and skill.<p>
<p>
     Pre-school aged children are provided with an educational programme, basic
health care, and nutritional supplementation. The national pre-school
curriculum has been adapted to reflect the local culture. Within the programme,
staff make use of natural activities in the children's lives--planting, hoeing,
herding of llama and sheep, etc.  There is also extensive use of local music,
songs, dances, and folk tales.<p>
<p>
      Staffing for the programme is provided by "volunteers", who receive a
small stipend. These young men are chosen by the community to work in the
pre-school. They generally have an elementary school education. They receive
two months of pre-service training and on-going supervisory support from
Ministry of Education personnel. On a rotating basis, mothers come to the
centers to cook a noon-time meal.    <p>
<p>
       While the original purpose of the centres was to provide nutrition
education, at this point in time they serve primarily as educationally focused
pre-schools. (However, they were used as a base of operation for a national
immunization campaign.) This is probably due to the fact that funding for the
programme comes from the Ministry of Education.  UNICEF has been involved in
the provision of training and vehicles which allowed the programme to be
developed in remote areas.  CARITAS has provided the nutritional
supplementation.<p>
<p>
     Because of the success of the program in the altiplano region, it has been
disseminated to other parts of Peru as well.  Beginning in 1980, the <p>
Ministry of Education modified the programme and extended it to other regions
in Peru, including metropolitan Lima, Cuzco, Apurimac, San Martin, and Huarez,
spreading the network of non-formal pre-school education programmes. <p>
<p>
     Currently within Peru there is a system of formal education and systems of
non-formal education which are being implemented to serve the needs of a range
of pre-school aged children.  Both the systems receive support from the
Ministry of Education, and fall within its mandate for supervision and support.
   <p>
<p>
     Within Haiti there are also two major systems of provision--the formal and
the non-formal.  While the formal system is supported by the Ministry of
Education, the non-formal system is under the mandate of the Ministry of Social
Affairs, and is called <u>Timoun Byen Vini</u> (Welcome Little One). It is a
UNICEF supported community-based programme. In October, l984 there were 140 of
these programmes operating in 47 locations, serving about 6,000 children. The
programme is managed by the Center for Special Education, associated with the
Haitian Association of Rehabilitation of the Handicaped. The focus is on
reaching children at risk of developmental problems--estimated to be 75% of the
age group.<p>
<p>
     <u>Timoun Byen Vini</u> integrated care programmes are implemented at the
request of community organizations which must make a commitment to maintain the
programme once it is begun.  They must provide a place for the group to meet,
obtain health services for the programme, and identify a source of food for the
feeding part of the programme. Staff from the Ministry of Social Affairs work
with the community to help them obtain these services.      <p>
<p>
     Teachers in this programme are <u>monitors</u>, assisted by mothers, on a
rotating basis.  Monitors have generally completed primary school.  Their
training occurs over an 18 month period of time-- three weeks of initital
training, followed by two weeks of training six months later and another two
weeks of training one year later.<p>
<p>
     The programme is designed to serve two different groups of children: those
between three months and three years, and those between three and five years of
age. Communities generally develop a programme for the older group first.  When
additional resources are available, a programme is developed for the younger
age group.  Curriculum is based on an adaptation of the Portage Model.  A
checklist, based on developmental milestones, has been developed to monitor
progress.  The children attend the centre for three and a half hours a day,
five days a week.  In addition, there is a strong emphasis on working with
parents so that they can provide appropriate activities for their children in
the home.  Mothers have a copy of the checklist so that they can follow the
child's progress.  The Monitor works with the mother, suggesting <p>
activities that she can do with the child and encouraging her to do so.  <p>
<p>
     In sum, the examples presented in this sub-category illustrate ways in
which centre-based programmes have been developed specifically in order to
provide integrated care to the young child.  Integrated programmes are designed
to include health, nutrition, and education services.  The emphasis given to
the different components depends, to a large extent, on the sponsoring agency.
In the next sub-category are early childhood care and education programmes that
have been implemented in conjunction with services being provided for adults or as an entry point
into the community in order to
develop a range of community based services.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>E. In adult or community development centres.</b><p>
<p>
     In this sub-category are early childhood care and education programmes
that are provided in centres where the primary goal is to provide a service to
adults or the community at large. The ECCE programme has either evolved as an
adjunct to services being provided, or it is created to serve as a base for the
future development of a range of community services. What is true in both
instances is that at some point in time, the population being served has
expressed a need for an ECCE programme.  The examples to be described in this
section have been developed by different sectors--public and private.  Included
is a description of a health sector programme developed in Malaysia; an ECCE
initiative developed in conjunction with a nutrition programme in Indonesia;
women and development efforts in Iraq and Brasil; a community development
effort in Bolivia; and church-sponsored ECCE programmes in Swaziland.<p>
          <p>
          1. <u>Within the health sector</u>. An innovative programme, the
<u>Sang Kancil</u> proejct, has been developed within the squatter settlements
of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  The project was begun in 1978 by the health sector
in an attempt to meet the health needs of those living in urban squatter
settlements.     <p>
<p>
     Squatter settlements are a growing phenomenon in the developing world.
"The current estimate of the population in slums, squatters and shanty towns in
developing countries is 50% of the total urban population." (Yusof, 1984, p.7)
At the policy level there is difficulty in providing services for squatters.
Urban squatters occupy the land illegally. Therefore they are not entitled to
city services--water, sewage, medical care, education, etc. On the other hand,
many squatter settlements are stable communities, including people from a
variety of income levels.  Even those who have the finances to leave the area
often stay. There are a variety of reasons for this: affordable housing may not
be available outside the settlements; families may have a well developed
support system within the settlement that would be lost to them if they moved
elsewhere, and/or individuals may have acquired a leadership position within
the settlements that they could not obtain in other parts of <p>
the city. <p>
     It is widely recognized that the environmemt within squatter settlements
is threatening to people's health--physically, mentally and in terms of
psycho-social development.  Thus, strategies are being sought to meet the needs
of squatter populations--strategies which recognize, value, and build upon the
complex social systems which exist in the settlements. Developers of the
<u>Sang Kancil</u> project were able to do this.      <p>
<p>
     The project was begun by health sector personnel interested in
establishing primary health care centres within <u>kampungs</u>, or districts,
in the settlements.  Meetings were held with community members to determine
their needs and priorities.  They were most interested in having a child care
system for young children, and for creating income generating activities for
women.  Health care was not seen as a priority.  Those involved in developing
the project listened to the community.  Rather than building a health centre,
they 
established a pre-school and an income generating project.  When these were
well established, then it was possible to introduce primary health care, which
is now widely accepted.  One person involved in the project summarizes the
experience as follows:<p>
<pre>
          Listening to the community is an important step...It
          has the advantage of providing information quickly on
          areas of concern...it also has the role of validating
          information received from more formal sources...The
          development of <u>Sang Kancil</u> has illustrated clearly
          (that) the initial thrust of the programme to introduce
          MCH had to be changed...Entry was channeled through the
          preschool system and income generating activities.
                                             Yusof, 1984, p.26
</pre>
     The <u>Sang Kancil</u> model now consists of three components--maternal
and child health clinics, a pre-school programme, and income generating
activities which have become self-supporting.  The project began as an action
research effort at 3 sites. It is now a national programme model and is being
implemented in 13 settlements.<p>
<p>
     The Malaysian example illustrates the way in which a part of the national
health sector has been able to meet their own goals by establishing an ECCE
programme.  There are also examples of international health organizations that
have begun to meet their own goals by implementing early childhood care and
education programmes. In Mauritius, for example, the Family Planning
Association (FPA) of Mauritius recognized that many women needed child care.
The existing programmes were too expensive for women with low incomes. So, the
FPA created a day care centre next door to their own facilities.  The
centreprovides care for 40 children from 3-5.  When mothers bring their
children to the centre they are encouraged to participate in meetings held at
the family planning clinic. There are weekly lectures on child health and
family planning.  In addition, home visits can be arranged to accomodate the
schedule of working mothers.<p>
<p>
     The centre also provides on-the-job training for young women interested in
working in early childhood programmes.  After the young women have participated
in the training programme for two years they can establish their own child care
centre.   The City Council of Port-Louis is interested in the ECCE model as
developed by the Family Planning Association and has expressed an interest in
establishing similar programmes in other parts of the city. The Mauritius
Women's Self-Help Association has plans to set up similar centres in other
towns.  Thus, in response to the needs of women in the community, a service was
created by the Family Planning Association.  As women brought their children to
the centre they began to take part in other FPA actvities. In this way the
goals of the FPA are being realised.<p>
<p>
     Another example comes from the International Red Cross.  The Swaziland Red
Cross Society created 8 regional primary health care centres in 1980. Early
childhood care and education programmes are a part of these centres. An ECCE
programmes has been included for a variety of reasons: a. it was recognized
that multiple purpose centres are more cost-effective; b. there was a demand
for quality care from working women; c. there was an awareness that within
Swaziland it is important for children to have a pre- school experience if they
hope to enter first grade; and d. having an ECCE programme in the <p>
health centre assures that children's health can be monitored, immunizations
can be kept up to date, nutritional supplementation can be provided, children
can be taught good health habits, and there is the possibility of identifying
developmental problems. (Evans, 1983, p.20)<p>
<p>
     The Red Cross is working closely with the Ministry of Health to develop
appropriate materials to be used in the centres.  They are also working closely
with the Ministry of Education.  Their policy is to have multiple donor
collaboration in building and equipping the centres.  The Red Cross will match
funds provided by other agencies, ministries and organizations. For example,
when one of the centres was built, the U.S. embassy provided funding for the
construction of the building, the Ministry of Education provided technical
assistance in the design of the building, the Red Cross contributed funds for
equipping the facility, and the commmunity actually built the structure.
       <p>
<p>
          2. <u>In conjunction with nutrition programmes</u>. In addition to
the development of early childhood care and education programmes in connection
with health programmes, there has also been an attempt to integrate ECCE
activities into nutrition programmes.  An interesting example comes from
Indonesia. In the early 1970s a nutrition project was initiated, the Applied
Nutrition Program (ANP), designed to produce more protein foods and to increase
children's protein intake.  The programme was evaluated in 1973 (Sayogyo,
1975). From the evaluation it was evident that protein supplementation would
not solve the problem.  There was a recognition of the relationship between
malnutrition and poverty. Thus in the next five year plan (l974-l979), known as
the REPELITA II, there was a social marketing emphasis. An attempt was made to
make people aware of the problem of malnutrition--its causes and effects--and
an effort to get all sectors involved in addressing the issues.  A variety of
approaches were tried. The programme which finally evolved is known as the
National Family Nutrition Programme, which, during REPELITA III (1979-1984),
was expected to be implemented in 40,000 of the 65,000 villages in Indonesia
(Rohde &amp; Hendrata, 1982, p.212).<p>
<p>
     It is within the context of this nationally implemented nutrition
programme that the <u>Bina Keuarga and Balita</u> (BKB) project was
implemented. Begun in 1982, the BKB project is an attempt to add an early
childhood education component to the existing structure of services to
families. The focus of the BKB project is on parent education.  The purpose of
the project is to "enhance the knowledge, awareness and skills of mothers of
children under five and other members of the family so as to enable them to
provide [a] conducive educational environment to ensure the comprehensive
development of children under five." (Stein, 1985, p.1).  Field workers--women
from the community being served--are provided with training in child
development and adult education.  They then provide workshops for mothers at
the nutrition centres.  In the workshops mothers receive child development
information, their role as primary eduators of the child is emphasized, and
they are provided with easy activities that they can do with their children at
home.  In addition, a toy library has been established.  Mothers can take toys
home with them and use them with their chidlren.  When they return the toys the
following week, they can take out something else.  Local toys have been created
which are adaptations of the toys modelled by CINDE, the Latin American group
which developed the programme being implemented in the BKB project. <p>
     <p>
<p>
     The BKB project was initiated by the office of the Associate Ministry for
the Role of Women.  As the programme was developed a number of sectors were
involved--Women's Development, Education, Health, Socio-cultural Development,
and Welfare.  Although ultimate responsibility for the programme has remained
within the office of the Associate Minister for the Role of Women, as the
programme has been implemented on a wider scale, the leading sector has shifted
from year to year. For 1983-1984 it was under the Directorate General for Rural
Development, and for 1984-1985 the Directorate General for Non-Formal
Education, Youth and Sports took the lead. Currently the National Family
Planning Co- ordinating Board has the responsibility for wider implementation
of the programme. <p>
<p>
     To assure that the programme will continue to have inter-sectoral support,
working groups at the central and provincial level are being created which
include as many sectors as possible.  In an evaluation of the project a list
was provided of the potential departments and programmes with which the BKB
programmme could be integrated.  It included: Home Affairs, Health,
Agriculture, Social Affairs, Education and Culture, Religion, Information,
Ministry Coordinator for People's Welfare, Industry, Justice, Manpower and
Transmigration...and the list goes on. (UNICEF Board Report, 1985, II. p.1-3)
<p>
<p>
     In essence, the BKB project is an example of how early childhood care and
education efforts can be added on to existing organizational structures, taking
advantage of systems already in place, while adding an important  component in
support of children's overall development. It is also an example of a programme
which relies on and receives multi-sectoral support for its continuation.<p>
<p>
<p>
               3. <u>Within women in development  programmes.</u>  During the
last 20 years there has been an increased recogntion of women's role in
development, and efforts have been made to support women's greater involvement
in the wage economy.  Support for women's development has come from national
governments and the international community. On the national level policy has
been created in many countries which focuses on involving the total population
in development. Examples of this come from Kenya and Tanzania, where, after
independence, there was an emphasis on community self-help. All people were
encouraged to work together to promote the country's development. In other
instances policy changes have come about as the result of the changing
structure of manpower within the country.  For example, in Iraq, where the
country is at war, there is a need for women to enter the work force and take
the place of men who are at the front. Thus women are being given new training
opportunities, and there are expectations that they will be involved in overall
development efforts.  <p>
<p>
     Within the international community, the UN Decade for Women, begun in
1975, provided the impetus for a number of government and international donor
agency sponsored projects whose explicit focus was on increasing women's
opportunities for development. The conference in Kenya, celebrating the end of
the first Women in Development decade, 1975-1985, set some new programme
directions, building upon what was learned in the first decade.<p>
<p>
     Some of the projects designed to promote women's development have been
successful; others have not met intended goals.  By and large, those that have
met with the most success are those that have provided women with the supports
they have needed to take on new roles.  The primary support required is a
recognition of the fact that even though women are being given new
opportunities, their traditional responsibilities remain intact--those related
to the household and child care.  In order for women to fully participate in
development, quality child care must be available.<p>
<p>
     In most instances those developing the programmes have not recognized the
importance of developing a care situation for the child. More commonly, women
themselves have realised their need and created their own programmes. The
Malata Market Place programme in Ghana, described earlier, is an example. The
child care centre developed in relation to women's agricultural work in
Senegal, also described earlier, is yet another example. Both the Ghana and the
Senegal initiatives were developed by women in a given community, to meet their
own needs.  <p>
<p>
     Efforts have been made to create child care centres on a national level as
well. An example is the system of training and provision being developed in
Iraq. There have been two major thrusts to the development of child care in
Iraq. Since the mid 1970s there has been a government policy to increase
women's participation in development. More recently, since the war with Iran,
there has been a need for more women to enter formal employment because men are
involved in military activities.  There are two major organizations responsible
for the development of child care which will allow women to work outside the
home: the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs and the General Federation of
Iraqi Women (GWIF)--each of whom operate about half of the 162currently
registered child care centres. (Evans, 1984, p.3) At this point in time the
Ministry and the GFIW are seeking ways to integrate their systems of child care
and to develop lower cost alternatives that will make child care available to a
larger percentage of the eligible children.     <p>
<p>
     Another example of early childhood care and education programmes developed
in relation to women and development programmes and centres comes from Brasil.
In 1979 the <u>Centro de Estudos Supletivos de Narandiba</u> (CESUN) was
established to provide nonformal education and vocational training to
low-income peoples. One of the group's activities has been the development of
women's programmes. As CESUN began to plan programmes, a problem arose.<p>
<pre>
          One of CESUN's original ideas was to provide vocational
          training to the women in non-traditional areas, such as
          plumbing or electricity. Although the women expressed
          interest in such training, they asked what they would
          do with their children while they attended sessions.
                                         Rocha et al., 1983, p.10
</pre>
Following a series of discussions it was determined that CESUN should not only
establish a child care centre, but it should also develop a caregivers training
course to provide staff for the centre and to provide trained staff to other
child care centres that were being developed in the community. Thus, one of the
vocational training courses offered through CESUN is Caretaking. Within the 160
hour training course women are taught child development, nutrition, health and
first aid, and techniques for helping children learn.  They also discuss the
economic and social context of women's work, legislation relating to labour and
women's rights, the relationship of women's economic activity to family
planning, and community relations. (Rocha, et.al., 1983, p. 7-8).  Thus, in
addition to meeting the immediate needs of women who wanted to <p>
participate in training, a course was developed that provided women with
marketable skills and knowledge. Not incidentally, what they learned in the
course also helped them in their own parenting role.<p>
<p>
<p>
          4. <u>As a part of community development efforts</u>. There are a
range of international donor agencies that have been involved in community
development efforts.  The general design of such projects is to work with the
community to identify needs, and then to create a range of services to meet
these needs. In a variety of instances the community defines early childhood
care and education programmes as a priority. As a result, ECCE programmes are
created, either in support of existing services, or as an entry point into the
community and a base from which other community development activities can
evolve.<p>
<p>
     An example of an ECCE programme which is part of an overall community
development effort is the <u>Centro Socio-Educativo Los Andes</u> in Oruru,
Bolivia.  Oruro is located in an area of Bolivia which suffers from extreme
poverty.  The Christian Children's Fund (CCF), a child sponsorship
organization, has been working in the community to improve the life situation
of young children.  The focus of the effort in this particular community is on
improving the health and general development of children under 6 years of age.
Rather than providing financial subsidies to individual families, CCF decided
to take a part of each family's subsidy and to create a community service
centre. When the programme began adult education courses were offered and
medical and dental services were provided. Child care was provided in the
centre for the children of adults attending the courses.     <p>
<p>
     Over time the child care component became of increasing interest to the
community.  They wanted to establish a pre-school for those between the ages of
3 and 6.  When it began, the pre-school served 20 children full-time, five days
a week.  However, this provided an important service to only a small percentage
of the children who could potentially benefit from the programme.  So, after
much discussion, the format for the pre-school was changed so that 240 children
could be served in a year.  In groups of 30, children attend either the A.M. or
P.M. sessions offered Monday- Wednesday or Tuesday-Saturday. Thus 120 children
participate each week. These children attend the pre-school for 6 months.  An
additional 120 children attend in the next six months.  In this way far more
children are served.<p>
<p>
     Now there is also a home visiting programme as a part of the centre's
activities. Essentially the home visitor, a trained community volunteer, is
responsible for monitoring the family's use of the services offered through the
centre.  When a child is accepted for sponsorship by CCF, an initial home visit
is made, during which the home visitor explains the sponsorship and what
services the child and family can receive through the programme.  Based on the
family's needs, the home visitor makes recommendations regarding their
participation.   In addition, the home visitor makes bi-monthly visits to the
families of 0-3 year olds to check and advise on health, nutrition, and child
development. She also follows up family participation at the centre.
(Schaefer, et al, 1984, p.16).<p>
<p>
     The programme is newly begun.  However, the funding and technical
assistance--provided through a USAID grant--which supported programme
development, will end in fall, 1985.  CCF will continue to provide funds for <p>
the operation of the community center through its child sponsorship programme.
In addition,  CCF is looking at the Oruro project as a model programme for
enhancing the overall provision of child care within other centres world-wide
which are operated with CCF funds. Thus, one of the products of the technical
assistance process provided in the Oruro project will be a manual providing
guidance to others wishing to create similar projects.<p>
 <p>
<p>
          5. <u>Religiously affiliated ECCE programmes</u>.  Religious groups
concerned with providing a service within their community will either create
their own ECCE programme, or allow someone to operate a programme within their
facility. Generally the curriculum for the programme includes religious
material. If the day care is the only one available in an area, parents will
enroll their children, even if they are of a different religion.  In instances
where there is a strong social service or conversion thrust to the work of the
denomination, ECCE programmes are seen as a way of reaching the community.<p>
<p>
     A good example of this comes from Swaziland--a small country in southern
Africa, where there are a number of protestant and catholic groups which have
established systems of early childhood care and education.  The Baptists have
developed a demonstration centre with seven classrooms and a training facility
where they train approximately 30 teachers a year.  People coming to the
training are sponsored by the Ministry of Education, private industry, and
other private agencies.  The Baptist training facility is the only in-country
training available.  The training and child curriculum are based on religious
teachings.  Because they have already developed their own training, the Baptist
Church is in a strong position to influence the develoment of a national
curriculum for both teachers and young children.  However, there are other
denominations which have begun to develop their own programme.<p>
<p>
     The Lutheran Mission is in the process of establishing a training centre
as an alternative to the Baptist training. The Lutherans have created a
demonstration classroom as a part of an evolving multi- purpose facility. The
Bahai faith is another dominant force in early childhood in Swaziland.
Although they have more recently begun to create pre-schools, the national
committee appears to be committed to the development of a pre-school programme
for Swaziland.  The Catholic Church has also developed several pre- schools.
At this point their teachers are sent to Kenya for training or they are being
trained through Montessori correspondence courses. Clearly a number of costly
facilities and programmes are being created. What is needed are national,
rather than denomination, guidelines for the development of early childhood
care and education programmes in the country. (Evans, 1983).     <p>
<p>
     Another example of religious-affilated early childhood care and education
sponsorship is the YWCA in the South Pacific.  For the past twenty years the
YWCA has been supporting the development of ECCE programmes (for children ages
2 to 6) throughout the Pacific Islands.  The curriculum reflects adaptations of
Western, traditional, half-day pre-school programmes, with an emphasis on
Christian teachings. The Pacific Pre-School Council, a membership organization
with representation from all the Pacific islands, receives its primary support
from the YWCA. Periodically workshops are held so that those involved in ECCE
programmes can share their experiences and learn from one another.  Such a
workshop was held in 1980, sponsored by the YWCA South Pacific Area.  Other
public and private groups were also involved, yet the religious influence of
the pre-schools is evident in reports of current activities.  It is also <p>
evident in a summary of the workshop where the organizer commented:<p>
<pre>
          I believe that the outcome of this Workshop has 
          really been to lay a solid foundation for Pre-
          school work in the Pacific. The spiritual life
          of the Workshop was enriched by sharing in
          morning devotions.
                                  Goodwillie, 1980, p.iii
</pre>
     The denominational beginnings of the early childhood care and education
movement in any country can exert a lasting influence on the development of
regional or national curricula--for the children and for teacher training. This
must be taken into consideration when attempts are made to collaborate with
these groups in order to include other curriculum components into the ECCE
system.<p>
<p>
<p>
     Within this chapter a typology of early childhood care and education
programmes has been presented.  The typology is based on the <u>setting</u>
within which the ECCE programme is established.  However, within the
<u>setting</u> typology it quickly becomes evident that <u>sponsorship</u> and
<u>programme characteristics</u> are equally, if not more, important in the
development of a strategy for the implementation of a wider range of health
care components into existing systems.  Thus, in the next chapter an attempt is
made to map out the implications of the typology.

<b>VI. THE POTENTIAL FOR DELIVERY OF PHC/MCH COMPONENTS THROUGH
EARLY
CHILDHOOD</b><p>
<b>CARE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMMES; RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
ACTION</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     This section begins with a brief description of the maternal and child
health care components of primary health care that could be delivered through
early childhood care and education programmes.  This is followed by a
discussion of the relative ease with which the various components could be
provided, based on the <u>setting</u> of the ECCE programme.  The section ends
with a set of recommendations for action, based on an assessment of the
potential for actually being able to work within the <u>settings</u>, taking
into consideration <u>sponsorship</u> and <u>programme characteristics</u>.
The recommendations are offered as alternative courses of action.  They are
provided to promote discussion within the WHO.  The specific actions undertaken
will need to be derived from those discussions.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>A. Health care components.</b><p>
<p>
     There are two different issues related to the delivery of MCH care.  One
has to do with making technologies--techniques, equipment, actions and
activities--available to all people.  For example, it is possible to prevent a
number of debilitating diseases through immunization.  A relatively simple
action gives people the protection they need.  Another set of actions is
associated with the treatment of diarrhea--Oral Rehydration Therapy.  The
action, in this case, provides a cure to an immediate problem.  It does not
address what caused the problem.  One of the ways to make the technologies
available to people is through social marketing.  Campaigns with slogans and
simple, appropriate presentations of information are designed to capture
people's attention.  They are made aware of an action they can take to solve a
problem.  Many social marketing strategies are highly effective.  Yet they deal
with only one aspect of health care.<p>
<p>
     At quite a diferent level, the issue in health care provision is how to
change attitudes and alter people's decision-making patterns that are related
to the cause of the problem and/or provide a long- term solution.  Here the
concern is to help people understand how their behavior affects health
outcomes.  The focus is on prevention of problems. For example, birth outcomes
is a concern in many parts of the world.  How do you help women understand the
impact of their eating habits on a child's growth and development? Another
issue is the high rate of malnutrition and infectious disease among infants and
young children which come about as a result of poor feeding patterns.
Breastfeeding is one solution. How do you best promote the idea of
breastfeeding?  What is there within the culture that affects attitudes and
practices related to breastfeeding?  Another issue to address has to do with <p>
cognitive and psycho-social development.  Few children receive from the
environment the stimulation needed for optimal development.  How do you work
with parents to help them understand the importance and value of time and
energy given to creating opportunities for children's learning?<p>
<p>
     In essence, the technologies associated with behavioural and attitudinal
change are much less well developed.  The challenge in attempting to deliver
health care components through early childhood care and education programmes is
to determine which <u>actions/activities</u> can be provided and which
<u>attitudes and decision-making processes</u> can be affected.  In briefly
describing the health care components, an attempt will be made to differentiate
between the two.<p>
<p>
     In considering the MCH care components that can be delivered in ECCE
programmes it is necessary to differentiate what might be offered to two
different age groups--children from birth to under three years of age, and
children from 3-6 years old.  Often these age groups are served in different
contexts, and different emphases are given to the various health care
components.  For example, nutrition is often a focus of programmes for children
under three. With children between the ages of 3 and 6, more emphasis is given
to the development of good health habits.  In both instances there are
opportunities for cognitive and psycho-social stimulation.<p>
<p>
     It is also necessary to differentiate between the health care components
that can be delivered by ECCE personnel, and those that require the skills and
knowledge of health care personnel.  Personnel within ECCE programmes can be
trained to provide a range of health care components, particularly those
associated with prevention. In other instances, however, someone from the
health sector needs to be available to provide the services.  Given these
considerations, the health care components that could be provided within ECCE
programmes consist of:<p>
<p>
          1. Custodial care that would assure the basic <u>safety and
well-being</u> of the child.  In the most basic care situation, the child
should be provided with shelter and be free from physical danger.  This is not
always the case when the programmes are offered in inadequate facilities.<p>
<p>
          2. In most ECCE efforts, basic <u>monitoring of growth and
development</u> could occur.  Monitoring would consist of periodically
measuring children's weight and height, and recording the information on growth
charts developed in relation to national reference values. Growth monitoring
would give providers some "bottom line" information on the child's general
level of development.  It is an action that can lead to behavior change only if
those doing the monitoring are able to interpret the information it provides.
Currently the WHO is developing a prototype of children's growth and
psychosocial development record which will incorporate culture-appropriate
indicators (milestones/landmarks) of development which can be used by primary
health care workers (PHWs).  The study is also investigating the factors which
promote optimal growth and development and also factors of risk.  The training
of ECCE providers and PHCWs on these issues will lead to a better understanding
of and stimulate action with reference to growth and development.<p>
<p>
          3. Within the context of some ECCE programmes more sophisticated
<u>screening</u> could take place that would allow for the <u>early
identification of specfic problems in growth and development</u>, including
such things as mental <p>
retardation, loss of hearing, speech problems, vision problems, developmental
delays, and learning disabilities.  In general, ECCE providers can refer
someone for testing, but the detailed screening would be provided by PHCWs and
health care personnel at first or second level referrals.<p>
<p>
          4. In collaboration with the health sector, <u>immunization
programmes</u> could be established with ECCE providers working with PHCWs,
health care personnel and parents to assure timely immunization of children and
pregnant women.<p>
<p>
          5. The nutritional status of children could be <u>assessed</u> either
ECC providers or health care personnel. Nutritional <u>supplementation</u>
could be provided by ECCE personnel to the child who is mildly or moderately
malnourished. For there to be a real chanage in the child's nutritional status,
however, parent education must also be a part of the ECCE effort.<p>
<p>
          6. <u>Basic health care</u> needs could be met within the context of
the ECCE programme--sanitation, personal hygiene, etc.  In addition, education
of the young child (particularly in the 3-6 year old group) could occur which
would help create good health habits.  Some of these habits might well be
brought into the home by the child.<p>
<p>
          7.  Some level of <u>physical, cognitive and psycho-social
stimulation</u>  could be provided for the child in  all ECCE settings.  Within
this area there are no simple technologies or actions.  To provide adequate
stimulation, the person working with the child has to have basic knowledge of
child growth and psychosocial development.<p>
<p>
     In addition to being able to provide direct delivery of health care
actions and activities to young children, it would be possible to deliver a
number of services to women of childbearing age and other community members
through the ECCE programme.  The specific services that could be provided
within the ECCE setting include: 1. <u>family planning</u>; 2. <u>nutritional
assessment of women and nutritional supplementation</u> for pregnant and
lactating women who are malnourished or anaemic; 3. <u>Tetanus immunization</u>
for pregnant women, in collaboration with health care personnel; 4. information
on and support for <u>breastfeeding</u>; and 5. <u>education</u> on health,
nutrition, and children's growth and development.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>B. The ease of delivering the MCH components of PHC in the range of ECCE
settings.</b><p>
<p>
     Using the <u>setting</u> typology, it is possible to do a mapping of the
relative ease of introducing the different health components into the various
settings.  A mapping is presented in Table 1.  A rating of "low","medium" or
"high" has been made for each health care component, in each setting category.
A rating of "low" indicates that it is highly unlikely that the health care
component could be delivered in that setting; "medium" indicates that, with the
proper supports, the health care component could be introduced, and "high" means that
there is a good probability that the health care component could be
successfully delivered.  The ratings are based on what is known about the
setting itself and the characteristics of programmes generally found in those
settings.  (Obviously there is room for a great deal of discussion around these
ratings.)<p>
<p>
<b>C. Recommendations for action.</b><p>
<p>
     If some agreement can be reached about the relative ease of delivering the
various health care components through ECCE programmes, the next question
becomes, what would it take to make it happen--in terms of training, materials
and on going support?  What is the cost?  Obviously the cost of developing an
appropriate intervention for each setting would be prohibitive.  Thus, given an
assessment of the likelihood of successfully introducing the MCH components of
PHC in a given setting, and the costs associated with each strategy, a decision
can be made about priorities for investment.  Recommendations about the
investment of resources in creating strategies for delivery of PHC/MCH
components is done by <u>setting</u>.<p>
<p>
          1. <u>In the home</u>.  This setting includes three different types
of programmes.  First, there are home visiting programmes where providers work
on a one-to-one basis with the parent, giving her child development information
and suggesting activities that can be done with the child to promote the
child's develoment.  Even though these programmes are targeted to work with
those most in need of services, they do not reach many families.  Thus, <u>it
is recommended that resources not be invested in developing materials and/or
training for home visiting programmes</u>.<p>
<p>
     The second type of "in the home" programmes are the parent education
efforts where parent groups are created and meet on a regular basis over a
given period of time.  In the group meetings parents are given information on a
range of topics related to early childhood care and education.  They are
expected to take the information given and apply it in their homes.  The
curriculum for the parent education courses vary, depending on who sponsors the
course.  Courses are offered by a variety of sectors-- education, health,
welfare, community development.  Thus, there are many groups that could be
worked with to introduce and/or upgrade current coverage of primary and
maternal and child health issues.  <u>It is recommended that the possibility be
explored of developing a set of materials that could be delivered through
parent education courses--either creating a complete course of its own, or by
developing materials that could supplement current efforts.</u>.<p>
<p>
     The third "in the home" set of programmes are represented by the CHILD-to
child initiatives.  These are based on primary health care concerns, and are
well developed.  However, <u>it is recommended that the current training and
support materials used in the CHILD- to-child programmes be reviewed with an
eye to whether or not they include support for cognitive stimulation and
psycho-social activities</u>.<p>
<p>
          2. <u>In the neighborhood</u>.  The programmes in this category
(known asfamily day care or child minding), can be divided into two
groups--those that fall within the non-formal and those that are included in
the formal systems of provision.  The former are characterized by providers who
have developed a programme on their own initiative.  The latter are providers
who are linked to an agency or organization which sponsors provision for young
children through family day care homes.  Those providers who have initiated
their own programme seldom have linkages to a formal network of child care
provision.  Thus, while there are many individual providers, they are hard to
reach.  Therefore, <u>it is recommended that family day care providers who are
part of the non-formal system not be a priority for action</u>.<p>
     <p>
     A diffferent recommendation is being made in terms of working with the
formal system of family day care provision.  There are an increasing number of
systems of family day care provision-- generally operated by welfare and/or
community development groups.  Family day care provides a low-cost alternative
to the building of expensive ECCE facilities, and is a model of provision that
is becoming an attractive alternative to centre- based ECCE programmes. <u>It
is recommended that resources be invested in creating materials and/or training
packages for family day care providers who are part of a system of ECCE
provision</u>.  These materials can then be made available to providers from
the non-formal system who wish to use them.<p>
<p>
          3. <u>In the workplace.</u> Once again, a distinction needs to be
made between the formal and non-formal systems.  The formal system is
represented by employer-sponsored ECCE programmes.  These programmes are
frequently mandated to provide child care for children of employees.  The
mandate comes from national policy, and is further defined through related
legislation.  In many developed countries, particularly in Eastern Europe,
employer- sponsored day care is pervasive.  At this point in time, outside of a
few countries, employer-sponsored child care is not a moving force in ECCE
provision in developing countries.  However, because these ECCE programmes can
develop into large systems of care, <u>it is recommended that there be
involvement in working closely with national governments who are developing
policy and ligislation in support of employer-sponsored child care, to develop
appropriate training and materials for use in that context</u>.<p>
<p>
     Further, <u>it is being recommended that the difficulty of becoming
involved with the non-formal work sector be recognized, and work be done with
indigenous groups interested in developing ECCE systems</u>. Many of the
programmes that characterize the non-formal work sector--the market place and
agricultural settings--tend to be unique to the geographic region and the
specific needs of a relatively small group of women.  While market place women
all around the world need child care, these women are not linked together in
any way that would support promotion of ECCE programmes in the marketplace.
Thus, rather than focusing efforts on the unique non-formal work setting, it
would be more appropriate to work with nationally organized indigenous groups
which provide linkages within a country and/or regions of the world.<p>
          4. <u>In children's centers</u>. The programmes within this category
are all centre-based ECCE efforts which are found in facilities developed,
built, or refurbished specifically to meet the needs of young children. There
are three major sub categories: the "open-air" programmes; the programmes that
operate in primary schools; and integral care services designed to meet the
child's multiple needs.<p>
<p>
     The open-air category consists of programmes which rely primarily on
community support for their existence.  Some of the programmes have been
developed with support from public and private organizations from outside the
community, but, in general, these programmes are based upon community
initiative.  What that means is that they are not adequately supported in any
way.  The facilities, if they exist at all, are make-shift and sometimes
unsafe.  Staffing generally consists of community para- professionals who may
or may not receive any training.  In addition, they either provide their time
to the programme on a voluntary basis, or they are paid a small stipend derived
from school fees.  Materials are non-existent.  These programmes lack 
the resources necessary to develop a curriculum and could not afford to pay for
the training and materials which would give them the skills and knowledge
necessary to promote health care activities. <p>
<p>
     Despite these contraints, there is a need to deliver or assist in
delivering MCH care services within these ECCE settings. First of all, the
open-air, non-formal ECCE programmes represent the fastest growing category of
programmes.  Second, these programmes are being created in places not currently
served by either formal ECCE provision or health care centers.  Thus, they are
reaching those most in need. Third, the community has made a commitment to
these programmes.  They utilize the resources available to them to implement
and maintain the programme. This commitment can be built upon for the
development of health care services, as evidenced by the Malaysia experience.
Fourth, the door is open for multi-sectoral involvement in these programmes.
For most of the programmes there is no formalized curriculum that would have to
be adapted, although informally the programme may be linked to education,
health and welfare. There is an opportunity to create a comprehensive
programme. The drawback is that open air programmes are the responsibility of
different sectors in different countries.  Thus a variety of strategies will
have to be developed to work with these programmes.  In sum, <u>it is
recommended that investment be made in supporting the development of
community-based ECCE efforts and strategies be developed for working with
different sectors to promote and/or up-grade community-based ECCE
programmes</u>.<p>
<p>
     The next sub-category of center-based programmes is represented by those
found in primary schools.  In this instance the programmes are sponsored almost
exclusively by the education sector and operate as a part of the formal school
system. In all probability it would be difficult to work with these programmes.
The curriculum has been set. While it is more than likely that it includes a
health education component, it is unlikely that the systems would be open to
the delivery of a range of health care services.  <u>It is recommended that
ECCE programes found in primary school settings be given support for the
delivery of health care components only after support for higher priority
settings is provided</u>.<p>
<p>
     The third sub-category, those programmes designed to provide integral care
to young children, is, by and large, already providing a range of health,
nutrition and education services. However, because they are developed under
different sponsors, the emphasis will vary. An appropriate course of action
would be to assess the materials currently being used in these efforts, and to
bring together the most useful materials for dissemination to similar
programmes.  In addition, it would be useful to create a training package that
could be used across sectors and adapted regionally. Thus <u>it recommended
that an analysis of training and support materials for integrated care
programmes be completed to assess their completeness, their ease of use, and
their applicability, with the goal of creating packages that can be
disseminated to the different sectors involved in the development of integral
care settings</u>.<p>
<p>
<p>
          5. <u>In adult/community centres</u>. The sub-categories within this
grouping tend to represent sponsors.  For example, there are programmes
developed and implemented by the health sector.  Obviously these are already
delivering many of the health components.  One area that may be neglected,
however, is the cognitive and psycho-social stimulation needs of young
children. Work could be done to examine current curriculum in health sponsored
ECCE programmes, and the to develop materials and supports for a broader
curriculum in these settings. Likewise, ECCE programmes operating in nutrition
centers may well need the same kind of support to implement the full range of
activities that support the child's total development. Thus, <u>it is
recommended that an assessment of current health and nutrition sponsored ECCE
programmes be made to determine the extent to which they are providing optimal
experiences related to children's multiple needs</u><p>
<p>
     Another sub-category of ECCE programmes are those found in connection with
women and development projects.  In the description of some of the programmes
developed in relation to women's place of work, it was noted that these efforts
may be unique to a given location, given the nature of woman's work in that
setting and the supports that are available to her.  Thus, it may be hard to
reach enough children to justify developing programmes in relation to the
non-formal work sector.  <p>
     However, it may be worth approaching these programmes from a different
angle. There are an increasing number of women and development programmes--many
of which have come to an awareness of the need to develop child care programmes
if women are to avail themselves of training and education opportunities and
secure work in the formal sector. There is a growing network of women and
development programmes.  While many of those in the network will not be
directly involved in creating and operating child care programmes, they may
well be involved in such efforts within their countries.  In addition, these
programmes have an important role to play in terms of maternal and child
health.  They are able to address a number of women's needs; health is a basic
issue. This network should be a part of developing training and materials that
can be used to establish quality child care programmes   Therefore, <u>it is
recommended that work be done with women in development programmes to create
ways of introducing primary and maternal and child health care components into
the range of services they offer</u>. This collaboration should have a
relatively high priority since women's groups are able to reach many
populations currently not being reached by health centres.<p>
<p>
     In programmes which have a community development focus there is likely to
be an awareness of the multiple needs of children and families, and an ability
to develop a range of programmes in response to community needs. What tends to
happen within the community development field, however, is that many involved
in working with a given community do not think that programmes and services
offered in their setting are applicable in other settings.  But, in fact, there
are important principles and guidelines that can be derived from the wealth of
community development experience over the past twenty years.  What is needed is
a systematic examination of the ways in which early childhood care and
education programmes have served the goals of community develoment,
particularly as these efforts relate to the introduction and acceptance of
health components. <u>It is recommended that work be done with community
development experts to derive models that can be applied in other contexts</u>.
It would appear that training and support materials developed for multi-
sectoral early childhood care and education programmes, and for women in
development programmes, would also be applicable in the community development
context.<p>
<p>
<p>
          5. <u>In religious centres</u>.  In the case study section there was
a description of church groups that have been involved in the development of
ECCE programming as a way of providing a service to the community.  In some <p>
instances the efforts have been local; in other cases national programmes have
been developed.  By and large, these religious groups, while representing
internationally operating denominations, have not created a network of early
childhood care and education programmes. For the most part these groups do not
reach large numbers of children, nor do they have the resources to create large
systems of care.  Therefore, <u>it is recommended not to become involved in
working with denominations groups within countries to promote the delivery of
health care through their programmes</u><p>
<p>
     On the other hand, there are several large systems of early childhood care
and education programmes which have been developed by religiously affiliated
organizations.  An example of this is the YWCA and the network of programmes
that they have supported in the South Pacific.  Another set of examples come
from within the community of private voluntary organizations--Catholic Relief
Services, Christian Children's Fund, and many more.  By and large the focus of
these international organizations has been on the development of relief and
survival programmes. However, many of these groups are attempting to examine
the overall impact of their programming and are becoming involved in efforts
that raise the quality of life for everyone in the community.  There is
increased interest in developing programmes for young children that include
cognitive and psycho-social stimulation as well as nutritonal rehabilitation
and supplementation. Thus, <u>it is being recommended that work be done with
private voluntary agencies in support of this expansion of their services, and
that the support of these groups be sought in the development of appropriate
training and materials to bring health to all</u>.<p>
<p>
<p>
     In sum, there are a variety of strategies that can be developed to extend
the MCH components of PHC through early childhood care and education
programmes. The strategies to be developed rely on an understanding of the
context within which ECCE programmes currently operate, and an assessment of
the potential of these programmes to deliver health care components. This paper
has provided information on the context of ECCE programmes, the sponsors, and
the day-to-day experience for children and families being served by the
programme. The typologies presented provide a framework within which strategies
can be developed. In this concluding section an assessment has been made of the
probability of meeting world health goals by working within a range of settings
with different public and private agencies and organizations.  Further, a
series of recommendations for action were made. These are not meant as policy.
They have been developed as a point of departure for debate and discussion,
with the expectation that, as a result of the process, appropriate actions will
be undertaken. <p>

<center><b>Abstract</b></center><p>
<p>
The impact of a series of interactive video nutrition education programs, along with the provision of a food supplement, was studied in Northeastern villages in Thailand. One of the 5 modules (VTR-4) was particularly child development oriented, aimed at creating maternal awareness of her child as an individual with early perceptual ability, and at recognizing the importance of mother-child interaction, play and supplementary feeding. The total audienceof the VTR-4 were 478 men, 930 women, and 3225 school children.
Village mothers of under-two aged children were interviewed individually prior to the introduction of the media and at 2, 10, and 14 months later when the VTR-4 had been shown 3, 4, and 7 times respectively in each village.<p>
Nutritional status of the children, and maternal knowledge and attitudes toward
childrearing were assessed. Some aspects of practice were observed during home
visits. A significant improvement was found in maternal awareness
of infants' perceptual abilities, in knowledge and attitudes toward
breastfeeding, in child play and play materials, and in supplementary feeding
practices, especially a more positive approach to dealing with tongue
thrusting. Random observation during home visits revealed some change in
accordance with exposure to the media, i.e. mother-child interaction, existing
play materials and the type of cradle used. A significant difference was also
noted in the percentage of mothers intending to give their baby colostrum, in
comparison to the control group at post-tests 2 and 3. Although the prevalence
of malnutrition among the under-two children in these villages was not
significantly decreased during the study period,. it was clear that the
integration of psycho-social componants into the nutrition education had a
considerable impact on maternal knowledge, attitudes and some aspects of their
childrearing practice.<p>

 Introduction<br><hr align=left noshade width=15%>
Protein energy malnutrition (PEM) in infants and preschool children has been
recognized as a major health problem in Thailand for more than two decades.
Nevertheless, progress in overcoming PEM was slow. In the period from 1977 to
1980, the drop was only from 52.7 to 50.8 percent (1, 2), using Thai standards
and the modified Gomez classification. According to the Ministry of Health's
analysis, the three major constraints were: 1) the inadequate coverage of the
health system, 2) the lack of community awareness of the problem, and 3) the
inadequate multi-sectorial input to the nutrition program. In recent years, new
efforts have been made and a sharper drop has occurred.<p>
The national primary health care program development which includes nutrition
as a major component with community-based activities such as the "village
surveillance program," the supplementary food program, nutrition education and
multi-sectoral collaboration within the Poverty Alleviation Plan, has been
carried out in many parts of the country during the end of the 4th and
throughout the 5th National Economic and Social Development plans. As a result,
the prevalence subsequently dropped to 36.0 percent in 1982 and 28.4 percent in
1984 (2).<p>
The Institute of Nutrition, Mahidol University (INMU) has conducted a
community-based nutrition research program in the Northeast, where the
prevalence of PEM was highest, and found that nutrition education is an
essential component of the integrated nutrition, health, food supply and income
generation program in order to improve the nutritional status of the most
vulnerable infants and preschool children. The Institute has produced and
evaluated the impact of interactive video programs and radio on the mothers of
under-4 aged children in 98 villages situated in 2 provinces -- Ubonrachathani
and SriSaket. The results of a comparison of the modes of communication --
video, video combined with radio, and radio alone -- have been previously
reported (4). The present report focusses mainly on the integration of
psycho-social components into the health/nutrition education, expanding it
beyond the nutrients, food production and preparation to cover mother-infant
interaction and other psycho-social aspects of feeding.<p>
There are two main reasons for incorporating psycho-social components into
nutrition education -- to reduce malnutrition and to enhance the quality of
life through harmonious development. The synergistic effect of a poor
psycho-social environment and malnutrition an early childhood growth and
development has been recognized in the literature comparing the behavior of
well-nourished and malnourished children at the same age. According to Cravioto
(5), mothers of malnourished and normal children living in the same village in
Mexico were found to be different in at least 3 psycho-social aspects: fewer of
them listened to the radio. they provided lower quality of home stimulation and
they were less responsive to their child. On the other hand, Brazelton, et. al.
(6) reported that subsequent protein energy malnutrition (PEM) could be
predicted with 70-80 percent accuracy for Guatemalan babies who had low
interactive ability, based on the Brazelton neonatal behavioral assessment
scale. In a recent review of the literature, Zeitlin and Mansour (22) found
mother-child interaction to be important in predicting "positive deviance"
(nutritional thriving found among children who are at risk). Based on the
literature and also on our own experience, our first hypothesis in the study
was that improvcd mother-child interaction would have a positive effect on
child nutritional status, acting through improvements in maternal understanding
of the child's need and better feeding of supplementary food.<p>
The current concept of harmonious child growth and development which determines
the quality of life beyond survival, calls for more attention to psycho-social
aspects, particularly during the most vulnerable period of early childhood. Due
to the previously high mortality and morbidity rates, nutrition and health
education is almost always directed toward recognition of diseases and their
prevention and management. At the same time, economic and social development
programs usually involve income-generation and materialistic development with
little concern about the child rearing practices and other aspects of family
life. Our second hypothesis is that childrearing practices will be more
appropriate if the mothers know their children's perceptual ability, and their
learning ability, and if mothers recognize their own potential to help children
grow and develop better.<p>
Method<br><hr align=left noshade width=10%>
The IMNU conducted this action research project from 1981 to 1984 in 48
villages in Ubonrachathani and SriSaket provinces in Northeast Thailand. These
villages were randomly assigned as follows: 12 control villages and 12 TV
treatment villages in Ubon; 12 radio and 12 combined radio/TV treatment
villages in SriSaket. General base-line data were collected in May 1981 and
January 1982 from mothers of under-four children in all 48 villages. For the
present report on psycho-social issues, additional baseline data was collected
from mothers of under-twos in March 1982 (Pre-test) in the TV and the TV plus
Radio villages. The impact evaluation was carried out in May 1982, January
1983, and May 1983 (Post-tests 1, 2, and 3, respectively).<p>
A supplementary food product called "Luk Rak," which literally means "beloved
child" and consists of rice, mung bean and sesame or ground nuts, was produced
and sold at the lowest possible price of 2 bahts (or 9 cents $US) as a package
of separately packed ingredients. This food product has been used as an
educational tool as well as an indicator to measure the effectiveness of the
media experiment. Two village health communicators in each village were
selected as village-based product distributors. A three-day training session
was conducted concerning general nutrition knowledge, the product, job and
responsibility, record-keeping, and persuasion techniques.<p>
Five modules of video tapes and radio programs were developed and tested before
dissemination. The interactive video tapes are 25-30 minutes long with 8-10
interactions, which take up another 15 minutes. The content of these modules
can be briefly summarized as follows:<p>
1. "Luk-Rak" (Beloved Child as well as the name of the supplementary food
product) compared two 15 month old boys, one malnourished, the other normal and
the food each of them had.<p>
<p>
2. "Let's Cook Luk Rak" showed the cooking of the supplementary food product
and how to encourage the child to take it.<p>
<p>
3. "Value of Breastfeeding" emphasized the promotion of breastfeeding including
colostrum and adequate diet for pregnant and lactating mothers.<p>
<p>
4. "Here comes Dr. Nit" showed the perceptual and interactive activities of
newborn babies, children's needs for psycho-social stimulation and play
materials. The problem of tongue thrusting and disinterest in supplementary
food were dealt with.<p>
<p>
5. "Happy Valley Village" was a puppet show presenting 5 food groups fighting
the nutrition devils.<p>
<p>
Psycho-social components are mostly incorporated into the 4th module (VTR-4)
and some part of the 1st module which shows behavioral differences between the
2 boys. The interactive learning and motivation strategies used in the VTR-4
include:<p>
1. Discovery/logical conclusion. The audience is exposed to certain information
and then asked to make a decision logically following that information.
Example: a newborn baby can see and hear and imitate facial expression.<p>
<p>
2. Analogy/logical conclusion.  The audience is reminded of something familiar
that works on the same principle as the idea being taught. Then the audience is
asked to draw conclusions from the new information based on the analogy.
Example:  The analogy of being greeted on the arrival at a house, with the
mother-newborn interaction.<p>
<p>
3. Observation<p>
<p>
	3.1. Description. The audience observes an event and reports what was seen.
Example: Observe the reciprocal interaction "face-to face" between the doctor
and a 3-month old baby.<p>
<p>
	3.2 Comparison. The audience observes two or more conditions and reports
differences and/or similarities.  Example: Contrast is shown between the
physical and behavioral responses of malnourished and normal boys.<p>
<p>
	3.3. Modeling of Desirable Behavior. The audience sees desirable behavior and
is asked to describe the positive behavior or some of the elements. Example:
Mother prepares the supplementary food and feeds her baby who displays tongue
thrusting behavior and disinterest.The desired behavior is gently trying to
feed again and distract the child.<p>
<p>
           4. Specification. The audience is given a general principle and
asked to apply it by giving specific examples. Example: play materials can be
made from locally available plants. The audience is asked to name the plant and
the play material.<p>
<p>
5. Generalization. The audience is given specific examples and asked to
conclude the general rule. Example: The baby can hardly see anything while she
is laying awake in a closed cloth cradle.<p>
6. Personal Opinion or Feeling. The audience is asked to give their opinions
about non-threatening subjects related to the matter. Example: The audience is
asked to see things through the eyes of the infant in the closed cradle.<p>
<p>
7. Reinforcement. After every interaction an immediate feedback and
reinforcement of the correct answer is given.<p>
<p>
Field implementation involved sending a video-van equipped with a video tape
player and color monitor to visit each of the TV treatment villages once a week
during the summer (February to May), and less frequently during the farming
period (June to December). The video tapes were shown in 24 villages while the
supply of supplementary food products was brought to all 48 villages by the
same van. The interactors who went with the video-van served as motivators to
encourage audience participation and to answer the questions raised in the
video program. They also collected records of food sales, of video tape
showing, and of resupply of the food product. Thus they were the linkage
between the village health communicator and program manager. In each of the TV
treatment villages, the VTR-4 was shown 3 times during the March-May period in
1982, one time during the June-December period in 1982, and another 3 times
during January and May 1983. The total audience consisted of 478 men, 930
women, and 3225 children.<p>
    The evaluations for this particular module were carried out in March 1982
(Pre-test), May 1982 (Post-test No. 1), January 1983 (Post-test No. 2). and May
1983 (post-test No. 3), respectively. Mothers of under-two children were
interviewed individually during home visits. The interviewers observed
mother-child interaction, type of cradle used, existing play materials, and
they assessed the nutritional status of the children.<p>
Results<br><hr align=left noshade width=10%>
The subjects were mothers of children under two years of age in 12 villages
receiving TV treatment (Table 1). Sixty-five to 70 percent of them were between
21 and 30 years of age. Most of them had finished 4 years of compulsory
elementary school and earned their living by rice farming. Eighty-eight to 91
percent of them were lactating mothers. The mean number of<p>
living children was 2.4 _+ 2.8 and the mean number of pregnancies was 2.7 _+
2.1.<p>

    The percentage distribution of nutritional status among 0-2 year olds is
shown in Tables 3 and 4, using weight for age, and height for age. According
to Thai standards as presented in Table 5 (7), there was no statistically
significant improvement in nutritional status over the study period. However,
the nutritional status assessment showed seasonal variation of the prevalence
of malnutrition which was more pronounced after the dry summer season. Age-
specific prevalence showed that malnutrition occurred early even among the
0-3
month olds who were breast-fed. From the age of 7-9 months, the N+ (Normal,
above 50th percentile) tended to decline steeply while the malnutrition
prevalence in terms of weight-for-age increased. The same trend could also
be
seen in height-for-age, but at a later age of 13-18 months. By the age of
19-24 months, only 10 percent of the children remain in the N+ group both in
weight and height for age according to the Thai standard.<p>
    When the percent of expected weight for height in each age group was
considered, either according to the US or the Thai standard, the 7-9 month
old
began to show a remarkably low weight-for-height after the dry season
whereas
children in the second year were qenerally below 90 percent of the expected
weight-for-height in all assessments.<p>

    Maternal knowledge about, and attitudes toward infants' ability to see
were significantly more positive after seeing the videos, as shown in Figure
1. Compared to the 1.7 percent of the subjects initially reporting that a
baby can see was within the first week of life, the percentage rose to 11.
5.4, and 21 percent, respectively, at post-tests 1, 2, and 3. More than a
two-fold rise occurred in the percentage of mothers who thought their
children
could see by the age of one month. Related to this finding, more open cradles
were found during the home visits. (Figure 1.1)<p>
<IMG SRC="fig1.gif"><p>
    The increase was less dramatic in the number of mothers who thought their
child could hear at the age of one week, but the increase was two-fold in
mothers who thought a child could hear by the age of one month (Table 2).<p>
<IMG SRC="fig2.gif">     
<p>
    Compared to the mothers in the control villages. a significant increase
was found in the percentage of mothers reported giving colostrum to their
newborns. (Figure 3).<p><IMG SRC="fig3.gif">
And more mothers also gave correct reasons for giving colostrum (Figure 4).
Moreover, significantly more mothers in treatment villages than in control
villages were committed to early suckling right after delivery (60.4 as
compared with 44.5 percent) as of Post-test 3.<p><IMG SRC="fig4.gif">
<p>
    Dealing with the problem of introducing "Luk Rak" supplementary food, the VTR-4 showed the right consistency, the right temperature, and the technique to encourage feeding in spite of the infant's tongue-thrusting reflex or turning away. Prior to introduction of the media, about 50 percent of the mothers reportedly responded to tongue thrusting or disinterest by discontinuing feeding. That percentage fell to 26 after introduction of the
media at the time of post-test 1, but increased again somewhat, to about 39
percent by post-test 3. The important result is that more mothers kept
trying and played with the child until the child took more food rather than just discontinuing or using the gesture of eating action (Figure 5). This was significantly different from the mothers in the control villages (Fiqure
6).<p><IMG SRC="fig5.gif">
<p><IMG SRC="fig6.gif">
<p>
   Although both groups of mothers received growth charts and had their
children weighed repeatedly, significantly more mothers in the TV treatment
villages were aware of the desirable weight for 15-month olds, as shown in
VTR-1, in comparison with mothers of under-twos in the control villages
(Figure 7).<p><IMG SRC="fig7.gif">
                    
<p>
    When the subjects were asked which contents of the video show they could
recall, the psycho-social components in childrearing and child play seemed to be more memorable (Figure 8)<p><IMG SRC="fig8.gif">
<p>
This may explain the post-test finding that significantly fewer mothers
reported they had never given their children any type of toys or play
materials (Figure 9). In addition, more of them "played with" or taught their child when the child played with household items -- rather than punishing or taking the things away (Figure 10).<p><IMG SRC="fig9.gif">
<p><IMG SRC="fig10.gif"><p>
A modest but significantly higher proportion of mothers in treatment villages
reported making play materials from local plants than those in the control
villages (Figure 11).<p><IMG SRC="fig11.gif">
<p>
 Discussion<p><hr align=left noshade width=15%>
     The subjects in this study were young mothers of under-two year old
 children living in rural villages of Northeast Thailand. Their children were at risk of early malnutrition although the rate of breastfeeding was more
than
 95 percent and persisted for more than a year. (This contrasts with the
urban
 situation where the breastfeeding rate is only 45 percent and usually lasts
 only one month (8. 9, 10). In both semi-rural and rural areas, there is a
 declining trend in breastfeeding, particularly when more mothers work
outside the home and have more income. A similar finding was reported on the lack
of knowledge of the benefit of breastfeeding and mis-belief about colostrum
and early suckling (11). In our study, most mothers still practice breastfeeding but with poor understanding, and they were ready to change to bottle
feeding.
 It is therefore very cost-effective to disseminate knowledge and to
establish a positive attitude toward early breastfeeding in order to maintain this highly desirable practice.<p>

     The integration of psycho-social components concerning newborn infant-
 mother interaction has been shown to be associated with increased
knowledge, attitude and with commitment to early breastfeeding within the first hours in
 our subjects. Breastfeeding, according to six of nine studies, continued for a significantly longer period for those mothers who suckled their babies in the first hour after birth (12, 13). In our subjects, most of them started breastfeeding after the first 2 to 3 days in the baseline data and breastfed sooner after the media dissemination. Beside the message on the benefit of colostrum and breast milk, the recognition of their newborn as a "seeing" and  "hearing" and "feeling" individual may motivate the mothers toward early contact, interaction and early breastfeedinq.<p>
     However. this study has not dealt enough with the problem of too early
 introduction of semi-solid bulky sticky rice to infants as young as a few
days old. This practice interferes with receiving breastfeeding and is the likely cause of protein energy malnutrition in early infancy (0-6 months). The other possible cause is the inadequate breast milk production in rural
malnourished lactating mothers whose milk was found to be only two-thirds of their well-nourished counterparts(l9).<p>
     Seasonal variation of the prevalence of malnutrition and different types of nutritional deficiencies was found in infants. preschool and school
 children in rural areas with higher prevalences during the rainy season
 (July-September) than during the harvest season (January-February ) (15).
Our finding also showed the changing pattern during the 2 years of the study
 period. The availability of food, parental attention toward the children and illnesses may be the contributing factors.<p>
     From the nutritional assessment it is clear that weight-for-age was
the most sensitive parameter and the earliest weaning sign was the change in
growth velocity from a higher channel to a lower one. For example, the 13-18
month old group began to shift from normal above the 50th percentile (N+) to
normal below the 50th percentile (N-), but did not yet increase the prevalence of malnutrition. But the 19-24 month olds showed further downward drift and the age-specific prevalence of PEM increased significantly in all degrees. Therefore, longitudinal growth monitoring to let mothers, village health volunteers and health personnel be aware of this early change in growth velocity and to pay more attention to increased food supplementation may be an effective way to prevent subsequent PEM. From this study we found that most growth charts (95%) were well kept and considered useful at the end of the two-year study period. The question is how to make the growth charts useable and comprehendable by parents, not only for detection of malnutrition but also
for growth monitoring. The video program has shown an increase in the
mothers' knowledge of what a normal 15-month old should weigh.<p>
<p>
    In Thailand from 1979 to 1984, 1.5 million children 0-5 years of age in
37,000 villages were regularly weighed by the National Growth Monitoring
Programme (2). Parents are advised at each weighing about how to maintain
their child's growth. Cases of "poor growth" rather than only malnourished
cases, once detected are examined more closely to find the cause and are
managed accordingly. These measures include more intensive nutrition
education, and supplementary feeding or referral to more qualified health
workers. A cohort growth chart is given to each village health comunicator
and village health volunteer for presentation of the weighing result to the
public and for monitoring by the village committee and the volunteer group. It is expected that by the end of 1986, which is the end of the 5th national economic and social development plan, all 57,000 villages in Thailand will                         participate in the growth monitoring programme (2, 3, 16).<p>
     The integration of psycho-social components into nutrition education in
 this study is an example of a strategy geared to the "total child." Infants
 and preschool children in these villages are "at risk" because both their
 social and physical environments are impoverished, There are usually more
 than two generations living together in the same house or in the vicinity,
the women, including the mother, aunt, grandmother, and sisters are responsible for childcare. However, these women most also do the house work in addition to participating in agricultural and other income-earning jobs. The physical and mental condition of the mothers may, therefore, account in part for the lack of interaction between mothers and infants.<p>
    Socio-cultural values and traditions may also have an important influence on interaction. For instance, the culture values subtleness more than expressiveness. Newborn infants are usually wrapped and placed in a basket lined with a blanket, close to the mother for a few days.   Parents, relatives and neighbors usually do not openly express their enjoyment or admiration of the baby for fear that the spirits might take the baby away. Relatives usually say aloud, "What an ugly baby he is," in order to deceive the spirit. Holy thread may be tied around the baby's wrist to protect the baby. This traditional practice may be another example of cultural adaptation to previously high peri-natal mortality rates. Infants are often given banana and sticky rice in addition to breastfeeding to make them "full" and "well behaved." Children are often seen laying an a closed cloth cradle.<p>
    As we have shown in previous pages, few mothers in Northeast Thailand
recognized the visual perceptual ability of infants. In the pre-test, only
1.7 percent thought the baby could see at one week and only 14.7 percent at
one month. At the same period, a study in a Bankok slum showed that 20 and 35 percent of the mothers surveyed expected their baby to see within one week
and one month, respectivey. (17) In the Northeast, the percentages were also low among mothers for early perception of auditory ability. However, the data showed an impact on expectations of using the media, with a strong influence on expected age of seeing and a lesser influence for hearing. Therefore, by increasing maternal awareness of perceptual abilities. the naturally existing mother-infant relationship will be enhanced and self-perpetuating. Mothers will be more aware of a child's physical and psycho-social needs.<p>
     Rural mothers as well as their urban poor counterparts need to know
their capacity to make a difference in their children's growth and development and how to make the most use of their potential and existing resources in creating a more nurturing environment for their children. Only one-third of the mothers would encourage or play with their children using household items in the pre-test and the percentage increased to more than 65 percent in post-tests 1 and 2, declining somewhat to 50 percent in post-test 3. There were no toys or recognizable play materials in more than 70 percent of the homes observed during the first home visits and almost half of the mothers reported never having given their children any toy or play materials.
 Subsequently, more mothers provided toys or play materials to their children but most were comercially available toys. Less than 10 percent made play materials from local plants. Mutually interactive games between the child and family members were reported in few families, although these activities did not require commercial play materials which may be limited by their economic status. The media did not emphasize these play activities and there was no significant change seen in the impact evaluation.<p>
    According to the quality dnd quantity of breast milk in rural Thai
mothers, it is recommended that supplementary food be introduced when the                             
 infant is 6 months old if the mother is healthy, but it may be introduced
one month earlier in the case of malnourished mothers. The INMU has developed 7 types of simplified supplementary food containing rice, legumes and sesame.
 The selection of the formula depends on the availability of local food
 products (18). They can be locally produced and supplied to children from
the age of six months to five years. The acceptability is not as good as
expected especially among young infants who still show a strong tongue thrusting reflex. Mothers usually regard this as a sign of dislike compared to their response to sweeter banana or chewed sticky rice.<p>
     The most successful outcome related to health and nutrition is the
 striking decrease in the percentage of mothers who otherwise would
discontinue feeding semi-solid supplementary food when the child turns away or shows tongue thrusting. When the mothers know the desirable behavior of continuing to feed, of distracting the child through play, and of waiting to try again, the child is more likely to receive more food and grow better.<p>
    In conclusion, the integration of psycho-social components into nutrition education has been attempted with promising impact on rural mothers' knowledge, attitudes and some aspects of their child rearing practices. This will be empowering mothers to promote more harmoneous growth and development of children, especially during early childhood. Other aspects of psycho-social components should be incorporated in all health- and nutrition-related activities (19). From the integrated health, nutrition, agriculture and rural development projects in Ubonrachanthani (20), it was clear that income generation alone does not necessarily improve nutritional status of the rural poor. By utilizing curative health care as the entry point of implementation, along with preventive and promotive health care and continuous nutrition education, the nutritional status of the community can be improved. One of the most important factors in acceptance of prevention and promotion is the social preparation of villagers and the interest of community leaders.<p>
    With existing communications technology, visual messages are most
effective and can result in behavioral change regardless of functional
literacy and distance (21). The application of communications technology in
modifying health behavior and childrearing practices is a challenge not only
to economically developed countries but                                     even more so in developing
countries.<p>

<title>A Note From the Field, Asha Sadan - A Hope Fulfilled</title><body><p>

<i>A Note From the Field</i><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Asha Sadan - A Hope Fulfilled</b><p>
<p>
	Asha Sadan is a home which affords shelter and protection for destitute and
abandoned children, as well as serving as a remand home for delinquent girls.
This foundling home receives children of all ages in different states of health
and nutrition.  The children remain in care until they are adopted.   The
neonates and sick children are assigned to nursing staff who tend and care for
them.<p>
<p>
	This is the story of the older children who were relatively healthy, but
little else.<p>
<p>
	The honorary managing committee members had noticed that the children were
apathetic and sometimes unruly.  They showed no signs of normal growth and
development.  In the month of August '86 there were thirty-two babies who
needed help, but the managing committee could not fathom the reason.  <p>
<p>
	The children had been provided with a beautiful nursery with fancy cots and
beds and plenty of toys, but were not really allowed to play with the toys
except under supervision. There was a luxurious kitchen and a full-time cook
who dished out nutritious meals at fixed times.  But she was strictly following
instructions, and being anxious by nature, would prepare the food well ahead of
time, then leave it on the counter until the specified time.  The children
spent most of their time looking longingly at the food, partly because they
were hungry, but more importantly because they had nothing better to do.<p>
<p>
	<i>Mobile Creches</i> was requested to help in running the childcare centre
during the day.  Consequently four trained staff members arrived at Asha Sadan
to assess and assist in tending the children.  For the staff of <i>Mobile
Creches</i> who were accustomed to the dust and rubble of construction sites
and creches with low roofs and little ventilation, this seemed like heaven!
There were toilets with running water and a large kitchen.  What luxury.<p>
<p>
	But the atmosphere was strangely disconcerting.  The place smelled of stale
urine and most of the children were either crying or just sitting.  Some of the
smarter ones were pointing to the food on the counter and begging.  The staff
were flabbergasted.  There was no time to be wasted in observing.  They had to
get down to work immediately.<p>
<p>
	Two of them attended to the physical cleanliness of the nursery as well as the
care of the children.  The plastic panties were replaced with comfortable
cotton ones, and toilet training was started.  Almost all the children had head
lice and scabies.  These were immediately treated.<p>
	<p>
	But the most important aspect of child care was affectionate interaction,
coupled with stimulating activities.  These brought about perceptible changes
in the behaviour of the children in the short time of a week.  The children
responded to the love shown to them and began to communicate with the adults
who cared for them.  But when it was time for the caregiving staff to leave in
the evening, there were heartrending scenes.  The children would cling to them
and cry bitterly.<p>
<p>
	By the end of a fortnight all this had changed.  The children felt more secure
and were willing to wave goodbye to the caregivers, secure in the knowledge
that they would come again the next morning.  Slowly they were accepting
discipline without fear.  The routine of feeding children and keeping them in
bed most of the time was slowly modified to include interactive, stimulating
activities for cognitive development.<p>
<p>
	Working with established practices that were unimaginative and outmoded was
not easy.  There was tremendous resistance from the senior nursing staff who
believed that "children should be seen and not heard."  They had established
the rules and nobody dared question them.  For example, at feeding time, the
children were seated on the floor. Bowlfuls of mashed cereal mixed with egg
were shoved into their mouths mechanically by some helpers, with not a word
being spoken.  At the end of the meal, they were given water from the same
bowls.  Then the children were lifted up and put to bed.<p>
<p>
	After many laborious discussions the emphasis was shifted from feeding and
dumping, to nurturing with love and care, as well as to activities for
cognitive development.  More attention to the children's health problems and
habit formation began to pay dividends.  They were encouraged to play and to
use the toys.  The children looked forward to the time allotted for outdoor
play.  Soon they were dancing and singing, and the creche was resounding with
their laughter.  The first faltering words had been uttered, showing that the
children were normal after all.<p>
<p>
	A fortnight after the entry of Shalini, Vasanti, Shakuntala and Saraswati of
<i>Mobile Creches, </i>there was a perceptible change in the children.  They
were happier and healthier and looked forward to each day with enthusiasm.  The
creche was now vibrant with eager children wanting to talk, play, learn and
sing all the time.  Their social-emotional development was beginning to take
place.<p>
<p>
	The children's recorded weights showed an increase of 500 grams exactly one
month after intervention.  They were now feeding themselves from little
gleaming plates and enjoyed the independence.<p>
<p>
	Particular mention should be made of Ashish.  He was totally withdrawn and
uncooperative and would not respond to any instructions.  Twice or thrice a day
he would have a tantrum and would cry inconsolably.  This was his only
communication with the world.  But with patience, understanding and love,
Vasanti was able to win him over in a month and a half.  He related to her and
enjoyed looking through picture books and communicating with her.  His psyche
was still precarious and he reacted to harsh instructions with tantrums, but he
was able to be pacified by Vasanti.<p>
<p>
	For <i>Mobile Creches</i> the experience provided mixed feelings. There was
the frustration of not being able to change the system drastically, combined
with the satisfaction of meeting the challenge and achieving success.  The
initial trials turned into triumphs.  They had brought joy and stability into
the lives of many forgotten children.<p>
<p>
	At the end of six months the children had graduated into balwadis
(pre-school).  But the work is not finished yet. The staff of the remand home
need to be trained for quality childcare, so that every child who enters the
home has a better chance of normal development and a bright future.<p>

</head><title>A Food Supplementation Programme in India</title><body>Note:  Italics indicates commentary<p>
<p>
<b>Case Studies</b><p>
<p>
<i>The following case studies illustrate various strategies for bringing
health, nutrition, care and/or education components to young children and their
families.  Some of these programmes had a singular focus, some were designed
from the beginning to be more comprehensive, and others have become
comprehensive over time.  They are not all success stories, but they do provide
some insights into the complexities of developing appropriate and effective
programmes.</i><p>

	<u>A Food Supplementation Programme in India</u><p>
<b>Focus: Providing food supplementation to increase children's intake of
vitamins and iron, and providing health services for pregnant and lactating
women, to improve the nutrition of children ages 6 - 36 months.</b><p>

	The Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition Project (TNIP) was begun in 1980 with
funding from the World Bank.  It was designed to reduce the incidence and
prevalence of malnutrition and improve the health of children in the 0-3 age
group.  There was also a focus on pregnant and lactating women.  One of the key
features of the project was Nutrition Surveillance.  Children were monitored
and weighed once a month.  Those who were found to be malnourished were given a
food supplement called <i>Laddu</i>, made from cereals and pulses fortified
with vitamins and iron.  When the child appeared to be rehabilitated, the
supplementation was stopped.  Pregnant and nursing women also received
nutritional supplements.<p>
<p>
	In addition to the provision of nutritional foods, the project had a health
component which focussed on helping to decrease the infant mortality rate by
providing better health care to mothers pre- and post-natally.  There was also
a communication component that was designed to motivate the population to pay
more attention to the nutritional needs of infants and young children from
birth to age 3.  Mass media and one-to-one contacts were the chief methods of
spreading the word. <p>
<p>
	What was the project able to achieve?  Over a period of 6 years there was a
dramatic reduction (55.5%) in severe malnutrition and also a clear upward shift
in the percentage of normal children and very moderately malnourished children
(Swaminathan, 1993).  Thus the programme was effective in reaching the
children.  It was much less effective in reaching women. "The participation of
pregnant women and nursing mothers in the supplementary feeding as well as the
referral and health care system was poor, with low ante-natal registration and
delivery services, and less than 50% uptake of nutritional supplements by
women." (Swaminathan, 1993, p. 10).  One of the hypothesized reasons for the
lack of uptake by the women is that the project was not sensitive to women's
work roles and timings.<p>
<p>
	Why was it able to accomplish what it did?  The project was designed in such a
way that it reached the poorest of the poor.  It was well structured
organizationally and administratively.  And, the provision of food, rather than
a cash payment for families to buy it, helped assure that families actually had
food.<p>
	What were some of the problems?  There was little effort to get the community
involved in any aspect of the programme other than being the receivers of the
service.  They were not involved in preparing or distributing the food.
Further the rehabilitation was often temporary.  Short-term goals were met, but
there was no attempt to address the issues that led to the malnutrition in the
first place, whether that be poverty or a lack of understanding of the role of
care in the feeding process.  And finally, the programme did not address issues
of self-reliance in food or stimulate local production of the food which would
have greatly enhanced sustainability. In addition, no attention was paid to the
psycho-social aspects of early development.<p>

Support: A critique of relevant laws, policies and programmes from the
perspective of women's triple roles."  A paper presented at the Sixth
Conference of the Indian Association for Women's Studies, Mysore, May 31- June
2, 1993.<p>
<p>
<i>	The TNIP programme was begun in an era when straight supplementation was
seen as sufficient.  As a result of programmes like this one and others since,
lessons have been learned.  For one thing, supplementation in and of itself is
no longer seen as sufficient.  At the very least the focus has to be on
changing diets so that the needed nutrients are present in everyday foods and
eating habits.  In the World Bank document, <b>Best Practices in Addressing
Micronutrient Malnutrition</b> (World Bank, 1993), the authors suggest that in
developing a supplementation programme that leads to a changed diet the
following questions have to be raised:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>1.  Whose diet needs to be modified?  If it is only young children that are
in danger of malnutrition, then mothers need to understand the importance of
changing the young child's diet.  Or, it may be that it is most important to
change the diet of pregnant and lactating women. In this instance other
strategies would be used.</i><p>
<i>2.  Who has the power to change the diet?  Does the mother have control over
this or is it the grandmother that dictates what the child will be fed?  What
role does the father play in the process?</i><p>

<i>3.  What is most easily changed that will have the most impact?  The more
specific the modification the easier it will be to make it.</i><p>

<i>4.  What will motivate people to change?  Changes are not likely to come
about when people are presented with "scientific" information.  They need to
see that there will be some immediate benefit for them if they are going to
change their behaviour.</i><p>

<i>5.  What are the obstacles to changing behaviour?  There is the obvious one
of unavailability or cost of the appropriate foods.  There are also the beliefs
and attitudes that people have about what it is appropriate and inappropriate
for people to eat, particularly pregnant and lactating women and infants.
(World Bank, 1993, pg. 59)</i><p>
<hr>
<i>The second case study illustrates the ways in which a multi-pronged approach
was taken, involving government, local producers, and the community, to assure
both access to the micronutrient and sustainability of the effort.</i><p>

	<u>Iodine Deficiency (IDD) Control in Bolivia</u><p>
<b>Focus: To fortify the salt supply with iodine so that the whole population
of Bolivia would have access to and use fortified salt.</b><p>

	This project was begun after a study conducted in 1983 documented that 65.2%
of the school-age children had goiter problems, and that there was a 16%
cretinism rate in some areas.  Some of the difficulties encountered in bringing
iodine to the total population were: a widely dispersed population with pockets
of isolation; difficult terrain making distribution a problem; large deposits
of non-iodized salt that people had easy access to; and a longstanding
acceptance by the people of iodine deficiency.<p>
<p>
	From the beginning the project had strong government support. In 1983 the
Italian government, through the Joint Nutrition Support Programme (JNSP) of
PAHO/WHO and UNICEF, funded PRONOALCOBO - a national programme to fight against
goiter.  PRONOALCOBO was incorporated as a branch of the National Office of
Food and Nutrition, and operated through the Ministry of Health.<p>
<p>
	The programme included three approaches.  The first was to increase the
production and distribution of affordable iodized salt.  This was achieved.
Today, 80% of the necessary idolized salt is produced domestically (both
publicly and privately).  Salt producers' cooperatives were created through
working with the pre-existing National Cooperative Institute, and the
government produced salt.  As the industry developed, a percentage of the
profits from the sale of iodized salt were pumped back into the programme
through PRONOALCOBO, subsidizing the education activities and the delivery of
iodine to the remote areas.  PRONOALCOBO hopes to achieve financial
independence in 1994.<p>
<p>
	The second strategy consisted of public campaigns to increase awareness of IDD
and methods of IDD control. The Ministry of Health trained community volunteers
to distribute IDD materials and promote community acceptance. There was
extensive collaboration with preexisting institutions.  This included primary
health care workers and facilities, local NGOs, agricultural committees,
mothers clubs and churches.  The trained community health workers trained
teachers and community leaders, providing them with materials they could use in
educating others.  In addition radio and television spots provided information
and traditional forms of education (puppet shows, theatre) were used to reach
people at fairs and festivals.<p>
<p>
	Third, there was direct administration of iodine supplements to those at
highest risk.  These consisted of supplying iodized oil to communities without
access to iodized salt.<p>
<p>
	As a result of the programme, goiter among school-aged children has dropped to
20.6%, consumption of iodized salt increased from 1% to 98% in urban areas and
from 0% to 22% in rural areas.  <p>
	<p>
	There appear to be several reasons for the success of the programme.  First,
from the beginning there was strong political support for the effort.  This was
demonstrated in the creation of PRONOALCOBO and the fact that laws and
regulations governing the production and distribution of salt went hand-in-hand
with the effort.  Secondly, appropriate technologies were introduced in a
timely way by the International Council for Control of IDD (ICCIDD).  Machinery
for the production of iodized salt was made available, along with expertise in
how to produce it in a cost-efficient way.  Third, programme planning and
implementation was the responsibility of the Bolivians, not outsiders. <p>
<p>
Reference:	World Bank, <i>Best Practices in Addressing Micronutrient
Malnutrition</i>. 1993, pg. 96<p>
<p>
<i>	Why has this programme been as effective as it has over the past decade?
The lessons learned from this and similar projects would suggest that in
addition to the variables listed above, the following were contributing
factors:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>1. Over time, iodized salt was available, affordable and accepted by the
people.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>2. An educated public began to learn the value of iodized salt and changed
their buying habits to include iodized salt.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>3.  Multiple avenues were used to bring the message to the community. The
use of popular media (both modern and traditional) helped focus people's
attention on the issues.  They also learned about it through community people
they trusted and children received information in school and brought it home.
Groups people belonged to were part of the process of getting the word out.
The messages were everywhere.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
_______________________________________________<p>
<p>
<i>The two cases presented above illustrate the ways in which a very targeted
programme can be introduced successfully.  In the first instance there were
considerable problems because some of the wider contextual issues were not
addressed and the approach did not include a psycho-social component.  In the
second case, working within and using the context were critical variables in
the success of the programme.  In both instances there was a specific product
that was being introduced.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>The third case study is of a project in Thailand where, like in Tamil Nadu,
there was a concern about children's nutritional status.  However, quite a
different approach was taken.  Rather than focussing on applying supplemental
foods to the child, the project began by looking at the practices surrounding
feeding and nutrition in order to change maternal behaviour.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
	<u>Integrated Nutrition and Community Development Project in Thailand</u><p>
<b>Focus: A reduction of malnutrition through understanding and building on
local childrearing practices and beliefs</b><p>
<p>
	This project was begun by the Ministry of Health in Thailand who conducted
studies to understand why there was such a high incidence of protein energy
malnutrition (PEM) within the country.  They identified what they perceived to
be three major constraints to significant reduction in the level of PEM in
infants and preschool children: 1) a health system that did not reach those
most at risk;  2) a lack of community awareness about malnutrition and its
impact on children's growth and development; and 3) the fact that nutrition was
being viewed as a health problem only: there was a lack of multi-sectorial
input into the programme. <p>
<p>
	Taking these constraints into consideration, the government, in 1979, launched
an integrated community-based primary health care project that included
supplemental feeding,  growth monitoring and parental nutrition education, all
within a national plan for poverty alleviation.  Within this broad framework,
the Institute of Nutrition at Mahidol University carried out a nutrition
education project that was directed toward families with the most vulnerable
infants and pre-schoolers.  What is unique about the project is that the
nutrition education included a psycho-social component focussing on
caregiver-child interactions and on improvements in the physical and social
environment surrounding the child.<p>
<p>
	As a basis for the project, childrearing attitudes and practices were studied
to know what mothers were currently doing and to determine how that might
affect children's nutritional status.  Through the studies a number of
nutritional and social taboos were discovered that were not beneficial to the
child.  For instance, there was a belief that colostrum was bad for the infant
and that newborns were incapable of sucking.  This meant that breastfeeding was
not begun immediately following birth.  It was delayed, with the consequence
that many mothers found it difficult to breastfeed and quickly turned to bottle
feeding.  Children were not receiving the nutrition which breastfeeding
provides.<p>
<p>
	It was also discovered that mothers believed that the normal tongue-thrusting
activity of infants signalled that the infant was no longer hungry.  Because of
this belief, many infants were chronically underfed.<p>
<p>
	Another important belief that needed to be addressed was that few mothers knew
that at birth infants were capable of seeing and hearing. As a result, mothers
did not interact with their infants and they were left for hours in hammocks
that essentially blocked them from seeing anything in their environment.
Related to this was the mother's lack of awareness of her own capacity to make
a difference in the child's development.  Mothers had little understanding of
how they could make use of existing resources to create a more nurturing
environment for the child and how important it was for them to interact with
the child.<p>
<p>
	With these practices in mind, a series of interactive videos was created.  One
was specifically oriented toward child development, aimed at creating maternal
awareness of her child as an individual with early perceptual ability, and the
importance of play and of mother-child interaction in that play and in
supplementary feeding.  A second video compared two 15-month old boys, one
malnourished, the other normal.  The video identified differences in the
mother's behaviour (her feeding and caring practices) in each scenario, as well
as differences in the food provided to the child.  Health communicators in each
village, who served as distributors of supplementary food, were trained in the
use of the videos which were presented as often as needed in each village.<p>
<p>
	An evaluation of the project was conducted to assess the impact of the project
on children's nutrition.  As a result of the project fewer children suffered
PEM.  On the basis of interviews with mothers of under-two children, and of
observations in the home, evaluators of the project concluded that changes in
the mothers beliefs and behaviours were critical variables in improving
children's nutritional status. <p>
<p>
	Those involved concluded that videos are a powerful technique when working
with illiterate adults. The visual images provided through the videos
stimulated discussion and presented mothers with models of behaviour which they
could imitate.   When observers went to the villages they noted more
adult-child interaction, more open cradles, and more colostrum was being given.
The results suggest that a focus on the psycho-social components of feeding
(i.e. care) can make a significant difference in children's nutritional status.

<i>While the Thailand experience represents an attempt to create a nutrition
education programme that takes into account the many variables that contribute
to a child's nutritional status, there is a national programme in India that is
designed to not only address nutritional needs, but children's cognitive needs
as well.  It includes not only children from birth to age 3 but also pregnant
and lactating women and children through age 6.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
	<u>Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) in India</u><p>
<b>Focus: Providing children from birth to six years of age with comprehensive,
integrated services, including nutritional supplementation, health, care and
education.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	In 1974 India adopted a National Policy for Children that to ensure the
delivery of comprehensive child development services to all children.  One of
the first targets for the effort were the poorest children found in urban slums
and rural areas, particularly children in scheduled castes and tribes.
Beginning in 1975 with 33 projects, Integrated Child Development Services
(ICDS) has grown to 2696 projects (more than 265,000 centres) in 1992, reaching
about 16 million children under 6 years of age.  The specific objectives of
ICDS are to:<p>
<p>
   	lay the foundations for the psychological, physical, and social development
of the child;<p>
   	improve the nutritional and health status of children, 0 to 6;<p>
   	reduce the incidence of mortality, morbidity, malnutrition and 	school
dropout;<p>
   	enhance the capability of mothers to look after the needs of the child. <p>
<p>
	The integrated package of ICDS services works through a network of Anganwadi
(literally, courtyard) Centres, each run by an Anganwadi Worker (AW) and
helper, usually selected from the local village.  The AW undergoes a
three-month training in one of the more than 300 training centres run by
voluntary and governmental agencies.  Responsibilities of the AW include:
non-formal pre-school education, supplementary feeding, health and nutrition
education, parenting education through home visiting, community support and
participation, and primary maternal and child health referrals.  Support is
provided to the AW by a supervisor (1 per 20 AW) and a Child Development
Programme Officer working with 3-5 supervisors) who is directly responsible for
implementation and management of each ICDS project.     <p>
<p>
	All families in the area to be served are surveyed to identify the poorest.
Those families with children under 6 and/or where the woman is pregnant or
lactating, are served in the Anganwadis. Regular examinations are provided by
Lady Health Visitors and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives.  Children and pregnant women
are immunized on a scheduled basis. Three hundred days a year food is
distributed, the menu prepared in accordance with local foods and traditions.
Families are encouraged to bring the children to the centres for regular
feeding.  Children's weight and height are monitored.  Those with severe
malnutrition are given additional food supplements, and acute cases are
referred to medical services.<p>
<p>
	A pre-school programme has been developed for 3-6 year olds who attend the
centre three hours a day.  The AWW is encouraged to develop activities that
stimulate the child.  An additional service is non-formal training in nutrition
and health organised for mothers and pregnant women.  These sessions are open
to all women, aged 15-45, with priority given to pregnant and nursing women and
women whose children suffer from repeated malnutrition.<p>
<p>
	Funding for the programme has come from both governmental and non-governmental
sources.  The initial costs of establishing a programme are provided by the
Ministry of Social Welfare. The costs of the supplementary feeding programme
are borne by the state; and the on-going operational costs are the
responsibility of the Central government.  International donor agencies have
also been involved in funding aspects of the programme: UNICEF assisted in
planning and implementation beginning in 1975. Since 1982 other international
agencies, for example, the World Food Programme, the Aga Khan Foundation, CARE,
NORAD, USAID and the World Bank, have been contributing in a variety of ways.<p>
<p>
	The ICDS programme uses existing services of diverse governmental departments
and of voluntary agencies for the training of ICDS workers.  Overall
administration lies with the Department of Women and Child Development within
the Ministry of Human Resource Development.  ICDS is monitored by the Ministry
as well as the All India Institute of Medical Science and the National
Institute for Public Cooperation and Child Development.  The annual unit cost
per child per year was estimated at approximately US$10.00.<p>
<p>
	Although the programme often operates at a minimum level of quality it has
nevertheless had important effects on the under-six population.  For instance,
a review of nearly 30 studies of the nutritional impact reveals nearly
unanimous results documenting a positive outcome.  A 1984-86 comparative study
done in a number of locations showed ICDS/non-ICDS infant mortality rates of 67
vs. 86 in rural areas and 80 vs. 87 in urban areas.  In a comparative study of
effects on schooling, one researcher found that those with ICDS background had
a higher primary school enrollment rate (89% vs. 78%), were more regular
attenders, had better academic performance and scored significantly higher on a
psychological test (Raven Colour Matrices), than non-ICDS children.
Furthermore, the difference in enrollment rates was accounted for by
differences among girls (more of the ICDS girls stayed in school).  In another
study, it was found that primary school dropout rates were significantly lower
for ICDS than for non-ICDS children from lower and middle caste groups (19 vs.
35 percent for lower castes and 5 vs. 25 percent for middle castes).<p>
<p>
	The ICDS, the largest programme of its kind, illustrates the power of
political commitment to achieve significant rates of coverage in an integrated
programme of attention to children ages 0 to 6, with important effects on
health and education and at a reasonable cost.<p>

<i>	What is impressive about ICDS is that when it was conceived in 1974 there
was a clear understanding of the importance of delivering comprehensive
services to meet the multiple needs of young children.  Structurally the
programme has always included a focus on health, nutrition and education of the
young child and the mother.  While the programme has certainly demonstrated
positive benefits for both women and children, they are not of the magnitude
that one would hope for.  This is due primarily to the difficulty of assuring
quality because of the scale on which the programme has been implemented.  It
may also be due to having such a comprehensive mandate.  </i><p>

<b>Focus: The development of community-based services in response to
community-defined needs.</b><p>
<p>
	The Sang Kancil Project was developed within the squatter settlements of Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia.  It was begun in 1978 by the health sector in an attempt to
meet the health needs of those living in urban squatter settlements.  The
rationale for working in squatter communities was based on the fact that they
are a growing phenomenon in the developing world, constituting nearly 50% of
the total urban population.  It is widely recognised that the environment
within squatter settlements is threatening to people's health, physically,
mentally and in terms of psycho-social development. <p>
<p>
	In Malaysia there was difficulty in providing services for squatters because
they occupy the land illegally and thus are not entitled to city services
(water, sewage, medical care, education, etc.).  Nevertheless many squatter
settlements are stable communities, including people from a variety of income
levels.  The stability comes from affordable housing that may not be available
outside the settlement and well-developed support systems and/or leadership
positions within the settlement.  The developers of the <i>Sang Kancil</i>
project developed a strategy that recognised, valued, and built upon the
complex social systems which exist in the settlements. <p>
<p>
	While the health sector personnel who began the project were interested in
establishing primary health care centres within <i>kampungs</i> (districts) in
the settlements, they began their efforts by conducting meetings with community
members to determine their needs and priorities.  The community wanted a child
care programme for young children and to create income-generating activities
for women.  Health care was not seen as a priority.  Those involved listened to
the community.  Rather than building a health centre, they established a
pre-school and an income-generating project.  When these were well-established,
then it was possible to introduce primary health care, which is now widely
accepted. <p>

<p>
<p>
	<i>The approach of beginning with a limited focus and incrementally providing
other services to young children and their families appears to be successful.
However, it works best when the target population is relatively small.  It is
much more difficult to use this approach when considering issues of
scale.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>It is apparent from the above cases, that a program needs to be designed in
response to the particular population(s) being served, taking into account
their history, beliefs, practices, perceived needs, expectations and ability to
participate.  Programs also need to be designed with the active input and
participation of the programme providers.  While the research on <b>Care</b> as
it relates to health and normal development shows that a multi-dimensional
integrated approach is optimal, practical experience shows that this approach
requires great sensitivity and careful planning.

<title>CHILD CARE: CONTESTED GROUNDS, by Robert G. Myers</title><body><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CHILD CARE: CONTESTED GROUNDS</b><p>
<p>
Robert G. Myers<p>
<p>
<p>
Although it may seem obvious that child care should be an explicit and
important part of the discussion dealing with participation and development of
women, and of women in development, child care has often entered the discussion
as an afterthought or has been absent.  It has remained a <i>contested
ground</i> in programming.<p>
<p>
	The reluctance to incorporate child care into the debate and into programming
is only in part related to the lingering fantasy that "a woman's place is in
the home".  It is also related to the history of the development of the women's
movement and of WID programs, where the "productive" role of women has been
distinguished from the "reproductive" role of women -- with emphasis placed on
the productive role.  The care and up-bringing of children has not been
recognized as a "productive' activity, for understandably ideological reasons.
The unfortunate result of this narrow view has been to make it more difficult
for programmes of child care to evolve that are supportive of, and permit, the
economic and social participation of women over a broad front.  But there is
not an important opening in this view. <p>
<p>
Why should programmes to improve development and participation of women in
development incorporate child care?<p>
<p>
1.  The obvious first answer is that the lack of adequate child care options
inhibits the earning and learning possibilities of women and children.  This
answer is usually recognized even if it may not be acted upon.<p>
<p>
2.  A second reason women's programmes should incorporate child care is that
care is itself a productive investment strategy.  In this vein, child care
should be viewed not only as a means of increasing productivity in the society
but also as a form of employment and income generation.<p>
<p>
Here, ground is contested because it is argued by some that employment in child
care simply perpetuates inequalities by extending employment to women in a
traditionally "maternal" occupation and does not help to place women in the
mainstream.  It could be argued that failure to recognize care as a legitimate
form of work results not only in negative effects on the ability of women to
earl and learn and  in the growing number of child care jobs outside the home,
filled almost exclusively by women who are poorly paid and without social
benefits.<p>
<p>
3.  A third, less immediate but equally important reasons why child care should
be central to the issues of women's participation and development is that the
way in which children are reared bears directly on gender issues:<p>
<p>
	  	women are primarily responsible for production of the work force.<p>
	 discrimination when the sex of the child is known.  It continues to be
evident during the early years in the various forms that child care takes.<p>
	 values (including those related to gender) are transmitted to children and
through children to the next generation<p>
<p>
******<p>
<p>
Having argued the importance of child care within a context of women's
participation and development, let us turn now in a telegraphic way to several
important points that emerge from a review of the literature.<p>
<p>
1.  Historically, women have always worked in economically productive jobs.
They have always been in the labor force, recognized by monetary remuneration
or not.  The narrow definition of women as "only housewives" is a myth.  Pleas
to return to the "good old days" when women stayed in the home are hollow.<p>
<p>
2.  Women have rarely been the some caretakers of their children. Other family
members, neighbors and members of the community have, traditionally,played an
important role in the process.<p>
<p>
3. Previous systems of social support and child care are eroding as migration,
urbanization, changes in family structure and the extension of schooling
proceed apace.  With this breakdown, new support systems are needed.<p>
<p>
4.  IT is not correct to assume that strengthening a woman's productivity and
participation will automatically increase the welfare of either the woman or of
her children.  There may be trade-offs of energy and time that have negative
effects on one of the other, or both.  This is so in part because families are
not necessarily altruistic, welfare-maximizing institutions we think them to be
in which benefits are distributed fairly.<p>
<p>
5.  There is a tension between the so-called 'productive' and 'reproductive'
roles of women that must be dealt with.  That tension is particularly acute:<p>
<p>
	 	in conditions of poverty<p>
	 	in single parent, women-headed households<p>
	 	during the first year of a life of a child<p>
	 	when alternative child care options are lacking<p>
	 	during periods of the 'life cycle squeeze'<p>
	 if work is poorly paid, without benefits, far from home and physically
demanding<p>
	 in heavy work seasons (e.g. harvest) or "wet" seasons<p>
	 where culture strongly dictates an exclusively domestic role for women.<p>
<p>
6.  The need for <b>adequate</b> child care through alternative (to exclusive
care by mothers) arrangements is strong and is not being met.<p>
<p>
7.  To be "adequate' programmes of alternative care should be: affordable,
accessible, flexible, run by trusted and accountable persons, and meet minimum
quality standards.<p>
<p>
8.  There are many viable options for stimulating the provision of adequate
care,including strengthening traditional care in families,establishing
programmes of home day care for groups of children. self-standing programmes of
center-based care, and linking programmes of alternative care to programmes of
community development, credit, community gardens, co-ops or markets, care in
the workplace, etc.<p>
<p>
9. In many cases, existing options are underutilized because they do not
provide adequate care, as defined above.  This does not mean that there is no
need or demand for alternative care.<p>
<p>
10. Community-based approached to child care, located in women's groups or
other community organizations can provide an excellent service of care, but
typically need some form of subsidy to be sustained over time if they are to
serve poorer women and families.<p>
<p>
11.  There is a need to facilitate direct care of children by mothers during
the first year of a child's life.<p>
<p>
12.  Men are little involved in direct child care or housework.<p>
<p>
******<p>
<p>
Some policy implications<p>
<p>
1. There is a need to improve and enforce legislation that provides access to
child care and regulates policies of maternal and paternal leave.<p>
<p>
2.  Additional, target investment i adequate child care is required,
particularly for children where parents are involved in the informal sector and
for woman-headed households in marginal areas.<p>
<p>
3.  When organizing programmes to improve the productivity, participation and
welfare of women, the needs of children must be taken into account .
Similarly, when organizing programmes directed toward the development of
pre-school children, women's needs must be responded to.<p>
<p>
4.  It is possible and advisable to build programmes of adequate child care on
local experience and capacity, responding to local needs with community based
approaches.  This cannot be done without a subsidy and in such programmes
quality must be guarded.<p>
<p>
5.  Child care should be viewed both as a social investment and as an area of
employment generation.  Proper pay and benefits should be provided to those tho
work in child care jobs.<p>
<p>
6.  Ways must be explored to re-integrate elders and fathers into the child
care process.<p>
<p>
7.  Domestic labour, including child care, should enter the national accounting
systems. <p>

<p>
programming related to the intersecting needs of women and children and to make
recommendations in terms of actions that might be taken to assure that women's
and children's intersecting needs are recognised, considered, and planned for
in future development efforts.<p>
<p>
	A review of policies and programs of selected international agencies was
carried out in order to identify successful efforts which benefit both women
and children. It consisted of "desk" reviews of a variety of women in
development projects and early childhood care and education programs, journal
reviews, and interviews with donor agency personnel, private foundation
staff,
and individuals from non-governmental organizations. The following statements
summarize the findings:<p>
<p>
	1. <b>Historically.</b> The premises and assumptions that have provided the
conceptual base for the development of women's and children's programs have not
taken into account the intersecting needs of the two groups. However, program
experience over the past decade has brought increasing awareness that projects
developed for one group may not be supportive of the other group's needs. Today
there are programs which successfully meet the needs of both groups, but they
are scarce.<p>
<p>
	2. <b>Programmatically.</b> In general, those programs which are successfully
meeting the needs of both women and children have evolved as a single-focus
program has been implemented and a wider range of needs have emerged and
appropriate components added. It is wore common for a women in development
program to eventually include a child care component than it is for an early
childhood care and education program to include programming for women.<p>
<ol>		a. Where a program has been developed for women, child care is a likely add
on; it develops as a result of women's expressed need for child care support.
The primary focus of the child care program is on the child's safety. While
many women are aware of the multiple needs of children that should be met
through these programs, they seldom have the expertise and/or
resources to assure that a full range of services is available for children.<p>
<p>
		b. If an early childhood care and education program develops a component for
women, programming focusses on her nurturing and reproductive role, not her
productive role. Thus only a limited number of women's needs are addressed. In
fact, there are times when the program component being developed in support of
the reproductive role is in conflict with women's
productive role.</ol><p>
<p>
3. <b>Organizationally.</b> In terms of donor agencies, the further free the
field one goes, the less awareness there is of the intersecting needs of women
and children. Further, personnel within agencies and organizations that work
with national governments generally have loner levels of awareness of the
issues than those working in non-governmental agencies. This may be because
many governments have a conservative perspective on women's role in
development. On the other hand, governments may be willing to invest in
programs which promote children's survival; few have made an investment in
programming for children's on-going development,
<p>
    4. <b>In the literature.</b> Journals which focus on women's development
seldom refer to children, except in terms of child care centers that have been
created in support of women's changing role. Likewise, early childhood journals
generally focus on how to create effective programs for young
children; little or no consideration is given to the needs of parents. A
theoretical awareness of some of the potential trade-offs in current
programming is found in a few articles from within a variety of academic
disciplines (anthropology, economics, education, community development,
psychology, agriculture, sociology), illustrative of the fact that the issues
cut across traditional academic boundaries.<p>
<p>
	5. <b>Conceptually.</b> There is an examination of the position which
separated women's productive and reproductive role. There is a move to validate
both roles. Today arguments are being made to the effect that:<p>
<p>
<ol>		a. It is legitimate to support the development of women&#146;s productive
role by strengthening women's reproductive role. This is being done by:
providing monetary or work-related rewards for child care and
education--recognizing that these activities are productive as well as
personally rewarding--and by recognizing women's participation in the provision
of child care as a valid farm of work for women that should be judged as other
jobs are judged--in terms of pay, incremental knowledge, skill development,
security, training, self-esteem, etc.<p>
<p>
		b. It is legitimate to support children's development by focusing on the
development of women in their productive roles. Those characteristics which
facilitate women's development as producers also enhance their parenting role.
By providing better health, increasing women's educational opportunities,
providing access to technical training, assuring that women have access to
income, providing women with credit and land, and freeing women from the long
hours required for household maintenance, children's situation will improve.</ol><p>
<p>
	6. <b>The future.</b> There are some forces at play within the development
world that will have an effect on future programming for women and children. By
in large these forces will lead to a closer examination of women's and
children's needs and their intersect. The changing climate could allow women's
and children's intersecting needs to be brought together conceptually and
programmatically. Put those currently concerned with the issues will have to
provide support to the effort through continued research, through dissemination
of information and through networking and advocacy.<p>
<p>
	7. <b>Strategies.</b> There are a series of strategies that should be employed
to support policy makers and program implementers.<p>
<p>
<ol>		a. There needs to be a distinction made between how programs are
conceptualized and how they are implemented. While it is important at the
design level to consider how to meet the intersecting needs of women and
children, in terms of implementation, adding on may be preferable to trying to
satisfy both sets of needs from the outset. There is a greater likelihood of
success if a program begins with one component, with the early intention of
adding additional components.<p>
<p>
		b. Within some agencies policy is built upon (or evolves from) successful
field projects. Thus it can be argued that the lessons learned from successful
programs need to be crystallized and disseminated. In addition, innovative
field projects need to be developed and implemented to provide further examples
of the ways in which the intersecting needs of women and children can be met
successfully within a range of development efforts.<p>
<p>
		c. It is important to present program planners and implementers with
practical information on how to implement complimentary and supportive program
components; some are willing but have no understanding of what is needed or how
to accomplish the task.<p>
<p>
		d. In both conceptualization and implementation, it is important to be
sensitive to current frames of reference. In working with policy makers it is
important to frame the issue in a Hay that helps them respond to the pressures
they are under within their organization. Likewise, in working with a
community, programs for women and/or children must be begun within the
framework of culturally sanctioned activities.</ol><p>

	Within the paper there is a more complete discussion of what has been learned
to date from project reviews, journals, and interviews with individuals
representing a variety of perspectives, There is a brief description of how
programs for both women and children have evolved over the past fifteen to
twenty years. In addition, there are a range of program examples which have
been cited to illustrate the different ways in which women's and children's
programming has emerged, with some hypotheses about the resulting trade-offs
and/or benefits. In the final section there is a description of current
emphases and themes in the development world that may lend support to or put
constraints on a new conceptualization of the intersecting needs issue. In
addition, a number of suggestions are made regarding strategies which could be
undertaken to help shape policy and programming.<p>
<p>
<b><center>I. INTRODUCTION</center></b><p>
<p>
<b>A. The Problem.</b><p>
<p>
	Mothers and children, children and mothers; their lives are inextricably
intertwined. The experiences of one closely affect the other. Yet the programs
and policies affecting women and young children have usually focused on one
group or the other--seldom on both--despite what would appear to be overlapping
needs, and sometimes, important trade-offs between the two.<p>
<p>
	The potentially conflicting effects of programs focused on the survival and
healthy development of children, or the social and economic well-being of
women, are seldom recognized or admitted by planners and policy makers. The
general lack of awareness is reinforced by organizational and intellectual
compartmentalization which creates barriers to understanding a problem which,
in people's day-to-day lives, cuts across bureaucratic and academic lines. The
ability to conceptually merge the intersecting needs of women and children
could lead to programming that would forestall trade-offs and waste and result
in more effective action for women and children.<p>
<p>
	One step in developing a new conceptualization of programs for women and
children is to look at current programs far both groups and to examine the ways
in which the potentially competing needs have or have not been addressed in
these efforts. Another step is to assess the level of awareness of policy
makers within major donor agencies and to make some educated guesses about the
ways in which current initiatives will play into the issue--either by
maintaining a conceptual and programmatic split between efforts for women and
children, or by providing a new conceptualization of needs and how they can be
met for both groups.<p>
<p>
	Within this paper an attempt will be made to look at the ways in which women
in development programs have evolved and what that has meant in terms of
meeting children's needs, and how early childhood care and education systems
have developed and what that has meant for women. Examples will be provided to
illustrate the evolutionary process and the current state of the art in
programming for both women and children. There will also be a review of current
thinking within major donor agencies which will affect future programming for
women and children. The paper concludes with some suggestions as to appropriate
actions that might be taken to clarify issues and develop policy in support of
programs which promote women's <b>and</b> children's development.<p>
<p>
<b>8. The Methodology</b><p>
<p>
	To gather information on historical trends, current programming efforts and
policy developments three sources of information were used; 1.  journals
related to young children and women in development efforts; 2. project reports
describing program components, and, where they existed, project evaluations;
and 3. interviews with program people within donor agencies, private
foundations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) funded by those 
agencies.<p>
<p>
	Of the three procedures, the interviews were the most productive. Journals
provided very little useful information, By and large, those journals which
focus on women's issues refer to child care only as a support to women's
development; there is no questioning of the child's needs or the
possible effect of such care on the child. On the other hand, journals which
focus on child development, if they make mention of the mother, describe her in
her role as main support for the child; her productive role is not described.<p>
<p>
	 Project documents provided limited information. In reviewing <b>general
development projects</b>--those designed to benefit all those in a given
community-- it was seldom possible to assess how the project affected women,
and almost never was mention made of how if affected children. The problem of
looking for the impact of a program on women in general development programs
has been identified by people doing reviews of a range of efforts (Dixon, 1980;
Helzner, 1984). One of the primary reasons it is hard to identify the effects
of these projects on women and children is that they have not been the focus of
the intervention. If no provision has been made for meeting the needs of women
and children as a project is conceptualized, then the impact of the project on
their lives is likely to go unexamined. As noted by Dixon, "If girls and women
are not specifically identified in project papers as intended beneficiaries,
they are likely to remain invisible in planning and evaluation documents"
(1980, p. 48).<p>
<p>
	Thus, one is forced to look almost exclusively at those projects designed
specifically for women or children, and within these to ask the question of how
the program affected the other group. Once again, however, the issue of
original program focus prevents an intersecting needs analysis of project
effects. In <b>women in development</b> projects child care may be mentioned
as a component of the program that evolved as a project got underway. In a
summary of the Women in Development Office's analysis of USAID projects and how
they did or did not involve women, it was noted, "...several projects have
included facilities for child care which enable women to participate in skills
training or employment and income generating activities." (Horizons, 1985, p.
17). Thus, while project documents let the reader know that child care was
developed in connection with women's projects, there is no information on the
child care system and whether or not it met the needs of either the women or
the children. In order to have any understanding of how the project might
affect women and children it was essential to talk with
someone who actually knew the program.<p>
<p>
	A similar issue occurred in reviewing early childhood care and education
programs (efforts to support the development of young children from birth until
the age at which they enter primary school). Where women were mentioned it was
in terms of (1) how they provided support to the program--through volunteering
in the classroom, preparing meals, making toys for the classroom;
or (2) how there were components in the program designed to educate the mother
in terms of health and nutrition practices--presumably supporting her nurturing
role. Once again, when those who knew the program through first hand experience
could be interviewed a much better understanding of the dynamics of the
situation was provided.<p>
	Thus, overall, interviews proved to be the most beneficial activity--in terms
of learning what has happened in practice during the past ten years; in terms
of assessing current understanding of the issues relating to women's and
children's intersecting needs; and in terms of looking to the future in terms
of both policy and practice and what that will mean for women and
children.<p>
<p>
<b><center>II. PUTTING THE ISSUE IN CONTEXT: A BRIEF HISTORY</center></b><p>
<p>
<b>A. Women in Development: Changing perspectives and Conceptualizations</b><p>
<p>
	It was not until the mid to late 60's that the development world began to look
at women's role in development. At that point in time attention was focused on
designing and implementing projects that could support women's increased
involvement in the development process.<p>
<p>
	As women began to enter the formal wage economy there was an awareness by some
that women's traditional responsibilities would remain intact while women took
on new roles. There was a recognition of the fact that women needed support for
their current child care and household responsibilities in order to fully
participate in development efforts. One area where support was provided was
child care. There was the development of legislation to support the creation of
systems of child care in an attempt to respond to women's needs. What that
would mean for women and children was unclear.<p>
<p>
	Early in the 1970's, a number of people began looking at what it meant for
women to be involved in development projects. The reports were disappointing.
The literature contains many examples of development projects that were
actually having a negative effect on women. As summarized in Tinker &amp;
Bramsen (1976), development planning erred:<p>
<p>
<ol>(a) By omission--that is by failing to notice and utilize the traditional
productive roles which women are playing;<br>
(b) By reinforcement of values already in existence in the society which
restrict women's activities to household, child-bearing, and child-rearing
tasks; and<br>
(c) By addition--that is, by superimposing Western values of what is
appropriate work for women in modern society on developing societies. (p. 5)</ol>
	By and large, the early development programs for women fell within a "welfare"
orientation. As defined by Buvinic (1985),<p>
<p>
<ul>Purely welfare projects are those designed to deliver information, education,
sometimes free handouts (money, food, technology) to poor women in their roles
as homemakers reproducers, and child rearers. Examples are projects in maternal
and child health, hygiene, nutrition, home economics, and home-based
appropriate technologies. (p. 5)</ul><p>
<p>
	Clearly, for women to benefit from development projects, there needed to be a
new way of conceptualizing women's role. In 1975, with the beginning of the
United Nations Decade for Women, there began to be a shift in the way in which
women in development was conceptualized. Ideologically and politically it was
important to get the development world to separate women out--from men, and
from their reproductive role--and focus on women as women.<p>
<p>
	There was a shift in the way women's work was described. There was a new
emphasis on productivity rather than welfare. Women were described in terms of
their <b>productive</b> roles to shift people from seeing women only in their
<b>reproductive</b> role. In addition, it was argued that women should be a
part of the development planning process, not merely "targets of intervention".
Women began to be described and conceptualized as <b>agents</b> of change, not
passive recipients of development programs.<p>
<p>
	As a result of the activities stimulated at the beginning of the decade, many
governments realised they needed to acknowledge and expand the role of women in
national development. Toward this end, programs were developed which focussed
specifically on meeting the needs of women. Women in Development offices were
created within major donor agencies and separate funding was provided for
women's programs. Many things were accomplished during the decade. In the
UNICEF report from Nepal for 1985, there is a statement that summarizes much of
what was accomplished.<p>
<p>
<ul>One of the greatest achievements of...many of the women's projects undertaken
worldwide during the decade of women has been the shift in focus from welfare
to development. The extension of women's areas of concern from an almost
exclusive concentration on the social service sectors...to encompass also the
critical areas of economic development, agriculture, and rural development, and
access to training and investment resources is of key importance... The role
women have played as recipients of services is slowly changing to the role of
equal contributor in the overall process of development. (UNICEF, Nepal Annual
Report, 1985, p. 28)</ol>
	While there has been increased participation of women in the economy of Third
World cultures over the past ten years, to a large extent, this is the result
of the rising poverty of women and families rather than the increased rights of
women. Women's economic survival and the hope of economic progress for women
will depend on their access to formal education, modern labor, and financial
and technological markets. A major challenge to the success of future women in
development efforts lies in reducing the double day still faced by most women,
in improving their health, and in moderating the competing demands on their
time--demands that increase with poverty because women are required to work in
the marketplace to sustain or contribute to the
family budget. To meet that challenge, improvements are required in household
technologies and in child care arrangements.<p>
<p>
<b>8. Children and Development: Early Childhood Care and Education
Programs</b><p>
<p>
	During the last twenty years the situation of the young child in many
developing countries has become an increasing concern due to the rapid rise in
population growth rates. In some countries as much as 30-40% of the population
is under the age of 4. These children are being raised in situations where
health care, sanitation, and nutrition are marginal in spite of massive efforts
by government and citizens to improve conditions. Funds for additional services
are scarce at best. At the same time, there is a realization of the importance
of children's early years in setting the stage for their future growth and
development, and a recognition of the need to consider the country's future
development by investing resources in programs for young children.<p>
<p>
	In an attempt to deal with these facts, a variety of intervention programs
have been designed to specifically target the needs of young children--from
infancy through the pre-school years. There are programs which focus on health
and nutrition issues during the early months and years. There are other early
intervention programs which focus on development issues by providing activities
that will help foster the child's psycho-social and cognitive development. Some
of these programs have shown moderate success rates; most have been
disappointing.<p>
<p>
	Over time, among those whose primary focus has been on the development of
programs for young children, there has been an increasing awareness of the fact
that children cannot be "treated" in isolation. In order for programs for young
children to be effective, the family--in particular the mother--must be seen as
a part of the child's life. In essence, programs designed to
affect children's nutrition and/or survival are dependent on the adults in the
child's life for their success. The younger the child, the truer the
statement.<p>
<p>
<b>C. Women and Children and Development</b><p>
<p>
	Both women's and children's needs tend to be Pet when economic and social
conditions are favorable. In "ideal" conditions, a program directed to
satisfying women's needs meets to some extent the needs of children, and vice
versa. Potential conflicts are easily mediated by the presence of adequate
support systems or by exercising available options. However, when conditions
are harsh, there are competing demands to be met with limited resources;
choices have to be made. This presents a dilemma to policy makers and program
developers. They must assess the trade-offs of investment in one arena rather
than another. A range of women's and children's programs will be described in
the next section to illustrate some of the potential trade-offs which have
resulted from a variety of well-intentioned programs designed to meet the needs
of poor women or children.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b><center>III. WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN DEVELOPMENT: PROGRAM EXAMPLES</center></b><p>
<p>
<p>
	A range of women in development and early childhood care and education
programs have been reviewed in an attempt to assess the effect of a program for
one group on. the other group, in all the programs included there is a clear
connection between women's and children's needs. Within some of the programs
described it has been possible to successfully meet the intersecting
needs of the two groups; there are other programs where components have
developed components with no real understanding for what they might mean for
women and/or children. Program examples have been grouped into five categories
that represent different ways of including women and children in development
programming. To facilitate differentiation of the types of programmes each
category has a pictoral representation. Categorizations are based on different
combinations of the following symbols, each of which represents one or more
aspects of women or children's development that has historically served as a
program focus.<p>
<p>
<img src=balls1.gif alt="Figure 1">
<p>
<b>A. Single-focus Programs</b><p>
<p>
	Within this category are those programs that have sought to have a significant
effect on <b>either</b> women <b>or</b> children by developing a program that essentially
provides survival or development opportunities for one group without regard for
the other group.<p>
<p>
<img src=balls2.gif alt="Figure 1">
<p>
	<b>1.</b> The <b>child health and nutrition</b> efforts can beet be exemplified by
some of the early nutritional rehabilitation programs designed to decrease
infant mortality during the first year of life. A classic example of an effort
where the child was treated in isolation was developed in Chile in the early
70's. A rehabilitation program was developed for malnourished infants.
Children's
nutritional, health and stimulation needs were provided for within nutrition
centers. Once the child gained age-appropriate weight and recovered some of
his/her developmental delays, the child was returned to the family. Within few
months, however, many of the children re-appeared at the nutrition centers,
once again malnourished. What happened was that children were returned to the
environment within which they originally became malnourished. During the time
that the children were being rehabilitated, nothing was happening to change
their home environment. Thus the conditions which produced the malnutrition
continued to exist. Returning to that environment,
the children once again became malnourished. As a result of these experiences,
those implementing the program realized the importance of looking at the family
system and including the mother in the program (Evans, 1977).<p>
<p>
<b>	2. Child development</b> programs for children are found world-wide. They
most commonly take the fore of a pre-school program designed to provide the
child (ages 3-5 or 6) with a range of experiences that better prepare the child
for the primary school experience.<p>
<p>
	Within Southeast Asia there are a number of examples of national efforts which
have been developed to provide a pre-school experience for the urban poor and
rural child. In Thailand, for example, the Ministry of Education provides
grants to target communities to develop pre-primary programs. Grants go to
areas identified as "the rural impoverished, the urban deprived, the
remote and the barren, and the community with 50% of the children speaking
other than Thai." (Piya-Ajariya, 1983, p.47).<p>
<p>
	Korea represents another example where a pre-school program, offered in a
primary school, has been developed specifically to meet the needs of the urban
and rural poor. To help develop the pre-primary program, the Korean Institute
for Research in Behavioral Sciences (KIRBS), has been provided support by
UNICEF to create a curriculum for the rural and urban poor and to implement it
in areas of most need. A mid-term evaluation of the project indicated that the
program was successful in reaching poor children. One of the issues raised by
the evaluation was the fact that parent involvement was to be an important part
of the project, but when the evaluation occurred there was little evidence of a
parent education or parent involvement program. (Crellin, et.al., 1984, p. 29)
Most likely this is because the program was developed without consideration for
parental needs.<p>
<p>
	<b>3.</b> In terms of<b> programs that focus on women only</b>, there are a number of
examples of income-generating, agricultural, and home management projects that
are designed to provide women with more income and/or decrease the demands on
women's time. While it can be anticipated that the projects may, in fact,
address the needs of children, there is no discussion of this in project
documents.<p>
<p>
	A primary example of this is found within a recent series of case studies on
<b>Women's Roles and Gender Differences in Development</b>, supported by the
Population Council. While the authors were able to identify ways in which women
had been affected in a range of development projects, no attempt was made to
look at the ways in which the projects might have an impact on the
lives of young children.<p>
<p>
	Besides the fact that children were not defined as project beneficiaries at
the beginning, and thus their lives were not looked at over time, there appears
to be another issue operating here. In several of the interviews it was made
clear that one of the reasons that children and/or women
reproductive role are not discussed is that the authors of the documents are
aware of the attitudes of their readers. The reports are written for policy
makers, planners, current and potential funders who the writers feel do not as
yet take women seriously as producers. If mention is made of women's
reproductive role it is felt it would weaken the case for viewing women as
producers. However, those operating women and development programs, are aware
of the trade-offs for women and children that exist within the program on a
day-to-day basis. Some of them are concerned about the effect of these
trade-offs over time, but don't feel they have an arena within which to sake
their concerns known without raising major questions about women in development
programming.<p>
<p>
	By in large, what we have learned from single-focused programs is that they
seldom have hoped-for success rates. While many of these projects show
short-term gains, they seldom have outcomes that endure. This is frequently
because the programs do not acknowledge all the things that impinge on people's
lives. A broader perspective is needed. To some extent the programs in the next
category take this broader perspective. But as is evident from project
descriptions, they miss the mark in critical ways.<p>
<p>
<b>B. &#148;Support&#148; programs</b><p>
<p>
	Within this category are those efforts where programming has been created for
one group in support of the other groups' development. However, in taking this
approach, the needs of the first group may not be recognized and/or taken into
consideration.<p>
<p>
<img src=balls4.gif alt="Figure">
<p>
	1. In support of the child's survival and development,<p>
<p>
		a. <b>Women's involvement in child survival.</b> The current efforts to
support children's basic survival needs build on important technological
advances promising major reductions in infant and child mortality. However, the
successful delivery of the activities associated with child survival depend on
the availability, knowledge, skills and competencies of a significant care
giver in the child's life. (For example, among the BOGI strategies,
<b>G</b>rowth monitoring, <b>O</b>ral Rehydration Therapy and <b>I</b>mmunization can
be provided by care givers other than the mother. <b>B</b>reast-feeding, however,
requires the mother.) Focussing on the woman (mother) in these efforts comes
from a recognition of women's traditional role in the provision of health
care.<p>
<p>
<ul>The role of women in maintaining the health of the family, especially children,
is paramount. They administer the first line of treatment in the home and
usually decide the following steps that may need to be taken. They are largely
responsible for the feeding and nutrition of the family and most aspects of
child care, including mental as well as physical development. (WHO, 1984,
p.3)</ul><p>
<p>
	No one would argue with this statement. Women have been responsible for the
health and well-being of young children. A few questions do come to mind,
however. "Is it possible for the majority of women -- overworked, physically
weak and emotionally strained -- to acquire and apply these new techniques? How
do <b>women</b> benefit from the scientific advances for improved health and
nutrition of children?" (Mauras, 1985, p.2).<p>
<p>
	To answer these questions it is necessary to look at the reality of women's
lives in terms of their limited resources (time, money, education, and health),
economic needs and opportunities, work requirements, and household
responsibilities. Then it is possible to determine whether or not, and in what
ways, they can actually participate in the child survival activities and of
what benefit they are to women. Few of those agencies promoting child survival
have begun to address how the requirements for implementation of the strategies
affect women positively and/or negatively.<p>
<p>
		b. <b>Women's involvement in child development.</b> Not only are women
expected to be involved in child survival efforts, it is also assumed that they
can be involved in child development programs once survival has been assured.
Programs within this category are generally viewed as some type of "parent
education".<p>
<p>
			(1) One example of a program that clearly requires extensive maternal input
is <b>in-home parent training</b>, as exemplified by the Non-formal Home-based Initial
Education Project, implemented in Peru. The goal of which his "to assure that
parents have adequate childrearing and caretaking skills and to guide and help
them implement these skills in their daily routine." (Jesien, et.al., 1979,
p.7) Recognizing the demands on families living in poverty, the intent of the
program is not to create yet another demand on already scarce time and energy
resources, "but rather to enhance the quality of the interaction between child
and parent in the time that is available."
(Jesien, et. al., 1979, p.7).<p>
<p>
	In the program, non-professional community women are trained to provide weekly
home visits to the mother and child dyad. These home visitors
(<b>animadoras</b>) work with 10-12 families and, with the aid of a supervisor,
develop an individualized curriculum for the child (ages 3-5), based on his or
her developmental profile. The <b>animadora</b> uses the developmental profile
with the mother. From it she suggests specific activities the mother can do
with the child during the week to stimulate the child's development, The mother
is required to make note of the activities she does with the child and to
assist the <b>animadora</b> in charting the child's progress within the
profile.<p>
<p>
	A research design has been implemented as a part of the project so that
outcomes for children can be determined, What is not found in the evaluation is
any assessment of what the program has meant for the mothers involved. Has it
required additional time? If so, what has that meant for their other
activities? How has the project affected women's view of themselves--as mothers
and as women? Clearly if this type of program is to become a vehicle for
supporting children's overall development, there needs to be an understanding
of what the program weans for women and their role as agents of development.<p>
<p>
			(2) <b>Parent education can also be done in groups.</b> An example comes from
Indonesia where a parent education program, the <b>Bina Keuaraga and Balita</b>
(BKB) project, has been implemented in connection with the National Family
Nutrition Program. As the EKB project was developed a number of sectors were
involved--Women's Development, Education, Health, Socio-cultural Development,
and Welfare. The purpose of the project is to "enhance the knowledge, awareness
and skills of mothers of children under five and other members of the family so
as to enable them to provide [a] conducive educational environment to ensure
the comprehensive development of children under five." (Stein, 1985, p. 1).
Field workers--women from the community being served--are provided with
training in child development and adult education. They then provide workshops
for mothers at nutrition centers. In the workshops mothers receive child
development information, their role as primary educators of the child is
emphasized, and they are provided with easy activities that they can do with
their children at home. In addition, a toy library has been. established.
Mothers can take toys here with them and use them with their children. When
they return the toys the following week, they can take out something else.
(UNlCEF Board Report, 1985)<p>
<p>
	There is no evaluation of the program in terms of how it affects women. It is
unclear what type of women participate in the program--whether the hours of the
meetings have been established to meet their needs, whether or not women are
actually able to carry out the activities with their children, and if so, with
what level of success. These are just some of the questions that need to be
asked.<p>
<p>
			(3) Another type of <b>group focused parent education</b> program comes from
Chile. Known as the <b>Padres y Hijos</b> program, it focuses on working with
groups of parents, representing the poorest of the poor, to better the quality
of family and community life. The program uses parents' interest in supporting
the child's development as a way of getting parents involved in larger
community development efforts. It consists of weekly meetings where a series of
child care "theses" are introduced. The leader presents pictures that depict
daily events that offer opportunities for stimulating the child's learning. The
leader guides the discussion, focusing on what the picture shows, what the
child is doing developmentally, and what the parent can do to support the
child's learning in that situation. Parents up with activities and games they
can use with the child (ages 9-6). Toys are also available. Parents can take
them home for the week, or use them as models and make their own.<p>
<p>
	The program was begun in 1979 by the <b>Centro de Investigaciones y Desarrollo
de la Educacion</b> (CIDE), a private research and development center in Chile.
Those operating the program feel it is a cost-effective way of working with
parents to educate them about child growth and development. The group meetings
also serve as a catalyst for the development of other community-based
activities that ultimately improve the standard of living within the community
(Mauras, et. al., 1979, p.18). Current documentation provides no indication of
how the overall program affects the lives of women or children.<p>
<p>
	2. The equivalent program for women in this category, while not quite
analogous, is<b> nationally mandated/sponsored day care</b>. In this instance
the ultimate goal is women's participation in the formal wage economy. Programs
for children are developed to support women's productive role, not necessarily
to promote the child's development. It is assumed that children's needs will be
adequately met in the child care situation. Put, in reality the child care
program may or may not take into account children's needs.<p>
<p>
	Not only may this strategy have a detrimental effect on children, but it may
not support women's development either. Many national governments, in
recognition of the day care needs of working women, have passed legislation
requiring businesses employing more than a given number of women to provide
daycare for the children of their employees. One result of this legislation has
been for companies to limit the number of women they are willing to hire. Thus,
an initiative designed to support women's entrance into the labour market may
have the unintended consequence of restricting women's opportunities.<p>
<p>
	Another approach is for the government itself to support the costs of daycare.
An example comes from Iraq. There have been two major thrusts to the
development of child care in Iraq. Since the mid 1970s there has been a
government policy to increase women's participation in development. To support
women taking on new roles, day care programs were developed. More recently,
since the war with Iran, there has been a need for more women to enter formal
employment because men are involved in military activities. This gave added
impetus to the development of day care.<p>
<p>
	There are two major governmental organizations responsible for the development
of child care within Iraq: the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs and the
<b>General Federation of Iraqi Women</b> (GWIF)--each operating about half of
the 162 currently registered child care centers. The current systems of
provision are modeled after center-based programs as found in Eastern Europe
and Western countries. They are not being used to capacity and are costly to
operate. They are generally available to middle-income professional women.
Those women most in need of day care for their children cannot afford the
current systems of provision, nor are their hours of operation conducive to the
needs of many women. At this point in time the Ministry and the GFIW are
seeking ways to integrate their systems of child care and to develop lower cost
alternatives that will make child care available to a larger percentage of the
eligible children and provide the necessary support poor women need to enter
the wage economy.<p>
<p>
	In sum, the efforts for women and children included in this category exemplify
an awareness that programming for one group will have an effect on the other.
However, these programs are built on some untested assumptions about the needs
of and appropriate services for both groups.<p>
<p>
<b>C. Programs with Components for both Women and Children</b><p>
<p>
	Within this category are programs within which there is, to some extent, a
recognition of the intersecting needs of women and young children, where an
attempt has been made to address at least some of those needs within a single
delivery system. But, for the most part, these programs represent a "lost
opportunity" in the sense that they are not doing the most they could to meet
the multiple and intersecting needs of both groups. This imbalance is found
primarily among early childhood care and education programs where there is
integrated programming for the child while the programming for women focusses
only on strengthening their reproductive role.<p>
<p>
<img src=balls5.gif alt="Figure"><p>
	An example of a program within this category is the <b>Integrated Child
Development Services</b> (ICDS) program in India. The need for massive programs
which address the needs of young children is most evident in a country like
India where there are more than 109 million children under the age of
6--constituting 16% of the population. In 1974 India adopted a National Policy
for Children. The policy statement is an expression of India's commitment to
insure the delivery of comprehensive child development services to all
children. One of the first targets for the effort is the "poorest of the poor
found in urban slums and urban areas", particularly children in "scheduled
castes and tribes." (Sadka, 1984, p.3).<p>
<p>
	To develop a comprehensive service for these children, a program was created
to meet the following goals which, incidentally, illustrate the imbalance in
terms of addressing women's and children's needs.<p>
<p>
<ul><li>  to reduce the incidence of low birth weight and severe malnutrition among
children;<br>
 <li>to bring down the mortality and morbidity rates among children 0-6 years
old;<br>
<li> to reduce school dropout rates through early stimulation programs for children
3-6 years old;<br>
 <li>to provide the environmental conditions necessary for mental, physical and
social development of children;<br>
 <li>to enhance the ability of mothers to provide proper care for their children;
and<br>
<li> to achieve effective co-ordination at the policy and implementation levels
among government departments to promote child development. (Sadka, 1984,
p.12)</ul>
	In order to meet these goals it was determined that the program needed to
provide: non-formal pre-school education; immunizations, regular, periodic
health check-ups, supplementary nutrition; appropriate medical referral
services; and nutrition and health education for women.<p>
<p>
	An <b>Anganwadi</b>--a children's house--serves as the base of operations
within the community. The program operates through a three tiered staffing
system. At the community level is the <b>Anganwadi worker</b> (AWW). This
person plays the key role in the community; she is the primary link between
community members and the government. She is responsible for the day-to-day
operation of the program. Above the AWW is a Supervisor who provides AWWs with
on-going
training and support. Above her is the <b>Child Development Project Officer</b>
(CDPO), who provides the linkage between the ICDS program and government
administration.<p>
<p>
	All families in the area to be served are surveyed to identify the poorest.
Those families with children under 6 and/or where the woman is pregnant or
lactating, are served in the <b>Anganwadis</b>. Regular examinations are
provided by Lady Health Visitors and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives. Children and
pregnant women are immunized on a scheduled basis. Three hundred days a year
food is distributed. Families are encouraged to bring the children to the
centers for regular feeding. But the fixed hours do not always respond to the
work needs of women. Children's weight and height is monitored. Those with
severe malnutrition are given additional food supplements, and acute cases are
referred to medical services.<p>
<p>
	A pre-school program has been developed for 3-5 year olds who attend the
center three hours a day. While there is no formally structured curriculum, the
local staff are encouraged to develop activities that stimulate the child.
Frequently there is parental pressure to teach the alphabet and beginning
numeracy. An additional educational service is non-formal training in nutrition
and health organized for mothers and pregnant women. These sessions are open to
all women, aged 15-45, with priority given to pregnant and nursing women and
women whose children suffer from repeated malnutrition.<p>
<p>
	Funding for the program has come from both governmental and non-governmental
sources. The initial costs of establishing a program are provided by the
Ministry of Social Welfare. The costs of the supplementary feeding program are
borne by the state governments; and the on-going
operational costs are the responsibility of the Central government.
International donor agencies have also been involved in funding aspects of the
program: UNICEF assisted in planning and implementation beginning in 1975.
Since 1982 other international agencies--WFP, CAFE, NORAD, USAID--have been
contributing in a variety of ways.<p>
<p>
	Two major evaluations of the program have been conducted. One occurred in 1978
and the second was in 1982. The evaluations focus on health indicators for both
women and children. However, there is no further discussion of how the program
affects either women or children.<p>
<p>
<b>D. Programs Meeting the Intersecting Weeds of Women and Children</b><p>
<p>
	Within this category are the programs that appear to be meeting the multiple
and intersecting needs of women and children. Included are 1. examples of
programs that have evolved overtime to meet both needs, and 2. programs that
were begun with a clear conceptualization of the potentially competing needs
and trade-offs where specific program components were created
to assure that both sets of needs were met.<p>
<p>
<img src=balls5.gif alt="Figure"><p>
	1. Evolutionary programs.<p>
<p>
		a. <b>Child care programs created to support women's employment that then
evolve to support women's broader development and/or provide income for other
women.</b><p>
<p>
			(1) The <b>Mobile Creche</b> program in India is interesting in that it
began as an integrated program of child care to support women employed in
industry. Once the child care system was established, additional program
components were developed to support women in other ways.<p>
<p>
	India is a country that has had legislation in support of employer sponsored
child care since 1964. For many years it was not enforced. However, over the
years there was pressure to comply. Within the construction industry there was
particular concern. Many women are employed within the industry, and with the
frequent moves required as buildings are completed and new ones begun, women
and children are forced to relocate. Women are not able to rely on extended
family members to care for their children. Thus a program of early childhood
care and education Has begun for these workers and their families. A variety of
private voluntary organizations, working with the construction industry,
created the "mobile creche" system, which began in 1969. The early childhood
care and education program is established where the women are working, and
moves with them from site to site. Mobile Creches have also been established to
serve the children of street cleaners, rag pickers, and other families
representing the lowest social status groups in
India.<p>
<p>
	There are three levels to the program. The first is a creche for infants and
young children (from 3-4 weeks to age 3). The second is called a nursery
program and is for 3-6 year olds. The third is an elementary program for
children from 6-12 years of age. Within the creche program
the primary focus is on child health and nutrition. The majority of the
children are malnourished when they enter the program. Thus, there is an
emphasis on providing them with proper foods and educating the parents about
nutrition. Within the nursery program the health and nutritional status of the
child remain an important part of the program. The children are monitored
weekly by a physician, and growth charts are kept on the children. In addition,
however, there is an emphasis on cognitive and psyche-social development. One
of the goals is to help prepare the children for the formal school system.<p>
<p>
	The third level, the elementary program, was developed for children who
traditionally would have been taking care of their younger siblings. Because
these children are now in an ECCE program, the older children should be going
to school. The elementary program was developed to prepare these children to
enter school and be placed within an age equivalent grade.<p>
<p>
	Staff within the mobile creche system are from the lower middle class.
Originally the staff received their training within the traditional teacher
training institutes. However, it was discovered that this training was not
appropriate. For example, they discovered that staff needed literacy training
and training in basic health care. Thus, over time, the Mobile Creche program
developed their own training for staff. Those with the aptitude are given
additional training in nutrition, community work and medical social work. Thus,
the Mobile Creche program meets the needs of low-income women, providing some
with child care and job opportunities and training for women who are not likely
to have qualified for training within the formal educational system.<p>
<p>
	As the program has evolved, classes in adult education have been added. There
are literacy programs, nutrition classes, and political discussion groups. Thus
the program can be envisioned as a spiral--it evolved in response to women's
needs and then cycled back to meeting a wide range of women's needs at a higher
level while appropriately meeting the needs of young children.<p>
<p>
			(2) Another example comes from Tarqui, a small community on the outskirts of
Quito, Ecuador. Within this community a <b>family day care</b> program designed to
meet child care needs of women working outside the home also meets the
employment needs of community women.<p>
<p>
	Within the community of Tarqui a child care center had been established for
3-5 year old children. It was meeting the needs of many families in the
community. Yet there were still children being left at home alone while their
mothers went to work. A survey was done in the community to identify families
with children in need of care. Community leaders who had participated in the
survey came together to determine how to meet the needs of these families. In
the meetings that followed a family day care system of provision was presented
as an alternative to the creation of another center. The idea took hold.<p>
<p>
	Based on their interest, their location in the community, the adequacy of
their homes, and their personal characteristics, six community women were
chosen to become day care providers. These six mothers received some initial
training in child development, health, and nutrition; regular in-service
training is also provided. They are supplied with a small table and chairs.
They are also given appropriate toys. They are provided with food supplements
for the children, and regular medical check-ups are provided through the Tarqui
Cooperative, which serves as the base for the program.<p>
<p>
	An extensive evaluation has been conducted since the project began. There have
been some clear project impacts in terms of women's development. The mothers
who have been trained as day care providers have, in essence, established small
businesses, In the process of the project these women have learned bookkeeping
and record-keeping skills. They also have a new image of
themselves as wage-earners. While they began by seeing their work as an
extension of their care giving role within their own family, they soon began to
see their work with the young children as a legitimate job. They began to see
their worth and to recognize the skills and knowledge that they have and are
acquiring as a result of being involved in the project.<p>
<p>
	One example of the way in which this new image has manifested itself is the
women's demand to be recognized as employees of the Cooperative. At the
beginning of the project it was decided that parents would pay fees to the day
care mothers. It soon became evident that parents could not pay the full fee.
Thus a sliding-scale fee schedule Has established. The monies received from
parents were then supplemented by the Cooperative. As the project progressed,
the day care mothers realized that although they were getting money from the
Cooperative, they were not receiving the benefits that other Cooperative staff
were receiving (health care, insurance, and job security). The women began
arguing that they should be paid a regular salary. Many cooperative members
made the case that the women should not be paid salaries because their work is
a "contribution" to the community. The day care mothers were not willing to buy
this argument. When the providers actually resigned they gained public support
for their position. Clearly the women are finding their "voice" within the
community and coming to value their work in economic terms, and so are other
members of the community.<p>
<p>
			(3) Another example comes from Brazil. In 1979 the <b>Centro de Estudos
Supletivos de Narandiba</b> (CESUN) was established to provide nonformal
education and vocational training to low-income peoples. One of the group's
activities has been the development of women's programs. As CESUN began to plan
programs, a problem arose. While "the women expressed interest in the training,
they asked what they would do with their children while they attended
sessions." (Rocha et al., 1983, p.10).<p>
<p>
	Following a series of discussions it was determined that CESUN should not only
establish a child care center, but it should also develop a care givers
training course to provide staff for the center and to provide trained staff to
other child care centers that were being developed in the community. Thus, one
of the vocational training courses offered through CESUN is Caretaking.
Within the 160 hour training course women are taught child development,
nutrition, health and first aid, and techniques for helping children learn.
They also discuss the economic and social context of women's work, legislation
relating to labor and women's rights, the relationship of women's economic
activity for family planning, and community relations. (Rocha, et.al., 1983, p.
7-8). Thus, in addition to meeting the immediate needs of women who wanted to
participate in training, a course was developed that provided women with
marketable skills and knowledge. Not incidentally, what they learned in the
course also helped them in their own parenting role.<p>
<p>
			(4) Another example copes from Mauritius where the <b>Family Planning
Association</b> (FPA) of Mauritius recognized that many women needed child
care. The existing programs were too expensive for women with low incomes. So,
the FPA created a day care center next door to their own facilities. The center
provides care for 40 children from 3-5 years of age. When mothers bring their
children to the center they are encouraged to participate in meetings held at
the family planning clinic. There are weekly lectures on child health and
family planning. In addition, home visits can be arranged to accommodate the
schedule of working mothers. Thus, in response to
the needs of women in the community, services were created by the Family
Planning Association. As women brought their children to the center and
received training, they began to take part in other FPA activities. In this way
the goals of the FPA are being realised.<p>
<p>
	To some extent the center has also begun to address the need for women to
engage in income generating activities. The center provides on-the-job training
for young women interested in working in early childhood programs. After the
young women have participated in the training program for two years they can
establish their own child care center. The City Council of Port-Louis is
interested in the ECCE model as developed by the Family Planning Association
and has expressed an interest in establishing similar programs in other parts
of the city. The Mauritius Women's Self-Help Association has plans to set up
similar centers in other towns.<p>
<p>
			b. <b>Programs developed in response to community defined needs.</b><p>
<p>
	A good example comes from Malaysia, where an innovative program, the <b>Sang
Kancil</b> project, has been developed within the squatter settlements of Kuala
Lumpur.<b>[*]</b> The project was begun by health sector personnel interested in
establishing primary health care centers within<b> kampungs</b>, or districts,
in the settlements, Meetings were held with community members to determine
their needs and priorities. They were Rest interested in having a child care
system for young children, and in creating income generating activities for
women. Health care was not seen as a priority. Those involved in developing the
project listened to the community. Rather than building a health center, they
established a pre-school and an income generating project. When these were well
established, then it was possible to introduce primary health care, which is
non widely accepted. One person involved in the project summarizes the
experience as follows:<p>
<p>
<ul>Listening to the community is an important step...it has the advantage of
providing information quickly on areas of concern...it also has the role of
validating information received from more formal sources...The development of
<b>Sang Kancil</b> has illustrated clearly (that) the initial thrust of the
programme to introduce MCH had to be changed...Entry was channeled through the
pre-school system and income generating activities. (Yusof, 1984, p.26)</ul>
	The <b>Sang Kancil</b> model now consists of three components--maternal and
child health clinics, a pre-school program, and income generating activities
which have become self-supporting, The project began as an action research
effort at 3 sites. It is now a national program model and is being implemented
in 13 settlements,<p>
<p>
	The Malaysian example illustrates the way in which a part of the national
health sector has been able to meet their own goals by establishing programs
for women and children which fall outside the health sector.<p>
<p>
	<b>[*]</b>	It is widely recognized that the environment within squatter settlements is
threatening to people's health--physically, mentally and in terms of
psycho-social development. Squatter settlements are a growing phenomenon in the
developing world. "The current estimate of the population in slums, squatters
and shanty towns in developing countries is 50% of the total urban population."
(Yusof, 1984, p.7) At the policy level there is difficulty in providing
services for squatters. Urban squatters occupy the land illegally. Therefore
they are not entitled to city services--water, sewage, medical care, education,
etc. On the other hand, many squatter settlements are stable communities,
including people from a variety of income levels. Even those who have the
finances to leave the area often stay. There are a variety of reasons for this:
affordable housing may not be available outside the settlements; families may
have a well developed support system within the settlement that would be lost
to them if they moved elsewhere, and/or individuals may have acquired a
leadership position within the settlements that they could not obtain in other
parts of the city. Thus, strategies are being sought to meet the needs of
squatter populations--strategies which recognize, value, and build upon the
complex social systems which exist in the settlements. Developers of the
<u>Sang Kancil</u> project were able to do this.<p>
<p>
	2. Programs where the initial conceptualization included awareness of and
plans to meet the intersecting needs of women and children.<p>
<p>
		a. The <b>Melka Oba Cooperative</b> in Ethiopia is a good example of how the
income-generating needs of women were meshed with infants' and young children's
needs for quality care. Within Melka Oba a cooperative was started; both men
and women are members of the cooperative. The work of the cooperative centers
around a fruit orchard. As work schedules were being developed it became clear
that provision had to be made for the children. Women did not want to leave
them at home alone, nor did they want to take them to the orchard with them.
The members of the cooperative requested that the government provide a day care
for children from 45 days through 6 years old. Various government agencies got
involved and funds were provided by UNICEF for the development of a creche and
pre-school program for 104 children.<p>
<p>
	To this point, the description of the <b>Melka Oba Cooperative</b> program sounds
like the way in which other child care programs have been developed. But this
program has a new twist. Women are given time off from their work to
breast-feed their youngest children and to take their children to and from
school. However, this does not mean that they lose wages because they are
providing care for the children. The system is set up so that women can earn
work points by providing this care. Thus women do not have to give up income to
provide care for their children; in fact nurturing activities can provide them
with income. The program is being replicated in Yetnora, and other districts
are interested in implementing similar programs.<p>
<p>
		b. A second example comes from <b>Nepal</b>, which has been the site of a
number of successful women in development program efforts. The <b>Production
Credit for Rural Women</b> project has been successful in providing women with
the economic support they need to develop income-generating activities. In
addition, quality care programs have been created for young children as a
result of the work of Save the Children. A new project that is still on the
drawing board is known as GATE (<b>Girls Access to Education</b>). The GATE
project revolves around women's centers in rural villages. The design of the
project includes explicit attention to child care through the centers, (1) as a
way of freeing girls (older siblings) to continue in school; (2) as an impetus
to getting women to organize; and (3) as a means of improving the survival and
healthy development of young children--particularly girls for whom it is hoped
that preparation for school will reduce the chance of their dropping out.<p>
<p>
	As the project has been designed, a number of national and international
organizations have been involved in supporting the different components. The
project has recently received approval from the Nepali government and,
apparently, is to be implemented through a women's association, rather than the
Ministry of Education. The project has been slow getting started. One reason
for this may be the multi-sectoral involvement. Many "agendas" have to be
fulfilled and there may be difficulty in determining who should take the lead.
The hope is that even though the women's association will manage the project,
the other sectors will continue their involvement and maintain
their commitment to the overall effort.<p>
<p>
<b>E. Women Initiated Programs</b><p>
<p>
	This category stands apart from the others in the sense that it includes
programs which have been developed by the community itself. The program that
has evolved Has begun because the group or community members felt a need for a
program. Over time outside assistance may or may not have been provided to
support the initiative. Many of the programs in this category have the
potential to meet the intersecting needs of women and children, but there are
come real trade-offs for both groups as a result of the ways in which the
programs are evolving.<p>
<p>
<img src=balls7.gif alt="Figure">
<p>
	1. <b>In Ghana, the Accra Market Women's Association</b> was interested in
starting a child care program for their children while they were involved in
buying and selling. They approached the Accra City Council, which agreed to
fund the program. A committee was formed, consisting of members from the
Women's Association, the City Council, the Department of Social Welfare (which
is mandated to oversee ECCE programmes), the Ministry of Health, and the
Ministry of Water and Sewage. A building near the market was refurbished. It
now serves 200 children, from infancy through 5 1/2 years of age. It operates
under the Administration of the Regional Medical Officer of Health. Thus it has
a strong health and nutrition focus. Mothers of infants are encouraged to come
to the center to breast-feed then. This is relatively easy since the women work
only a few steps from the child care facility and have some flexibility in
terms of being able to take the time necessary to come to the center.<p>
<p>
	Children are provided with a morning snack and a full lunch. To enter the
program children must have a physical examination and appropriate
immunizations. Once a month a public health nurse inspects the facilities,
provides immunizations as needed, and completes children's medical charts. In a
report on the project, the following conclusion was drawn:<p>
<p>
<ul>The Malata Market Day Care Centre experience has been a successful one largely
because of the support the centre has received from the very initial stages,
from appropriate agencies together with the keen interest of  the mothers, who
work in close proximity to the centre. (WHO/UNICEF, 1982, p.23)</ul>

	2. Another <b>initiative undertaken in relation to women's work place was
begun in Senegal</b> in 1962. Women who were part of an Animation feminine
center, proposed to those operating the centers (animatrices) that a day care
center be started where children could be cared for while women worked in the
fields. The day care was proposed by the women,<p>
<p>
<ul>to resolve the problem of caring for their young children while they and their
older daughters under-took the arduous task of planting out the rice.
Entrusting the children to older sisters who were still too small to work in
the fields was a solution that did not provide sufficient guarantees of safety:
and leaving them on the edge of the rice fields meant they would be exposed to
all the vagaries of the climate--humidity, ran, direct sun, etc--as well as to
the attacks of wild animals, especially poisonous snakes. (Bashizi, 1979, p.
166-167)</ul>
 	The <b>animatrices</b> agreed to establish the day care program as long as the
women's center did not have to pay for the program. (An interesting position
for a women's center to take!) So, mothers shared responsibility for the
program. Some planted a community garden from which the children could he fed
while they Here in the center. Other women rotated responsibility for
taking care of the children and tending the garden. The first ECCE center began
in July, 1962, and operated for 2 1/2 months during the nest difficult part of
the agricultural reason--when the rice crop is transplanted. During the first
year 110 children between one and five years of age were provided for in the
center. Since that tire day care centers have spread throughout Casamance (one
of eight administrative districts in Senegal).<p>
<p>
	The centers operate under the Department of <b>Animation rurale, Promotion
humaine</b>. Community developers within the Department quickly saw the
potential of these centers; they could be used as a base from which a variety
of social services could be offered. They began to offer training to community
volunteers who worked in the centers. They also began to offer adult
education courses in nutrition, health, hygiene, disease prevention, water
purification, etc. Through the centers they also offer treatment for such
diseases as malaria and conjunctivitis.<p>
<p>
	The key to this effort from the beginning has been that the program is
"essentially and fundamentally a people's initiative". (Bashizi, 1979, p.171).
The goal is to keep it under the control of the community and to continue to
use the program to support community development efforts while it provides a
much needed service to women and children.<p>
<p>
	3. A third example, which represents the <b>initiative of women in rural
communities</b>, comes from Zimbabwe. For many years a small percentage of
Zimbabwe's children aged 0-6 years, mainly in urban areas, were able, through
private means, to attend pre-schools, play centres, and creches. In the more
rural areas, pre-schools did not exist. In 1980, the government of Zimbabwe,
through the Ministry of Education and Culture, took the initiative to plan a
national early childhood care and education program. The Ministry established a
commission of inquiry which undertook an extensive nationwide investigation of
current ECCE activities and produced a report in 1981.<p>
<p>	According to the report, hundreds of women in the rural areas, with no support
from the government, have started some form of early childhood care and
education activity for their young children. The push from rural areas for ECCE
programs has come about as a result of:<p>
<p>
<ul>1) the burgeoning population growth which stands nationally at more than four
percent; and according to 1982 Census projections, more than 23% of the total
population is under 6 years of age; 2) the need felt by parents to overcome the
legacies of the colonial past by giving children a &#147;head start&#148; in
the schooling and socialization process; and 3) the pressure of mothers to free
themselves for short periods from child care in order to participate in wage
earning or enterprise to supplement family income. Whatever the reasons,
proliferation of self-help community-supported pre-schools is occurring in
areas where health care, sanitation and nutrition are marginal. (Perry, 1983,
p. 1)</ul>
	The conditions under which the more than 4,400 village ECCE programs operate
vary considerably. They range from programs operated under trees, to programs
in small buildings with mud-daubed nails and thatched roofs, to programs that
take place in the church sanctuary, to elaborate facilities constructed and
maintained by municipal support.<p>
<p>
A typical ECCE program consists of upwards to 85 children, with only one or two
mothers (generally untrained), caring for the children. Parents have little or
no resources to pay for the program; many use the bartering system to support
their child's participation. What this means is that nest teachers (all of whom
are women) receive little or no pay for their work.<p>
<p>
	Some of these programs receive direct or indirect training and support from
non-governmental agencies, such as VOICE (<b>Voluntary Organizations in
Community Enterprise</b>), OXFAM/US/UK, church groups (Methodist, Catholic,
Seventh Day Adventist, Lutheran) and other special interest groups. At the
present time the Ministry of Community Development and Women's Affairs has been
given the mandate to coordinate ECCE programming throughout the country.<p>
<p>
<ul>The Ministry is well aware of the energy generated by the self-help initiative
in the communities and the potential of this large pool of untrained workers
and volunteers to provide paraprofessional support to teaching, management,
building, health services, food and nutrition. But, preservice and continuing
inservice training will be required for development of responsible and creative
leadership. (Perry, 1983, p.6)</ul>
The governmental and non-governmental agencies and organizations involved in
ECCE activities recognize some of the issues involved in providing the
necessary support to the vast range of ECCE efforts which exist in Zimbabwe.
They are seeking the most effective way to support the community initiative,
while at the same time assuring that quality services are provided. (Evans,
1983, p.3).<p>
<p>
	While community based programs have many positive characteristics, there are
some dangers in assuming that this approach Hill adequately meet the
intersecting needs of women and children. One plus is that they are frequently
developed in communities which are not reached by current services. A second
plus is the fact that these programs are developed in response to community
felt needs--a program has not been imposed on the community from outside. The
fact that the programs rely heavily on community support if they are going to
survive can be seen as positive and negative. It is positive in the sense that
the community has to take ownership for the program. It can be seen as negative
if people--primarily women--volunteer their labor and thus have decreased
opportunities to engage in income-generating activities. As noted by
Mbikusita-Lewanika,<p>
<p>
<ul>Most of these centres are provided by the communities on self-help bases. The
communities are eager for their children to benefit from any kind of early
childhood care and education, and cannot wait for the governments to provide
these facilities...Since they are provided by the communities, they are the
cheapest of all children's centres. On the other hand, these centres have the
poorest facilities,...overcrowding of children, lack of equipment and
materials, under staffed and untrained personnel. (1982, p.23)</ul>
	She then proceeds to make an argument for why these programs should, in fact,
receive the <b>most</b> governmental attention. Included in her list of reasons
is the fact that those starting the programs have the fewest economic
resources; early childhood care and education centers in these
communities have the potential to serve as a base for community development;
these communities receive the least in terms of all social services; children
from these communities are most in need of what a quality pre-school can
provide; and last, but not least, people in these communities have demonstrated
their commitment to their children and their ability to create a program
through self-help initiatives; their efforts should be recognized and supported
by the government (Mbikusita-Lewanika, 1982, p.23-24).<p>
<p>
	What she has failed to note, but which is consistently true, is that these
programs are staffed by women who "volunteer" their services. This clearly has
implications for their own development. The <b>first</b> has to do with the
potentially lost opportunity cost since they are not able to be involved in
other activities. The <b>second</b> has to do with assumptions about the skills
and knowledge that women have that would make them appropriate providers of
care in an ECCE program. In reference to assumptions about women's roles in a
variety of development efforts, Buvinic (1984) provides the following
analysis:<p>
<p>
<ul>A common belief in development circles related to the use of women volunteers
is that cultural proscriptions dictate that work with low-income women should
be done <b>by</b> women. This belief has been put into practice throughout the
Third World, but its validity has gone largely untested, while it is clear that
the lack of technical expertise of volunteer women staff is a major hindrance
to the success of projects directed to increase women's productivity and
income. (1984, p.21)</ul>
	The same analysis applies to women working in child care centers. In terms of
ECCE programmes, it is commonly assumed that community women can and should
volunteer--or receive a very small stipend--to provide the care for the
children. This assumption takes into consideration neither the needs of women
nor the children. Community-based programs are an important part of the
development process. But without looking at the quality of care for children,
and the costs and benefits of the programs for women these programs can be far
more negative than positive for both groups.<p>
<p>
	In sum, there are a range of program efforts which have been designed to
promote women's and children's development. Historically these programs have
been developed in isolation; at best, complimentary programs have evolved.
Within the past decade, policy makers, planners, and implementers have learned
what is needed to create effective programs for each group independent of one
another. What is much less clear is what it means to create development
programs from which both groups benefit. Within a few of the current efforts,
innovative approaches are being tried which ate built on an emerging awareness
of how to address the multiple and intersecting needs of women and children.
But, there is much to be learned and applied. In the final section of this
paper some of the forces in the development world that would support, or
constrain, a new conceptualization of programs for women and children will be
described, and some action strategies suggested.<p>
<p>
<center><b>IV. MOVING FORWARD: SOME REALITIES AND STRATEGIES</b></center><p>
<p>
	In this section of the paper an attempt will be made to: A. look at the forces
that are at play currently that will constrain or provide support to
conceptualization of the issues and programming to meet the intersecting needs
of women and children; B. look at the ease with which current programming for
women and children can be extended appropriately to meet the needs of the other
group; and C. look at what needs to be done in the near future to move us ahead
in our understanding of the issues and in promotion of policy in support of
women's and children's development.<p>
<p>
<b>A. The Forces at Play</b><p>
<p>
	There are a number of forces operating within the development world at the
present time that could be used to support a new conceptualization of the
intersecting needs of women and children. These include an awareness of
people's day-to-day lives and what that means for their involvement in new
programming; an understanding of the limits of many of the development
approaches to date; research and evaluation data which provide a greater
understanding of some of the variables involved and how they interact; and a
recognition of the costs of development programs, resulting in the creation of
programs that build upon current delivery systems. These forces do not operate
in isolation of one another; they are intertwined. The discussion that follows
highlights current issues and awareness that, while evident in the most recent
literature, emerged primarily through the interviews.<p>
<p>
	1. <b>There is an increasing awareness of the intersecting needs of women and
children in relation to child survival.</b> For example, of the variables that
are important to child survival, clearly half of them are related to factors
associated with the mother's pregnancy; the other half require the mother's
attention once the child is born. Yet current programming focuses only on the
child once the child is born, and relies on the mother to deliver the service.
Child Survival monies have not been invested in supporting the mother during
her pregnancy, nor has adequate attention been given to the potential costs,
and benefits, to the mother of her involvement in implementing the
strategies.<p>
<p>
	In terms of looking at women's own development, her involvement in the child
survival effort may have a cost. For example, one of the "costs" to a woman may
be the cost in terra of her own health and nutritional status. There are a
range of other costs. Those currently responsible far developing and delivering
Child Survival programmes are aware of sore of the potential costs for women.<p>
<p>
<ul>[Cost] can be defined, for example, as either a monetary value, an opportunity
cost, a status loss, or a consumer's time. Because a rural woman pays no money
for a vaccination does not mean that it "costs" her nothing. Indeed, the day of
travel or the abandonment of the family, and the arguments with her husband can
be high prices to pay for a product which is frequently perceived to have such
a low consequence. (Academy for Educational Development, 1985, p. IV-37)</ul>
	Recognizing the potential costs, proponents of the current Child Survival
strategies have attempted to identify potential benefits to women of their
involvement in the program. A number of benefits have been hypothesized. They
include some of the following, paraphrased in a variety of ways:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>		  <b>knowledge.</b> Women gain knowledge that previously was guarded by the
medical profession; information and the process of problem solving are
democratised; women gain new health delivery skills. (Mauras, 1985)<p>
<p>
<li>		  <b>responsibility/control.</b> Women are called upon to take on increasing
responsibility; Child Survival programmes enhance the capabilities of women to
act; they become decision-makers. "Women become active agents in program
delivery." (UNICEF, 1985, p.9)<p>
<p>
<li>		  <b>status.</b> Participation in such programs can advance women's sphere of
influence. (WHO, 1984)1 by participating in these programs women gain an
enhanced sense of self and control over their environment. Women have organized
and developed a "voice" within the community. (Mauras, 1985, p.6)<p>
<p>
<li>		  <b>savings.</b> Successful implementation of the strategies saves valuable
time, energy and money (Mauras, 1985, p.5); women save money by not needing to
buy expensive formula (0'Gara); there are potential benefits to women of less
child sickness, improved child health and a lower incidence of infant and child
mortality. (UNICEF, 19854 p.23-24)<p>
<p>
<li>		  <b>income.</b> Child Survival projects which have lead to the production of
weaning foods have provided income generating activities for women. Examples
include projects in Thailand, Sri Lanka, the Dominican Republic, Botswana, and
Paraguay (UNICEF, 19854, p.13)</ul>
	However, before jumping on the bandwagon of the benefits side of women's
involvement in Child Survival and Development Revolution (CSDR) strategies, it
should be noted that at the present time these are, by and large, hypothesized
benefits. As one UNICEF staff person noted, currently "there is more
justification than analysis" in the definition of benefits. Another UNICEF
person expanded on this same observation by stating that the CSDR approach does
not begin with an analysis of women's needs, then ask how the CSDR program
responds to them. Rather, it begins with the position that CSDR is good because
it saves the lives of children, <b>then</b> asks what benefits it may have for
mothers, more by way of justifying decisions taken than by way of seeking
adjustments that could improve the mutual benefit. Clearly core research is
needed to understand the real trade-offs for women as a result of their
involvement in CSDR activities.<p>
<p>
	2. <b>Within some of the donor agencies there is a love away from focusing on
individuals to either looking at the mother-child dyad or to seeing the
household as the focus of program efforts.</b> The major impact of this
movement has been to decrease the amount of funding directed to "women only"
programs. One USAID official saw this as a positive move since women's programs
were funded at a relatively low level; few women in development efforts could
be funded. She felt that women could benefit more by the current funding
pattern because they would have access to a much wider range of development
funds. Others, however, felt there was great danger in the household focus.
Historically, programs designed to promote development within a community have
had a neutral, and in some instances negative, effect an women's development.
Unless there is some system of accountability within this new framework--in
terms of addressing and meeting both women's and children's needs--the
household focus could be a real step backwards for women's and children's
development.<p>
<p>
	3. <b>Research on the relationship between women's and children's development,
for the most part, provides a strong basis for the argument that a program
designed to promote women's development will have a positive outcome for
children.</b> (Unfortunately there is no corollary of this for children.)<p>
<p>
	The literature contains numerous examples of the positive relationship between
maternal <b>health</b> and children's well-being, particularly during the pre- and
peri-natal stages.<p>
<p>
<ul>Women's own nutritional and health status affects the health of their infants
and risks of morbidity and infant mortality, as well as increasing their own
risks of maternal mortality. (Kobes &amp;  Scott, 1982, p.2)</ul>
In addition, there is a positive relationship between maternal education and
child outcomes. The following come from a report by the Office of Women in
Development (USAID):<p>
<p>
<ul><li>  the better educated the mother, the less likely the child is to die in
infancy. The children of educated mothers are better nourished and healthier.<p>
 <li> the children of educated mothers are more likely to succeed in school, core
so than if only the father is educated.<p>
<p>
 <li> educated women are more receptive to family planning and tend to have later
marriages and fewer children.<p>
<p>
 <li>primary education opens the way to further education or vocational training in
agriculture, health services, etc., and thereby increases the opportunities to
find remunerated employment. (1985, p. 6)</ul>
But to create a program that focuses only on promoting women's health or
education ir order to promote her and the child's development, is not
sufficient. It does not address any of the variables that lead to poor health
and lack of education--primarily poverty. Program experience gives support to
the research findings.<p>
<p>
<ul>Many of the earliest attempts to reach poor women in India were through health
programs. While some of these initiatives have achieved outstanding success,
many others, because of their narrow health focus, have proved to be difficult
to sustain organizationally and financially. The realization that for families
in poverty the overriding concern is economic survival has stimulated program
efforts to enhance women's ability to earn income. However, a focus on economic
activities need not be at the expense of a concern for health. In fact, income
generation programs can create both the demand and the delivery mechanism for
genuine community-based health care. (Ford Foundation, 1985, p.4)</ul>
	The experience of Ford Foundation is in accord with the experience of many
funding organizations. There is a beginning recognition of the
inter-relationship between health, education, income-generating activities and
the demands made on women living in poverty. In terms of health and education
there appears to be a clear relationship between these variables in women's
lives and what that means for children. In teres of women's involvement in
income generation activities and the effect on children, the evidence is being
gathered. Then, there is another set of questions being asked about the
distribution of income once it enters the household and what that means for
women and children.<p>
<p>
	Research concerns and program initiatives are not unrelated activities. It is
not incidental that much of the research is currently focused on intra-familial
or household dynamics and that the household is now the focus of development
activities for one of the major donor agencies.<p>
<p>
	The Ford Foundation experience also touches upon one of the other forces
currently operating that would support future programming to meet the
intersecting needs of women and children--an interest in developing
multi-sectoral programming.<p>
<p>
	4. <b>There is a move toward multi-sectoral programming.</b> One of the
outcomes of development projects over the past twenty years is a realization
that single-focus programs--either in terms of those to be included, or the
content of the programs--are likely to have short-term benefits, at best. At
worst, they are likely to have negative effects on the groups of people not
included in the effort. Evidence to this effect was described earlier in
discussions of the effect of early development programs on women. Thus, in
current efforts there is an attempt to conceptualize a program effort in terms
of its multi-sectoral dimensions, and to implement programs that take
into account the totality of a person's life.<p>
<p>
	But conceptualization and programming don't always go hand-in-hand. Sometimes
conceptually a program can take into consideration multiple needs, but when it
comes to programming, a single focus is pursued. One cause of the discordance
between conceptualization and programming may be differences in thinking at
various levels in an organization, as is described by Bennett in summarizing
many of the experiences encountered in women's programs.<p>
<p>
<ul>There is a deep and legitimate uncertainly about the relationship between
women's mothering role and their role as economic providers. This uncertainly
has lead to what can almost be described as schizophrenic programming on the
part of development agencies... While at the policy level copious recognition
is given to the importance of both roles, at the operational level,
implementation activities carried out by specialized agencies or divisions tend
to ignore one aspect or the other. (1983, p. 1)</ul>
	On the other hand there are good program examples of efforts which began as
single-sector projects that, in implementation, became multi-sectoral. A good
example is the <b>Sang Kancil</b> project in Malaysia that was described earlier. The
project was begun by the health sector to improve maternal and child health. As
it evolved, it addressed children's issues, women's need for
income, and finally introduced primary health care to the community at large.<p>
<p>
	It was suggested in one review that women would be very open to multi-sectoral
programming because, "Women's multiple roles and responsibilities in the family
and in the community put them in a position where they are deeply involved in
almost every area of development." (WHO, 1989, p.5). However, the stronger
argument for multi-sectoral programming is that people do not live in isolation
of one another, and each activity in their life affects and is affected by a
range of variables. The question is, what is the most effective way of
providing multi-sectoral programming? In leaking at successful program efforts,
it would appear that it is more effective to begin small (i.e. by addressing a
specific problem first) and then adding to that effort to meet a wider range of
needs. This would suggest that in terms of meeting the intersecting needs of
women and children, it is important to begin with a conceptualization that
addresses both sets of needs, but in terms of implementation, it ray be
necessary to begin with a program for one group with the intent of adding on
other components. The danger in this is that the additions way never be
made--because of the need to strengthen existing components, or because of the
lack of expertise about how to implement the addition, or because of increased
project costs which leave little or no resources available when it is time to
add the other components.<p>
<p>
	5. <b>One of the forces that operates throughout programming for women and
children is costs.</b> Social service and development programs are expensive.
While recognizing this, large donor agencies have established goals for
themselves in terms of reaching the poorest of the poor. Current resources are
not sufficient to meet those goals--particularly if the organization has to
create new delivery systems to meet its goals. Thus, there is an interest in
working with existing delivery systems to enhance their capability to deliver a
wider range of services. A good example of this is found within the <b>World
Health Organization</b> (WHO).<p>
<p>
	The World Health Organization (WHO) has made a commitment to bring health to
all by the year 2000, in terms of both survival and <b>primary health care</b>
(PHC). The costs of developing primary health care centers accessible to all
people would be prohibitive. Thus, the WHO has taken another approach. They are
looking at two different delivery systems that can be found throughout the
world, sometimes in the remotest areas: early childhood care and education
programs, and women's groups or organizations. In both instances, current
activities have been reviewed with an eye toward how they right be utilized for
the delivery of the maternal and child health components of primary health care
services. (See Evans, 1985, for a review of ECCE activities, and WHO, 1984, for
an assessment of the ways in which women's organization might be utilized.)<p>
<p>
	The rationale for using women's groups for the delivery of primary health care
(WHO, 1984), includes some of the following:<p>
<p>
<ul><li> women have a natural and traditional role in health care<p>
 <li>women's organizations are a natural entry point for PHC<p>
 <li>involving women's organizations in PHC activities will raise the status of
women and make them more effective leaders in the community<p>
 <li>women can reach other women and break down barriers<p>
 <li>women have stronger roots in their community<p>
<li> women's organizations are already oriented towards the intersectoral
approach<p>
 <li>women can mobilize community resources (p.2)</ul>
There are also some constraints to women's organizations playing this role.
Some of those noted include:<p>
<p>
 <ul><li>the low status of women<p>
 <li>women in developing countries are usually in poor health and overburdened with
work<p>
 <li>socio-cultural traditions can hinder women's involvement in PHC<p>
 <li>activities in PHC are not perceived as giving rise to immediate economic
benefits<p>
 <li>women's efforts are not integrated with national development programmes, (WHO,
1984, p.5-8)</ul>
	There are pros and cons to the utilization of existing systems. Clearly it
means reduced costs because new systems are not being created. One of the
potential dangers, however, is that the current focus and activities of the
systems could be lost as the result of the infusion of resources that would
take the program in a new direction.<p>
<p>
	6. <b>Appropriate policy is Emerging.</b> At the policy level there is
beginning awareness of the intersecting needs of women and children as
evidenced in <b>UNICEF's Response to Women's Concerns</b> (1985a). The document was
written in support of UNICEF's (a <b>child</b> focussed donor agency) programming for
women, and argues the case that programs which enhance women's development will
have a positive effect on children's development. In fact, the argument is made
that if you are really going to sake a significant change in children's lives,
it is essential to support women's development.<p>
	Within the UNICEF document a series of activities are recommended, which, if
implemented, would "reflect UNICEF's integrated approach to problems
confronting low-income women and children". Those which are most directly
related to the intersecting needs of women and children include:<p>
<p>
<ul><li> strengthening linkages between children's welfare and women's status<p>
 <li>promoting an integrated approach to nutrition<p>
 <li>revising support to income-generating programmes<p>
 <li>expanding women's education<p>
 <li>providing technical. resources to increase household food production<p>
 <li>supporting new directions in training programmes and skills<p>
 <li>community-centered approaches to family planning (UNICEF, 1985a, p.29-33)</ul>

	In sum, there are a number of forces within the development world at large
which would allow for conceptualization and programming which would focus on
meeting intersecting needs. In the majority of instances it would not take the
development of totally new strategies, Rather it would take building on what
exists, for both women and children, asking, what would it take to
expand/enlarge/redefine this effort to better meet a range of needs? In the
next section, there is a brief discussion of the ease with which
conceptualization and programming could be expanded for both groups in order to
meet the needs of the other group.<p>
<p>
<b>B. The Ease of Extending the Focus from one Group to Another--at the Policy,
Research and Implementation Levels</b><p>
<p>
	1. <b>Expanding the focus from child only, to child and woman.</b> There seem to be
some real possibilities for expanding early childhood care and education
programs to include women in development issues. Supports for this line of
activity include the fact that:<p>
<p>
		a. <b>Young children are dependent on their mothers</b>, at least during the first
months of their lives. There are a number of assumptions that underlie thinking
at this point. These assumptions color how program developers think about
creating and implementing activities which focus
primarily on supporting young children's development. The basic assumptions are
well summarized by Nieves (1982, p.8):<p>
<p>
<ol>1. Child rearing and child care are invariant and exclusive responsibilities of
the biological mother; that is, biological mothers are the universal and
primary caretakers...<p>
<p>
2. ...therefore, mothering and bonding or "nurturing" beyond the biological
acts of giving birth, nursing and bonding during the first days of the infant's
life, are not substitutable activities...The biological imperative continues to
rule women's behavior...</ol>
Mothers are a necessary part of the child's life. While others could do the
caretaking, by and large, the responsibility will, for the foreseeable future,
remain primarily with the biological mother. Thus, it is easy to make an
argument that programs for children should be expanded to include the mother.
The DANGER, however, is well illustrated in the examples described earlier.
Programming for women tends to focus only on their reproductive role; little or
no consideration is given to their productive role.<p>
<p>
		b. <b>Funding and support for ECCE programs is increasing.</b> While this is
primarily true in terms of child survival, in some Third World countries there
is also recognition of the importance of young children's development. Thus,
building on what is known about the relationship between women&#146;s
development as women and how it relates to children's development, monies may
be available to support women's development out of these funds.<p>
<p>
		c. At the practical level <b>there are staff within child focused agencies
(i.e. UNICEF) that are concerned with women's issues.</b> They can work from
within their agencies to push for integrated planning around intersecting
needs. They have an understanding of what women need to develop their
productive role and what this will mean for children now and in the future.<p>
<p>
	2.<b> From women focused programs to the inclusion of child issues.</b> Within
this category there are both constraints and supports.<p>
<p>
		a. A constraint is the <b>political reality</b> of needing to ideologically
separate women's productive role from her reproductive one. In order to
increase women's visibility in the development world it has been necessary to
present them as <b>producers</b> and to consistently illustrate the ways in
which they are agents of change. By introducing children, it reinforces the
<b>reproductive</b> role. In the latter role nomen are taken less seriously.<p>
<p>
<ul>There has...been a marked tendency to explain women's subordinate status and
dependence on men in modernizing societies in terms of their reproductive
roles, and in terms of the fact that the place of work (or the place of
production) and the place of reproduction become separated in the course of
modernization and capitalist development. Women must remain in the place of
reproduction and, as a consequence, their role in production decreases and
their independence on those who are engaged in production increases. Once a
woman is no longer directly engaged in production, her social status decreases
accordingly. (Nieves, 1982, p. 2)</ul>

		b. A related constraint is the <b>costs associated with adding a child care
component</b> to a women's program. Those seeking funds for women's programs
are being asked to justify the costs and benefits of their program within the
economic framework used to judge the effect of development programs on men.
While the issue of costs and benefits is a complex one, suffice it to say that
in today's economic reality, women's programs are more costly; women need basic
education, leadership and management skills, and increased self-confidence
before they can take advantage of technical training programs. Comparatively
speaking, men bring many of these skills to the program. One of the contractors
interviewed then went on to say, "If on top of this we have to add the costs of
child care, the costs would be prohibitive, and we'd never get a project
funded."<p>
<p>
		c. In support of the integration of children's needs into women's program is
that fact that <b>if child care is not available within the program, women create
it for themselves</b>, Sometimes this is with the support of the funding agency
(i.e. funds are shifted to cover the cost) and sometimes it is done in spite of
the funding source (as was the case in Senegal). In other words, women
participating in development programs know they need care for their children.
In fact, they want quality care. They want to know that their children are
safe, that they are getting good foods, and that they are "learning"
something.<p>
<p>
		d. In support of the development of <b>child care is that it can become the
focus of income-generating activities</b>. In a number of cases cited above, the
child care center became an income generating activity. Women receive training
in the operation of a child care program. The center say also serve as a base
for training other community women to operate their own child care
centers.<p>
<p>
		e. Another support comes free the fact that <b>those involved in development
planning have an increased awareness of women's reality</b>. There is a
recognition of the fact that to address women's needs as women, consideration
must be given to women's nurturing role.<p>
<p>
<ul>Poor women in developing countries have no choice but to be increasingly more
productive in the cash economy and at the sane time to fulfill their domestic
responsibilities, including hose production for family or household consumption
and childcare. (Nieves, 1982, p. 1)</ul>
		f. A constraint is the fact that <b>there is no demand for the inclusion of
children's issues in women's programming outside of the need to support women's
development</b>. In expanding children's programs to focus on women, it can be
argued that what is good for women Hill be good for children. The
corollary--that what is good for children is good for women--while intuitively
appealing, is not backed up with research evidence.<p>
<p>
		g. A constraint related to (f) is that<b> in agencies and offices that focus
on women in development programs there are no staff who are advocates for young
children</b>. There is no one free within the organization that is working to
build a case for consideration of the intersecting needs; in fact, there is
little organizational knowledge about what children need beyond basic
survival.<p>
<p>
	3. <b>A new dimension.</b> Within recent years there has been increased focus
on the needs of girls in Third World countries. (An example is the GATE project
being developed in Nepal.) While the following quote represents UNICEF's
perspective, an interest in supporting the development of girls comes from
other donor agencies and foundations as well (the Carnegie Corporation
and WHO, for example).<p>
<p>
<ul>From the UNICEF perspective, programme action for girls and adolescents is
important for three basic reasons: (a) to rectify the disadvantages girls face
relative to boys in education, nutrition, health and survival; (b) as means to
ensure proper infant/child care and nutrition, given that young girls often
care for younger children; and (c) because of the benefits that improvements in
the health and nutritional status of today's girls and adolescents will have on
the next generation... The foundation of a healthy mother is laid early; ages
10-15 are crucial. Health problems leading to foetal or child death, maternal
depletion and low birth weight babies often begin before and during
adolescence. (UNICEF, 1985a, p.25, 30)</ul>
	In some ways "girls" represent an intersect of women's and children's needs,
and they are certainly important to future development. Programming for
adolescents may be an entry point for addressing many of the identified
concerns.<p>
<p>
<b>C. Proposed Action</b><p>
<p>
	Obviously in order to move forward our understanding of and programming for
women and children there will need to be concerted effort on several fronts--in
terms of research, in terms of policy development, and in terms of programming.
The question is how to do this? The following are some possible action areas
that would help to advance the field.<p>
<p>
	1. <b>There is a need to increase our knowledge base in order to create a new
conceptual framework about the relationship between women's and children's
development.</b> To do this we must continue research on the relationships
between the types of work that women engage in and what that means for
children; research on the kinds of support systems that women have developed on
their own and what they mean for both women's and children's development; and
research on what young children need and how that can be provided by a range of
caretakers.<p>
<p>
	In addition, there is a need to <b>evaluate</b> what has already happened. While one
USAID official stated that we have all the data we need, we simply need to look
at it in a new way, recent experiences in reviewing projects for their effect
on women and children would suggest that we don't have all the data we need.
Data are collected in response to questions asked as a project begins. If there
were no questions asked about the costs and benefits of a program to women and
children, then the data necessary to assess that relationship will not be
available. What needs to happen now is to work with current and new contractors
to ask the right questions as the projects get underway, using a variety of
techniques to look at potentially significant variables. A range of disciplines
have been involved in the development of formative and summative evaluation
strategies that would be appropriate to use in such an effort (see Booth &amp;
O'Gara, 1989; Lassen, 1984; and Buzzard, 1984).<p>
<p>
	2. <b>There is a need to continue to identify exemplary programs, and to do
in-depth case studies of innovative efforts so that issues and answers can be
explored.</b> One way to pursue this would be to hold a series of regional
meetings where those nest closely involved in program implementation provide
information on exemplary programs in the region. From these meetings issues in
conceptualization and programming would be clarified. In addition, information
on the most comprehensive programs, and/or those within which the most lessons
were learned, should be written up and disseminated to policy makers, planners
and practitioners. (Perhaps the <b>SEEDS</b> format would be appropriate.) This is a
particularly important step since the interviews revealed that, to some extent,
policy is derived from successful projects.<p>
<p>
	3. <b>Networking</b> needs to occur among those currently interested in
exploring the issues. What we found in the interviews is that many people are
sensitive to the issues as they were discussed. However, by in large, these
individuals did not have anyone within their immediate work environment with
whom they could discuss the issues. Clearly a greater constituency could be
created if there was a mechanism for getting people together with common
interests and concerns, among whom there is a wealth of knowledge, expertise
and experience.<p>
<p>
	4. <b>The strategies that have been developed need to be disseminated.</b>
This is different from the case studies where in-depth information on a
specific project is provided. What is being referred to here is a &#147;how
to&#148; booklet. One frequent response during the interviews was, "I'm sure
people would begin a child care program/income-generating activities if they
knew how." There was a sense that program people right well be aware of the
need, but that they did not have the expertise to go about establishing a
needed program component. This is certainly understandable; those that have
been involved in child care programs have little or no awareness of the range
of variables that are important in promoting women's development, and vice
versa. Perhaps two booklets could be prepared--one for those working in women's
programs that provides a list of "things you eight think about" in terms of
meeting the needs of children, and a parallel set of guidelines could be
provided for those operating early childhood care and education programs. The
booklets could also include vignettes of successful programs and include a list
of resources that could be drawn upon to add an appropriate component to an
existing program.<p>
<p>
	For example, in the booklet for those creating child care centers, they could
be challenged to think about:<p>
<p>
<ul><li> the hours of operation of the day care and how that meets the needs of the
families they hope to serve.<p>
<li> ways to create income-generating activities for women in support of the
program (through making and selling toys, by providing training so that women
can operate a child care center or provide child care in their own home).<p>
<li> ways to promote the development of women's organizations--perhaps starting
with the child care facility, but then expanding the focus to meet a range of
needs.</ul>

	The booklet for those operating women in development programs could include:<p>
<p>
 <ul><li>ways to build in monetary rewards for supporting the child's development (i.e.
receiving work credits for breast-feeding)<p>
 <li>a series of questions to ask women about the current situation of care for the
child to determine what the needs of women and children are in a given
community.</ul>

	Obviously the questions and strategies in each booklet would not be
appropriate for every project and community. But enough examples could be
provided so that program planners and implementers could make decisions
appropriate to the intersecting needs of women and children in their setting.<p>
<p>
<center>* * * * *</center><p>
<p>
	In sum, in pursuing information on policy and programs which support women's
and children's multiple and intersecting needs, there was great frustration.
From written project descriptions and from the interviews, it was clear that
very little effort has gone into the framing of optimal programs for women and
children. However, those interviewed were very receptive to a discussion of the
issues. It was also clear that those closest to programs as they are being
implemented have the greatest awareness of trade-offs that are made each day.
Those at the policy level are being made aware of the issues as they learn
about field experiences, but frequently they are part of bureaucratic
structures that limit their ability to act in accordance with their knowledge
and understanding. What is also evident is that people at all levels need
support in creating policy and programs that will maximize benefits to women,
children, and the community.<p>

This summary has been prepared by Robert Myers, Coordinator, The Consultative
Group on Early Childhood Care and Development..</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This report summarizes discussions of women's work and child welfare
held on November 12, 1985 at the offices of the International Center for
Research on Women (ICRW). The meeting was organired jointly by XCRW and
the Consultative Group on Early Childhood Care and Development. The (26)
individuals who participated (see attached list) came from international
agencies, private foundations, universities, private consulting and research
organizations, and the United Nations family. Participants represented
the fields of psychology, anthropology, economics, demography, education,
public health, nutrition, child development, and medicine. This diversity
of disciplinary and institutional backgrounds greatly enriched the discussion.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>Summary</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Two areas of social action in the Third World that have received increasing
attention in the last decade are the survival and healthy development of
children, and the social and economic well being of women. In both of these
areas there has been a concern about the relation between women's work
and child welfare, but from two rather different points of view.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>One view comes from the Women-in-Development (WID) community, which
has focussed primarily on women's productive roles, WID programmes tend
either to downplay women's child care responsibilitie or to assume that
adequate substitute child care is available. They are also likely to assume
that children will benefit from women's increased earnings and from the
greater control by women over the use of resources that women's work can
bring.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Another view is typical of policy makers and researchers concerned with
child health, nutrition and development who assume that women should devote
themselves primarily to their reproductive and child care roles and are
available to do so. A corollary, not always made explicit, is that if women
take on a productive role, particularly one outside the home, the welfare
of children will suffer. Thus, the reproductive and productive roles of
women are set in conflict. Often, there is little recognition of the additional
burdens child survival and development programmes may place on women. Or,
there is an assumption that seemingly minor burdens will result in longer-term
benefits for women through savings of time and money associated with reduced
child illness.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The meeting, and the background papers prepared for it, had two main
purposes: to examine available research evidence related to the above propositions,
and to draw programme and policy implications. Examining the evidence meant
challenging conventional wisdom and asking under what circumstances, and
for what groups of women and children these over simplified and sometimes
misleading generalizatians seem to hold or do not. It meant looking behind
current myths and practices to ask what variables explain one outcome or
another for both women and children.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Several conclusions emerged from the papers and the discussion:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>1. There is little evidence that women's work, per se, has negative
effects on children's nutritional status, especially after the period of
infancy, and mother's income may even enhance the child's well- being.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>2. If there is any period during the child's life in which mothers should
e encouraged to be with their children, it is during the first 6 to 12
months of life.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>3. The effect of women working an child welfare will depend on characteristics
of the work (e,g. level of income earned, distance from home, ability to
care for child while working, and working hours) and on the cultural and
Family contexts, including the existence of social support networks, and
the role or responsibility of the father as a possible caregiver.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>4. The research that addresses questions about converging or conflicting
needs of women and children needs to be strengthened. Few studies have
provided the methodological &quot;rigor&quot; necessary to make clear statements
about the relationship between maternal and child variables. Most studies
are correlational and cross- - sectional so causal interpretations cannot
be made.</p>

<p> There is more data on child health variables (breast- feeding, nutritional
status and mortality) than other child outcomes; research utilizing a broader
range of outcomes is desirable but will require additional attention to
measures for some of the concepts that are most important -self- - confidence,
self- esteem, and even child development - which are hard to measure, particularly
cross- culturally.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>5. National and international organizations have seldom recognized or
tried to deal simultaneously with the potential converging benefits or
the possible trade- - offs which programmes may have for women and children.
The current emphasis on short- term technological solutions to social problems
hamper the search for longer term strategies to meet, concurrently, the
needs of women and children. Major changes in political and institutional
climates are needed to give these issues &quot;currency.&quot;</p>

<p> </p>

<p>6. Meanwhile, there is a need to analyze the effects, on children as
well as women, of including child care components in women's projects.
There is a parallel need to examine the effects of child survival and development
(CSO) projects on women as well as children. Although it appears to be
easier to add a child survival and development component to a women's project
(through child care as health measures) than to focus an women's needs
in a CSD project, the high level of funding for CSD requires more attention
than has been given to women's needs within such projects.</p>

<p><b>Background Papers and Discussion</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p>As a basis for discussion, summaries were presented of several reviews
now in process. The first, presented by Patrice Engle 1) provided a general
framework for looking at the intersecting needs of working mothers and
children; 2) described some changes in the work patterns of women in developing
countries; and 3) examined effects that women's work is thought to have
on their role within the family. A second review and presentation, by Joanne
Leslie, focussed on the effects of women's work on child nutrition (both
infant feeding practices and child growth), seeking hypotheses to explain
what, on the surface, seem to be contradictory findings. In the third presentation,
Zsabel Nieves examined women's work, social support services and child
welfare. A fourth presentation, by Judith Evans and Robert Myers, aided
the discussion of policy and programme implications by examining actual
policies and programmes in selected funding or implementing organizations.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>These four presentations will be summarized briefly, followed by main
points made in the discussion of each. The reader is asked to keep in mind
that a central purpose of the meeting was to provide feedback to the author/presenter
whose reviews were presented in draft form. Final versions of the papers
will be available in March, 1986 from ICRW and from the Consultative Group.</p>

<p><u><b>1. Patrice Engle: The Intersecting Needs of Working Mothers and
Their Children: 1980- 1985</b></u></p>

<p> </p>

<p>To provide a general framework for analysis, Patrice Engle outlined
a number of costs and benefits to bath mothers and to children that might
be associated with maternal work for earnings (see Figure 1). She proposed
that these effects be examined within the context of changes in family
structure resulting from maternal work for earnings. For example, maternal
employment may have different consequences for both child and mother if
it is a response to the absence of the male head of household due to migration
for additional work, or a response to an increase in the availability of
assembly- - line work for women in multi- national corporations. In the
first situation, father absence and economic uncertainty may be key issues.
In the second, changes in power relationships within the home may have
negative or positive effects on both mother and child. Rather than considering
maternal employment as a unitary variable, it is important to examine the
family- level circumstances which are associated with work far earnings
in each case.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Engle described six changes in maternal work patterns which might have
differential effects on family adaptation patterns. These are 1) general
economic deterioration leading to an increased incidence of mothers' informal
wage- earning activities; 2) migration of male heads of households to urban
areas in search of work, leaving de- facto female- - headed households
in rural areas; 3) migration by young, unmarried women to urban centers
in search of work; 4) international migration of individuals or family
units into marginal circumstances, such as from Mexico to the U.S.; 5)
growth of &quot;off- shore&quot; manufacturing by multi- national corporations
which hire large numbers of presumably unmarried women with little job
security; and 6) various agrarian reform projects which include changes
in family land ownership patterns, work roles, and reliance on cash income.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In an earlier paper, in 1980, Engle focussed on the costs and benefits
to children of maternal work for earnings, examining issues such as compatibility
of work and child care, and patterns of Lime allocation of working and
non- working mothers, that analysis will be incorporated into the final
paper. The current presentation examined the ways in which women's work
for earnings could affect children by changing family structures, or by
increasing the mother's capabilities, Several hypotheses for these effects
have been advanced; Hypotheses 1, 3, and 4 represent possible benefits
to children of mother's work, and Hypothesis 2 examines possible costs
to children of maternal work for earnings. An underlying problem with much
of the research reported is that most is descriptive or carrelational.
Few studies have been done which examine how changes in maternal work status
affect changes in family patterns or child outcomes. We cannot, far instance,
be sure whether maternal work for earnings increases decision- - making
power or whether greater decision- - making power increases the likelihood
that women will perform an economic role.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><u>Hypothesis 1. (Benefit) First, work and the greater access to resources
that it prov ides, will be associated with increased decision-making power
for women. Second, income in the hands of mothers will be more likely to
be used for meeting the immediate needs of children than will income in
the hands of other family members.</u> </p>

<p>A number of correlational studies support the hypothesis that greater
access to resources by women is associated with greater autonomy in making
decisions in the domestic and non-domestic spheres. Work for earnings does
not always, however, increase women's access to resources; some studies
suggested that when women were laborers in an enterprise or farm controlled
by others, their role in decision- making in the household was limited.
Access to resources, rather than income- - earning per se, should be the
focus of investigation.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The second part of the hypothesis, that mothers are more likely than
are other family members to allocate income to the immediate needs of children,
receives considerable support from anecdotal reports, and from the few
systematic studies (e.g. Kumar in India, Gambia) that have been done. Studies
on parental perceptions of responsibilities indicate that, at least in
some areas, fathers perceive that feeding of children is the responsibility
of the mother.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><u>Hypothesis 2.(Cost) Women' s work for earnings is a divisive factor
in families, particularly between marriage partners</u>. The literature
reviewed suggested that the need for a woman to work is often a response
to the absence, temporary or permanent, of a male head of household, rather
than a cause of his leaving. A few studies suggested that in some cases,
women's employment provided the vehicle for escaping from a difficult or
even abusive relationship. Several theories of marital solidarity were
outlined: one proposes that sex- role differentiatian is the basis for
marital harmony, whereas another suggests that similarity of roles is conducive
of marital harmony. In the first case, maternal work for earnings could
disrupt traditional sex- - role patterns, whereas in the second, women's
work would lead to greater role similarity. An examination of the effects
of maternal work for earnings on marital relationships should consider
alternative models of marital solidarity.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><u>3) Hypothesis 3 (Cost and Benefit) Women who work will receive additional
help from other family members in domestic tasks </u>. Women who work outside
the home spend less supervisory time with their children. However, child-
rearing tasks in many societies are shared by others, so that mother's
time with their children after the first year does not vary substantially
whether or not they are generating an income. It is hypothesized that when
the mother works for earnings, other family members such as the father
or siblings increase their child- care role, which may benefit both them
and the young child. However, evidence from developing countries, and from
Mexican migrants to the U.S., suggests that this increase in help from
the fathers is minimal, even though verbal support far increased help may
be given. Help from siblings replaces the mother to some extent, but mast
reports suggests that these mothers who work for income experience a &quot;double
day&quot; phenomenon or an increased workload.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><u>Hypothesis 4. (Benefit) Women who work for earnings will have increased
levels of self-confidence</u>. The evidence to date suggests that when
women's employment leads to community- level respect, it is associated
with enhanced self- confidence and experiences of control. In the U.S.,
these attitudinal variables are associated with benefits for children.
In cultures in which the role of mothering is primary, the work role may
be seen as secondary, and a mother's attitude about the adequacy of her
mothering may be central to her self- esteem. The contribution of self-
confidence to &quot;maternal competence,&quot; a variable which has been
associated with improved outcomes for children under impoverished circumstances,
should be investigated further.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The review led Engle to propose an intergenerational model of &quot;maternal
competence,&quot; derived from psychological attachment theory. In developing
countries, the initial parent- - child bond appears to establish a model
far patterns of child care enacted when that child becomes a mother. If
this relationship holds true in other societies, second generation consequences
of impaired parenting might be predicted. Efforts should be made to support
women's mothering and their beliefs in their rnotl iering adequacy, particularly
when they are working outside the home. Maternal- child programmes should,
to whatever extent possible, build on existing skills in a supportive way,
rather than focus on the need for re- education, Some literature suggests
that a women's ability to use extended support networks, which may be critical
for her children's development, may be related to her experience as a child
and her willingness to trust non- family members.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Engle concluded that:</p>

<p> </p>

<li>Maternal work for earnings needs to be examined within the family context;</li>

<p> </p>

<li>Programmes addressed to working mothers should include opportunities
for those mothers to perceive themselves as competent;</li>

<p> </p>

<li>Efforts should be made to allow a primary caretaker to be with a child
during the first crucial 3 to 6 months of life, and training should be
given to mothers or substitute caregivers on appropriate care and stimulation
of children during that period.</li>

<p> </p>

<p><u>Discussion of Engle's paper.</u></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Although the following will not capture the richness of discussion and
the full nature of the exchange, it will provide the reader with an idea
of points that were raised.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>1) Based on the observation that poor women often do manage to cope
effectively by activating and maintaining supportive social networks, a
question was raised about the validity of the conclusion that there is
a need for greater self- esteem and competence training. The idea of having
to help women to be and feel &quot;competent&quot; was questioned, In reply,
the point was made that although women may develop networks, there nevertheless
are many examples of women for wham networks are not Functioning. These
are often women who are uprooted and under considerable stress. These women
need help.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>2) In response to a question about a request to translate the research
findings into policy implications and &quot;entry points&quot; that might
minimize potential trade- - offs, Engle suggested an emphasis on the first
year of life and on re- examining the possible social casts when mothers
must trade off child care time for work and when adequate alternative child
care is not avai lable . If, as suspected, the cost is high, then increased
investments in support to the mother and in alternative child care, particularly
during the first year of a child's life, may be justified.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>3) How can women be helped to feel competent and raise self- esteem?
Through encouragement from social service workers with whom women have
contact. By supporting women in their parenting role so they are more successful
at it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>4) A suggestion was made that T.V. holds considerable potential for
providing parental advice and support.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>5) There needs to be more attention given to the roles of men in caregiving,
a topic which, unfortunately, seems to have been left out of the discussion.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>6) A question was raised about how one measures such variables as &quot;maternal
competence&quot; and &quot;self- esteem&quot;. These concepts need further
definition and specification.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>2. <u>Joanne Leslie: Women's Work and Child Nutrition in the Third World</u></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Leslie's review provided a re- examination of the conventional wisdom,
accepted by much of the nutrition and public health community, that women's
labor force participation will have a negative effect on breast- feeding
and infant feeding which, in turn, will have a negative effect on survival
and on the health and nutritional status of infants and pre-school age
children.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>To probe this assumption, Leslie reviewed 41 studies published between
1972 and 1985 providing data from 27 different countries in Asia, Africa,
South America, and the Middle East. In summary tables, Leslie presented
a description of each study in terms of its authors, country, setting (urban
or rural), sample and method of data- gathering, characteristics of the
women/children/households studied, type of work, infant feeding or nutrition
status measures used, and the method of analysis. A brief summary of findings
was also included in the tables. The studies were broken into two groups,
those focussing on work and feeding practices, and those emphasizing work
and nutritional status. In each case, methodologically better and poorer
studies were separated out.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Guiding Leslie's review was a model of presumed linkages between women's
education, women's work, and child nutritional status. In the model, women's
education and/or work influence knowledge and practices, the use of health
and nutrition services, the duration of breast- - feeding, child care time
and income each of which, in turn, influences nutritional. status. Earlier
reviews of studies relating women's educational status and children's nutritional
status have concluded with reasonable confidence that higher levels of
maternal education are significantly and positively related to better child
nutritional status and lower child mortality. Similar clarity was not found
for women's work and children's nutritional status, countering conventional
wisdom claiming a negative association. The relationship is complicated
because &quot;work status&quot; is not fixed and because both directions
of causality are possible. Whether the relationship is positive or negative
will depend on the time spent working, the level of earnings, the type
of work, family composition, the availability and quality of alternative
child care, and the age of the child.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>With respect to breast- - feeding, Leslie found that women's work is
not associated with a decline in the incidence of breast- - feeding. Results
suggest, however, that there may be a relationship to the duration of breast-
feeding; working mothers shift earlier from exclusive breast- feeding to
mixed feeding. If exclusive breast- - feeding lasts three months, this
finding may not be particularly worrisome because shortly thereafter weaning
foods should, in any event, begin to be introduced. Moreover, few women
(somewhat more in urban areas and in Latin America) give work as their
reason for stopping breast- feeding. The findings paint to a need far increased
attention to the feeding and health of children at the time of weaning
when they are at highest risk of malnutrition due to special health and
nutrition needs.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Examining the relationship between women's work and children's nutritional
status focusses attention on the extent to which a trade- off occurs between
income earned (which combines amount of time worked and level of pay) and
time devoted to child rearing. In the review (see also discussion below),
evidence of threshholds was found. For instance, in Indonesia, work by
a mother for more than 40 hours per week had a negative effect on nutritional
status only if pay was below the minimum wage threshhold. Both working
time and the amount earned also affect the kind and quality of alternative
care that can be purchased.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>There was evidence as well as that mothers who are able to work at home
during the early months of a childs life are less likely to have malnourished
children, but that as children grew older, the positive income effect of
working outside the home may outweigh the greater child care time mothers
can provide by being at home.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Principal policy conclusions drawn by Leslie are:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>1) That policy- makers, planners and programme implementers should <u>not</u>
assume there is a causal and negative relationship between a mother's working
and malnourishment.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>2) That increased attention should be given to feeding and health practices
at the time of weaning.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>3) That policies and programmes facilitating work by mothers in the
home during the first months of a child's life could positively affect
nutritional and health status.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The review has several implications for future research. First, more
attention should be given to how wamen's work is defined and measured.
Comparisons are needed that take into account the overall income status
of working versus non- - working women. (In same cases working women come
from poorer households than non- working wamen. In other cases, particularly
where women are the heads of household, working women will be better off
than non- working women.) Effects of the availability and quality of substitute
child care and nutritional status also need to be studied. A more careful
examination is needed of the way in which the presumed trade-off between
earnings and caretaker time occurs (see also the presentation by Nieves).</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Future research should not attempt to arrive at a simplistic conclusion
that women's work has a positive or negative effect an child nutrition.
Rather, it should aim at identifying the ways in which women's work affects
infant feeding practices and child nutritional status and other measures
of child welfare. And it should seek out factors that may mediate the relationship,
such as access to quality of substitute child care, and prices of food
(particularly food to infants and weaning age of children). Further, there
is a need for increased understanding of nutritionally desirable practices
and indicators of healthy growth and development.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><u>Discussion of Leslie's paper</u>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Suggestions and observations made during the discussion were the following.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>1) Results were offered by Chloe O'Gara from a study in Honduras that
is not yet written up.This study reinforces the existence of an income
threshhold affecting the work- nutrition relationship, whereby children
under a year will be worse off if working women earn less than the minimum
wage. However, for children a year or alder, that difference did not appear
and &quot;maternal competence&quot; rather than income seemed to be a more
important determinant of the child's nutritional status. (Competence was
inferred from the attitude of mothers toward their babies and from the
general. appearance of the mothers and their households.) In the Honduran
study, women who breast- - fed for at least two months before weaning <u>and</u>
who worked, had the healthiest babies. They were also the most &quot;competent&quot;.
These results seemed to be consistent with what was presented by both Engle
and Leslie.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The point was also raised the quality of alternative care (not just
maternal &quot;competence&quot;) is also important, There are few studies
that look at the quality of alternative caregivers. This does not need
to be done in a very sophisticated way as suggested by one Indian study
which found that the alder the caretaker substitute, the less malnourished
the baby.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>2) It would be useful to consider the effects of the presence or absence
of husbands as a mediating variable.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>3) A household decision making (bargaining) framework might be applied
to examine the questions: How does the fact of working for income change
the relative power in the family? Do parental decisions take into account
maximizing the welfare of the child? If so, then the problem is less one
of changing parental perceptions (sometimes assumed to be the problem)
and more one of changing the conditions that constrain decisions.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>4) When examining the relationship between women, work and child welfare,
it is important to consider differences related to where a family is in
the family cycle. The relationship may be different for a couple that is
young and has only one baby and far a couple, age 35- - 40 with several
children.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>5) For policy purposes, the most important question may not be whether
or not a woman works, but may be, &quot;Which are the most vulnerable mothers?&quot;
Identifying the most vulnerable mothers may also identify the children
who are most &quot;at risk&quot;.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><u>3. Isabel Nieves: The Social Support Resources of Working Mothers:
An Outline</u></p>

<p> </p>

<p>As suggested in the previous reviews, an important intervening variable
affecting the relationship between women's work and child welfare is the
availability and quality of social supports families can utilize. Social
support is support provided by someone other than the mother and is exclusive
of her own resources and capital. To examine this issue Nieves began with
a model relating the circumstances of work, poverty, child care, and characteristics
of the woman and the child to available social resources (including both
informal and formal services) and then to the requirerments of good infant
feeding. This set of variables affects breast- feeding and supplemental
feeding practices and, through them, the nutritional status of the child.
The social supports included in Nieves discussion were financial, informational,
emotional, and task oriented support (help with child rearing, care, feeding,
housework, etc.).</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In her presentation Nieves suggested that formal support takes many
forms - from maternity leaves and benefits to provision of primary health
care, creches and other day care arrangements, flexi- - time, etc. Survival
strategies and social networks developed by women (families) contribute
informal support which seems to be preferred to formal services. Informal
support may be provided free or may involve some payment. It is often provided
by kin but also comes from neighbors and community groups. By definition,
informal support arrangements are not regularized. They usually involve
reciprocity. These spontaneous uninstitutionalized strategies are often
creative solutions to survival- threatening crises. Informal support systems
are increasingly recognized as arrangements to be strengthened and up-
graded rather than replaced.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>One starting point for examining social support systems is to look at
patterns of delegating child care responsibility. In general, the literature
shows that most mothers are not the exclusive, or even the main caregivers
for their children. In pre- - capitalist societies non-mothers provide
about half of the child care time for children under one year of age and
about three- - fourths for children over one. Contemporary studies of time
allocation also show a relatively small proportion of time devoted by mothers
to exclusive child care. That time seems to decrease only slightly when
women are employed in market work or agricultural production, this finding
can be attributed both to care by others and to the fact that child care
is seldom an activity performed exclusive of other activities.</p>

<p> Household composition and the availability of other family members
as caretakers or workers may have a greater influence on time spent caretaking
than whether or not a woman works outside the home. For instance, when
girls 13 to 15 years of age are in the home, the mother is more likely
to work outside the home and wean earlier. The presence of boys age 13-15,
on the other hand, seems to prolong breastfeeding because boys can go to
work substituting for the income earning role of the mother rather than
for the caretaking function.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Nieves presented, but did not discuss in detail, a set of hypotheses
she plans to examine as she continues her review. For example:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>1) Infant feeding decisions are a function of the child's age, the mother's
economic and time constraints, the availability of child care substitutes,
and the availability of breast milk substitutes.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>2) Women who work outside the house will adapt a mixed feeding pattern
(breast and bottle) earlier than women who do not work outside the home,
and will breast- feed when at home but; delegate child feeding responsibility
to others when they leave the house.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>3) The use of formal social support services for child care will be
determined primarily by the availability of informal child care options
in the household and the neighbourhood.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>4) Increased school attendance among girls 7- 12 reduces total child
care time of children 1- 5 but not of infants O-1. It also reduces reliability
of home- - based informal support mechanisms for child rearing and feeding.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>5) For working women, infant feeding decision may be influenced, not
by work per se, but by the conditions of work, hours and scheduling of
work.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>6) The availability of adequate formal social support services will
increase the likelihood that working mothers will be able to adopt adequate
infant feeding practices.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>a) Women who utilize day care services in or near a workplace will be
able to breast- feed for longer periods than those who do not have such
services.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>b) Accessible, reliable and efficient transportation systems will increase
the likelihood that women will breast- - feed their infants for longer
periods.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Most of these hypotheses will be examined as part of a research project
the International Center for Research on Women is now carrying out in Jamaica.
That research is based on data gathered from 150 female heads of households
who recently gave birth, who worked during their last two tri- mesters
of pregnancy, and who have another young child living. The work patterns,
child care arrangements, and child rearing practices of these women are
being followed and are being related to the nutritional status (and changes)
of their newborn children during their first year of life. Data are being
gathered at six weeks, three months, six months, and nine months.</p>

<p> Preliminary results indicate that the women are relying heavily on
friends, kin, and neighbors for support even when they have not returned
to work.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><u>Discussion of Nieves' presentation.</u></p>

<p> </p>

<p>1) Whether an informal or formal arrangement is preferred may depend
on the mother's assessment of both the adequacy and ability of the alternatives.
A mother's first preference may be for a trusted family member to provide
child care; but in practice that is not always possible. In some cases,
care by a family member may not be preferred because the family member
available is not experienced.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>2) A mother's role as household manager is important. One might hypothesize
that a mother's preference and assessment of caretaking options will be
influenced by the ease with which she can continue her control and management.
Supervision and control over child care may be related to education of
the mother.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>3) From a demographic perspective should one encourage women to work
outside the home because it would reduce the demand far children? This
question was raised to point out a counter argument to the conventional
wisdom of discouraging work.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>4) There can be a negative effect of social support on women and families
if that support overwhelms the person supported and creates a dependency
by her on the support system. Sometimes people cannot; develop a &quot;healthy&quot;
social network. One factor affecting the ability to develop and use a network
is self- - esteem.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>5) To what extent are informal social support systems economically efficient
as compared with formal support systems? It is possible to imagine that
the introduction of a formal system (e.g. a creche) would undermine an
existing informal system of child care that is operating more efficiently
and effectively. Intraducing government services may take the responsibility
of parents, but in so doing, contribute to inefficiency arrd dependence.
The answer to these speculations and to the opposite point of view which
was presented with equal force, is that we do not have the evidence to
make the judgement.</p>

<p><u>4. Judith Evans: Improving Programme Actions to Meet the Intersecting
Needs of Women and Children in Developing Countries: A Policy and Programme
Review</u></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The paper and presentation by Evans focussed an policies and programmes
of selected international agencies concerned with improving the welfare
of bath women and young children. Data far the paper came from documents
describing policies or programmes, from reviews of journals, and from interviews
with a variety of donor agency personnel, private foundation staff, and
individuals from non- governmental organizations. The following summarizes
points made about programming:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>1) <u>Historically.</u> The traditions that have provided conceptual
base for the development of women's and children's programmes have not
taken into account the intersecting needs of women and children. Programme
experience over the past decade has brought increasing awareness that projects
developed for one group may not be supportive of the other group's needs.
Today there are programmes which successfully meet the needs of both groups,
but they are scarce.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>2) <u>Programmatically.</u> In general, those programmes which are successfully
meeting the needs of women and children have evolved as the programme has
been implemented and needs have been identified. It is more common for
women in development programmes to eventually include a child care component
than it is for an early childhood care and education programme to include
programming for women.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>a. Where an income-generating programme has been developed fur women,
child care is a likely add on; it develops as a result of women's expressed
need for child care support.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>b. If an early childhood care and education programme develops a component
for women, programming focuses on her nurturing or reproductive role, nut
her productive role.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>3) <u>Organizationally</u>. In funding agencies, the further from the
field one goes, the less awareness there is within current programming
of the intersecting needs of women and children and the potential trade-
- offs. Those agencies and organizations that work with national governments
generally have lower levels of awareness of the issues than non- - governmental
agencies. Many governments have a conservative perspective on women's role
in development At the same time, they may be willing to invest funds in
programmes which promote children's survival and development.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>4) <u>In The Literature</u>. Journals which focus on women's role in
development; seldom refer to children, except to mention the need for maternity
leave or for child care centers created in support of women's changing
role. Child development journals generally focus on how to create effective
programmes for young children; little or no consideration is given to the
needs of parents.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>5. <u>Conceptually</u>. There is at present some evidence of a willingness
to re- examine the conceptual position of the 1970s which emphasized separating
women's productive and reproductive role, There is a move to recognize
the value of both roles. Today arguments are being made to the effect that:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>a. It is legitimate to support the development of women as women by
strengthening women's roles as mothers. This is being done by: providing
monetary or work- - related rewards for child care and education - - -
recognizing that these activities can be productive as well as personally
rewarding; and by recognizing women's participation in the provision of
child care as a valid form of work for women that should be judged as other
jobs are judged in terms of pay, incremental knowledge, skill development,
security, training, self-esteem, etc.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>b. It is legitimate to support children's development by focussing on
the development of women in their productive roles. Those characteristics
which facilitate women's development as producers also enhance their parenting
role. By providing better health, increasing women's educational opportunities,
providing access to technical training, assuring that women have access
to income, providing women with credit and land, and freeing women from
the long hours required for household maintenance, children's situation
will improve.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Projecting into the future, Evans indicated she thought that the changing
climate could allow women's and children's intersecting needs to be brought
together conceptually and programmatically. But those currently concerned
with the issues will have to provide support to the effort through continued
research, thorough disseminatian of information, and through advocacy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Several policy implications were drawn:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>a. There needs to be a distinction made between how programmes are conceptualized
and how they are implemented. While it is important to conceptualize and
design a programme to meet simultaneously the intersecting needs of women
and children, that may be difficult in practice. In implementation, a sequential
approach and &quot;adding on&quot; may be preferable to trying to satisfy
fully both sets of needs from the outset. There is a greater likelihood
of success if a programme starts with one component of the other, but with
the early and clear intention of adding additional components.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>b. Within some agencies policy is built upon (or evolves from) successful
projects. Thus it can be argued that the lessons learned from successful
programmes need to be crystalized and disseminated. Likewise, additional
field projects need to be developed in support of the intersecting needs
of women and children.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>c. It is important to present programme planners and implementers with
practical information on how to implement complementary and supportive
programme components; same are willing but have no understanding of what
is needed or how to accomplish the task.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>d. In both conceptualization and implementation it is important to be
sensitive to current frames of reference. For policy makers it is important
to frame the issue in a way that helps them respond to their current pressures.
For instance, community programmes for women and/or children must be started
within the framework of culturally sanctioned activities.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><u>Discussion of Evan's paper</u>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>1) Experience supports the idea that it is easier to add on child care
to women's programmes than the reverse. Women see the need and are willing
to do so.The more participatory the programme structure, the more likely
it is that issues of child care will be addressed. There are definite cost
advantages to adding on child care to women's programmes, These need to
be quantified. For instance, there may be savings related to reductions
in work</p>

<p> time lost or in cost savings with reduced expenses for healthy versus
sick children. On the other hand, the idea of adding an child care and
development elements to women- in- development programmes, although good
in theory, may represent a dilution of resources for women- in- development
programmes. It may not be cost effective to incorporate child care into
women's programmes when viewed on a large scale. Tn small, participatory
projects it may be cost effective but how does one replicate on a large
scale, and with what implications for costs? The net effect may also be
to transfer costs to women whose opportunity costs are lowest. Is this
a form of exploitation? One approach governments might take is to provide
&quot;matching grants&quot; to local organizations. This can mobilize local
resources.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>2) In programming to combine the productive and reproductive roles of
women, there is a tendency to focus on creating alternative child care
arrangements so that women can leave home to earn income. That may be appropriate
for children over one year. But the review presented earlier suggests that
for children under one year, women should seek the type of work, and or
the support that allows them to participate in and directly supervise child
care. Therefore, we might think not only of supporting substitute child
care, but: also of creating ways to maintain the income of working mothers
in the period following birth. The most common formal way of doing that,
often honored in the breach, is through maternity leaves during which a
partial salary is paid. There are other, less formal solutions, however.
For instance, in Jamaica, market women who have recently given birth continue
to prepare at home their basket of goods for sale, then entrust the sale
to other traders.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>3) There is a need to sensitize those who are supporting child survival
programmes, to which a great deal of money is being directed, of the importance
within their programmes of elements that benefit women. In most cases,
the success of child survival and development programmes rests squarely
on the shoulders of women. There is a growing and legitimate concern that
the &quot;technological fix&quot; represented by immunization campaigns
and other elements of the GOBI strategy will not go very far toward accelerating
the decline in infant mortality unless attention is given to women as the
main actors and as people who are already under considerable time pressure
to accomplish what is necessary for survival. TIhe simple technological
approach to child survival is least likely to benefit and mast likely to
place burdens an women. Although there is a desire on the part of programme
people in several agencies to look &quot;beyond survival&quot; to development
(both for young children and for women as agents of economic and social
development), it is very hard politically to push these ideas. The focus
is on survival. We1l- grounded arguments and solid facts are needed to
help make the case. Information about the patterns of use of women's time
and the economic implications of the patterns need to be made more available
to policy and programme people. If done, this would help build appreciation
for the connection between women's economic roles and their supportive
role in the child survival process. Another obvious area of direct overlap
between programmes of child survival and programmes designed to benefit
women is special attention to women's health during pregnancy and in the
post-natal period.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>4) There are benefits to women from more general programmes of economic
development that sl iauld not be overlooked. For example, a review of water
projects by the ICRW showed that provision of potable water is not only
a good health measure but it also cuts down an women's working hours. Another
study showed that provision of electricity gives women disposable time
for child care.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>5) The rediscovery of fathers that seems to be taking place in the United
States cannot be exported but; there is, nevertheless, a need to bring
fathers into the discussion. In some places and in some organizations,
this is being attempted to by taking &quot;the family&quot; rather than
the individual as both the unit of analysis and the programming unit.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>6) Not enough attention has bean given in the discussion to the cultural
supports and constraints which differ enormously from place to place. Religion
and language, fur instance, should be important variables in an analysis
of relationships and of programmes.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Postscript</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Following tflee meeting it was suggested that a summary be prepared
for distribution to individuals interested in the topic. In addition, there
was a call. for follow-up activities that might include: additional research
identified in the meeting as important, the evaluation of effects CSD programmes
have on women, the writing of case studies describing programmes in which
women's productive and reproductive roles are integrated with positive
results for both women and children, and the organizaition of regional
meetings in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to discuss women's work and
child welfare issues.</p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><p>
<p>
     The origin of this paper lies within a broad set of questions about how
women's income earning activities and household responsibilities areinfluenced
by technological advances and how these dynamics, in turn, affect the use of
health and nutrition technologies and influence the welfare of<p>
household members, especially children. Within that broad topic, we will focus
on one crucial task -- child care.<p>
     The welfare of children is almost by definition a product of the way in
which child care is organized and carried out. Child care is the process of
attending to basic needs for shelter, protection, clothing, health, nurturing,
and stimulation. It includes the attention needed for survival, growth, and
development. Each element of child care can be approached in many ways, with
choices from among a range of technologies. For instance, health care may be
provided through a high-technology hospital-based system or through a
community-based system of primary health care and/or by turning to the
"indigenous" technology offered by local curers.<p>
    The way in which child care is organized affects poor women's economic
responsibilities and opportunities as well as her own health and her children's
welfare. The lack of appropriate child caretaking arrangements may reduce or
limit economic opportunities or jeopardize the health and well-being of poor
children and women, or both. Examining child care, therefore should contribute
to an understanding of conditions at the level of the household that help poor
women to integrate their productive and reproductive roles. It<p>
should also help to identify the supportive conditions that are necessary for
sustained adoption of new health and nutrition technologies.<p>
    Generally, responsibility for choice and the effective use of available
child care technologies falls to women in their socially-prescribed roles as
mothers and/or home managers. Women are, therefore, central to the child<p>
survival and development crusade that has gained momentum since 1980, with a
focus on primary health care and the use of technological advances to combat
infection and aid healthy growth, such as immunizations against common
childhood diseases; oral rehydration and other basic medicines to combat
infections, especially infant diarrhea; promotion of breastfeeding for infants;
and better nutrition and health care for children generally. The crusade
reflects a broad shift from institutional, professionally- controlled<p>
services toward more participatory health and child care strategies. That shift
began in the late 1960's and has deepened in recent years as the worldwide
economic recession and related adjustment policies have made social services,
particularly health services, increasingly inaccessible to the poor (Youssef
and Hammon, 1985).<p>
    These more participatory health strategies depend heavily on time and
energy inputs from women (Leslie, Lycette, and Buvinic, 1986), but
participatory strategies are being promoted at the same time that women are
pressured to assume even greater economic responsibilities than they are
already carry<p>
ing. In part, that pressure also results from worldwide economic recession. In
the main, however, it accompanies and derives from longstanding economic and
social trends such as increasing landlessness due to redistribution, erosion,
and reforestation, the shift from food crops to export and cash crops, the
technological displacement of women from traditional tasks such as weeding and
home production of clothing, industrialization, the migration of men and
adolescent children from rural to urban areas, and the monetization of
economies. Al1 of these contribute to the increasing search by women for ways
to earn cash income, usually in jobs that are labor- and time-intensive.(1.)<p>
    At the same time that poor women's economic obligations to their families
are increasing, and the public health community is expecting their increased
participation in primary health care, women's domestic responsibilities remain
essentially unchanged (Buvinic, Lycette, and McGreevey, 1983). Poor women<p>
continue to perform and to manage essential tasks such as drawing water,
collecting firewood, and caring, nurturing, and feeding their infants and young
children. It is women who bear the children and it is almost<p>
exclusively women and female children who manage the tasks of caring for
them.<p>
    The difficult decisions and limited options faced by poor working women as
they struggle increasingly to balance their multiple roles as mothers and
economic providers have been well-documented in recent years (Buvinic, Lycette,
and McGreevey, 1983; Carloni, 1984; Dwyer, 1983; Engle, 1980; Nieves, 1979,
1981). Research has been less successful, however, in unravelling the net
effects of these decisions on the well-being of both women and their children.
This is in part a conceptual problem reflecting culture-bound misassumptions
about women's roles in the developing world. Moreover, most research analyzing
the multiple roles has been based on a linear model taking women's work as the
causal factor and children's welfare as the effect, with an assumed trade-off
between mutually exclusive mothering and productive<p>
roles. This conceptualization does not allow analysis of the overlapping and
interactive nature of these roles. It disregards the possibility that attending
to the survival and development needs of the family affects the kinds of
productive work that can be undertaken as well as the reverse. It omits other
variables, including a women's own health and energy 1evel.(2.) And, it fails
to recognize that the poverty which drove the women to work in<p>
the first place may be causing poor health and malnutrition, not the mother's
work or, more generally, that both women's work and child nutritional status
may be affected by the same set of underlying circumstances.<p>
    In this paper, we emphasize the need to step back in and to ask how the
relationship between a woman's mothering and productive roles is itself a
product of varying economic and socio-cultural environments, particularly at
the level of the household.(3.) We urge a closer look at variables mediating
the work/welfare relationship. One important set of intervening variables
relates to child care, including the availability and quality of child care and
development programs.<p>
<p>
(1.)To a lesser degree, the move of women into income earning jobs is
associated with an ideological awakening to the role of women as economic
providers and an associated desire to improve the power and status of women in
general as well as within their own households.<p>
<p>
 (2.)We will touch on women's health issues within the context of their
multiple roles as mothers and economic providers but for a more complete
discussion of poor women's particular health needs and those related to their<p>
specific work occupations see C.P. MacCormack, "Health Risks Women Incur in
Production in Developing Countries," Ross Institute, London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine, 1982.<p>
<p>
 (3.)We use the term "household" and not "family." The two terms are used
interchangeably throughout this discussion, but it is important to note that
they are not synonymous (Bennett, 1983; Nieves, 1983). Members of families are
related by conjugal or consanguineal ties. Households can consist of several
families, and while their members are often related by these same ties, this is
not always the case. Households and families in<p>
situations of poverty adjust their structure and composition to meet changing
economic and social demands in response to migration, the agricultural seasons,
family life cycle stages, and levels of poverty (Nieves, 1979, 1981; Tienda,
1980a, 1980b; Safilios-Rothschild, 1980), an important point that will be
discussed in more detail later on in relation to child care coping strategies
and needs.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Organization of the Paper</u></b><p>
<p>
    Following this introduction in section one, we review in section two the
evolving perspective brought to the analysis of the relationship between
women's work and child welfare, highlighting three common misassumptions about
the form and content of poor women's productive work and child care roles.<p>
    In the third section, we explore the caretaking strategies of poor women,
relating them to variations in characteristics of their work. We also look at
child care in relation to the composition of households and to shifts in
children's needs as they grow older, and family's needs at different stages in
the family cycle. We then examine informal and formal programs of child care
and their utilization, noting that many programs, particularly the more formal
ones, have been based on the same myths about the form and content of women's<p>
work and caretaking roles discussed in the first section of the paper. This is
reflected in relatively low coverage, an urban bias, often inflexible and
inconvenient hours, and high costs for services.<p>
    Section four suggests a program framework that supports poor women's
productive roles by taking into account variations in the characteristics of
their work and in child care needs. We try to avoid undue assumptions about
compatibility, and suggest that child care programs must recognize the reality
and conditions of poor mothers' work, including the daily time and labor
demands of essential domestic tasks, the variation in seasonal workloads, and
the distance of the workplace from home. The latter portion of this section<p>
takes the framework a step further by relating the setting and content of these
child care and development programs to the direct delivery of specific health
and nutrition technologies.<p>
    A final section highlights a continuing need for redefinition of concepts
and measures, comments on existing frameworks of analysis, and extracts
suggestions for research and evaluation and for program development.<p>
                                          <p>
 <b>WOMEN'S WORK AND CHILD WELFARE: AN EVOLVING PERSPECTIVE</b><p>
<p>
    Both the need to support and create income earning opportunities for poor
women and the need to improve the health and well-being of their infants are
important development priorities. In both cases, there is a need to know more
about the reality of poor women's lives in the developing world. That unfolding
reality brings appreciation for the difficulties involved in fulfilling these
intersecting needs, reveals innovative survival strategies being used, and
provides a basis for formulating meaningful programs benefitting bath women and
children.<p>
    The need for a revised analytical framework accurately portraying the
reality of poor women's lives in the developing world -- and from there
understanding the complex set of relationships that influence child health and
nutrition -- has been suggested by several reviewers (Bennett, 1983; Carloni,
1984; Dwyer, 1983; Mueller, 1982; Oppong, 1982). The revised framework would
have three general characteristics. First, it would avoid the culture-bound
assumptions about the role of women and children in society and about the
functioning of household systems. The assumptions have provided major barriers
to conceptualizing productive rolesand caretaking responsibilities in the Third
World in an integrated way. Second, it would incorporate attention to the
internal dynamics of households, so that "an understanding of the social and
political economy of the household as a system becomes key in understanding the
factors which influence intrahousehold allocation,<p>
particularly as it relates to health and nutrition behavior" (Bennett, 1983).
And third. it would avoid both setting up linear cause and effect relationships
and rigid dichotomization of women's roles into productive and<p>
reproductive roles so that the two necessarily involve "trade-offs" of time and
energy. Instead, attention would be given to mediating variables affecting both
income earning and child care time as they in turn affect both the<p>
productive role of women and the nutritional, health, and psycho-social
condition of children. The called for revision has been evolving over the last
decade or more.<p>
    In the 1960s, the New Household Economics (NHE) provided a fresh starting
point for many scholars concerned with the relationship between women's work
and child welfare. The NHE identified the time of individual household members
as an important household resource, thereby shifting the analytical focus from
income earned to use of scarce time. This advance helped eventually to broaden
the definition of a woman's productivity to include activities that used time
to a productive end even though women did not receive income for their work.
However, critics of the original NHE approach pointed out that much of the
research based an the NHE framework focused on what were seen as trade-offs
between the potentially positive effects of time<p>
devoted by women to increasing income by working outside the home and the
potentially negative effects of reduced child care time in the home. This focus
was based on Western ideas about the role of women in society and about the
social and political dynamics of household systems.<p>
    In this paper. we will discuss three common misassumptions, or myths, that
have emerged from the critique of NHE and that are closely related to child
care issues. They have been labeled:<p>
	1. The myth of the mother as housewife.<p>
	2. The myth of the mother as sole caretaker.<p>
	3. The myth of an altruistic family core.<p>

<b><u>The Myth of the Mother as Housewife</u></b><p>
<p>
    One cannot assume, as is often done, that all, or even most, women in the
Third World are fulltime housewives; that is the exception rather than the norm
(Nieves, 1983). A great deal of research in recent years has documented the
type and extent of economic activities performed by poor women in the Third
World and their contribution to family income, helping to dispel the earlier
Western notion of women as housewives. A six-country study, in 1979, of
low-income mothers in Asia and Latin America, showed clearly that the surveyed
women work because their families deperately need cash income (OEF, 1979).
Although many poor women are also motivated to work by a desire for greater
status, independence and decision-making power within the household (Leslie,
1985), the unsettling fact is that women living in poverty have no choice but
to work (Nieves, 1981; Safilios-Rothchild, 1980).<p>
    The view of women as housewives fosters the inaccurate view that women's
work, if and when it does occur, takes place almost exclusively outside the
home, whether in a rural or urban setting (Carloni, 1984), A problem of
definition and measurement narrowly linking "productivity" to income helps to
perpetuate that myth.(4.) Most income-earning work is performed outside the
home; most women's work is not. Women create products at home to sell outside.
They weed fields, gather firewood, haul water, and prepare food, all which make
vital contributions to the household economy. These home production activities
have always required substantial time and labor inputs from women and female
children but they were generally ignored in estimates of women's work, because
they usually do not generate cash income and are performed near or inside the
home.<p>
    Our own definition of poor women's productive activities includes income
earning activities both inside and outside the home and home production
activities. The definition includes activities that may take place in rural or
urban areas and in the formal or informal sector. We will argue below as we
discuss the relationship to child care. that the characteristics of the
particular work a woman carries out are more important than whether the work is
inside/outside the home, urban/rural, or formal/informal. This view of
productive activities can be applied equally well to looking at the activities
of other household members as well as the "housewife."<p>
    Defining productivity in terms of paid work outside the home resulted in a
significant misrepresentation of women's contribution to the household economy
and an underestimation of the demands made on women's time and labor (Buvinic,
Lycette, and McGreevey, 1983; Leslie, Lycette, and Buvinic, 1986). Although
national accounting systems do not reflect the fact, it is now acknowledged
that, when all working hours among family members are assigned an economic
value, the contribution of women (and children) to household income can be even
greater than that of poor men in the developing world (King and Evenson, 1983).
This is so, despite the fact that, whatever the location or sector, the work of
women tends to be low-paying, time-intensive (often requiring long hours),
labor-intensive (often requiring heavy physical labor), irregular,  seasonal,
and low in productivity (Anker, Buvinic, and Youssef, 1982; Buvinic,  Lycette,
and McGreevey, 1983; Commonwealth Secretariat, 1984; Leslie, 1986;  Nieves,
1981).<p>
    A particularly important contribution of recent research on women's
productive roles has been the identification of women-headed households among
the poor and a recognition of their growing number. Over 40 percent of rural
households in Kenya, Botswana. Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Lesotho are headed by
women (Youssef and Hamman, 1985). Such households are found in rural and urban
areas and are characterized as lower in income, with more younger children,
fewer secondary sources of income, and as having less access to productive
resources as compared to male-headed households. These households  are more
dependent than others on wage earnings from casual labor. Their  nutritional
vulnerability derives from higher dependency on purchased food or  transfers in
the form of food subsidies, as well as declining real wages and employment
opportunities (Carloni, 1984). A substantial proportion of the female heads of
households are also in the "prime" working age group (25-29), the period in the
life cycle when the burden of household dependency is likely to be greatest
(Merrick and Schmink, 1983).<p>
     Associated with the myth of mother as housewife is an assumption that
mothers are always physically and mentally able to carry out a domestic role.
Mothers are invincible. That view reinforces the tendency to look only at the
effects of her work on her children, to the disregard of the effects on her<p>
 own health and well-being.<p>
     It is assumed, for instance, that mothers can breastfeed. Declining rates
of initiation and duration of breastfeeding have negative effects on child
nutrition, which explains the emphasis in research on monitoring infant feeding
practices among women who work. However, while the importance of breastfeeding
for the health of the infant cannot be overemphasized, very prolonged lactation
constitutes a heavy physical burden on poor women who frequently experience
unbroken cycles of pregnancy and lactation and who are,  at the same time,
expected to produce food and cash income to support their families. In a study
of nutritional stress and economic responsibility among women in three areas of
Nigeria, Harrington (1983) found that it is women aged 25-34 who fall most
often into the highest nutritional stress ranges, having spent more than 60
percent of their time either pregnant or lactating. Almost one-third of the
Ibadan and Benin women and one-half of the Kano women in the highest
nutritional stress groups have medium-high or high scores on participation in
the payment of the basic necessities of their households.<p>
    Also, many poor women perform heavy labor, particularly in the rural areas,
which increases their nutritional and physical stress, which in turn, makes
lengthy breastfeeding dangerous for both mother and child. The demands of
lactation are longer and more costly in terms of nutritional demands than those
of pregnancy. A malnourished, lactating mother with high parity not only
produces poor quality milk for the infant, but experiences chronic depletion in
nutritional and energy levels (UNICEF, 1986a).<p>
    Biological links between the mother and infant during pregnancy and
lactation mean that the mother's health and nutritional status as well as her
reproductive pattern influences the health and survival of the child. For<p>
 example, maternal age, parity, and birth interval have all been shown to exert
an independent influence on pregnancy outcome and infant survival through their
effects on maternal health. Synergism also exists between these maternal
variables, such as short birth spacing combined with maternal age (Mosley,
1984). Research on women's work and child welfare needs to pay more attention
to the influence of maternal health factors not only on the health of their
infants and children, however, but also on the ability of the women themselves
to live healthier lives while they struggle to balance the multiple burdens
associated with their economic and reproductive roles.<p>
<p>
(4.) In the literature, the definition of a woman's productive role varies
significantly. A continuum can be established showing the different cut-off
points used in defining the productive role:<p>
<p>
Income-earning tasks	 Unpaid direct 		Domestic	 Child 		Leisure<p>
 outside 	    inside              support to income 	  	chores (Home	   care

   (1)	     (2)                  	          (3)                        	 (4)
	(5)          	(6)<p>
<p>
All definitions of a woman's productive role include income earning outside the
home (1). Some include income activities in, or near the home (2). Some include
non-income activities in category 3 such as weeding or preparation of food for
market. Fewer definitions include domestic chores (4) such as collecting
firewood, cooking, and washing which we have labeled "homeproduction." These
chores are often seen as part of the "reproductive" role which always includes
child care activities (5). Some confusion surrounds the notion of a
"reproductive role" because some authors link this to a woman's biological
reproductivity, extended to care for the child, whereas others link it to the
reproduction of societies through care and socialization of the young.<p>
<p>
<b> <u>The Myth of the Mother as Sole Caretaker</u></b><p>
<p>
    A second myth supporting the oversimplified position that women's work
trades off directly against child welfare is that the mother is the only
caretaker of young infants and children (Nieves, 1983; Oppong, 1982). When
mothers work, therefore, supposedly their child care time is reduced in direct
proportion to the time they invest in "work" activities, usually those defined
as taking place outside the home. Presumably, then, the need to work trades off
also against the use of health and nutrition technologies which require time to
use.<p>
    While it is true that the care and nurturing of infants and young children
is primarily the responsibility of women and female children in the developing
world, mothers are not the sole caretakers of children in most societies.
Indeed, researchers have noted that it is the exception rather than the rule,
for Third World mothers to do most of the child care unaided (Mueller, 1982;
Nieves, 1981, 1983; Oppong, 1982; Weisner and Gallimore, 1977). Only recently,
however, have the roles of other family members in performing domestic and
child caretaking tasks been given attention in time-use studies, showing that
they make necessary productive and caretaking contributions to help maintain
family survival. Although the role of older siblings as caretakers of younger
children is the norm in in many places, and not a stopgap measure, the impact
on child welfare of their role has been poorly documented and little
understood. It is not necessarily a negative one.<p>
    The degree of a mother's direct involvement in caretaking depends in part
on the age of the child. In <u>pregnancy</u>, child care and mother's care are
virtually the same although the care of both overlaps with other tasks and
responsibilities. During <u>infancy</u>, it is usually the mother who spends
the most time in child care activities (Ho in the Philippines, 1979; King and
Evenson in the Philippines, 1983; DaVanzo and Lee in Malaysia, 1983). That does
not necessarily mean, however, a trade-off against productive activities.
According to the time-use studies just cited, mothers rearrange their time so
that child care and home production time are maintained, while "leisure" time,
such as sleep and personal grooming, is greatly reduced and market time is kept
to a minimum. As the youngest child gets older, the mother delegates concrete
child care activities, such as feeding, bathing, dressing, and supervising
child care to others. The time of the mother released from child care is
transferred almost exclusively to market production time with women continuing
to work long hours, taking little or no leisure (Ho in the Philippines,
1979).<p>
    The use of older siblings to care for younger ones is a common pattern of
nonparental caretaking (Engle, 1986a, 1986b; Mueller, 1982; Nag and Kak, 1984;
Nieves, 1981, 1983; Oppong, 1982; Safilios-Rothschild, 1980, 1982; Weisner and
Gallimore, 1977). Sex-based differentiations in the task can be found among
siblings, although the differences are less sharp before adolescence. In
general, and in both rural and urban areas, girls begin to shoulder this burden
earlier than boys and often carry a heavier workload .in general
(Safilios-Rothschild, 1980). This is particularly true in female-headed
households and landless households (Safilios-Rothschild, 1980; Schmink, 1983).
Time-use studies in rural areas of Yemen, Bangladesh, Botswana, Nepal, and Java
repeatedly found that young girls spend more time in household and<p>
child care tasks than do boys (Chamie, 1983).<p>
    The use of caretakers other than parents is often tied to cultural
practices and beliefs (Weisner and Gallimore, 1977), but is also related to the
simple availability of individuals to assume caretaking roles, first within the
family, then outside. Availability depends on the composition and size of the
residential or domestic group. Extended or joint domestic groups, particularly
those with extended female kin such as grandmothers and co-wives, provide a
wide range of caretaking opportunities (McSweeney, 1979; Weisner and Gallimore,
1977). In contrast, where a mother lives alone with her children and where kin
or other socially relevant caretakers must assist with productive work or live
far away, nonparental caretaking is severely limited. For example, in
female-headed households, mothers often depend on sibling caretaking (Merrick
and Schmink, 1983; Nieves, 1981; Safilios-Rothschild, 1980). One study -in
Bogoti, Colombia found a relationship between household structure and
caretaking patterns: While women-headed households relied on sibling care,
mothers living in extended households relied on other female relatives, and
mothers living with men depended on friends, neighbors, and maids for child
care (Rosenberg, 1984; cited in Engle, 1986a).<p>
    Child care can also take place outside the residential unit, particularly
among low-income families (Oppong, 1982; Nieves 1979, 1981). Children are
sometimes sent away to live with other relatives in other households when
conditions are not optimal for child rearing within their own homes. Social
networks within the same neighborhood may also provide a place for caretaking.
More formal arrangements for attending to young children may beavailable as
well.<p>
<p>
<b><u>The Myth of the Altruistic Family Core</u></b><p>
<p>
    In the conceptual model of the New Household Economics, an assumption is
made that the family unit operates according to a joint utility model; that is,
that all household members share the same preferences and priorities for the
use of household labor, time, income, land, and leisure.(Bennett, 1983). A
discussion of this missassumption contributes less directly to undermining the
perceived dichotomy in thinking about women's productive and reproductive roles
in the Third World than the first two myths we discuss. But it is particularly
important for understanding the social and political forces at play at the
level of the household which influence resource allocation, which in turn,
influence the utilization of health and nutrition technologies and hence affect
family well-being.<p>
    A number of studies in recent years have shown that men and women often
have separate obligations and priorities for meeting family needs. Results
suggest that women generally show greater and steadier allocational inputs than
men for children's basic survival needs. There is evidence, for  instance, that
the mother's income is a better predictor of child nutrition than the father's
income where men's and women's responsibilities for family food are separate, a
reflection of this differential behavior (Cornia, 1984;  Kumar, 1978;  Engle,
1982; Popkin, 1983; Safilios-Rothschild 1980, 1983). Some research has shown
that even in societies in which women are not responsible for feeding the
family.(5.) when the poverty level of the family requires that they work and
earn an income (whether controlled by the woman herself or by her husband), it
is almost universally used to buy food (Safilios-Rothschild, 1980). There is
additional evidence that women's income routinely covers  medicine and health
care for children and female relatives; and that women's savings are critical
for medical emergencies (Leslie. 1986).(6) South Indian study concluded that
"female labor force participation by any female over 12 years of age
contributed significantly to the energy intake of young children" (1986, p.
72).<p>
    In situations of chronic scarcity, however, possessing both the knowledge
of family needs and the income to provide for them does not necessarily
guarantee control over these resources for improved health and nutrition.
Household income is not always pooled (Guyer, 1982; Jones, 1983; Kumar, 1979;
Rold&aacute;n, 1982; Safilios-Rothschild, 1980). The diversity of needs and
interests among family members results in a process of negotiations - serious
"bargaining" - between male and female members and the allocation of the scarce
resources are determined by the degree of decision-making power possessed by
each negotiating party (Bennett, 1983; Rold&aacute;n, 1982;
Safilios-Rothschild, 1980). Furthermore, not all household members have equal
bargaining power to enforce their own definition of utility and therefore not
all members benefit equally from the way resources are actually allocated. This
view interprets observed inequalities in the distribution of household
resources<u> not</u> as the most efficient reaction to the prevailing
wage/price situation or as evidence of the household's maximizing behavior,(7.)
but as evidence of structural asymmetries in the economic. social, and legal
position of men and women, which give the two unequal bargaining power
(Bennett, 1983).<p>
      There is substantial evidence that gender-based inequities in access to
household resources have direct implications for nutritional and health status
of each family member. For example in patriarchal societies where family power
structures are male-dominated, there is greater evidence of female than male
malnutrition and undernourishment - unequal food distribution in favor of boys
and adult males prevails (Safilios-Rothchild, 1980, 1983).<p>
    "Bargaining power," or a household member's ability to realize personal
allocational priorities, can be influenced by the individual's contribution to
the household income and some studies have shown that increases in women's
income have given women more decision-making power and control over the
distribution of resources within the household. Acharya and Bennett in rural
Nepal (1982) found that women's involvement in market activities gives them
much greater power within the household in terms of their input in all aspects
of household and resource allocation decisions. At same time, confining women's
work to the domestic and subsistence sectors reduces their power vis-a-vis men
in the household.<p>
    While some researchers have noted that economic activities may be
considered a necessary condition for female autonomy and power relative to men,
they also point out that it is not a sufficient condition (Bennett, 1983;
Safilios-Rothschild, 1982c; Youssef, 1982). Social, cultural, and psychological
dimensions also influence the degree of decision-making power and control over
resources. For example, women in patriarchal, traditional societies cannot
always translate their earnings into power because they often have less power
and autonomy than women who don't work. This is especially true in households
where men have low incomes and marginal occupations.(8.) In Acharya and
Bennett's study in rural Nepal (1982), a number of socio-cultural factors
influenced women's participation in the market economy. In general, the higher
the household's image of the female sex, the lower the woman's participation in
in-village market activities, Among the Tibeto-Burman women, higher age at
marriage, greater female mobility, more positive female gender sterotype,
self-choice of marriage partner, and marriage at close proximity to women's
natal home(9.) were positively associated with higher female input into the
market economy. Conversely, among the Hindu Indo-Aryan women, earlier age at
marriage, negative female gender stereotypes, lack of female choice in marriage
partner, and marriage at a greater distance from the woman's natal home were
positively associated with the relative confinement of women's work time to
domestic and subsistence production. Additional factors influencing, women's
bargaining power that have been cited in research include freedom to divorce
and remarry, polygamy, and individual personality (Bennett, 1983); prevailing
segregation of the labor market; and sexual division of labor.<p>
<p>
(5.) Decision-making regarding the quality and quantity of food for the family
is not necessarily a female perogative. It belongs to the spouse who is
responsible for food and who has control over the income for food.<p>
<p>
(6.) 0ther factors influencing the intrafamilial distribution of food include:
the extent to which food is scarce (crop failure, poverty, poor distribution of
food in remote rural areas, seasonal lack of food, scarcity of time for food
preparation); who distributes the food and that person's characteristics
("nibbling" while cooking by young girls or grandmothers can reduce sex
inequalities between nutritional status of boys and girls, and men and women);
duration of breastfeeding and weaning practices; prevailing food practices,
beliefs, and taboos (in Malawi, pregnant women cannot eat eggs, milk, or
chicken); sex and birth order (mothers may favor older boys or older boys may
be more aggressive in securing more food for themselves, especially if the food
is distributed from a common bowl) (Safilios-Rothschild, 1980).<p>
<p>
(7.) The more traditional model of time allocation within the household assumes
that household members will allocate their time and their expenditures on
market goads so as to produce that combination of commodities that result in
maximum utility  (DaVanzo and Lee, 1983).<p>
<p>
 (8.) The prevailing male-dominance ideology in these highly sex-stratified
societies is adhered to by women as well as men, so that the women do not seek
to become economically independent; they are involved in productive activities
only by default. They are not socialized to want or enjoy independence,
autonomy, and power based on their own productive activities
(Safilios-Rothchild, 1982c).<p>
<p>
(9.) Proximity to natal home is an indicator of the degree of support a woman
can expect from her natal kin groups after marriage (Acharya and Bennett,
1982).<p>
<p>
<b><u>The Question of Compatibility</u></b><p>
<p>
    Some kinds of work are thought to be "compatible" with child care, allowing
productive and reproductive roles to be combined, while others are not. Related
to the myth of the housewife, there is a tendency to assume that work carried
on outside the home is incompatible with child care responsibilities and that
work in the home is compatible. However, a high-powered research project is not
needed to conclude that that is at best a partial truth and certainly not a
reliable generalization. It may or may not be easier, or less costly, for
instance, for a woman whose productive work is at home to take the time needed
to administer oral rehydration therapy than for a woman whose work is outside
the home. For both, a significant block of time is required away from
productive work. Conversely, some jobs outside the home permit children to be
taken along and cared for while working. Thus, compatibility depends more on
the demands of the particular work being done and on the needs of the child
being cared for than it does on whether the work is performed inside or outside
the home, or in a rural or urban setting.<p>
    Nor can compatibility be inferred easily from such broad classifications as
"agriculture" vs. "non- agriculture" or "informal" vs. "formal" sector work,
although that has been suggested. Agricultural work transplanting paddy or as a
paid laborer during harvest time may not be compatible with child care whereas
tending a home garden may be. Some "informal sector" work such as vending
flowers on the street may be compatible, but that will certainly depend on
distances to work and during work, on the surrounding conditions where the
vending occurs, and on the age of the child.<p>
    In a strict sense, a woman's work is only "compatible" with child care if
it allows her to care for a child while she is working. She does not,
therefore, have to make alternative arrangements for child care. That is the
interpretation often applied in discussions of compatibility and consequently,
the search for compatibility between work and child care has not, to date, been
very enlightening.<p>
    Discussions of compatibility that emphasize the ability of a mother simply
to be present, and therefore presumably able to cope with caretaking, are
superficial. Attention must be given also to how combinations of work and child
care affect the quality of a woman's work and the quality of childcare. A job
may allow children to be nearby and, in a sense, cared for, but at a sacrifice
to productivity on the job. The work may be compatible withsome aspects of
child care but not others. Shelter and security and food may be provided, for
instance, but conditions may be unfavorable for preventing and attending to
sickness or, they may not permit care that enhances the development of a
mentally alert and sociable child. Healthy growth and development require more
than simply "minding" a child. They require time consuming attention,
interaction, and stimulation, and a certain level of acquired knowledge.<p>
    The notion of "compatibility" is tied to the availability and the role of
non-parental caretakers. In rural areas, for example, older siblings or
extended kin may be available for caretaking tasks but in marginal urban
areas<p>
they may not be if families are smaller, if kin did not migrate with the
family, and if siblings are under pressure to continue in school or to
themselves enter the paid labor market. When alternative caretakers are
available, the compatibility issue recedes.<p>
    In this paper we too are seeking a kind of compatibility between work and
childcare by looking for ways in which support can be given to women to help
them integrate their productive and reproductive roles. But we will take a
broad view of compatibility, as suggested above. In the next section, we turn
to an examination of child care and child care strategies as related to work
characteristics, keeping in mind the cautions raised in this section. We will
make more explicit our own definition of child care and will describe
alternative child care strategies, In the concluding section, we will return to
implications for future research and programming.<p>
<p>
<b>RELATING CHILD CARE AND CHILD CARE  STRATEGIES TO WOMEN'S WORK</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Child Care</u></b><p>
<p>
    Child care is the process of attending to the needs of a child. An
operational definition will, therefore, depend on the way in which needs are
defined. In common usage, the term often refers to attending to needs for<p>
protection against the elements and from dangers in the immediate environment,
for food, and for good health. These constitute basic custodial care, necessary
for a child to survive and grow. Less frequently, child care is defined to
include meeting psychological, social, and emotional needs. We will adopt a
broad view of child care that includes:<p>
	sheltering<p>
	providing security<p>
	clothing<p>
	feeding<p>
	bathing<p>
	supervising a child's toilet<p>
	preventing and attending to sickness<p>
	nurturing<p>
	stimulating mental development<p>
	socializing the child to its culture<p>
<p>
    Each facet of child care has associated with it a range of technologies
available for accomplishing the task. Some technologies are much more
formalized and expensive than others, putting them beyond the grasp of poor
families and, often, beyond the willingness of governments to commit funds to
their support. The contrast between high- and low-technology in health and the
shift to primary health care is well known, often discussed, and helps to
motivate the writing of this paper because of concern about the ability of
women to take adequate advantage of even the simplier technologies. Less
attention has been given to contrasting technologies for other child care
components. There is a parallel to health in the socialization component, for
instance, part of which, increasingly, is preparation for schooling. Fancy
pre-schools with imported Swedish blocks and highly trained pre-school teachers
represent one technology being applied with children ages 3 to 5, in contrast
with programs held in the outdoors, using stones and string and bottle caps,
and organized by local mothers with a minimum of training. The latter can also
prepare children for schools. We will have more to say about some of these
options below.<p>
    The importance assigned to each facet of child care will depend on the age
of the child, the extent to which the surrounding socio-economic environment
puts the child "at risk," the ability of household to meet the needs, and the
particular values of the society in which the child is growing up.<p>
    Each of the needs listed can be satisfied at various levels. A minimum
level of feeding, health care, shelter, and security will be needed for
survival. To realize a child's full potential, however, more than the mimimum
feeding and health care is necessary. And, attention to the psycho-social
components is required as well.<p>
<p>
<b><u> Child Care Strategies Among Poor Working Women</u></b><p>
<p>
    For low-income working mothers, the type of child care available is one of
the most important factors determining participation in income-earning
activities.(10.)  One study in urban Brazil, for instance, found that the
presence of young children was the most frequently cited reason far
unemployment (Schmink, 1982). Similar evidence exists for Malaysia and Sri
Lanka (OEF, 1979). In northern Thailand, female construction workers time their
births to avoid a period of peak job availability and do not return to work
until the child is at least one year old (Singhanetra-Renard, 1982,quoted in
Ware, 1984). Outside of Singapore and Hong Kong, few married women and even
fewer mothers are employed in factories. In Java women give up working when
they become pregnant or at least after the birth of the child. In Malaysia, the
employment of married women in factories is still extremely uncommon (Ware,
1984). The presence of infants under the age of one keeps Sri Lankan women out
of the labor force (OEF, 1979). These examples emphasize withdrawl from work or
unemployment. However, most poor women must work. They must, therefore, find
coping strategies for child care.<p>
    There are three main ways in which child care responsibilities can be met
by working women, to whom most societies continue to assign the care
responsibilities:<p>
<p>
	1.   Provide care oneself<p>
	2.   Delegate responsibility, but manage and supervise<p>
	3.   Use an existing service<p>
<p>
    In everyday life, these child care categories blur, with different patterns
being used at different times of the year (or even during a day), and with
different caretaking functions associated with different caretaking patterns.
During the peak agricultural season, for instance, it may not be possible for a
mother to provide direct care, even though she does so during the rest of the
year, so a way must be found to delegate responsibility. Or, a woman may
participate directly in the nurturing of her child but delegate feeding and
purchase clothing. An upperclass woman may purchase the services of an
<u>amah</u> or a pre-school but continue to supervise and occasionally take
part directly in the caregiving.<p>
<p>
    1. <u>Providing Direct Care</u><p>
<p>
	Time-use studies indicate that in spite of the multiple demands on poor
working women, child care is an important priority to them. Working women are
reluctant to allocate less time to child care or to turn over child care tasks
to others as their home production or market work increases, particularly when
faced with unsatisfactory alternatives.<p>
	<u>Reducing "leisure" activities</u>. One coping strategy that emerges from
time-use studies is to reduce the time spent in "leisure" activities, such as
sleep and personal care as the working day becomes longer (Bunster, 1983;
Engle, 1986; Nieves, 1981; OEF, 1979; Popkin, 1983).(11.) This strategy
obviously takes its toll on women's health. If work does not permit physical
proximity to a child during the day, this coping strategy will be a partial
one.<p>
	<u>Adjusting economic activities</u>. Perhaps the most common coping strategy
used by poor women to meet multiple responsibilities is to choose a particular
job that allows them also to be available for child care<p>
responsibilities (DaVanzo and Lee, 1983; Deere, 1983; Bunster, 1983); i.e., a
productive activity in or near the home or work in which the child can be
brought along. These economic activities are not usually found in the formal
economic sector and tend to be labor- and time- intensive, and low in
productivity. Mothers who work as vendors in both rural and urban markets also
frequently take their children with them (OEF, 1979; Bunster, 1983; Deere,
1983). Among low-income women in urban Brazil, women who once worked as maids
find they are no longer welcome with children. The most common occupation for
them becomes that of laundress, work which allows a mother to combine child
care and work (OEF, 1979). Working women in the slums of San Salvador and in
Lima, Per&uacute; prefer work that keeps them either inside the home (piecemeal
work for others) or very close to it (e.g. as market sellers), so that they can
care for their children (Anderson, et. al., 1979; Bunster, 1983; Nieves, 1979).
In a rural survey area of the Dominican Republic, even during harvest season,
over 60 percent of the mothers continue to care for their children. In the
rural community surveyed in Korea where many women do agricultural work, 43
percent of the mothers reported taking their children with them.<p>
<p>
    <u>2. Delegating Responsibility</u><p>
<p>
	In spite of her most valient efforts, a poor woman who must work will seldom
be able to fulfill completely and at all times the responsibility for the many
demands of child care. Consequently, some version of this second way to fulfill
childcare responsibilities is followed by almost all poor women. In some
cultures, child care is taken away from the mother and assigned to, for
instance, the mother-in-law, or a second wife. That cultural practice is
independent of whether a woman works and of where she works. In general,
however, mothers retain responsibility and control, and, although
responsibilities are delegated, working mothers still manage and supervise the
child care.<p>
	<u>Extended family</u>. When the additional time and labor demands of a
mother's work do not allow her to care for her child, the extended family is
usually the first choice in helping her to meet her child care needs, even in
urban areas. In a six-country study of low-income working mothers in Asia and
Latin America, relatives were felt to be acceptable caretakers because they are
trusted by the family to give the best alternative care (OEF, 1979). A study in
San Salvador revealed that some women move in to live with their sisters or
mothers so that domestic and income-earning responsibilities can be shared
(Nieves, 1979). In the Bataan Export Processing Zone of the Philippines, some
working women chose to send their children to stay with grandparents in the
rural areas. A larger number brought in relatives to live with them and care
for the children (Zosa-Feranil, 1982 cited in Ware, 1984). Female-headed
households, because they are poorer than their male counterparts, "double-up"
more often (Safilios-Rothschild, 1980). Children may also be sent to other
relatives in other households when home conditions within the family are not
optimal for childrearing (Nieves, 1981; Safilios-Rothschild, 1980).<p>
	<u>Delegating child care tasks to older siblings</u>. In very poor households,
particularly in those headed by women, children, especially females, must start
contributing their labor at an early age. (Cain, 1980; Nieves, 1981; Merrick
and Schmink, 1983; Safilios-Rothschild, 1980). The children are expected to
take on child care responsibilities as well as to contribute through work.
Older siblings, almost exclusively girls, are kept at home more often to care
for younger household members (Nieves, 1981; Safilios-Rothschild, 1980; Engle,
1986a, 1986b). In rural Nepal, the presence of female children between the ages
of 10-14 years old increases women's input into subsistence agricultural work
(Acharya and Bennett, 1982). These older siblings face alternatives that may be
as grim as those of the mother. Should they continue in school, or go to work
outside the home to earn money, or care for younger siblings so the mother can
work? Just as for the mother, the answer may be, "All of the above."<p>
	<u>Using informal social support networks</u>. When older children and
relatives are unavailable for caretaking tasks, another strategy is for working
women to arrange for trusted neighbors to care for their children. This happens
in rural settings and as well as in formal and informal urban settings. The use
of informal social support networks made up of nonkin (as well as kin) is an
important survival strategy among the poor not only for meeting child care
needs (Nieves, 1981) but also for a variety of goods andservices used in
reciprocal exchanges: information, job assistance, loans (including food,
clothing, and tools), services (including housing and food),and moral support
(Lommitz, 1978).(12.)<p>
	Delegating child care responsibilities may work reasonably well for some
components of child care but not for others. It may provide a minimum of
security, for example, but make delivery of health technologies difficult
because the mother cannot take the needed time to apply them, and because
prevention is not seen by the alternative caretaker as part of the
responsibility and because programs are not directed to the alternative
caretakers. Or, there may be a difference in knowledge between mother and the
alternative caretaker about feeding and preparation of food. Or, feeding may be
properly done, but nurturing and stimulation may not be adequately taken care
of.<p>
<p>
    3. <u>Using Child Care Services</u><p>
<p>
	Poor women cannot afford maids. If they are to purchase child care services,
they will usually be purchased at great sacrifice or will be provided through
cooperatives, the community, or the government. This third form of meeting
childcare responsibilities is increasingly available and sought and will be
discussed in a later section.<p>
<p>
     4. <u>A Last Resort</u><p>
<p>
         When none of the above are possible, a poor woman may leave children,
even very young children, alone for periods of time (Engle, 1986a, 1986b;
Nieves, 1979). This unfortunate solution, born of necessity, may be more common
than imagined. A study of poor working mothers in Bogota, Colombia, for
instance, found that 10 percent of the mothers left their children alone when
working outside the home (Rivera, 1979).<p>
 (10.)Certainly, the underemployment of these women in low-paying,  low-status,
intermittent, time and labor intensive jobs is also due to their lack of
capital and of access to credit and modern technology, lower levels of<p>
 education, lack of job skills training, and the highly segregated markets for
male and female labor.<p>
<p>
(11.)Men's use of time, by contrast, does not vary much during their adult
working lives (Birdsall and McGreevey, 1983; King and Evenson, 1983).<p>
<p>
<p>
 (12.)In a study of shantytown dwellers in M&eacute;xico, Lommitz (1978) found
that objective and subjective factors enhance or inhibit reciprocal exchange
and thus influence the formation or disbandment of a network of family members
as well as nonkin. These include: 1) prescribed social distance (between
brothers vs. compadres vs. friends); 2) physical distance (being close
neighbors frequently generates intense relations of reciprocal exchange between
nonkin); 3) economic distance (needs are determined by a balance of resources
and wants; reciprocity requires an equality of wants, otherwise the
relationship becomes severed or converted into a patron-client relationship);
4) psycho-social distance, or<u> confianza</u>, between two people, which
implies a mutual desire and disposition toward initiating or maintaining a
relationship of reciprocal exchange, presupposes a degree of social proximity
(familiarity), physical proximity (opportunity), and economic proximity (need
compatibility).<p>
<p>
<b><u>Influences on the Availabiliy and Choice of Child Care
Strategies</u></b><p>
<p>
    Choices among child care strategies will be influenced by the age of the
child, household composition and life-cycle stage, the characteristics of
available work, seasonality, and the availability of adequate program
options.<p>
    <u>Age of child</u>. Recent reviews (Leslie, 1985; Engle, 1985) have
pointed to evidence indicating that mothers who are able to work at home during
the early months of a child's life are less likely to have malnourished
children, but that as children grow older, the positive income effect of
working outside the home may outweigh the greater child care time mothers can
provide by  being at home. As a child becomes mobile and is ready to talk, its
needs change, affecting the choice of strategies. It is no longer possible for
a woman to carry the child on her back, for instance. And, it is important to
provide opportunities for language development. <p>
    <u>Household composition and life-cycle stage</u>. Delegating
responsibility tofamily is only possible if extended family or older siblings
are available to be called upon. When a first child is born, there are no older
siblings to<p>
help out. When migration to the city occurs, extended family members may or may
not be available. Poor families adopt these flexible residential and
organizational characteristics -- extending the household with kin members who
can share the domestic and/or market activities or "farming out" children --
most frequently during the "life cycle squeeze," when income deficits are
highest because of high numbers of dependent children (Tienda, 1980b). These
extensions change seasonally during the "wet and hungry" agricultural season as
the demand for food, health care, and labor-saving devices is much higher
(Safilios-Rothschild, 1980).<p>
    <u>Characteristics of available work</u>. The availability of child care
affects work choices, but available work will also affect the choice of child
care strategies. If a job pays well, child care options open. If work is near
home rather than at a great distance from home and if the task itself is not
physically draining, it may be possible to continue being directly involved in
child care, with only some delegation of responsibility.<p>
    <u>Seasonality</u>. Work and the choice of child care strategies have an
important seasonal dimension that deserves elaboration. During the wet
("hungry" or "slack") season food and cash reserves are lowest and vector-borne
diseases such as malaria and guinea worm are breaking. Incidence of diarrhea
also peaks during the wet season. During the dry ("peak") season labor
expenditures are highest for harvesting. Pregnancies and births which occur
during these times can result in an increase in maternal and infant morbidity
and mortality.<p>
    The women who have to work very hard during these seasons have little time
to cook, and often cook only one simple meal, or else delegate cooking
altogether to young girls (Safilios-Rothschild, 1980). During these times,
infants needing breastfeeding or special weaning foods suffer the most as well
as lactating and pregnant women, who expend additional energy but during the
hungry season consume less food. The adverse food conditions during the wet
season and the excessive work demands on women during both the wet and dry
seasons may lead lactating women to stop breastfeeding and prevent them from
preparing special weaning foods. The health risks for both themselves and their
weaned children are thus increased at times of high incidence of diseases such
as malaria or parasitic and other infectious diseases.<p>
    Evidence from Gambia, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Korea, and Tanzania suggests the
women reduce suckling time or wean their children during the wet season because
of labor demands (Carloni, 1984). In rural Gambia, 6-9 month old infants
receive 40 percent less breast milk during the rainy season. Weaning-age child
are fed only half as often as they should be, while women's own food intake is
also reduced by 40 percent. Women in their last trimester of pregnancy
reportedly lose weight instead of gaining as they should (Stinson, 1986).<p>
    Evidence from rural Northeast Thailand shows that cooking and breastfeeding
were reduced during rice planting and harvesting and a close covariation with
miscarriages was observed during these times. Women and children are the main
water collectors and this task becomes very arduous toward the end of the dry
season, which also contributes to increased health and nutritional risk
(Palmer, Subhadhira, and Grisanaputi, 1983).<p>
    A study in rural Honduras noted that women specified that malaria, although
chronic, was especially severe during the wet season. Other health problems
reported by women to occur more often during the wet season were grippe, fever,
infections, and diarrhea. Of all illnesses, malaria causes the longest and most
frequent work disability lasting for a period of 2 weeks to a month each time
it recurs. When the mother was sick and could not perform household tasks, in
43 percent of the cases daughters alone and/or with another family member
performed these tasks. The second helper in importance was the mother-

in-
law
(Safilios-

Rothschild,
1983).<p>
    In Matlab, Bangladesh, September and October, just before harvest, make up
the lean period. Agricultural wages are low, food stocks are low, especially
among the landless, and rice prices are high. In these two months births peak,
reflecting a peak in conceptions during the often cooler and less stringent
period which follows the main harvest. It was found that birth weights decline
during this season when the mother's food intake is lowest; breastmilk output
decreases indicating a reduced capacity for lactation; and nutritional status
deteriorates, with most children either gaining little or losing weight
(Cornia, 1984).<p>
    The environmental conditions, which increase maternal and child health
risks and labor demands, also influence child care patterns. Children are
reported to be entrusted to older siblings' care more often during the peak
seasons for women's labor (Carloni, 1984). A study in Kerala showed that the
child care constraint became more pronounced during the wet, slack season when
the heavy southwesterly monsoon rains bring virtually all agricultural activity
to a standstill and all other household members have to work longer to
alleviate the decrease in income from the primary earners. "It was not uncommon
to find even aged grandmothers working more often, though at very low wages,
during the slack season. This meant that even they were unavailable for child
care, and either the mother had to reduce her own employment, and hence income,
or leave the child unattended" (Kumar, 1978). There is also evidence that child
care is affected during the dry, peak season. Postneonatal mortality rates are
higher during the hot, dry months of May and June in the Punjab, when the
incidence of diarrhea is highest. These are also the months when the Spring
wheat harvest takes place and "child care becomes more haphazard," since all
able-

bodied
adults and children participate in the harvest (Pebley, 1984).<p>
                                        <p>
<u>TheAvailability of Adequate Programs of Child Care and Development</u><p>
<p>
    From the previous discussion it is clear that there is a degree of conflict
between a mother's work activities both inside the home and outside the home
and infant/child care, even in rural, traditional societies. This conflict is
particularly acute in resource-

poor
households where the opportunity cost of foregoing income is highest. This
includes the following situations: Where women are the heads of the household;
in nuclear households where there is a greater reliance on the earnings of the
woman, and where alternative child care by adults is not necessarily available
and there is a heavy reliance on sibling caretakers; where women's work outside
the home is far away and there are no maternity benefits nor opportunities to
breastfeed; where women's work around the home involves physically taxing work
or work that is incompatible with the care of an infant or young child; and
during particular seasons when work peaks. Both women and children can suffer
worsened health and nutritional status. Women may need to sacrifice or reduce
income-

earning
opportunities or choose jobs that allow them time flexibility, which are
usually low-

paying,
intermittent, labor-


and time-

intensive
in the informal sector, and which create the barriers to their formal sector
employment opportunities. Children may have fewer opportunities for schooling.
Both often have less access to what minimal health services may exist because
of low-

income
and the competing demands on their time and labor. Efforts to improve their
welfare are obstructed by this continuing cycle of poverty.<p>
    These conditions have helped to stimulate a growing demand for programs
responding to this vast need For child care among low-

income
working women and their children. What has been the extent and quality of the
response? Unfortunately, a review of the literature with an eye toward
identifying child care arrangements that address the complementary needs of
both low-income working women and their children, reveals an approach to
program planning based on the same myths explored earlier that conceptualize
women's roles in the Third World as dichotomous. More often than not, poor
women's economic needs are pitted against the health, education, and social
development needs of their children. We will examine what seem to be two
parallel responses, one of child-centered programs, the other, women-centered
programs.<p>
<p>
<u>Child-Centered Care and Development Programs</u><p>
<p>
    <u>Program evolution</u>. Historically, most centers in the developing
world providing attention to children were created specifically to cater to
early educational needs of children. Called "preschools," their curricula
were<p>
generally oriented toward preparing children for entrance into primary school
and not toward the integral development of the child (IDRC, 1983). These
programs targeted 3-6 year old children with the assumption that mothers were
available to take care of the social, intellectual, and mental development of
their younger children. In most countries in the developing world, they were
concentrated in urban areas and catered to middle and upper class children of
nonworking women, therefore disregarding needs of working mothers who were
assumed to be housewives. The upper class bias meant that an "integrated"
approach including health and nutrition was not considered necessary. This
preschool model had a strong Western influence and variations of the model were
copied in many countries when Ministeries of Education began slowly to include
early childhood education among their programs and to use public funds to
expand coverage to lower-income groups.<p>
    Another strain of attention to young children had its origins in the
volunteer work carried out by middle and upper class women and followed an
often paternalistic model of social assistance directed toward homeless or
other unfortunate children. These child care programs provided custodial care,
and sometimes a developmental or educational component. They included children
over a wide age span in the same program, were often boarding programs, and met
the needs of a very small group for whom no alternative existed. This social
welfare model carried over into later programs begun by social service or
family welfare ministries. A third kind of program focussed on child care, in a
custodial sense, providing attention to the health and nutritional needs of
children of working parents. These centers were occasionally organized by
employers and more often by governments -- sometimes to serve its own civil
servants, or, in the case of most socialist countries, on a much broader scale.
They focussed on children aged zero to two or three, were usually located
within ministries of health or social security systems, and in most Third World
countries were not widespread, particularly prior to 1980.<p>
    For most families in the developing world, child care and development
continued to occur at home and was a family responsibility.<p>
    During the 1970s, the panorama of childcare and development alternatives
began to change. Growing pressures for expanded and reformed social programs
for children living in poverty in the developing world during the 1970s
resulted in a new expression of interest in preschool programs by national
governments, but by the late 1970s, these programs, while intended to promote
early childhood education among the poor, were still reaching a small
percentage of the population and most were middle-class and urban children
(Myers in Latin America, 1983; Swaminathan in India and Asia, 1985). Those
preschool education centers reaching poor children were characterized by a
limited educational and learning environment, contrasting with centers for
middle- and upper-class children who could choose from a range of educational
and learning experiences facilitating their development (IDRC, 1983).<p>
    Also emerging in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s were child
nutrition programs. These reflected a growing awareness of the importance of
nutrition in early childhood and particularly the malnutrition of poor<p>
children in the developing world. Initially, these programs targeted 0-5 year
old children and later, pregnant and lactating women. Most were either
nutritional supplementation or recuperation programs. Many were not effective,
for a variety of reasons, including their failure to change home environments
and to understand the dynamics rehabilitation program was developed in the
early 19709 to provide malnourished children with nutritional, health, and
stimulation within nutrition centers. Once a child reached appropriate weight
for age, he or she was returned to the family, but within a few months, many of
the children reappeared at the nutrition centers, once again malnourished
(Evans and Myers, 1985).<p>
    More recently, programs or centers with a comprehensive view of child
development have begun to expand. These programs bring together early education
with nutrition, health, and other services in "integrated child<p>
development centers." These centers have been organized and operated by
national organizations, such as the Ministry of Education, by private voluntary
organizations, by communities, or by a combination of all three. Some programs
rely principally on professionals but many employ para-professionals as well.<p>
    One example of a child-centered program offering "integrated attention"
comes from Colombia where the Colombian Institute for Family Welfare (ICBF)
used funds from a 2 percent payroll tax to establish neighborhood center
intended to serve children of working mothers. These centers employed a range
of professionals and para-professionals as well as staff for cooking, cleaning,
and security. Children were provided with meals and some health care. Emphasis
was placed on the psycho-social development of children ages 3 to 6. Although
well financed, these centers were costly, preventing expansion to many
children. The poorest and neediest families were usually not cared for in ICBF
centers which served only women working outside the home and did not admit
children of women looking far work. Hours were sometimes adjusted to working
womens' schedules and sometimes not. The lack of attention to younger children
meant that a full child care function was not being fulfilled for most
families. No attempt was made to respond to the health, education, or parenting
needs of the women whose children were in the centers. Thus, while the centers
served needs of a select group of children, they did little to benefit mothers
and only partially fulfilled child care needs. Over time, the program has made
adjustments, but it remains very much focussed on the child rather than the
family or community.<p>
    Another example of the "integrated" approach is the Integrated Child
Development Service (ICDS) program in India. Launched in 1975, its target has
been children 0-6 and pregnant and lactatingwomen living in "poverty pockets":
urban slums, tribal areas, and rural areas. Its full range of program elements
includes supplementary nutrition; immunization; health checkup and referral
service; and nonformal preschool education for children aged 3-6. In contrast
to the ICBF program in Colombia, women were specifically included as a target
group, to be provided with nutrition and health education and functional
literacy (a part of the program that was later discontinued). Although the
program is aimed at the poorest families, only children 3 years or older are
expected to attend the preschool education center, from which they are expected
to be taken home after half-a-day, presumably by the mothers. It is assumed
that the mother is available to care<p>
for the child below 3 years of age. The mother is the target and focus for
health and nutrition education. In short, the program is built around the
mother as housewife, without much thought to child care needs of working
mothers. The ICDS program has shown some positive effects on nutritional status
and health of participating children (Tandon, 1986). However, another study of
the ICDS program reports: "Often, children collect just before the food
distribution and disperse after the meal. Preschool education for the 3-6 year
olds it appears, is in itself a desultory affair, an activity that takes place
while the food is being readied. Younger infants are usually brought in by
older siblings, in the absence of the mother, to eat at the centre"
(Swaminathan, 1985).<p>
    <u>Do child-centered programs meet the need</u>? For many reasons, the
child-centered programs we have sketched briefly do not seem to be meeting the
needs of low-income working mothers and their children. One main reason is
simply that coverage has been relatively low, particularly for low-income
families, for rural women, and for women working in their homes. This point was
illustrated dramatically for Latin American mothers interviewed in a 1979 study
(OEF), none of whom had met her child care needs through a preschool<p>
program or an integrated center. In the Asian countries covered by that study,
the situation was not much better. Only 1 percent of the 499 low-income women
surveyed in urban Malaysia and none of the 279 surveyed urban and rural women
in Sri Lanka reported using such facilities, Korea proved something of an
exception, with 19.9 percent of the 141 children of poor rural women and 1.9
percent of the 158 children of poor urban women surveyed care for by child care
facilities and/or preschools. Korea's day care center system was and is
regulated by the government, and there, families sometimes favor them because
they are seen as places of education as well as custodial care. However, most
are in urban areas and have no provision for all-day care. Since 1979, the
situation has improved considerably in many countries, but coverage is still
low. Even in India where the ICDS represents an extraordinary commitment, only
about 23 percent of the administrative areas are covered.<p>
    Even when child-centered programs are available, there are several major
constraints to use, related to income, timing, and location. Fees may be
required for admission, transportation, or supplies and clothing, making them
too costly for low-income families. Also, the hours of operation do not
correspond with hours of work. Many child-centered programs are 3- or 4-hour
programs that are not intended to free up mothers for work. Child-centered
programs are usually located in living areas and are not near work sites. That
means women do<u> not</u> have to carry their children long distances to seek
child care. however, locating care near the home means that mothers working
outside the home cannot breastfeed. In a sample of Bogot&aacute; working women,
for instance, child care centers were so far from the place of work that many
mothers used their state-regulated breastfeeding break to arrive later and
leave earlier in the work day (Winikoff and Castle, 1986). Unless a center is
intended for use by working women, and few have been, the hours and location do
not allow these women to breastfeed infants during the workday or to leave
their preschool children, go to work, work a full shift, and return for the
children (OEF, 1979).<p>
<p>
    <u>Women-Centered Child Care and Development Programs</u><p>
<p>
    <u>Program evolution</u>. Another program approach to child care and
development has grown out of a concern with the needs of working women in the
developing world. This approach has two main origins. First, and especially in
the socialist countries of Asia, it has grown as part of a larger working class
movement to protect the rights of workers,(l3.) and has resulted in mandated
child care for working women. More recently, child care has appeared in
conjunction with womens' programs.<p>
    Mandated child care for working women has for the most part been limited to
children of mothers working in the urban formal sector, or "industrial" sector.
That is in keeping with the inaccurate beliefs that Third World women's work is
confined to this "visible" sector and that it is the only work that women do
that is incompatible with the care of an infant or young child. This form of
child care often requires companies employing a certain number of women to
provide child care facilities at the worksite. The limit ranges from<p>
50 women in India to 30 women in Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Venezuela, and 20
women in Chile and Honduras (Cairns, 1984; Swaminathan, 1985). The care is
mandated usually only for the first 6 months of the child's life, although in
some countries, such as India, the law covers children up to 6 years of age.<p>
    The number of mandated day care centers for children of working women is
very small outside the socialist world. In the six-country study of Asia and
Latin America (OEF, 1979), for instance, the existence of industry-based care
was not mentioned in any of the reports from the three Asian countries. Brazil,
Per&uacute;, and the Dominican Republic were all found to have labor laws which
require that establishments employing a certain number of women provide an
appropriate place where their children may be cared for and where they may
nurse their infants. However, none of these facilities were found in the
Dominican Republic or in Per&uacute; and there were very few in Brazil.(14.)<p>
    Reasons for the existence of so few facilities include noncompliance with
the law, which frequently carries an insignificant fine and is rarely enforced
(Merrick and Schmink, 1983). Also, it is said that employers sometimes hire
just one female employee less than the number which has been established as the
minimum requiring child care services (OEF, 1979). A study that interviewed
employers and employees in six countries (Cyprus, Ghana, India, Mauritius,
Nigeria, and Sri Lanka) about hiring women in formal sector jobs found an
adequate labor supply but little demand. The reasons included the fact that it
would cost more to provide maternity and nursing benefits to working mothers
than to nonmothers or men, as well as the beliefs that mothers would be more
frequently absent and have a higher turnover rate (Anker and Hein, 1985).
Similar employee concerns were found in a study of this form of day care in
India (Swaminathan, 1985). So the laws may serve only to further limit Third
World women's access to formal sector jobs rather than to facilitate it. It
should also be noted that poor working mothers are often ignorant of the laws
which guarantee them certain benefits and they rarely participate in union
activities. Their lack of demand for these child care services also contributes
to low availability (OEF, 1979).<p>
    It is interesting to note that even if all companies complied with the
child care laws, coverage would be very small (Myers and Landers, 1986). In
Brazil, this figure has been quoted at about 10 percent of all children 0-5
years of age of mothers working in formal sector jobs (Rosemberg, 1986).<p>
    <u>Constraints to use</u>. Even where this type of child care facility
exists, utilization by mothers working in the formal sector is very low. There
are two frequent and equally important reasons cited by the women themselves
for this underutilization. The first is their location near or on worksite
premises, which are frequently distant from home and which mean women have to
carry their infants and young children considerable distances. The cost as well
as the difficulty of travelling this way on public transportation is a major
constraint to utilization, Also women often see their worksites as dangerous
locations, with environmental hazards such as pollution, which they feel are
unacceptable places for their children (OEF, 1979; Schmink, 1982; Swaminathan,
1985).<p>
    The second stated reason for widespread underutilization is the mothers'
concern for the quality of care provided for their children in these
facilities. In Sri Lanka, for instance, heavily underutilized plantation
creches show them to be poorly equipped and maintained and inappropriately
staffed (Swaminathan, 1985). A study in India cites uniformily poor conditions
in industrial sector creches. It notes that finances were available, but that
little thought had been given to their proper utilization. All facilities were
missing organized child development activity (children sit idle and aimless all
day), appropriate equipment (few or no toys), and appropriate interaction with
an adult. Further reasons cited in this study for underutilization was neglect
of children, harsh or rude behavior by attendants, and untrained staff. The
poor quality felt by the mothers leads to underutilization. But few employers
connect this underutilization with the quality or nature of their services
provided; creches are seen as unnecessary by many employers precisely because
they are underutilized. A vicious circle is perpetuated (Swaminathan, 1985).<p>
    More recently, child care centers have begun to grow in conjunction with
women's income-generating projects and programs -- alongside training and
credit and cooperative activities. These programs are young. They are usually
custodial at best and are created without much consideration for the needs of
the child. They may or may not include attention to health needs. A
psycho-social component is seldom incorporated or is extremely weak. The most
important need is seen to be freeing up the mother to work. It is assumed that
the child will benefit if the mother is able to improve her income position.
There are exceptions to this myopic view, as we will see later on, but they are
not widespread (Evans, 1985).<p>
<p>
(13.) Although the socialist Asian countries have made day care for the
children of working women a part of their social and political philosophy,
another study reports that they have yet to acknowledge the problems of<u>
poor</u> working women. There are sharp urban/rural disparities in quality of
care as well as in the number of facilities (Swaminathan, 1985).<p>
<p>
(14.) A cigarette factory in Rio de Janeiro has a child care center with a
capacity of only 30 children for each shift, even though 1,600 women are
employed there. Some Brazilian companies maintain contracts with private or
public nurseries to comply with the law. One such private entity has contracts
with 85 large businesses employing a total of 12,000 women. In 8 years of
operation, it cared for only five children (OEF, 1979).<p>
<u></u><p>
<u>Preference for "Family" Caretakers: Another Myth</u>?<p>
<p>
    A number of studies in the Third World suggest that women overwhelmingly
prefer to have their children cared for by a trusted relative or neighbor
rather than by an institution (Rivera, 1979; Engle, 1980). This provides one
explanation for the underutilization of both types of child care facilities. It
also provides a rationalization to some for not providing child care centers.
But the issue is not so simple. Preferences may be a reflection of the lack of
acceptable alternatives rather than a confirmation of contentment with family
caretaker arrangements.<p>
    The six-country study of Asia and Latin American to which we have made
frequent reference (OEF, 1979) illustrates the importance of providing adequate
care. Most of the women in that study believed that persons other than the
family are not particularly capable or motivated to provide quality child care.
However, it was found that in areas where families are aware of the existence
of child care facilities which offer <u>quality</u> care, they were anxious to
have access to such services.(15.)<p>
    It is reported that in a few places served by the ICDS Anganwadi in India,
the program has been obliged to act as a day care center, keeping the child
while the mother is at work in the fields, and that in many others, mothers are
pressing for such a service (Swaminathan, 1985). In a study in rural Thailand,
rural women agricultural workers were asked whether they wanted child care
facilities and whether these should be provided year-round or only in certain
months. A clear majority wanted facilities during the times of their greatest
agricultural responsibilities - during rice planting and harvesting. In the
village where there was more intensive year-round cultivation of crops, the
women expressed a desire for year-round child-care facilities (Palmer,
Subhadhira, and Grisanaputi, 1983).<p>
<p>
(15.)Among the surveyed population in Korea, for enample, for whom preschools
are a slightly more common phenomenon, parents cited such facilities as being
the only child care arrangement which is as acceptable as using grandparent's.
In the Brazilian study, none of the mothers currently had children in a child
care facility (there is at least one center in the community), but 32.5 percent
suggested such child care centers as an acceptable arrangement for meeting
child care needs. In urban Malaysia, (where 1 percent of the surveyed families
used child care facilities, an average of 30 percent of both men and women felt
that teachers, and specially trained women, should be the caretakers (OEF,
1979).<p>
<p>
<b><u>What Kind of Child Care Facilities Do Poor Working Women
Prefer?</u></b><p>
<p>
    A study of child care needs in Latin America and Asia showed that in
"either/or" situations, families prefer to send children 3-5 years of age to
child care centers rather than children aged 0-3. This is because parents give
high value to activities that prepare children for entering the formal school
system, In fact, many feel the greatest advantage of child care facilities is a
pre-school education opportunity. They recognize that intellectual stimulation
is not usually available at home for their children<p>
while in the care of older siblings or other family members (OEF, 1979).<p>
    Also, one of the most important characteristics of a successful child care
program is felt by the parents to be its community basis, both in terms of
location and participation (OEF, 1979; Schmink, 1982). In the Dominican
Republic, the overwhelming majority of women (90%) preferred neighborhood
locations (as opposed to the workplace) for day care centers in order to avoid
transportation problems. The same preference has been expressed by working
women in several other developing countries, including India, Colombia, and
Brazil (OEF, 1979; Rivera, 1979; Schmink, 1982; Swaminathan, 1985), although
these studies have not indicated the type of work in which these mothers are
engaged.<p>
    In brief, programs of child care arid development have expanded in recent
years, but often without the needed attention to the intersecting needs of the
women and children from the poor families these programs should serve. The
options available have often been too expensive, of poor quality, or organized
without adequate attention to location and timing.<p>
<p>
<b>SUPPORTING THE INTEGRATION OF WOMEN'S PRODUCTIVE AND REPRODUCTIVE</b><p>
<b>ROLES:  CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM RECOMMENDATIONS</b><p>
<p>
    The exploration of the relationships among women's traditional tasks of
caring and feeding infants and young children and their increasing obligations
as economic providers for their families suggests a vast and differentiated
need for child care, which is not being met by many existing child care and
development arrangements. A major weakness in child care programs as they try
to respond to that need is their unwillingness to let go of the myth of the
mother as housewife and to accept that the neediest families are those in which
the mother is working. The costs for poor women can be high: continuing poor
health and nutritional status for themselves and their children; high
dependence on child labor to the detriment of schooling; and<p>
reduced income-earning opportunities.<p>
    As a way of contributing toward the acceptance of the reality of the
working conditions among these poor women, the next section presents a range of
child care options.(16.) We will cite examples of existing programs that try to
reconcile child care needs and the characteristics of women's work in different
sectors, and in both rural and urban areas. The following section then makes
suggestions for the introduction of specific maternal and child health and
nutrition technologies witilin the child care and development program
setting.<p>
<p>
(16.) Our working definition of a "child care and development program:" a
multifacted system of care for infants and preschool age children living in
poverty that may include nutrition and health, education including
psycho-social and cognitive development, and custodial care, which is
responsive to the child's social,economic, and cultural context and which is
usually provided in the absence of the mother who is involved in income-earning
activities for cash or for kind, inside or outside the home. It can be provided
by other family members, such as older siblings or grandmothers, as well as by
trained para-professionals and professionals, and can take place within a home,
a neighborhood (in children's centers, including preschools; adult/community
centers; religious centers) and at the mother's workplace in both rural and
urban informal sectors, near cooperatives and construction sites, and in the
urban formal sector near factories.<p>
<p>
  <b><u>Maximizing Women's Economic Opportunities</u></b><p>
<p>
    In our exploration of the strategies and child care patterns adapted by
low-income working women, we have suggested that some jobs are more compatible
with child care than others. Although we will distinguish rural and urban, and
informal from formal sectors, we continue to feel that the crucial differences
lie more in the nature of the work itself, the availability and capacities of
nonparental caretakers, and the distance of the workplace from home. Therefore,
child care arrangements have to consider the different type of work that women
perform, focusing closely on the conditions of work, hours and scheduling of
work, and distance from the home to the workplace. Needs and responses will
vary tremendously from country to country,from rural to urban areas, and from
village to village; no single design can be appropriate for all situations.<p>
<p>
    <u>In Rural Areas: Irregular Wage Labor</u><p>
<p>
    Distance of the workplace from established villages can be a constraint for
poor women working in rural areas as irregular agricultural wage laborers on
farms and as irregular nonagricultural wage laborers in programs such as
stonebreaking for roads or building ditches. Both types of work, while usually
performed at a temporary fixed location, can require travel of considerable
distances from established villages as well as long hours of work, making child
care, particularly  breastfeeding, difficult, if not impossible. These women
are often landless, heads of households, and at the lowest: poverty level as a
result of male migration to urban areas in search of wage work,  which means
their burdens at home are also particularly heavy. Also their work is usually
intermittent and/or seasonal, requiring short periods  of very time- and
labor-intensive activity. Others are migrant workers without a home-base to
return to, living in temporary shelters at the edge of construction sites and
labor camps for one month or several months, and then moving on to seek work at
another site, usually on foot. Theirs is a life of constant movement in
settlements without sanitation, water facilities, schools, nor health clinics
(Commonwealth Secretariat, 1984). For these women and their infants and young
children, a flexible approach to child care provision is needed, because of the
daily and seasonal time demands of their work. Also, they are not a stable
workforce with a fixed place of work.<p>
    One example of a child care program that has attempted to accomodate to
these daily and/or seasonal child care needs near the worksites of rural women
agricultural workers comes from Senegal. There, women who were part of an
<u>Animation Feminine</u> center proposed a program to care for children while
they and their older daughters were in the fields at the time of rice planting.
A rotational arrangement was set up, and care provided from eight in the
morning until seven at night, with contributions made toward feeding either in
money or in kind. The program became a basis for other nutrition, health, and
community activities (Evans, 1986) (see the Appendix for further
description).<p>
<p>
    <u> In Rural Areas: Family Farms and Cooperatives</u><p>
<p>
     Small family farms provide another form of informal rural work for poor
basis (Commonwealth Secretariat, 1984). This type of work, while also
intermittent and seasonal and requiring short periods of very time- and
labor-intensive work. is usually home-based or close to the village at a
permanent fixed location. In addition to perhaps the provision of a temporary
creche (if work is distant from the house) during times of peak labor demand,
another approach could be community day care. Useful examples of community day
care come from Kenya, and Zimbabwe (see the Appendix). In these cases,  the
child care and development programs are set in fixed locations in the community
and employ community members who are provided with some training.  This type of
center serves women who work year-round as permanent wage laborers at a fixed
location or those principally engaged in home production.<p>
     Rural cooperatives lend themselves to establishing child care centers.
Because the control lies with the users of the centers, hours and other
arrangements can more easily be fit to work schedules. Examples come from the
agricultural cooperatives of the green zones around Maputo in Mozambique
(UNICEF, 1986b) and from Ethiopia where the Melka Oba Producers Cooperative
added child care so that women could participate fully in economic activities
of the cooperative (Suetsugu, 1986). In the Ethiopian case, work credit was
given for the time necessary to bring children to the child care center and/or
for breastfeeding.<p>
<p>
    <u> In Urban Areas: Women's Informal Sector Work</u><p>
                <p>
    Poor women working in the informal urban sector have child care needs
similar to those of poor rural women, because they also work for irregular
periods, in jobs that are low in productivity and long in hours both outside
the home as petty traders or domestic servants. and inside the home doing
piecemeal work for others. Their work outside the home, which often has no
fixed location or a location unsuitable For children, such as a marketplace,
may take place at a great distance from home and requires long hours. Their
work inside the home may not be a safe place for children because of noxious
fumes or dangerous machinery (Commonwealth Secretariat, 1984). Again, an
informal, flexible approach to day care provision is necessary.<p>
    There are several examples of child care arrangements at, or close to,
theplace of work that respond to the particular needs of a group of low-income
working women and their children in urban areas. The Accra Market Women's
Association in Ghana established a child care facility at the marketplace which
was near enough that breastfeeding was possible. Health care and nutrition were
provided on a regular basis (UNICEF, 1982). Another example, responding in a
flexible way to the shifting needs dictated by the construction industry, is
that of the mobile creche, pioneered in India. In this case, childcare is
brought to temporary construction worksites. Again, the program includes health
care and nutritional components. Early stimulation and education is also an
important: part of the program. Mobile creches employ para-professional
workers, trained on the job, use low-cost equipment and culturally-familiar
materials, and attend to children from age 0 to age 12. Construction workers
either come to the creche to breastfeed or the baby is taken to them on the
site.<p>
    Neighborhood child care, in a community centre or in a home day care
arrangement might be suitable, with flexible hours. In such arrangements,
neighborhood caregivers usually are not formally trained. The organization of
care may be based on already existing reciprocity (kin or nonkin) networks. The
child care arrangement may be informal and private, without any connection to a
Formal network of providers or services. Or, care can be formalized and linked
to other services and supported with some training and on-site assistance for
the caregivers. Payment for the service may be in kind or in money. It can be a
"low-cost" option that is also "community-based." It is likely to build on
existing local practices. Integration can be achieved through training and in
the supportive services provided to caregivers. Day care responsibilities can
even generate income, prestige, and self-confidence for a limited number of
caregivers.<p>
    Instructive examples of home day care come from several places in Latin
America.  In a Venezualan experiment that began in 1974 day care mothers, at
least 18 years old, were paid (by the government and other mothers) to care for
groups of five or six children under the age of 6 in their homes for 12 hours a
day. Homes had to meet requirements for safety and hygiene.  Training and
supervision were provided.  Unfortunately, costs were high. Other examples come
from Colombia, Ecuador, and Brazil where costs of home day care were reduced.
In all, para-professionals from the community took on the caretaker roles. Some
support was provided from existing health services.<p>
    These examples, which are elaborated in the Appendix, illustrate the
potential for responding to the child care needs of women working in the
informal urban sector through a home day care service model. They also provoke
questions about cost, quality, effect, scale and sustainability. (17.)<p>
<p>
    <u>In Urban Areas:  Women's Formal Sector Work</u><p>
<p>
    Although work by women within the formal wage sector often involves poor
working conditions, long and irregular hours including shift and night work,
and travelling long distances to work, the permanent location of work makes a
more formal approach to child care provision possible.  In the previous
section, we suggested that such child care arrangements were infrequent (except
in socialist countries), often of poor quality, and sometimes underutilized, in
part because of the location so far from home. We also mentioned an alternative
approach -- establishing child care and development centers in the
neighborhoods from which workers come.  This approach is seldom feasible for a
large employer who draws from many neighborhoods and must, therefore, be
established through local or national efforts. Because such arrangements work
against direct involvement in child care (including breastfeeding), they should
be backed by strong legislative support for working mothers providing for
maternity leave with job protection, and some flexibility in working hours.
Unfortunately, such supports can work against employment opportunities for
women and are often <p>
disregarded.<p>
    Neighborhood centers can be highly formalized, as in the ICBF case
described earlier or they may be less formal as in the Indian ICDS and the home
day  care  examples already cited.  When formal arrangements are supported,
there is a particular need to look carefully at how each of the components of
child care-- health, feeding, stimulation, etc. -- is being delivered.<p>
   Although wew have written somewhat disparagingly about the role of formal
"preschools" and their ability to respond to women's as well as children's
needs, that option need not be discarded.  However, preschools should be
affordable (or subsidized), and organized with hours keyed to the working
schedules of the mothers,  Or, the program should make it easier for siblings
to be caretakers.  In several Southeast Asian countries where the rates of
demographic growth have leveled off or declined and where available primary
school places have approached 100 percent, spaces are now opening within
primary schools and are being used for preschool programs. There are potential
advantages to such an arrangement. It allows older siblings (who might
otherwise be at home caring for their younger ones) to bring younger brothers
and sisters to the preschool and to pick them up at the end of the primary
school session. Proximity also makes easier the organization of CHILD-to-child
programs in which primary school children help out periodically in the
preschools, as a means of learning methods of child care and development to be
applied at home and in later life.(l8.)<p>
     We turn now to examine more closely ways in which these various child care
programs might serve to improve the use of health and nutrition technologies.<p>
<p>
(17.) Several cautions should be added when considering support for a home day
care system. First, unless training and supervision are relatively good,
quality can be very poor.  Conditions can be unsafe and attention minimal.
That possibility is exacerbated if the system is not linked to other to other
support services.  Second, home day care can be relatively costly, depending on
how it is set up.  If low costs are obtained by exploiting women caregivers or
skimping on support services, unhappy caregivers, low quality service and a
purely custodial program may be the result.  Third, under some circumstances, a
decision to provide home day care can allow governments to avoid making more
permanent commitments to the institutionalized day care in which case gains may
disappear quickly with a change of governnment.  Finally, home day care is
often rationalized in terms of the family-like atmoshere it provides for a
child.  However, caregiving in a home by someone who is not a child's mother
requires some management skills as well as parenting skills. (Rosemberg, 1986)
These cautions notwithstanding, home day care is a potentially important mode
of responding to the developmental  needs of young children and provides a
viable alternative to formal child care centers, particularly for children ages
0 to 3.<p>
<p>
(18.) At the same time, the direct association with primary schools can easily
bias the content of early childhood programs toward a regimented extension
downward of schooling that does not allow exploration or learning through play
but, rather, imposes rigid forms and ideas upon preschool children. There is
also less likelihood that the community will be involved, that parents feel
they can turn over their responsibility for many child care components,
particularly the school-related ones.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Maximizing the Use of Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition
Technologies</u></b><p>
<p>
    Women already form the broad base of the primary heath care delivery system
as providers of family self-care, but their additional time and labor - and
income - are needed to implement the newer strategies found in the technologies
and practices defined by the "child survival revolution." In the case of oral
rehydration, for instance, water may need to be boiled for oral rehydration
mixtures, which may require a 6-mile walk for water and/or the time and work of
gathering additional firewood or money to purchase fuel. Money may also be
needed to buy ingredients for home-prepared oral rehydration mixtures or for
purchaseof packaged oral rehydration salts. Several feedings of the solution
per hour must be administered to a dehydrated child. Or, trips to the nearest
clinic for prenatal care, the weighing of babies, and child immunizations may
be a 3-hour walk away and then a long wait in line, costing several hours in a
single day. Fees for services may be required. Or, at the time of weaning,
special weaning foods need to be bought and/or prepared and require frequent
feeding. Poor women's lack of access to modern, energy-efficient and
labor-saving technologies for home production, particularly food preparation,
makes the provision of weaning foods a time- and labor-intensive activity. For
the poor women in the developing world who are already struggling with the
daily time and labor demands of balancing their necessary productive activities
with their responsibilities as mothers to maintain the family's survival, these
additional demands on their time, labor, and income may be too serious a
constraint. The poor health of the women themselves, an often neglected factor
in discussions of implementing child health and nutrition technologies, may
also be a constraint. All of this means that any attempts to improve the health
and nutritional status of poor women and their children must consider these
serious time, location, and income constraints among poor working women.<p>
    Our previous discussion of child care options suggests that child care and
development programs can now be considered, in many locations, as a legitimate
health and nutrition activity - as an entry point for the direct delivery of
health and nutrition technologies. If the option available and chosen by
working women is the extended family or if an informal social network is used,
then education and delivery efforts must take those choices into account.
Programs must not only be directed to mothers but to other caretakers as well.
The child care options we would like to emphasize, however, are those in which
children are grouped in some kind of regularized day care or preschool
arrangement. In such settings, children and mothers are a readily accessible
group. The link between child care and the health sector can be made relatively
easily, facilitating direct health care and referral of both groups directly to
health care services. It alsoprovides a channel of communication between health
services and families. This communication is important, since the evidence is
clear that many of the communities where the need for child care is high also
show a low utilization of health services and a correspondingly high incidence
of maternal and child morbidity and mortality (WHO, 1981).<p>
    Locating these technologies within child care and development centers or
neighborhood arrangements that have already been designed to overcome the time,
location, and income constraints to use by poor working mothers could
contribute to better use of the child survival and development strategies.<p>
<p>
		<u>Time</u>: These child care arrangements recognize the daily, seasonal,
intermittent, and 	irregular dimension of women's work both inside and outside
the home with flexible hours and 	services during times of peak labor
demands.<p>
<p>
<u>		Location</u>: These child care arrangements are located in homes,
neighborhoods, and 	worksites according to the distance and structure of
women's work - to facilitate breastfeeding and to 	help working women avoid the
time costs in transportation as well as the difficulties and financial 	costs
of transporting infants and young children long distances.<p>
<p>
		<u>Income</u>: The income constraint has been addressed indirectly by these
child care and 	development centers by lessening women's time demands
associated with child care so that they can 	increase their employment options.
Direct income effects are also provided by training and employing 	women in
these centers as child care supervisors and managers, health workers, and food
preparers. 	The income earned can help offset some of the financial costs that
these mothers face in 	implementing the child health and nutrition
strategies.<p>
<p>
    <u>Child Health and Nutrition</u><p>
<p>
    Many child care and development programs already include some child health
and nutrition activities. In addition to providing a place for working mothers
to breastfeed, there is sometimes provision of food for preschool age children
such as snacks and lunches. Growth charts are sometimes kept and screening is
done to detect physical and psycho-social problems may occur. Immunization
shots are sometimes provided. Instruction in the preparation of oral
rehydration solutions and in the production and provision of specially prepared
weaning foods may be given. A referral system to health care services may be in
place. But given the poor level of health and nutrition among these children, a
more direct and concentrated effort to deliver these health and nutrition
technologies could be made.<p>
<p>
    <u>Maternal Health and Nutrition</u><p>
<p>
    In addition to providing direct delivery of health and nutrition activities
to infants and young children, it is also important to consider the health
needs of women. The minimum services that could be provided within the child
care and development program setting include:<p>
<p>
	-   Nutritional assessment of women and nutritional supplementation for
pregnant and lactating 	women who are malnourished or anemic.<p>
<p>
	-   Prenatal care and monitoring with a good referral system to health care
services.<p>
<p>
	-   Tetanus immunization.<p>
<p>
	-   Health and nutrition education, including environmental sanitation (waste
disposal, latrine 	construction).<p>
<p>
	-   Family planning information with a good referral system to health care
services.<p>
    Several examples will illustrate child care arrangements that are also
serving health needs.<p>
<p>
		The Melka Oba child care and development program among fruitgrowing
cooperative 	members in <u>Ethiopia</u> cited earlier appears to be
successfully meeting the child care needs of low 	income agricultural rural
women while at the same time addressing the basic maternal and child 	health
needs in an area where maternal, infant and child mortality is high.<p>
<p>
<p>
		In <u>Mauritius</u>, the Family Planning Association set up a day care center
next door to their 	own facilities because the community expressed a need for
such a center and the existing programs 	were too expensive for poor women. The
center provides care for 40 children aged 3-5 years. When 	mothers bring their
children to the child care center, they are encouraged to participate in
meetings 	held at the family planning clinic. To some extent, the center has
also begun to address the need for 	women to engage in income-earning
activities. The center provides on-the-job training for young 	women interested
in working in early childhood programs. After the training program has been
completed, these women can establish their own child care center. The Mauritius
Women's Self-Help 	Association has plans to set up similar centers in other
towns (Evans and Myers, 1985).<p>
<p>
		An example from <u>Malaysia</u> illustrates another way in which a part of
the national health 	sector has been able to meet their goals by establishing
programs for women and children which fall 	outside the traditional health
sector. The<u> Sang Kancil</u> project has been developed within the squatter
settlements of Kuala Lumpur. The project was begun by health sector personnel
interested in 	establishing primary health care centers within <u>kampungs</u>,
or districts, in the settlements. Meetings 	with community members to determine
their needs and priorities, however, showed that health care 	was not a
priority. The community was most interested in having a child care system for
young 	children and in creating income earning activities for women. So rather
than building a health center, 	workers established a preschool and a women's
income earning project. After these were well-	established, primary health care
was introduced within the settings and well accepted. The project is 	now used
as a national program model and is being implemented in 13 settlements (Evans
and Myers, 	1985).<p>
                                          <p>
    <u>Other Nutrition-Related Efforts</u><p>
<p>
    Too often nutrition intervention is associated only with food
supplementation. There are, however, a variety of less common nutrition
programs that can be self-sustaining, cast- effective, and even income-earning
activities with which child care might be associated. For example, in some
food-for-work schemes and community kitchens a child care component is built
in.<p>
<p>
		In <u>Bangladesh</u>, the World Food Program supports a number of
food-for-work projects that 	employ large numbers of women. The major work of
these relief schemes involves earth-moving 	work such as constructing dirt
roads and embankments, and dredging rivers and fish tanks. Workers' 	payment is
made in wheat rations. Many young women, including mothers of young children,
participate in this heavy work. However, older needy women generally cannot
because of the nature 	of the work. Young mothers in need of someone to take
care of their children, and older women in 	need of food and income, have
devised a way to meet each other's needs. Groups of mothers engage 	the
services of an older woman who goes to the work site to watch the young
children there. Because 	the children are close, mothers are able to breastfeed
and attend to special needs as necessary. In 	payment, the working mothers give
a portion of their wheat ration to the older woman who keeps 	some for her own
consumption and sells the remainder to earn cash for other needs (OEF, 1979).<p>
<p>
    In community kitchens, the mother who cooks receives a free meal and a
small payment. Children pay a minimal price for the meal or contribute fuel for
food used in preparation. One person is responsible for a larger number of
children, freeing up the time of individual mothers. The mother preparing the
food earns cash income and the other mothers are free for cash earning
activities, which should override the small cost of prepared food (Huffman,
1986). Such an approach fits easily within the child care and development
setting.<p>
    The provision of special weaning foods, snacks, or lunches for children or
food supplements for pregnant and lactating women is an important dimension of
maternal and child nutrition strategies, given the low income levels within
these families. Weaning foods produced locally by village groups such as
mothers' clubs or cooperatives have also provided the triple benefits of
improving child nutrition, reducing time expenditures of women in food
preparation, and provided income for villagers involved in the food production
(Huffman, 1986).<p>
    The options that have been discussed above can be built on, or around
informal support systems that already exist. In order to do that, however, it
is necessary to have a much better picture of what these networks are and how
they function than we have for most locations.<p>
<p>
    <u>CHILD-to-Child Programs</u><p>
<p>
    While support is needed from working mothers if maternal and child care
needs are to be adequately met through child care and development programs, it
is also important to recognire and support the traditional child care
responsibilities of adolescent girls and older women in their role as
"substitute" mothers. Strategies such as growth monitoring, oral rehydration
therapy, and home prepared weaning foods can be implemented by these "mother
substitutes" and within the child care and development setting there are some
good examples of this kind of delivery of health and nutrition technologies
through the CHILD-to-child program model.<p>
    The CHILD-to-child program is aimed at giving older children the skills and
knowledge needed to improve the health and nutritional status of their younger
siblings and their family. The program was conceived during the International
Year of the Child (1979), by the Institute of Education in London and the
Tropical Child Health Unit of the Institute of Child Health, University of
London, and has taken hold in more than 50 developing countries. The idea
behind the program is that elementary school-aged children can be taught basic
health and nutrition care that they can provide to their younger siblings and
pass the same ideas on within the family or community environment. In various
programs children have been taught to identify malnutrition by taking an arm
measurement and to make the water, salt and sugar solution used to combat
dehydration. They are also taught about safety and how to prevent disease and
other health problems. Examples are presented briefly in the Appendix.<p>
    Health and nutrition education programs also have been directed to parent
and family members in many ways and in many areas: to adolescents, soon to
become parents, in Trinidad, and to grandparents in Jamaica, where a major role
in caregiving is often shouldered by grandparents. This particular strategy
should receive particular consideration because it can be directed toward
enhancing the development of children in the earliest months and years of life,
affords an opportunity to integrate development messages from health,
nutrition, and education, continues to place the primary emphasis for
development with the parents and extended family of a child, and offers the
possibility of effective large scale application (Myers and Landers. 1986).<p>
    The foregoing discussion suggests at least two main conclusions. First, the
potential of using both informal and formal systems of child care as vehicles
for improving the understanding and use of health and nutrition technologies
has not been and needs to be realized. Second. the fact that many mothers must
work and that mothers are not the sole caretakers of their children, makes it
imperative that health systems direct their attention to alternate caretakers
as well as to mothers.<p>
<p>
<b><u>A Special Note About Child Care as an Economic Activity</u></b><p>
<p>
    With the growth of alternative ways to meet the demand for day care, many
women are being called upon to assume new caretaker roles, in community and
home daycare centers. For some, child care becomes, itself. an income-earning
activity. These women become important figures in the use of health and
nutrition technologies.<p>
    Unfortunately, the same economic pressures that push programs toward
low-cost models of child care that poor women can afford and will therefore
use, tend to place childcare among the jobs that are low in pay, are time- and
labor-intensive, and are considered to require little or no training.
Therefore, although these programs can, and do, provide crucial support to the
income-earning activities of many women by taking into account poor women's
daily and seasonal work schedules and work locations, they do so in part by
drawing on the good will of (some would say by exploiting) those (mostly) women
who do the caretaking. And, they do so at the risk of throwing away the
potential for improved delivery of health and nutrition technologies.<p>
    Treating the job of caring for children other than one's own as a low-paid,
unskilled activity draws upon and reinforces the myth of mothers as housewives
who do not need to earn income. But taking care of others children is not the
same as taking care of one's own. Taking care of 8 or 10 children is much more
demanding than caring for 2 or even 5. Support and additional training are
needed.<p>
    When women take on the job of childcare, the additional responsibility they
incur, including responsibility far the health and nutritional status of their
charges, requires recognition of their need for training in the use of<p>
appropriate technologies. It also requires recognition of their need for income
instead of expecting them to volunteer their time and labor. It requires that
employment as a child care worker be judged on its own merits as a job just as
other forms of employment are judged. Does the job provide a proper salary,
benefits, a degree of security, training, the possibility of moving to a better
position, the opportunity for social and work-related exchanges with other
workers, etc.? This viewpoint is rarely held but the issue needs to be
confronted in the search for new ways to support the need and right of poor
women to work.<p>
    The ICDS program in India illustrates the potential for employment
generation among women, the potential for delivering child care technology
through an expanding system of child care and development, and a program
dilemma. The ICDS system now employs approximately 200,000 women as Anganwadi
workers or helpers, most of whom were previously at home engaged in
non-remunerative household tasks. These women receive three months initial
training, periodic refresher courses, and a small "gratuity" each month for
nine months, but no additional benefits.(l9.)  For urban women and the more
educated, the ICDS benefits are minimal and there is a move to unionize to
pressure for higher pay and for benefits. Iroinically, higher pay could
restrict expansion of the program and of employment and training opportunities
or require introduction of a fee leaving out women who most need the ICDS.<p>
    Experience is beginning to suggest that if child care programs are to be
effective on a sustained basis, including as extensions of health care
delivery, they must recognize child care as a form of "work" and, over the long
haul, provide adequate payment for participation rather than depend onvolunteer
time and labor. This issue cannot be further elaborated in this paper but must
be in other discussions of women's work and child care.<p>
<p>
(19.) For rural women, even the small payment and training is seen as valuable.
An ironic indicator of perceived value is an increase in the "bride price" a
woman can command if she is an ICDS worker.<p>

<p>
<b>CONCLUDING NOTES AND SUGGESTIONS</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>A Continuing Need for Redefinition of Concepts and Measures</u></b><p>
<p>
    Considerable progress has been made over the last two decades toward
understanding how women's income earning activities and household
responsibilities relate to each other and influence the welfare of household
members, especially young children. However, problems of definition and
measurement reflecting both culture-bound misassumptions and the limitations of
linear quantitative methods have hampered analysis and are only slowly being
overcome. As they are overcome, the questions asked are being continuously and
constructively redefined. Oversimplification and facil generalization are
giving way to more complex and situation-specific answers.<p>
    Redefining the productive role of women to include non-remunerative work
and home production, and turning to analysis of time as a scarce resource has
helped to open the analysis of women's multiple roles and to describe the
burdensome choices faced by poor women. Broadening analyses to include the
changing contributions to work and child care of all family members, including
young children, as they affect various aspects of family welfare also
represents an advance. So does the shift to looking at the internal dynamics of
households as they affect decisions and control over income, the use of time,
and the use of particular health and nutrition technologies.<p>
    But these advances are not yet commonly accepted. Much of the research work
dealing with women's work and child welfare in the Third World continues to
follow the misassumptions sketched at the outset of the paper -- viewing women
only as housewives, assuming they are the sole caretakers and overlooking the
fact that household members may not share the same preferences and priorities
as they approach decisions about the best use of resources.<p>
    In order to unravel further how decisions about women's work and household
responsibilities relate to decisions about the use of health and nutrition
technologies and their influence on the welfare of household members. further
clarification of main concepts will be required. For instance. both the
concepts of women's work and of childcare need further specification.<p>
<p>
    1. <u>Women's Work</u>. The slow pace of change in the definition of what
researchers have used in their analyses of "work" by women is illustrated in an
excellent review by Leslie (1985). The majority of the 41 studies reviewed,
published between 1972 and 1985, simply compared "working" vs "non-working"
mothers. Many separated women's work as "in the home" or "away from home." Some
studies depended on a link to specific occupations or on whether or not the
work was for pay. Often it was unclear whether working women who were not
earning income were included as working mothers or not (Leslie, 1985).<p>
    To analyze properly the potential tradeoffs of time and money facing women
as these relate to use of health and nutrition technologies, greater
specification of work situations is required -- in terms of the characteristics
of particular jobs. In addition to characteriring work as paid or unpaid, it is
important to know the amount paid. In addition to the distinction between work
at home and outside, one should know the distance from home -- in travel time,
and inconvenience. also, what hours are worked? How flexible is the job in
terms of the ease of taking time off? Do child care facilities come with the
work and are there other benefits? These and other questions about the nature
of the particular work will influence the possible time/income trade-off.<p>
    2. <u>Child Care</u>. To understand the potential use of health and
nutrition technologies For the benefit of young children requires an
understanding of how child care occurs and who does it. That exploration
depends on how child care is conceptualized. In this paper we have discussed
the myth of the mother as the sole caretaker and the need to open up analysis
to look at caretakers other than the mother. Accepting the idea of multiple
caretakers changes notions of what consitutes "compatibility." We have also set
out various components of caretaking that may need to be treated separately in
analyses, each of which has a range of possible technologies associated with
it. And, we have urged that the concept of care be extended beyond custodial
care to include attention to fostering mental and social development as well.<p>
    In tandem with the limiting assumption that a woman's work must be outside
the home, there is a tendency to assume that child care must occur inside the
home. Hence the notion of a direct trade-off and the implication that health
and nutrition technologies, if they are to have an effect, must be decided upon
and managed by mothers or other caregivers within the household. This is at
best a partial view. Increasingly, child care occurs outside the home and in
some kind of institutionalized arrangement. That is particularly true in
socialist countries but the change is occurring the world over, particularly in
urban areas. Including in analyses the available childcare outside the home,
whether naturally occurring through social support networks or made available
through institutionalized care, also changes notions about compatibility,
helping to dissolve the idea of a straightforward trade-off between productive
and reproductive roles. We have argued also that these<p>
 child care options open opportunities for direct delivery of health and
nutrition technologies that complement both household use and delivery through
health services. They can be used for education of parents as well.<p>
    The concept of child care should also take into account the age of the
child to be cared for. Researchers have tended to aggregate children from zero
to six years of age, rather than using shorter age intervals (e.g. 2-3 years,
3-6 years), which have important developmental as well as health significance.
In a child's first year of life, it tends to be more dependent on the mother's
physical health for nutritional status. In the second year of life, children
normally begin to walk, making them more mobile before they have developed
their ability to perceive and respond appropriately to danger. This is when
children are more prone to accidents at the same time that they need the
frequent feeding of specially prepared weaning foods. By age 3, children are
developing language abilities and better coordination, making them more capable
of protecting themselves from environmental danger and perhaps making
nonparental caretaking patterns less crucial to child health and development
(Engle, 1986a, 1986b).(20.)<p>
<p>
(20.)Instead of studying caretaking patterns by age, children could be grouped
by developmental stages: (1) walking/non-walking, which normally occurs between
the ages of 8 months and 15 months; (2) at the point in which language, and
therefore instruction, begins to be internalized so that children's behavior
can be governed by rules or guidelines in the absence of immediate supervision,
which normally occurs between the ages of 2-1/2 and 3; and (3) at the age of
weaning (Engle, 1986a).<p>
<p>
<b><u>Searching for a Framework</u></b><p>
<p>
    Setting out an operational model that will allow adequate analysis of
women's time spent earning income (allowing possible purchase of important
health and nutrition inputs) and time spent directly using nutrition and
health-related technologies by caretakers will not be an easy task. In our
review, one of the most appealing frameworks for analysis we encountered is
that suggested by Bennett, presented in Diagram 1 on the following page.<p>
<p>
                                INSERT DIAGRAM 1 HERE<p>
<p>
    Introducing this thoughtful and useful model illustrates both the advances
in thinking we have noted earlier and the need to keep at the task. In defining
relationships, Bennett center her analysis on the internal dynamics<p>
of the family. She incorporates all household members into the analysis. She
defines as her outcome measures the individual health and nutritional status of
all household members. She allows for multiple caretaking and for home
production and she avoids the assumption that the household has a single
utility function by looking separately at the per person household earnings and
expenditures. Beginning inside the household allows exploration of the
relationship between income earning and the ability to influence how household
resources, including time, are used. It provokes questions about who makes
decisions and about the social and gender-

related
motivations of the decision-

makers.<p>
    In Bennett's model the way in which "mediating variables" will be measured
and handled in an analysis becomes crucial. It is not immediately clear, for
example, how the "knowledge" variable should be measured or how it may interact
with income. And, other relationships might be postulated. For instance, does
knowledge influence efficiency of time used and also the quality of care.
Should not macro-

economic
conditions be shown as having a direct effect on nutritional status, in
addition to the effects that operate through the time allocation among tasks?
As one thinks across households and to different kinds of work, there will be a
need for differentiating the kind of work activity that generates the income to
be distributed.<p>
    Looked at out of context, as we are doing, the model has a static linear
quality to it. Thus, although Bennett is very conscious of the need for
attention to women's health and energy level requirements, the possible
feedback of improved health and nutritional status on how time is allocated is
not incorporated. We do not know how overlapping time use (e.g. simultaneously
knitting, breastfeeding, and talking with a friend) will be<p>
 handled.<p>
    In brief, despite major advances, conceptual and measurement challenges
continue as we try to understand the reality of the daily lives of women in
poverty and their families in the developing world.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Research Questions and Gaps</u></b><p>
<p>
    The previous discussions suggest a range of research problems. We have
selected four key areas for emphasis.
<p>
    1.   <u>Intra-household studies</u>. Among studies that have recognized
differential priorities and differential control over resources among household
members, too few have linked these findings to greater income expenditure on
food and other health needs for the family and from there, to improved health
and nutritional status (Bennett, 1984; Carloni, 1984). Where men's and women's
responsibilities for family food and health care are separate, women's control
of income can be crucial. But is the assumption of maternal altruism justified?
Do increases in maternal income actually lead to increased allocation for the
child? Much has been inferred about child nutrition from changes in the control
of income by women but anthropometric data on child health and nutrition is
rarely available in these same studies. It needs to be gathered and more
closely linked to income pooling, to gender-specific priorities for income
expenditures, and to gender-specific economic obligations within the household,
with regard to support for child feeding and health care. Also, more research
is needed on the factors affecting women's "bargaining power." How does women's
productive work (domestic activities vs. subsistence agricultural production
vs. market economy) affect their input into the various areas of household
decision-making? Can it actually change traditional gender ideology?<p>
    2. <u>Examining income and time trade-offs of a woman's work status</u>.
This gap, which was evident from Leslie's recent review (1985) is surprising
considering that the two major effects of women's work on a child's nutritional
status are hypothesized to be the positive income effect and the negative time
effect. To research this area it is important, at a minimum, to ask. "What is
the effect on family welfare of work commanding different wage levels and
requiring different amounts of time7 The potential importance of<p>
this point can be illustrated by a study in Kerala (Kumar, 1978), in which
significantly lower levels of child nutrition were more apparent among
chiildren of the women who were the sole earners in the family or workers in
unskilled field labor, both situations of low productivity and low wages. While
they could not relieve the income constraint for which they entered the labor
force, they added on a time constraint as well (Kumar, 1978). Similarly,
Soekirman (1985) in Indonesia Found that the negative effect of mother's
employment on child nutritional status is only significant if the mother works
more than 40 hours a week and earns less than the minimum wage. If a mother
works more than 40 hours but is better paid, the effect was not significant,
Another study in an urban area of Guatemala found that the negative effect for
children's nutritional status of mother's work was limited to domestic workers,
who worked long hours at very unskilled, poorly paid<p>
labor (Engle, Pederson, and Smidt, 1986).<p>
    Some studies have taken the age of the child into account when addressing
the income and time trade-off associated with the mother's work status.
Haggerty (1977) found that women who work at home have the least malnourished
children in the 0-11 month age group and the most malnourished children in the
12-23 month age group. Similarly, Engle (1986b) in urban Guatemala found that
children of women who did not work had better nutritional status than children
whose mothers worked, but only during the child's first year of life. The
opposite was true during the child's second year - working mothers had better
nourished children than nonworking mothers. The underlying hypothesis is that
during the first year of life the child is most dependent on the physical
presence of the mother for nutritional status than on environmental factors
such as income. As the child grows older, the positive income effect of working
outside the home outweighs the greater child care time mothers can provide by
being at home (Leslie, 1985). If this hypothesis holds in a wider variety of
settings, it has very important implications for policy.<p>
    3.   <u>The Role of non-maternal caretakers</u>. Although nonparental
caretaking of children is the norm, not the exception, in the Third World,
especially for children of poor working women, few studies have examined the
effects of this caretaking pattern on children's welfare. Very little is known
about the growth and developmental effects on young children from pear
families, of care by older siblings and other alternative caretakers to the
mother.<p>
     In a review of cross-cultural evidence on sibling caretaking by Weisner
and Gallimore (1977), the general conclusion reached was that there is no
evidence that children necessarily suffer socially or developmentally when
cared for in part by older children as opposed to the mother. Indeed, these
authors suggest that aid or support to a mother from children could increase
reported contentment with the mother role and could reduce the stress mothers
might feel if they have to work and were the exclusive caretakers for extended
periods. Also, caretaker diversity and skills for children could make their
separation from the mother less stressful. While this work study discusses
findings from 186 sampled societies, the research did not focus on families
living in poverty.<p>
    The little research on sibling caretaking patterns within low-income
households that has been done focuses on child health and nutritional effects.
In a study of the nutritional effects of sibling caretaking on children of
working mothers in urban and rural Guatemala, having an adult caretaker was
associated with better nutritional status for infants, while having a sibling
caretaker was associated with poorer nutritional status for two- and three-year
olds (Engle, 1986b). Similarly, another study of young children in rural India
found that the younger the child caretaker, the more poorly their charge
performed (Shah, Walimbe, and Dhole, 1979).<p>
    Research is also scarce on the differential effects on child welfare of
different types of caretakers. grandmother, a 10-year old boy, and a 7-year old
girl may all be available for child care tasks in a household. Who is given
caretaking responsibility and for which tasks might have different effects, at
least in part as a result of their knowledge of and ability to use available
health and nutrition technologies. In a study of child care strategies of
income-earning and home production mothers in rural and urban Guatemala, adult
female relatives were chosen to care for infants, while siblings were given
child care tasks for children one year or older (Engle, 1996b).<p>
    There are, too, questions of effects on non-parental caretakers of assuming
the caretaking tasks. One of the most obvious concerns expressed is the concern
that girls are required to stay home from school in order to attend to younger
siblings. With the gathering of fuel, animal care, food preparation, sibling
care, and participation in family income-earning work as the primary purpose of
children's activities within low-income families, the opportunity costs of
schooling are greatest. Research has shown that under such circumstances,
schooling, especially for girls, is more likely to be viewed as either too
expensive or largely irrelevant to the daily survival needs of the family
(Chamie, 1983; Safilios-Rothschild, 1980).(21.)<p>
    In Bombay, among children 6-11 years old, the two most important reasons
for girls not attending school are domestic work responsibilities and the need
to look after younger children. Similar data exists for San Salvador; Honduras;
and Khartoum (Safilios-Rothschild, 1982a, 1983). In urban and rural Guatemala,
a study showed that girls were less likely to be enrolled in school if there
was an infant or toddler in the home, regardless of the working status of the
mother, and that this caused girls to enter school at a later age (Engle,
1986b). Survey data from Belo Horizonte, Brazil, show that households headed by
females in low-income groups were more likely to have no children registered in
school, and much more likely to cite financial problems as the reason for their
children's absence than were male-headed households. They were also less likely
to have their children in desired schools (Schmink, 1982).<p>
    4.   <u>Child care strategies</u>. Not unrelated to the above is the need
to identify and describe much better than has been done in most settings, the
informal child care strategies that poor women have developed and use. Once
identified more clearly, one can ask what the effects are on the health,
nutrition, and development of children. What, also, is the active demand and
what is the potential demand for alternative child care arrangements ? What
role, in fact, do present child care programs play for poor working women and
their children?<p>
<p>
21. Research shows that within low-income households, three main factors
influence school enrollment for children: the demand for child labor (competing
household, child care, and productive responsibilities); family size and
composition (presence of other siblings and extended kin such as co-wives and
older female relatives such as grandmothers and mothers-in-law to share work
and child care); and income levels (to pay for the cost of suitable shoes,
clothes, notebooks and pencils, and registration fees), Other factors include:
age at marriage; premarital pregnancy; mother's education; parents' negative
attitude toward daughter's education; shortage of school for girls in
sex-segregated countries; scarcity of female school teachers, and the scarcity
of schools in rural areas within reasonable distance from home combined with
lack of transportation (Chamie, 1983; Safilias-Rothschild, 1982a, 1982b).<p>
<p>
<b><u>Program Evaluation</u></b><p>

    Child survival and development_programs. There are, at present, a host of
programs that fall under the heading of "child survival and development"
programs. These are, typically, health and/or nutrition programs built around
such technologies as immunization, oral rehydration, weight monitoring, or
preschool education. In addition to evaluating these programs to see what their
effect is on infant mortality rates, morbidity, nutritional status, and
psycho-social development, the programs should be evaluated for their effect<p>
 on women. Do the demands of these technologies require time of caretakers that
simply is not available -- to bring a child to the primary health care center
or to administer oral rehydration therapy, for instance? Can the reductions in
morbidity and malnutrition be translated into time savings for mothers and
other caretakers? Does saving lives of children who would previously have died,
place new and additional burdens on women as they cope with increased levels of
disability? Assumptions are made about these outcomes, but the evidence is
thin.<p>
    <u>Women-in-development programs</u>. Most WID programs are evaluated
strictly  in terms of their impact on the lives of the women involved. An
assumption is made that the benefits from these programs will improve the
welfare of other family members, particularly young children. Does that in fact
happen? Under what circumstances7 Do the childcare arrangements that accompany
WID programs do their custodial job effectively7 Do they provide a
developmental component as we11?<p>
   <u> Child care programs</u>. Do programs of child care actually relieve
burdens for working women? Are hours and locations set to correspond to the
needs of working women? Do child care programs that bring children together
actually result in higher levels of infection than would have been the case
with an alternative arrangement, again costing women time away from work, or
restricting the kind of employment they can take because a high degree of
flexibility is required?<p>
    The growing need and both real and latent demand for support of programs of
child care and development requires more careful evaluation of present
experiments and large-scale programs. Those evaluations should be done with
both women and children in mind. The goal is to facilitate working
opportunities for women and to facilitate use of health, nutrition, and other
technologies to the benefit of both women and children.<p>

worked in the fields. The purpose of the children's center, as proposed by the
women, was "to resolve the problem of caring for their young children while
they and their older daughters undertook the arduous task of<p>
planting out the rice." Entrusting the children to older sisters who were still
too small to work in the fields was a solution that did not provide sufficient
guarantees of safety; and leaving them on the edge of the rice fields meant
they would be exposed to all the vagaries of the climate as well as to
poisonous snakes. The animatrices agreed to establish the day care program as
long as the women's center did not have to pay for the program. Mothers rotated
responsibility for taking care of the children and teak responsibility for
planting and extending a community garden from which the children could be fed
while they were in the center. The first center in 1962 operated for two and
one-half months during the most difficult part of the agricultural season -
when the rice crop is transplanted. Since that time, the day care centers have
spread in the administrative district so that they serve several thousand
children. The centers are open from 8:00 am until 7:00 pm and generally operate
from one to three months during the year - when the rice crop is transplanted.
Parents pay a fee for the program in the form of money, rice, oil, or dried
fish.<p>
<p>
    The centers operate under the Department of Animation Rurale, Promotion
Humaine. Community developers within the Department quickly saw that these
centers could be used as a base from which a variety of social services could
be offered. They began to offer training to community volunteers, adult
education courses in nutrition, hygiene, disease prevention, water
purification, and treatment for such diseases as malaria and conjunctivitis.
This program provides an excellent example of ways in which a child care and
development center has served as a catalyst and location for developmental
activities that help the community at large and foster use of health and
nutrition technologies (Evans, 1986; Myers and Landers, 1986).<p>
<p>
<u>Mozambique</u><p>
<p>
    Some of the agricultural cooperatives of the green zones around Maputo in
Mozambique, combine short and feasible working hours with child care on the
spot. Since the number of mothers among cooperative members is high, this child
care arrangement allows work to continue at a sustained rhythm and cooperative
earnings are not significantly reduced. Infants receive the benefits of
breastfeeding and avoid the other physical and health risks associated with
being left alone or brought to the fields with their mothers. In addition to
providing a safe place for children to stay while their mothers are at work,
these child care arrangements are designed to provide an environment that will
stimulate cognitive and psycho-social development.<p>
<p>
    A recent evaluation of the program shows that more than 70 percent of the
mothers using them rated the creche monitors, the activities planned for their
children, and their overall care as being good and nearly as many considered
the food and sanitation to be better than satisfactory. The accommodation and
equipment received lower marks. Their ratings fell to only "acceptable" in 38
percent of responses and "poor" in 10 percent. There was frank dissatisfaction
expressed by 36 percent of the users, although most of the complaints seemed an
indication that the purpose of the creches was misunderstood. Half of those
with complaints expected the creches to provide shoes and clothes for the
children and only 20 percent complained about poor equipment and lack of
electricity. Fewer mothers said that the didactic material was inadequate or
that the quality of the food was poor (UNICEF, 1986b).<p>
<p>
<u>Ethiopia</u><p>
<p>
    In <u>Ethiopia</u>, a comprehensive child development program has been
established to provide safe care and health and nutrition for children whose
mothers are part of a fruit growing cooperative that produces oranges and
mangoes. Although women had the right to become members of  the Melka Oba
Producers Cooperative mainly for gaining income, the prevailing conditions made
it extremely difficult for women to fully participate and benefit from the
right given to them by law. They were overworked, they lacked health care
services, and the few who became members of the cooperative felt they did so at
the expense of their children who either had to be left at home alone or taken
to the orchards where they were exposed to the risk of physical attacks from
snakes, rats, or other animals. The program brings together services from
several organizations and includes monitoring of child growth and development,
immunization, family life education including health and sanitation, and the
introduction of appropriate technology to ease the work burdens of both men and
women, such as wooden wheelbarrows to transport fruit to collection points.
Both a creche and a preschool have been established for approximately 104
children aged 45 days to 6 years, administered by a Children's Affairs
Committee of the co-op. Assistance is provided to train childminders to carry
out health, nutrition, and other support activities. The salaries for the
childminders are paid by the co-op. An innovative feature of the program is
provision of work credits to women for time off to breastfeed their infants and
to parents to take younger children to the preschool. Disease-related deaths
among children ages 1 to 5 have been reduced and women's participation in the
cooperative has increased. The child care center in Melka Oba is
self-sufficient except for the salary of a trainer for the childminders, which
is paid by the Integrated Family Life Education Project. The model is being
replicated in Yet Nora and other districts are interested in implementing
similar programs (Evans and Myers, 1985; Suetsugu, 1986).<p>
<p>
<u>Zimbabwe</u><p>
<p>
    An example of the initiative of women in rural communities comes from
Zimababwe. According to a 1981 investigative report conducted by the Ministry
of Education and Culture, hundreds of women in the rural areas, with no support
from the government, have started some form of child care and development
activity for their young children. One reason cited for the push from rural
areas for these programs is the need for mothers to free themselves for short
periods from child care so that they can participate in income-earning
activities to support Family survival. The conditions under which the more than
4,400 village programs operate vary considerably. They range from programs
operated under trees, to programs in small buildings with thatched roofs, to
programs in churches, to more elaborate facilities constructed and maintained
by municipal support. A typical program serves 85 children with only one or two
mothers (generally untrained) caring for children. Many parents, because they
lack financial resources, pay for the program using a bartering system (Evans
and Myers, 1986).<p>
<p>
<u>Kenya</u><p>
<p>
    More than 500,000 children are attending non-formal preschools (called
nursery schools) in <u>Kenya</u> that originated in the self-help movement
known as <u>harambee</u>. This system grew up in part from a need to provide
care for children while their mothers worked in the fields. Parents see
benefits not only in terms of academic preparation for primary schooling, but
also in the associated provision of health care. The community is responsible
for building schools and employing the paraprofessionals who operate them. Most
of the children attending are between the ages of 3 and 6. The Ministry of
Education now provides support through in-service training, supervision, and a
program to develop localized curricula and materials. Although this preschool
has taken on many formal characteristics, it remains firmly rooted in and
controlled by the community, giving it a "non-formal" character.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Urban Examples</b><p>
<p>
<u>Venezuela</u><p>
<p>
    A program was established in 1974 to provide mothers working outside their
homes with access to child care in which their children would be safe and
well-cared for. The resulting system of home day care was an outgrowth of the
natural forms of child care found in the poor neighborhoods to which it was
directed. Day care mothers, who had to be Venezuelan and at least 18 years old,
were paid a small stipend (part by the government and part by mothers using the
service) to care for groups of five or six children under the age of 6 in their
homes for 12 hours a day. Care included health, nutrition, and education in an
established routine. Homes had to meet requirements for safety and hygiene. The
program equipped homes with some furniture and materials.<p>
    To develop and implement the Venezuelan program, the Children's Foundation,
a quasi-governmental organization presided over by the President's wife, joined
with governmental agencies including housing, public works, health and social
services, social security, and nutrition. Each day care mother received
training and was aided by a technical support team consisting of a social
worker, health worker, and a teacher serving a group of 20 caregivers in any
particular neighborhood. A neighborhood coordinator was each responsible for 60
homes. According to an UNICEF-supported evaluation of the Venezuelan program,
"The day care mothers provide the children with the necessary custodial care,
are alert to their basic needs, abide by the stipulated daily schedule, know
the norms governing the program, have basic knowledge in the areas of health,
nutrition, and child development, prepare and serve meals, protect the children
against dangerous situations, take care of the children's personal hygiene, and
give the children a home-like environment until the arrival of their mothers."
As might be imagined from the description, this particular version of day care
was relatively expensive (less expensive to the government than formal day care
in large nurseries, but still expensive). At the time, Venezuela was
benefitting from an oil boom and felt it could afford the costs. Although the
program grew to include 1,260 day care homes in 42 neighborhoods in Caracas,
overall coverage remained limited. Moreover, with a change of government,
political backing for the home day care system disappeared and the leveling off
of oil prices created renewed cost concerns. Although some day care mothers
continue to provide services on their own, the program, as such, has died
out.<p>
<p>
<u>Ecuador</u><p>
<p>
    Another example of home day care comes from Guayaquil, Ecuador where a day
care system is supported as one sub-project within a more general urban basic
services strategy. The broader program brings together primary health care,
women's income generating activities, nutrition, and social communication. Home
day care mothers, who care for up to 10 children, ages 0-6, receive some
training and are also helped to improve their homes. They are paid a minimum
wage. Mothers who leave their children to be cared for form a committee to
oversee the process. One committee member is charged each week with purchasing
food for the children's needs. The day care system is linked to other
supportive services and supervision is provided. The system seems to provide
adequate care for children and has given an income earning opportunity to some
women. It has, however, remained a relatively small program.<p>
<p>
<u>Ghana</u><p>
<p>
    An example comes from Ghana where the Accra Market Women's Association
needed to set up a child care program for their children while they were
involved in buying and selling. Working with the City Council, the Department
of Social Welfare, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Water and
Sewage, a building near the market was refurbished serving 200 children from
infancy through age 5 and one-half. Administered by the Regional Health
Officer, the program has a strong health and nutrition focus. Mothers are
encouraged to come to the center to breastfeed. Children are provided with a
morning snack and a full lunch. For children to participate, they must have a
physical examination and appropriate immunizations. Once a month a public
health nurse inspects the facilities, provides immunizations as needed, and
completes children's medical charts. Good cooperation between the market women
and supporting agencies has made this market center a success. The model is
replicable, although coverage is focussed on relatively few children.<p>
<p>
<u>India</u><p>
<p>
    The Mobile Creche Program, operating 50 centers at any given time in New
Delhi and Bombay, <u>India</u>, specialites in caring for children from one of
the poorest sections of the Indian society -- the children of migrant
construction laborers. These centers take care of about 4,000 children on any
given day. Mobility is built into the program as a direct response to the
special needs of thousands of families engaged in an occupation which takes
them from site to site, building makeshift shelters near the worksites. The
child care centers are set up in whatever accommodations are available at a
particular construction site, basements, tin sheds, unfinished skyscrapers, or
tents. When work at one construction site is completed and families of the
laborers depart for a new site, the mobile creche also moves to the new
location.<p>
<p>
     Begun in 1969 with the opening of one creche in New Delhi, the program was
initially the charitable effort of two concerned women who  provided a
supervised playing and resting place and some food for children while the
parents were working. Since then the program has expanded to provide services
for infants and young children (from 0-3 years), for children ages 3 to 6 who
enter a nursery school (<u>balwadi</u>) program, and for elementary school
children from ages 6 to 12. In  practice, however, the groupings are not rigid
and there is considerable freedom of movement. Included in the program's
content is the provision of lunch or nutritious snacks and regular visits by
doctors and treatment of diseases and malnutrition including maintaining growth
charts. Emphasis is also given to children's cognitive and psycho-social
development and one of the goals is to prepare them for the formal school
system. The creches have also evolved into community centers which also address
the needs of parents and offer classes in nutrition and hygiene for the
mothers, adult literacy training, and training in vocational skills.<p>
<p>
    In the program, equipment is low-cost and locally provided. Culturally
familiar materials are used. The para-professional day care workers are trained
on-the-job by a process of exposure, observation and participation, working
under the guidance of experienced field workers who have some professional
exposure and on-going training. Creche workers receive salaries and are
recruited from the local communities.Most are young women who may be part-time
students or unemployed, although more recently, older boys have become
interested in the program.<p>
<p>
    Although limited in scale, the program has consistently met its twin
objectives: Working for the development of the whole child while serving the
needs of the working mother at her doorstep. Also, the quality of care has been
shown to be excellent (Swaminathan, 1985).<p>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>CHILD-to-Child</u></b><p>
<p>
    One example of the CHILD-to-child program comes from <u>Kenya</u> where, in
1979, participants from the fields of education, health, and social work
determined that management of diarrhea should be the first focus of a program
in Kiambu Province. Training and support of the CHILD-to-child effort was
provided and outcomes were monitored, focussing on measuring changes in
knowledge, attitudes and skills, and comparing the number of diarrhea cases
brought to the hospital before and during the project. The pilot project proved
successful; the model was then implemented in other villages in the area (Myers
and Landers, 1986).<p>
<p>
    Another example of a CHILD-to-child program comes from <u>Jamaica</u>. The
dual purposes there are to help the school children become good parents and to
improve the care received at present by younger siblings. As part of the
regular curriculum, primary school children, 9-11 years of age, are taught
basic childrearing practices, focussing on hygiene, child-feeding and child
development. To put the program in motion, teachers were brought together in
two weekly workshops where they discussed development issues and were provided
with ideas, activities, and lesson plans. Teaching is done through song (using
folklore, music, and the Jamaican dialect), dramatizations, and other
participatory activities rather than through didactic teaching. Children color
pictures which provide a development nessage and take them home. They also make
toys which are taken home to be used with younger siblings. An evaluation shows
changes in the knowledge, attitudes and <u>practices</u> of the primary school
children (Myers and Landers, 1986).<p>
<p>
    Another example comes from an urban slum in Bombay, <u>India</u>. By
recognizing the potential of children as messengers to their parents and as
"health educators," staff of a free lunch program at a primary school have
increased participation rates in the program by both children and mothers.
School attendance increased so that it was close to 100 percent. The children
were healthier. Cleaning their own eating utensils trained them in elementary
hygiene. Profiting from this experience, the staff then addressed the health
center's problem of getting parents to bring their children for immunizations
and follow-up injections. They obtained a list of the siblings of all the
school children and had the children bring their mothers and younger siblings
for immunizations, which were given in the classrooms. "The children actually
began to vie with one another in demonstrating their influence at home." The
results were startling: a success rate of 90 percent where it was previously
only 20 percent. Building on the success of the nutrition and immunization
efforts, a "child-to-mother" health education program was begun. Health
education sessions for the older children were given, using teaching devices
such as role-playing, discussion, and demonstration. The focus was on local
health problems such as tuberculosis, malnutrition, scabies, and other diseases
and deficiencies commonly encountered in the area. The children were shown
patients with particular conditions and were taught to recognize certain signs
of illness and deficiencies. In this one small school, no fewer than 94
students brought people suspected of having health problems to the school's
health center (Bhalerao, 1981).<p>
<p>
<u>Child Care as an Economic Activity</u><p>
<p>
    A family day care program in the community of Tarqui on the outskirts of
Quite, <u>Ecuador</u>, designed to meet the child care needs of poor women
working outside the home in the informal urban sector, also meets the
employment needs of some of the community women. An evaluation of the project
shows that the mothers who have been trained as day care providers have, in
essence, established small businesses. In the process of learning to manage
their home day care programs, they learned bookkeeping and recordkeeping
skills. They also have a new image of themselves as wage-earners. While
initially seeing their work as an extension of their caregiving role within
their own family, they soon began to see their work with the young children as
a legitimate job. One example of the way their self-image changed was their
demand to be recognized as employees of the sponsoring Tarqui cooperative, so
that in addition to their regular salary as day care providers, they could also
receive the benefits that other co-op members were receiving in health care,
insurance, and job security. Unfortunately, the women had to actually resign
their positions, which gained them public support, before their requests were
met. (Many cooperative members felt the women were not entitled to the same
benefits because they viewed the work as a "contribution" to the community.)
But clearly the women are finding their "voice" within the community and their
work is being valued in economic terms by other members of the community (Evans
and Myers, 1985).<p>

<title>Childrearing Practices: Creating Programs Where
Traditions and Modern Practices Meet.</title><b>Childrearing Practices: Creating Programs
Where
Traditions and Modern Practices Meet.</b><p>
<p>
by Judith L. Evans<br>
Robert G. Myers<p>
<p>
<i>Children are more than the object of their parents' attention and love; they
are also a biological and social necessity.  The human species perpetuates
itself through children; cultural, religious and national groups transmit their
values and traditions through children; families maintain their lineage through
children; and individuals pass on their genetic and social heritage through
children.  The ultimate value of children is the continuity of humanity.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
                                                                 Arnold, et al., 1975, pg. 1<p>
<p>
For years anthropologists, sociologists and psychologists have been providing
descriptions of how children are raised within cultures around the world,
including the beliefs and practices surrounding pregnancy, child birth and
treatment of young children.  We have information on what children are being
fed and how often.  We know how children are socialized to pass on the culture.
We know where parents turn when a child is sick and what they do to restore
their children's health.  Yet we don't use that information when creating
programs for young children and their families. <p>
<p>
<p>
Despite the extremely rich data that exist on traditional childrearing
practices, patterns and beliefs, it is only relatively recently that those
involved in creating interventions have thought to use these data as the basis
for program development.  Early Childhood programs have been based primarily or
exclusively on what is thought to be <i>scientifically </i>appropriate for
young children, without taking into account the traditional childrearing
contexts within which the programs are being developed.  This often creates a
gap between what the program providers think should happen for young children
and what parents are used to doing. One of the challenges faced by those
developing policies and programs to support young children and their families
is how to maximize what can be provided for the child by interweaving practices
that "scientific" evidence would suggest a child needs with effective
traditional childrearing practices and beliefs.<p>
<p>
<p>
During the past three years the Consultative Group on Early Childhood Care and
Development, with support from UNICEF, has organized a series of workshops on
childrearing practices and beliefs.  The first set occurred during 1991 and
1992 and was focussed on Latin America.  More recently, in 1993, the
Consultative Group conducted a comparable workshop in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Within the workshops there was an expressed need to have a better understanding
of how to assess childrearing.  There was also a desire to share information
and develop strategies on how to use this information to develop appropriate
programs for young children and families.   In this article we will discuss
what was learned about ways in which scientific information can be brought
together with an understanding of traditional and evolving practices to develop
programs that serve young children and families.  In the two articles that
follow there is a presentation of the specific childrearing practices and
beliefs uncovered in the Sub-Saharan African and Latin America Workshops, drawn
from the reports oon the workshops. (Myers, 1992; Evans, 1994)<p>
<p>
<b>Why is Knowledge of Childrearing Practices, Patterns and Beliefs
Important?</b><p>
<p>
Today we have considerable knowledge about what makes programs for young
children and their families successful.  We have understood the importance of
community involvement in all steps of the process,  building on what
alreadyexists  within a community, and creating partnerships to help sustain
efforts.  However, even with this knowledge we sometimes miss the mark when
creating programs. We develop program activities that never seem to catch on,
our messages are misinterpreted, we find that people have no way of connecting
what we are offering to their daily lives, we find 'technologies' misapplied.
Why is this so?  One of the most basic reasons is that frequently programs are
designed without a clear understanding of the culture within which they are
being offered. Even programs based on a community-defined need may not be
designed in response to the community context.  Unfortunately, ideas about
practices to be promoted in a program frequently come from individuals who are
not part of the culture or group that the program is intended to serve. A
clearer understanding of childrearing practices, patterns and beliefs would
help us do our job better.  More specifically,  knowledge of childrearing
practices patterns and beliefs is important: <p>
<p>
<b>to understand, support and improve the childrearing process</b><p>
<p>
The fields of health and developmental psychology suggest that there are
actions taken by caregivers that are supportive of children's growth and
development.  There are also some actions that are detrimental.  By detecting
and understanding the effects of childrearing practices on children's
development it is possible to identify those practices which should be
supported and those which ought to be discouraged. <p>
<p>
<b>to respond to diversity</b><p>
<p>
Children grow up in a wide variety of different physical, social and cultural
circumstances. Even within cultures there is diversity.  There is no "right
way" to bring up children.   Nonetheless many programs intended to help young
children are conceived of as if all children and circumstances are the same.
Too often there is a search for the one model that will serve everyone.
Understanding practices and patterns and incorporating that knowledge into
programs is crucial if programs of early childhood development are to serve the
variety of children and families and circumstances that any program is bound to
encompass. <p>
<p>
<b>to respect cultural values</b><p>
<p>
Practices, patterns and beliefs define the ways in which children are
socialized. The rhetoric of most programs includes a plea to respect cultural
differences.  Indeed, the Convention of the Rights on the Child indicates that
children have a right to their cultural identity.  If this is to occur, a much
greater effort must be made to define, describe and understand the reasons for
cultural differences in the up-bringing of children.  <p>
<p>
<b>to provide continuity during times of rapid change</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Environments and practices are changing as a result of economic, social
and political changes.  Sometimes these changes are very rapid and they can
have a significant impact on children's  development.  In the process, some
practices are being lost that continue to have both cultural and scientific
value.  Other practices, which appear to be "deviant" represent novel
adaptations to particular settings, and may be followed for good reasons and
with good results.  An attempt should be made to understand rather than
suppress them.  Conversely, old practices are being applied in new settings or
new practices are being adopted that may not be appropriate to the changing
settings in which a child is growing up.  Unless these changes in circumstances
and in forms of childrearing are identified and understood, policy and programs
may take a misguided view.<p>
<p>
<i>Traditional practices and beliefs have a particularly important role to play
when children's lives have been radically changed as a result of war, migration
and other difficult circumstances, as described in the article by Claudia Black
(can be accessed from previous web page under Childrearing Practices)</i><p>
<p>
<i> Childrearing practices, patterns and beliefs are based on a
culturally-bound understanding of what children need and what they are expected
to become.  </i><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>What is meant by childrearing practices, patterns and beliefs?</b><p>
<p>
Childrearing practices are embedded in the culture and determine, to a large
extent, the behaviors and expectations surrounding a child's birth and infancy.
They also influence childhood, adolescence and the way these children parent as
adults.   <p>
<p>
Childrearing consists of practices which are grounded in cultural patterns and
beliefs.  Put in the simplest terms, caregivers have a set of
practices/activities available to them.  These have been derived from cultural
patterns,  ideas of  what <i>should </i>be done, and constitute the accepted
practices or norms.  These, in turn, are based on beliefs about <i>why o</i>ne
or another practice is better than another.  The practices, patterns and
beliefs affect the style and quality of caregiving.  For instance, the practice
of constantly carrying a child has a different effect on the development of
that child than the practice of placing the child in a cradle or playpen.
Further, a social and parental belief that children are given by God, and
therefore should be treated in a particular way, has effects that are different
from the belief that children are human creations.<p>
<p>
     <b>Practices:  What and How</b>   Practices include activities which:<p>
 <i>guarantee the child's physical well-being</i> -- keeping the child safe and
free from harm, providing shelter and clothing, preventing and attending to
illness.<p>
 <i>promote the child's psycho-social well-being </i> -  providing emotional
security,  socialization,  nurturing and giving affection.  <p>
 <i>support the child's physical development </i> -  feeding, bathing,
providing safe places to play and explore.<p>
 <i>promote  the child's mental development</i> -- interaction, stimulation and
play. <p>
 <i>facilitate the child's interaction with others outside the home </i>--
within the community, at health clinics, at school, etc.  <p>
<p>
At a very general level all of these behaviors can be found in most societies.
<p>
<p>
At a more specific level, <i>what </i>is done to help a child survive, grow and
develop merges with <i>how </i>it is done to define and distinguish practices
that vary widely from place to place.  For instance, in responding to the need
for food, the practice of breastfeeding contrasts with the practice of bottle
feeding.  Feeding on demand contrasts with scheduled feeding.  The practice of
constant carrying differs dramatically from the practice of placing a child in
a crib, cradle, hammock or playpen for prolonged periods.  The practice of
talking to a child about appropriate behavior contrasts with an emphasis on
non-verbal forms of communication in the socialization process.<p>
<p>
     <b>Patterns:  What should be done?</b>  The childrearing patterns of a culture
are the childrearing norms.  They include the generally-accepted styles and
types of care expected of caregivers in responding to the needs of children in
their early months and years.  The patterns define childrearing in a way that
assures the survival, maintenance and development of the group or culture as
well as of the child.  There are patterns of behavior surrounding specific
times in a child's life. For example, there are expectations in terms of
parental and community behavior in relation to a child's birth.  There are
norms in relation to how a child is named.  There are expectations in terms of
how an infant's death is handled.  There are expectations in terms of how the
child will learn to become a responsible member of the society.<p>
<p>
While the patterns govern the culture as a whole, these patterns may or may not
be followed by individuals; there are variations in the particular
circumstances in which a child is raised and individual caregivers differ in
their beliefs and knowledge. Sometimes within a culture there is considerable
latitude in terms of adherence to cultural patterns.  In other instances,
deviation leads to ostracism. <p>
<p>
     <b>Beliefs:   Why should things be done that way</b>? The explanation for why
particular childrearing practices are used comes from the traditions, myths and
the religious systems that underlie the culture.   The beliefs are a response
to the demands of the culture as well as the needs of individuals.  The family
and community implement specific childrearing practices which they believe
will:<p>
     <p>
      Ensure the survival and health of the child, including the development of the
child's reproductive capacity to continue the lineage and society.<p>
<p>
      Develop the child's capacity for economic self-maintenance at maturity, to
provide security for the elders and younger members of the society.<p>
<p>
      Ensure the survival of the social group by assuring that children assimilate,
embody and transmit appropriate social and cultural values to their children.
<p>
<p>
In some instances beliefs evolve as the needs of the people change. In other
instances beliefs restrict people's ability to respond to changing conditions.
<p>
<p>
In most societies, the family, however defined, is the primary unit given
responsibility for raising children.  There is considerable individual
variation in practice from family to family, depending on the psychological
make-up of the parents, including their own personality, the experiences they
had as children, and the conditions under which they are living.  The role
other members of the society play in the raising of children differs depending
on the specific cultural group.  In some settings community members play a
significant role and in others they take on a more distant role.   <p>
<p>
When societies are more or less isolated from one another and there are few
outside influences, what one generation passes on is similar to the way the
next generation raises its children and there is a relative stability of
values, practices and beliefs.<p>
<p>
While some cultures have remained relatively isolated and intact, there are
other cultures which have been more vulnerable to change. This vulnerability is
the result of increased exposure to other ideas, sometimes through formal
education, and increasingly through mass media.  For some societies the
introduction of different ideas has resulted in a relatively easy incorporation
of the new, with maintenance of the traditional.  For others, the juxtaposition
of the traditional and the new, along with economic changes which have
threatened people's survival, have left cultures disorganized and groups of
people at a loss in terms of their values and beliefs.  In the jargon of
present-day psychology, these cultures could be classified as 'dysfunctional'.
They no longer provide children with the grounding, stability, and vision that
was found within traditional belief systems. <p>
<p>
In the struggle for identity and in the desire to be "modern", some have
completely cast off their traditions, or think they have. Yet the modern does
not always work for them.  As a result, people are seeking to identify and
recapture traditional values.  There is an increasing awareness that much of
what existed within traditional cultures was positive and supportive of growth
and development, for the individual and for the society.  Likewise there were
practices that today we recognize as harmful to a person's health and
well-being.  It is this search to define and understand the traditional in
relation to what is known today that is the basis of current research and
programs in many parts of the world.<p>
<p>
<b>The Interface between Childrearing Practices and Scientific Knowledge </b><p>
<p>
While childrearing practices may be different across cultures, scientific
knowledge would suggest that there are basic needs that all children have and a
predictable pattern of development during the early years that is universal.
Studies from different parts of the world reveal that all young children need
adequate nutrition, health and care from birth onwards.  The lack of these
supports during the early years has  permanent negative effects on later
development.  Not only are there consequences for the child's physical
well-being; in addition, these variables interact with and have an impact on
the child's social and cognitive development.  While these factors are
influenced by the economic and political context within which the child lives,
they are mediated through the family's childrearing practices, patterns  and
beliefs. <p>
<p>
The type of childrearing practices required at a given point in time depends to
a large degree on the child's developmental age and the health and nutritional
risks the child is facing.   For example,  influences on the child during the
<i>prenatal period</i> and into the first few months of life include the
mother's pre-pregnancy health and how much weight she gains during pregnancy,
her dietary intake, how much energy she expends, and her emotional state.
(Engle, 1992) There are traditional beliefs and practices that impact on the
mother's health and preparedness to give birth to a healthy infant.   For
example, in many cultures in Sub-Saharan Africa the practice is for pregnant
women to observe food taboos that restrict their consumption of foods that are
in fact important to their nutrition and the growth of the foetus.  In some
instances these taboos compound women's undernourishment and lead to high
maternal and infant mortality rates. <p>
<p>
At <i>birth and during the first year of life </i>the child is at the greatest
risk of mortality.  That may be why there are so many beliefs and practices
within traditional cultures that surround the birth of a child.  It is
recognized as a critical time for both the child and the mother.  Where a
period of confinement is a part of the tradition it allows the mother time to
recover physically and to bond with the child before she is required to assume
her tasks.  The negative side of this practice is that it may keep the mother
from getting medical care that she requires. <p>
<p>
During the <i>post-partum and early infancy stages </i>the child is completely
dependent on others for care.  Generally the mother is the primary caregiver,
sometimes with considerable support from others and sometime alone.  She is
responsible for providing all the things an infant needs:  protection from
physical danger; adequate nutrition and health care; an adult who can
understand and respond to signals; things to look at, touch, hear, smell, and
taste; opportunities to explore the world; appropriate language stimulation;
and an adult with whom to form an attachment.  (Donohue-Colletta, 1992, pg. 65)
The level of support the mother receives from others in the family and from
society plays an important role in the kind of care she is able to provide
during this time. Thus the cultural patterns surrounding the role of the
father, other family members and the community during this period is important
for the child's survival and development.<p>
<p>
During <i>late infancy</i> (or when complementary foods are introduced), the
child is at greatest risk of growth faltering.  While growth faltering may be
the result of inadequate nutrition, there is clear evidence to suggest that the
feeding process itself is important in determining a child's later development.
(Evans, 1994)  Thus, not only is it important to know what kinds of foods are
available to children, it is also important to understand the context within
which food is provided.  <p>
<p>
Once again, there are traditional practices (positive and negative) that
provide insight into the factors affecting a child's nutritional status.  These
involve the kinds of foods that are recommended for children, food taboos, and
what kind of food is introduced and when.  Also of importance are feeding
patterns within the family.  In some cultures children are fed only what
remains after all other members of the family have eaten. Children may also eat
only when adults eat, which may be two times a day.  Also of importance is who
is doing the feeding?  Is it only the mother?  Is her attention given to the
task or is she involved in other activities at the same time?  Are older
siblings the ones responsible for feeding the younger child?  Are they paying
attention to how much the child is eating?  Are they paying attention to the
child during the process?  Answers to all these questions would provide
important information related to the child's nutritional status.<p>
<p>
As children become<i> toddlers </i>and begin to move around on their own,
environmental cleanliness and vigilance in terms of the child's safety are of
utmost importance.  In addition to the kinds of supports the children required
as infants, when they become toddlers (1-3 years of age) they need: support in
acquiring new motor, language and thinking skills; a chance to develop some
independence; help in learning how to control their own behavior; opportunities
to begin to learn to care for themselves;  daily opportunities to play with a
variety of objects. (Donohue-Colletta, 1992 pg. 65)  There is wide variation
across cultures in terms of the extent to which parents understand children's
need for stimulation and their beliefs about what children are and are not able
to do.  For example, in Thailand parents believed that infants could not see
and therefore could not respond to adults.  Placing children in closed cradles
seemed a reasonable thing to do.  Through videos and home visits parents  saw
infants responding to things in the environment.  They then began to see the
importance of opening the cradles and interacting more with the infant.
(Kotchabhakdi, 1987) In this instance, introducing the practice of playing
games with your infant without changing the belief system would have been
futile.<p>
<p>
While the mother remains the primary person responsible for the safety, care
and feeding of the child, it is during the toddler period that the child moves
out from the mother.  Over time others in the family and community play an
increasingly important role in the care of the child, particularly in terms of
socializing and teaching the child through direct instruction and modelling.
In some cultures "over time" means a few weeks after the child is born.  In
other cultures this can mean several months or years later.  The most common
time for <i>moving out </i>is when the child is weaned completely from the
breast.<p>
<p>
The<i> preschool child (3-6 years of age)</i> is more self-reliant.  During
this age children are socialized into the culture.  In some cultures they
become quite independent and are required to take on considerable
responsibility, even to the extent of being responsible for the care of younger
siblings.  In other cultures children are not encouraged to develop
independence until much later.  They remain totally dependant on adults for
their care and feeding.  Again, the culture the child is raised in determines
the timing and the kinds of skills acquired in relation to self-care,
independence and the development of responsibility.<p>
<p>
While in many cultures in the Majority World (the developing countries)
children may be given the role of caretaker for younger siblings, children ages
3-6 also have needs of their own.  They need: opportunities to develop fine
motor skills;  encouragement of language through talking, reading,  singing;
activities that will develop a positive sense of mastery;  opportunities to
learn cooperation, helping, sharing; and experimentation with pre-writing and
pre-reading skills. (Donohue-Colletta 1992, pg. 65)<p>
<p>
While there is continuity in children's development, both traditional belief
systems and scientific knowledge recognize that there are transition points
that represent a real shift in children's experience.  For example, when the
child is weaned from the breast, when new foods are introduced, when the
primary caregiver role expands to include others besides the mother, and when
the child takes on adult responsibilities, are but a few of the significant
transitions.  These developmental shifts require adjustments by the child.
Within traditional cultures there are frequently practices and/or rituals which
help mark these times, acknowledging the transition.<p>
<p>
In sum, traditional societies have evolved ways to support the growth and
development of children in response to contextual needs.  Many of these
childrearing practices, patterns and beliefs are consistent with current
scientific understanding of children's growth and development.  But, as the
cultures are undergoing change, some of the childrearing practices and beliefs
are falling by the wayside.  Parents are unclear about their goals and
expectations for their children and they are questioning the appropriateness of
traditional practices. New demands and the absence of traditional supports are
forcing families to do things differently.  Some parents are aware that they
are raising their children differently from the way they were raised.  Other
parents are implementing alternative childrearing strategies in response to
changing conditions without being particularly conscious of what is being lost
or retained from traditional practice. In both instances, what the parents do
impacts on how the child grows and develops. But families do not live in
isolation.  They are part of a community and a larger socio-political system
that defines the context that shapes childrearing practices and beliefs.  Thus
any attempt to work with families to support their childrearing practices needs
to be done within the wider socio-political context.  <p>
<p>
<b>The Context </b><p>
<p>
Just as programs cannot be developed by looking at the child in isolation,
neither is it possible to define the impact of childrearing practices only in
relation to the ways in which the family and community function.   The broader
context which surrounds the family and community must also be taken into
account.  <p>
<p>
Understanding the context helps provide an understanding both of the ways in
which childrearing practices have developed and the ways in which they are
evolving.  The context is composed of many things.  It includes:<p>
<p>
      the physical environment -  the climate/geography of the area that determines
the need for shelter from the heat or cold, and the relative ease of raising
food crops to sustain the family;<p>
<p>
      the socio-political climate that determines whether families have security or
a life dominated by fear;<p>
<p>
      the economic climate that determines a family's ability to survive and
thrive;<p>
<p>
     the philosophical and religious systems that provide a base for the values
and beliefs of the society and a cultural identity for the family;<p>
<p>
     the past, which is presented to the child through legends, myths, proverbs,
riddles and songs that justify the existing social order and reinforce
customs;<p>
<p>
          the family and community who act as models of expected behavior;<p>
<p>
     the village, which presents a variety of situations calling for prescribed
behavior.<p>
<p>
The configuration of these dimensions determines the kinds of supports (or
detractors) present as families and communities raise children. One way to
analyze possible configurations is along a continuum. In 1990, Negussie
completed an analysis of childrearing practices in Sub-Saharan Africa (1990).
She chose to represent these childrearing practices along a continuum related
to degree of modernization. At one end of the continuum are<b>
<i>traditional</i></b> cultures.  These are defined as cultures within which
childrearing practices and beliefs are based on inherited and orally
transmitted knowledge.  The context is more or less stable and there are
adequate resources to support the traditional way of life.   Negussie notes
that, in general, traditional cultures are more characteristic of rural than
urban areas.  <p>
<p>
Societies that would be placed along the continuum between the two ends are
characterized as<b> <i>transitional</i>.</b>  For these societies there is a
shift away from traditional practices as they are exposed to new ideas and/or
there are changes in the environment which threaten their survival, forcing
them to make changes.  Negussie suggests that those migrating from rural to
urban areas and/or living in marginal communities can be characterized as in
transition.  Within societies that are in transition, childrearing practices
and beliefs include a mix of the traditional and modern, and the mix is
different depending on what is required of families.   <p>
     <p>
The other end of the continuum can be defined as <b><i>modern</i></b><i>.</i>
Cultures located at this point on the continuum have access to and are using
non-traditional (Western) health care and education in place of traditional
systems.  Negussie found that those living in peri-urban and urban areas are
most likely to be placed at this point on the continuum.<p>
<p>
     This way of defining contexts is elaborated on below. <p>
<p>
<b>  1.   Traditional:  reliance on inherited and orally transmitted
knowledge</b>.<p>
<p>
Many of the studies of childrearing beliefs and practices in Sub-Saharan Africa
conducted earlier in this century captured the childrearing practices found
within traditional societies.<b>[1]</b>  In some
sub-Saharan African countries there are pockets where these cultures continue
to exist, but these are few and far between.  In most countries, traditional
childrearing practices, both positive and negative, are changing as families
are exposed to other beliefs and practices.  Where traditional practices have
been interrupted the society may be classified as in <i>transition.</i><p>
<p>
     <b>2.     Transitional:  as a society that relied primarily on traditional wisdom
begins to adopt alternative beliefs and practices.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<p>
<i>If the goals set by the 'modern society' [are] different from those earlier
set by the indigenous society, the individual follows the former.  The result
is the disintegration of the earlier set of goals and values.  Nigerian society
and culture is one undergoing such disintegration.  The generally set goals
seem to be western, materialistic and individualistic.  In the rural area
though, there still seems to exist traditional values, but these too are rocked
by the waves of principles of democratization and modernization, the vehicle of
which is education - western education.</i> (Akinware &amp; Ojomo, 1993, pg
40)<p>
<p>
Many African and Latin American cultures can be characterized as in a time of
<i>transition</i> as a result of changes which impact family life.  These
changes indirectly affect childrearing beliefs and practices and the growth and
development of children.  Families and communities are in transition as a
result of: <p>
<p>
     a.  <b> <i>Changes in the traditional functions of the family. </i></b><p>
<p>
One particularly important support to parents has been the community and the
extended family system. In the past, close family ties provided a built-in
measure of economic, emotional and social security to children and families,
but this traditional support for families has been disrupted as families are
moving from the rural to urban areas, as families are migrating in search of
work, and as individual family members leave the village in search of
educational and economic opportunities.  Many of the previous roles of the
community are being taken on by society or falling by the wayside.<p>
<p>
     b.  <b><i> Changes in the structure of the family.  </i></b><p>
The size of families is declining.  This is due partly to the fact that people
are having fewer children, but more significantly the decline in family size is
due to a move from multi-generational family groupings to the nuclear family,
which, by virtue of its limited number of adults, often fails to provide the
care and support required by children.  It is also important to note that these
smaller families are frequently not very stable units.  There is fluctuation in
the numbers and members in a household as a result of seasonal and work-related
in- and out-migration.  <p>
<p>
     c.   <b><i>Changes for the girl child. </i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><p>
Women and girls have become the focus of international attention.  Childrearing
practices which relied on the older girl child to care for younger children in
the family are being challenged.  Girls who have traditionally been responsible
for the care of younger siblings are attending school at an increased rate and
being encouraged to complete their education.  This has an impact on
arrangements for child care within the family.  <p>
<p>
     d.  <b><i>Changes in the nature of women's work. </i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><p>
Women have always played multiple roles that compete for their time and
physical and emotional energy.  Regardless of the context within which children
are raised, care of children, particularly young children, is still the woman's
responsibility.  In addition, the woman is responsible for household management
and operations, and economic/productive activity.  New economic pressures on
and possibilities presented to women mean that increasingly they work outside
the home, often for long hours and following schedules that limit their
availability and thus the time they can devote to child care.<p>
<p>
In rural areas women often work in the fields.  While in many cultures women
have historically constituted a majority of the agricultural work force, in
other settings the out-migration of men who are seeking employment has
increased women's agricultural role.  In addition, in some agricultural
settings plantation economies and cash crop production have meant that women
are increasingly being exposed to the demands of rigid time and work schedules
similar to those common in urban environments. <p>
<p>
In both urban and rural environments there is an increase in the number of
women-headed households.  This necessarily impacts the woman's work load.  <p>
<p>
     e.  <b><i> Changes in men's roles.</i></b><p>
<p>
Traditionally in many cultures men have been given a limited, but usually
clear, role in the upbringng of children during their early years. They are
disciplinarians. They are models for the young boys. But they are usually
little involved in day to day upbrinigng.  In some cultures (the sierra of Peru
and Bolivia, for instances) men are direclty involved in rituals related to the
birth of the child. But, as societies change, men's role has been changing.  In
many societies it is no longer defined by tradition.  More and more it is being
defined by changes in the economic situation and configuration of the family.
<p>
<p>
Within the cultures reported on at the workshop on childrearing beliefs and
practices in Sub-Saharan Africa, the movement of families from rural to urban
areas has impacted both positively and negatively on the role of the father.
For example, in Nigeria it was found that as families move to urban areas they
lose the support of the extended family.  Because the majority of the families
cannot afford to hire caregivers, the men became more involved in providing
care for the children.  Quite the opposite was found in Malawi. There when
families move to urban areas, even the little interaction men have with their
children is generally decreased. <p>
     <p>
     f. <b><i>  Changes in migration patterns.  </i></b><p>
<p>
Until recently men were the most likely to migrate in search of paid
employment.  In recent years, however, with the creation of free market zones,
more and more women are migrating to these zones to obtain work. The
potentially negative impact of this migration on families and young children is
of concern to many.<p>
<p>
Within traditional societies the norms, beliefs and practices were relatively
stable.  Expectations in terms of parental behavior were clear.  For families
in transition childrearing practices are not clear.  These families may lack
the skills to live in the state of flux represented by transitional cultures.
In this situation parents may have a sense of powerlessness and be less
self-confident in terms of their parenting skills.  This can lead to
childrearing practices that are inconsistent and/or overly restrictive (Werner,
1979).  For those families who have been living in urban areas for a generation
or two, they may well have incorporated more "modern" childrearing beliefs and
practices.<p>
<p>
<b>  3.   Modernity: when non-traditional health, education, and social supports
are available and relied upon more than the traditional.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Technology has made a wide variety of supports available to families that are
not available within traditional cultures.  While there are pros and cons on
just about every technology that has been introduced, the availability of these
technologies has radically changed people's lives.  For example, bottle feeding
has made it easier for women to enter the labor market.  But the introduction
of bottle feeding and the decrease in breastfeeding has resulted in high infant
mortality and morbidity rates due to improper use of bottles and infant
formula.  Another example is the introduction of a local primary school,
facilitating the attendance of girls in school.  This may mean that infants are
cared for by siblings older than the infant but too young to go to school,
putting both at risk.<p>
<p>
In sum, in societies with limited exposure to outside influences, the context
is relatively constant and as a result childrearing practices remain more or
less the same across generations.  In societies in rapid flux, there are
dramatic changes from one generation to the next in the context within which
children are raised.  These lead to differences in the type of care that is
provided to children.    Families living under traditional beliefs will raise
children in one way;  families in transition, or who consider themselves
modern, will have quite a different set of beliefs and patterns that determine
their practice.   Knowing this about families assists in the process of
creating appropriate programs.  <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Strategies for Developing Appropriate Programming</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><i>The challenge lies in changing the negative things without changing
the positive ones.  Unfortunately experience has shown that new changes bring
new problems...It is therefore important to fully understand the implications
of any action before embarking on it.    </i>Kalemba, 1993,  pg. 17<p>
<p>
The primary reason for looking at the ways in which traditional beliefs and
practices coincide with more recent thinking is for the purpose of creating
programs which support the positive and provide alternatives for the negative
practices and beliefs.    The following principles of programming generated as
a result of the workshops coincide with what is known as a result of
considerable programming experience and an accumulated knowledge about the
kinds of approaches that are most effective.  <p>
<p>
<b>A.  </b>  <b>    Gather information to gain an overall view of the practices
and beliefs within a given culture </b><p>
<p>
In order to build a program based on an understanding of childrearing
practices, patterns and beliefs, it is important to have a good understanding
of what is already known.  The question then becomes:  Where is knowledge on
childrearing practices and beliefs located and how can it be tapped?  There are
two main sources of data:  the scientific literature and experience.<p>
<p>
<b>Science.</b>  The accumulated "scientific"<b>[2]</b> literature available today includes
basic
research on child development.  These studies are often directed toward
identifying universal principles of development.  However, that literature also
includes psychological, medical, anthropological, and sociological studies of
how people in particular cultural and geographic settings care for their young
children.<p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the literature dealing with traditional childrearing practices
and patterns has many limitations.  First, access is a problem since the
information cuts across many disciplines and thus one must seek data from a
variety of sources.  Second, the information is often presented in academic
language and requires 'translation' into a form that is useful to program and
policy people.  Third, for the most part, the existing literature is derived
from a Western or Northern conceptual base that can distort some of the
findings.  Fourth, some of the literature is outdated.  Nevertheless, this
literature, placed in perspective, provides an important starting point.  <p>
<p>
It should be noted that literature searches should be extended to include
information found outside the scientific literature -- in such sources as
novels, biographies, traditional stories and myths.    <b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Experience.</b>  Another source of knowledge about childrearing is
experience.  This experience is of two types.  One is based on immediate,
personal experience, reflecting the circumstances of individuals in particular
families and communities.  A second type is accumulated experience, which adds
up to a "traditional wisdom."  Usually, experience is not brought together in a
systematic way or written up.  A major challenge is to capture current
experience and to describe "traditional wisdom" without making a prior
judgement about its values.<p>
<p>
<b>B.     Identify where there are significant gaps in knowledge about childrearing
practices, patterns and beliefs</b><p>
<p>
In developing programs for young children and their families it is important to
have an understanding of the ways in which current practices and beliefs affect
the child's overall development.  Many of the studies which have been conducted
on childrearing practices and beliefs have focussed primarily on health and
nutrition issues.  There is generally less information available on practices
that are related to psycho-social and/or cognitive development.  For
policy-makers and planners interested in supporting children's overall
development, this may well represent a significant gap in information
available.  If so, then a specific focussed study should be designed to gather
the relevant information.<p>
<p>
From the workshops there were several examples of focussed studies.  In-depth
studies were  conducted in Mexico,  Mali and Namibia.   In Mexico the focus was
on the role of change agents.  In Mali,  the focus was on understanding how
traditional child care systems work.  In Namibia  the researchers were asked to
look specifically at childrearing practices that supported children's cognitive
and socio-emotional development.   While these studies were focussed on
providing an in-depth look at a particular aspect of a culture, additional data
were gathered that provided a picture of the overall context within which
children are being raised.<p>
<p>
<b>C.     Select a Methodology that will yield the kind of data required</b><p>
<p>
One of the tasks of current researchers is to explore questions such as:  What
practices have fallen by the wayside over time?  Why?  (Because they were
practices that no longer served the culture?  Because they could not be
maintained due to changes in caregivers?  Because of the introduction of
"scientific" knowledge? As a result of changes in childrearing practices have
some good practices been lost?  What practices have been maintained?  How do
they serve the culture of today?  Why are some practices that we know to be
harmful still being maintained, such as the circumcision of girls?) <p>
<p>
To get answers to these questions requires a flexible methodology.  Those who
attended the workshops agreed that questionnaires and interview schedules
should not be used rigidly because this inhibits responses and limits
conversation.  Rigid adherence to a format with a particular order and
categories does not allow important issues and practices to emerge that might
not have been included in the original instrument.  It also increases the
chances that respondents will say what they think the interviewer wants to
hear.<p>
          <p>
One strategy is to work with community "agents" (including, for example,
community educators and health workers, <i>animators </i>(discussion
facilitators) of grassroots organizations, religious leaders, educators) who
have long experience in communities and who have presumably acquired a deep
knowledge of practices and patterns in the specific communities in which they
have worked.  (It should not be assumed, however, that because agents are part
of or work closely with a community, they are necessarily knowledgeable about
childrearing practices.)<p>
<p>

<i>In Ecuador, local health people were incorporated into the process of
collecting childrearing information.  Along the way, they not only acted as
collectors, but also as observers and as processors of the information,
internalizing it and discussing it in an inter-disciplinary team.  This led to
some immediate changes in the form in which local health centers operated.  In
this case, the information-gathering process had a direct effect because the
researchers were also the potential users.  </i>(Roloff, et.al., 1992)<p>
<p>
Another suggestion is to turn more directly to parents and other community
members in a process of discovering and describing local practices.  More
specifically, in the Latin American context, it was suggested that attention be
given to the utility of a participatory method used by the Roman Catholic
Church in its planning, termed "The Study of Reality."  This method, which is
similar to popular education approaches, involves community members in a
process of 1) seeing (collecting information),  2) judging (analyzing), and  3)
acting (using the information to play and carry out activities).  It was felt
that the method, with which the Church has had wide experience, could be
focussed on examining the condition of children, ages 0 to 6, and the
childrearing practices in a particular community.  Doing so would not only
provide knowledge about childrearing but would also, presumably, provide a
basis for action by the practitioners and caregivers participating in the
process.     <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>D.     Check on the Validity of the Data</b><p>
<p>
The suggested interview and questionnaires techniques  rely on a verbal
response.   The validity of such responses is sometimes questionable.   What
people say they do or believe is not necessarily what they actually do or
believe.  While none of the studies in Latin America relied on systematic
observation,  observations were used in the majority of studies conducted in
Africa and were used both to validate the verbal information as well as to
complete the picture.<p>
<p>
If observation is not possible,  another way to validate the results is to
compare what is obtained with what is found in the literature, with opinions of
local informants, and with opinions of specialists in the field.  Another good
strategy is to discuss the results directly with the people from whom the
information was originally obtained.  <p>
<p>
In addition to helping identify incorrect interpretations and to look for
explanations, this process is intended to promote reflection and change. For
example, results of a Jamaican study of the role of fathers in childrearing
were fed back to the same fathers from whom information was gathered.  The
process of discussion of these results  led to the formation of men's parenting
groups.  Moreover, the research information has been converted into a
discussion guide for use by groups in church, school, community and other
settings.  The guide is titled "Men and their Families" and is currently being
used to train facilitators who will each use the information to work with
groups of Caribbean men. (Brown et.al, 1993)<p>
<p>
In addition to discussing the results with those who helped generate the data,
a number of useful techniques that can be drawn upon include:<p>
<p>
 Asking adults to reflect on their own childhood.  Remembering childhood helps
to establish key themes, can identify continuity and change in practices,
contributes to the empathy of the parents with the child, and can provide an
easy way of including men in the conversation.  This exercise seems
particularly important because of the marked tendency for parents to repeat
practices applied to them when they were children, even if they do not think
those practices were appropriate or just.<p>
<p>
 Comparing practices and beliefs across generations by seeking out older and
younger parents.  This technique also helps to identify continuities or
discontinuities in practices across generations -- the "generational matrix".<p>
<p>
 Engaging in group dynamic exercises.  Such exercises help to get members of a
group involved and serve also as a form of expression with respect to
particular topics.  An example would be a role playing activity where
participants act out giving positive and negative feedback to children about
their behavior.<p>
<p>
 Constructing a "day in the life of a child."  This technique helps to make
observations more systematic.<p>
<p>
 Using data generated for other purposes (e.g. evaluations of current
programs). This makes maximum use of existing data.<p>
<p>
An example of the latter comes from Mexico where information about childrearing
practices was included in an action research project intended to identify ways
in which a parental education program might be improved.  As part of the
project, the interview schedule about practices was administered to a group of
mothers who participated in the project and a group of mothers who did not.
There was an unexpected outcome of this process for the group of mothers who
had not participated in the project.  These mothers, simply by having to
reflect on their practices in answering the questionnaire were obliged to
reflect on their own practices.  In the process they began to wonder what they
were doing well and might do better, and were motivated to seek participation
in the next round of parental education sessions. In fact, the attendance and
motivation of this group in the next course turned out to be higher than that
of the "experimental" group from the previous session.  Given the success of
this technique as a motivating device, the program decided to print a series of
very brief fliers, each one asking a question about a set of practices.  For
instance, one flier asked, "what do you do to help your child become more
intelligent?"  Another asked, "What do you do when your child does something
bad?"  gets into trouble? This generated more interest in the course.  (Duran,
et.al, 1993)<p>
<p>
<b>E.     Assess those beliefs and practices in relation to 'scientific'
knowledge.</b><p>
<p>
In a project titled, "New Educational Spaces" in Mexico, the analysis of
childrearing practices is now built into a process of parenting education
whereby community mothers who have been trained as pre-school teachers in
community-based programs are reaching out to parents.  The project, titled "New
Educational Spaces", includes reviews of childrearing practices as part of the
information that each community pre-school teacher gathers from parents.  A
central purpose of gathering the information in this case is to identify areas
of congruence or divergence between practices that are carried out in the home
and those favored in the pre-schools.  The method is first applied with the
pre-school teachers, asking them to look at their own practices in the
pre-school in relation to what they identify as the most important values and
skills they would like to impart in the school.  Then, the pre-school teachers
ask parents to reflect on what kind of child they would like their child to
become.  Pre-school practices are then viewed in relation to the particular
values and skills that parents say they would like their children to have.  <p>
<p>
The example from Mexico is a useful technique for assessing agreement between
the traditional and the more modern.  In that instance, the pre-school teachers
were being asked to assess their practice based on parental goals and
perceptions.  <p>
<p>
While some of the traditional practices and beliefs identified will be in
accord with current thinking, there will be others that are not.  When the
traditional and more modern practices are at odds with one another (e.g.
negative feedback to children that decreases their feelings of self-worth),
then the following strategy can  be undertaken. <p>
<p>
<b>F.     Identify the function the belief/practice serves in the society.</b> <p>
<p>
It is important to ask, why is the practice what it is?  How has it evolved?
Most traditions have evolved in response to changing needs within the
environment and culture.  It can be hypothesized that some practices are held
onto although they are no longer really functional for the culture.  But more
needs to be known about whether or not this is true.  The more that is
understood about a practice and/or belief, the more likely it is that a way can
be found to introduce changes. <p>

<p>
<b>Resilient Children and Families</b><p>
<p>
     by Claudia A. Blackburn<p>
<p>
<i>Claudia Blackburn is a psychologist who works internationally with programs
that serve families living in difficult conditions, and individuals traumatized
by alcoholism, abuses, and social dissolution.   </i><p>
<p>
<p>
<i>  The importance of traditional practices, patterns and beliefs is especially
evident when dealing with children and families who are victims of traumatic
conditions.  Traditions can provide a source of strength and reorientation when
an individual or family's world is disrupted, and can enhance the child's
ability to survive and thrive. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>   It is quite extraordinary that some children and adults not only
survive trauma but are able to continue to thrive regardless of their many
losses, trauma, and difficult living conditions.  How does one child survive
over another even when both possess the same painful history?  Why does one
individual adjust to the many traumas with fewer problems than a family member
who has shared the same experiences? <p>
<p>
     These questions have led researchers to study the impact of trauma and the
conditions for resiliency.  Resiliency is the ability to recover from or adjust
easily to misfortune or change.  It is the capability of a strained body and
mind to withstand shock and recover without permanent deformation.<p>
<p>
     Living with trauma and its effects, children and adults will frequently
possess  a behavioral pattern of learned helplessness and a belief in a
foreshortened future.  Life appears to have little meaning or purpose.  It is
common for victims to repeatedly experience an inability to effect change for
themselves or their family.  How then can resiliency be created or reinforced
with this level of hopelessness and helplessness?<p>
<p>
     The current research on resiliency and trauma has led to interesting
observations and conclusions that can guide us in developing programs that
support young children and families in difficult circumstances.  Through
research, several major factors have been identified that appear to preserve or
build the resiliency of an individual.  These elements have strong implications
for establishing programs in unstable or hostile environments where a child or
adult may be at high risk for victimization.  It is suggested that parenting
and child care programs explore ways to incorporate the following factors to
build a program consistent in strengthening the emotional and physical
well-being of their population.<p>
<p>
<b>1.      Access to culturally-appropriate personal support.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
A major factor that appears to contribute to resiliency is access to support
from either family members or outside significant resources.  If a child or
adult can rely on some form of personal contact that is consistent with their
culture and customs, particularly with family members or other individuals from
their community,  they will remain more emotionally resourceful.  A personal
support network provides a safety net to prevent individual parents or children
from falling into the desolation often caused by poor living conditions and
severe trauma.<p>
<p>
<b>2.     Continuance of traditional rituals, celebrations and practices.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Meaningful community events based on the cultural norms can also help to
maintain hope and stability in an ever-changing environment.  Even in the midst
of war and poverty, traditional cultural rituals, celebrations, and gatherings
can be adjusted to the conditions to enable individuals and families to either
maintain or reestablish a sense of community and a sense of self.<p>
<p>
<b>3.     The opportunity to exercise control over some aspect of their
lives.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Individuals' beliefs  regarding their degree of control over the occurrence and
outcome of traumatic events will generally influence their adjustment.  If
individuals believe they have little or no control over the traumatic
conditions, they will have more difficulty overall in their ability to adjust
favorably.  Therefore, in order to decrease helplessness and to maximize coping
skills, programs serving families in difficult circumstances need to
incorporate ways to give participants a sense of decision-making power,
self-determination, and true "ownership" of the program.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>4.     The maintenance of daily routines and common rituals.</b> <p>
<p>
Often, everyday activities are drastically interrupted by traumatic life
events, thus destroying a basic road map of daily living.  Through the use of
culturally-based rituals and routines, children and adults can rely on these
familiar activities to maintain a sense of orientation and level of control
over their environment.  Religious rituals, meal time practices, morning
routines and common celebrations all help individuals to keep their bearings,
even when living in severe conditions.<p>
<p>
<b>5.     Provision of consistency through the structure of the intervention
program.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Maintaining or creating <i>consistent </i>routines no matter how mundane
this may appear, can give a sense of safety and continuity for those inflicted
repeatedly by trauma. In viewing life through the eyes of trauma, life itself
appears tentative, fragile, and unpredictable.  Through a program structure, a
level of security, control, predictability can be generated to create an
atmosphere which will allow children and adult participants to thrive.  The
program structures will lay the foundation that enables individuals to
accomplish simple tasks and reestablish a sense of competence and normalcy.<p>
<p>
<b>6.     Interaction with positive role models from the individual's cultural
tradition.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Providing and identifying role models who exhibit problem-solving skills can
help build resiliency in children and parents.  Through observation of others,
individuals can see how to develop tools to confront the physical and emotional
hardships caused by the trauma.  In addition, they can witness how others cope
with problems and survive their history.  Role models who are accepted by the
community and reinforce positive values within the culture, can give a sense of
hope to others who believe that survival is futile.<p>
<p>
<b>7.     Opportunities to express feelings and sort out thoughts and
beliefs.</b><p>
<p>
Individuals need opportunities to express their thoughts and feelings about a
painful or traumatic situation, in order to better handle the emotional and
social effects of the experience.  A valuable component of resiliency is the
process of acknowledging, retelling and addressing the emotions and beliefs
pertaining to the trauma or painful events in a supportive and safe
environment.  The means of creating this atmosphere must be based on cultural
norms and local customs in order to generate participation.  If children or
adults don't have an opportunity to address the stress in a
culturally-comfortable context, their ability to heal may be limited.  Coping
skills become strained when individuals are unable to manage information,
memories, and emotions produced by the traumas.  This limits a person's present
and future ability to cope with additional stresses.<p>
<p>
<b>8.     Context in which to develop (or which provides) a sense of purpose.
</b><p>
<b></b><p>
The development of a sense of purpose and meaning for the suffering is an
important ingredient in healing and reinforcing suffering.  Children and
families often need guidance, support, and a format to initiate or enhance this
healing process.  This is the final stage of recovery.  To move beyond the pain
and devastation, individuals must be able to generate reasons to endure their
losses and painful history and a hope for the future.<p>
<p>
In conclusion, it is the hope of this author when reviewing the emotional
impact of trauma and the factors that lead to a healthier adjustment to stress,
that consideration be given to incorporating activities that promote resiliency
within programs that serve young children and their families.  Especially in
view of the research which underscores the importance of the early years in a
child's subsequent development, such programs can become a significant avenue
to creating a resilient population.  <p>

<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>G.     Identify how vulnerable the practice/belief  is to change</b>.  <p>
<p>
Once a practice is understood more completely, then it is possible to determine
whether or not it is amenable to change.  The best strategy is to begin with a
practice that appears to be vulnerable to change.  If people are beginning to
question the practice, then it may be open to change.  Questioning can lead to
discussion.  This provides an opportunity for people to receive new
information.  Alternatives can be discussed and perhaps tried.  Once one
behavior or practice has been changed, people may be more willing to look at
some of the practices that at the outset of a project appeared to be
intractable. <p>
<p>
If the practice appears to be malleable,  then it is possible to move to the
next step.<p>
<p>
<b>H.     Identify what would motivate someone to change the current practice. </b>
<p>
<p>
What is reinforcing the current practice?  Given the reinforcers in the current
situation, what might be used to motivate someone to change? An example comes
from the Malawi study where traditionally children were not bathed very often.
Rather than telling people they had to bathe their children to make them more
healthy, the strategy was to find a way to motivate the women to bathe their
children frequently.  The answer came when a childcare program was created.  A
rule was made that in order for children to participate in the program they had
to arrive bathed and in clean clothes.  As a result mothers began to keep their
children cleaner because they wanted their children in the child care.  Child
care was something the mothers valued. There was no need to 'preach' to the
mothers about the value of keeping children clean. The desire to have the child
in the program was what changed the mother's behavior, not the abstract concept
that this would help keep the child healthy.  (Kalemba, 1993,  pg.  16) <p>
<p>
If the process does not stimulate change, then a more direct approach can be
taken.<p>
<p>
<b>I.     Develop the intervention in line with the behaviors you want to change.
</b><p>
<p>
The strategy so far has provided data on the problem, as defined by the
community.  It has also allowed those involved in planning the program to
understand the childrearing practices and beliefs associated with the problem.
This groundwork will provide  a basis for determining project goals and
actually putting a project in place.  In actually designing an intervention
there are several principles that it is useful to remember.<p>
<p>
First and foremost it is important to remember that <b>there are no
formulas.</b>  No one program model will be satisfactory in all settings.
While the program being introduced can draw heavily from programs that have
worked in other settings, it should be recognized that adaptations will have to
be made. <p>
<p>
Second, the presentation of practices derived from scientific and/or ecumenical
ideas ought to be seen as the source of  themes for discussion and dialogue
rather than  messages that have to be delivered.  Too often "dialogues" are
used as a way to convince people to accept certain practices or patterns or
beliefs originating in science or church doctrine.  They do not allow for the
identification, valuing and appropriation of current practices to meet the same
goals. <p>
<p>
Third, there may well be a tension between a "global vision" in which
everything seems inter-related and important and necessary, and the necessity
of developing goals that are specific and achievable within a realistic time
frame. One way to overcome this tension is to distinguish short term and long
term actions, focussing on areas of priority in the short run and working with
the integrated vision for long term plans.  <p>
<p>
Fourth, a "constructive" vision is needed.  It is important to maintain a
positive and constructive vision of the community and families.  Accordingly,
emphasis should be placed on recognizing good practice rather than on focussing
on and punishing bad practice.<p>
<p>
Fifth, demystify the services. Professionals frequently feel that extensive
training and an in-depth understanding is required to perform a function well.
Yet, many of the tasks that lead to a better quality of life can be simplified
and made accessible to people with little formal education.  Again the example
comes from Malawi where, as a result of simple technologies, people have
developed safer birth practices, provided the community with water, created
pre-school centres, and undertaken growth monitoring and the treatment of
common ailments. (Kalemba,  1993,  pg. 16)<p>
<p>
<b>J.     Programs for Children should be Focussed on the family and Community
</b><p>
<p>
Programs seeking to have a positive impact on children's growth and development
should not be directed only at children.  Attention should be given to the role
of mothers, fathers, grandparents, extended family members and siblings.
Parental education programs is one vehicle for focussing on the family. An
understanding of childrearing practices and beliefs can provide the content for
such programs.  For example, in Chile, a study of childrearing practices was
integrated into a program designed to educate and empower parents. (UNICEF,
1994)  Data from the study was used to identify specific areas that should be
stressed in the program, and to develop "positive parenting"  modules dealing
with: <p>
<p>
a.   The family unit<p>
b.   Attachment and love for children during pregnancy and the first year of
life<p>
c.   Self-esteem and self-reliance in development of children<p>
d..  How to enrich home interactions with children and home learning
environments<p>
e.   The father as a participant in childrearing practices<p>
f.   Discipline strategies based on respect and love<p>
g.   Support systems for parents.<p>
<p>
Programs that have a positive impact on children do not necessarily need to
have a child development or parent education focus.  By uplifting the lives of
family members, particularly mothers, and the community there are indirect
benefits for children.  Programs which give women additional income that is at
their disposal have indirectly affected children in that women tend to use
these new resources to benefit children's health and education. (Engle, 1994)<p>
<p>
<b>K.     Provide integrated services. </b><p>
<p>
People's lives are not as fragmented as government social services.  We know
that multi-sectoral supports are more effective than mono-focal efforts.  In
the early years development is closely tied to health and nutrition.  Supports
for children in the first three years must take a holistic approach, including
attention to mental, social, as well as physical development.   Alliances
should be sought among institutions seeking to better the welfare of young
children.   Neither the government nor non-governmental institutions, nor the
church can expect the desired results working alone.<p>
<p>
<b>L.     Build on existing programs. </b><p>
<p>
An effective way to keep costs manageable is to build child care and
development components into existing programs.  Options that have been tried
include incorporating early childhood development actions into on-going adult
education, community development, child care, health and/or nutrition programs.
This strategy avoids the need for the development of an expensive new
infrastructure.  Although not without cost, experience shows that such
integration can be efficient and produce a synergism that benefits the original
program.  <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The rich diversity of the studies presented at the various workshops is
difficult to capture in a summary.  The breadth of conditions and contexts, and
the variation encountered in practices, patterns and beliefs confirms the
general conclusion that programs of early childhood care and development need
to be adjusted to local variations and realities.  If not, it will be
impossible to respect cultural differences and to "begin with the knowledge of
the people."<p>

Introduction to the Studies</title>
<body><b>Childrearing Practices in Sub-Saharan Africa: An
Introduction to the Studies </b><p>
by Judith L. Evans<p>
     <p>
     One of the goals for the Namibia Workshop was: <i>to bring together
information from existing studies of childrearing practices and to draw
implications for policy and programming.</i>  Thus in preparation for the
Workshop several studies of childrearing practices and beliefs in sub-Saharan
Africa were selected for review.  The researchers were asked to make a
presentation at the meeting on their findings. <p>
<p>
     Before looking at the specific information generated in the five research
projects reported on at the Workshop, it is important to provide an overview of
the methodologies employed in each study.  None of the studies was conducted
specifically for the purposes of the Workshop.  Each study had been conducted
earlier, one as early as 1984, with the most recent being completed in 1991.
Because these studies were mostly unpublished, the Workshop was seen as an
opportunity to share the results with a wider audience and to further the
discussion of ways in which an understanding of childrearing practices could
facilitate programme development.<p>
<p>
     The studies in Namibia, Zambia, Malawi and Nigeria were all undertaken with
the support of UNICEF and were conducted by national research and/or academic
institutions.  The study in Mali was supported by Save the Children USA and was
conducted in collaboration with a national research institute.  Since the
studies were done in isolation of one another, they lack a common methodology.
The methodologies employed in each study were based on the study purposes and
reflected the expertise of the research group involved in the effort.  What
follows is a brief description of the  methodologies developed by each research
group.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Methodology</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>1.  Namibia</b>  <p>
<p>
<i>Child Care and Development in Uukwaluudhi, Northern Namibia.</i> R.F. Zimba,
&amp; B. Otaala. (1991) UNICEF, Namibia.<p>
<p>
     <i>Purpose</i>.  This study was completed in 1991 and was undertaken for the
express purpose of understanding traditional childrearing practices and beliefs
among the Uukwaluudhi peoples in northern Namibia.  This was the initial step
in the implementation of a UNICEF child development project, the general
objective of which was "to create optimal conditions for early childhood
development and care at the household and community levels."  (pg. 23)  In
order to do this, UNICEF staff felt it was important to undertake research that
would "provide background data for establishing developmentally stimulating
household based child care." (pg. 25)  More specifically, the purpose of the
research was "to assess the extent to which qualities of a developmentally
stimulating environment were provided by the Uukwaluudhi community." pg. 27) <p>
<p>
     The study was undertaken by two members of the Faculty of Education at the
University of Namibia. They were assisted by six field workers.  Community
workers also participated in the study, facilitating communication among the
researchers and community members. <p>
<p>
     <i>Sample</i>.  136 Uukwaluudhi households were selected randomly and visited
by the 2 researchers and 6 research assistants.  An average of 13.6 households
were visited in each of 10 districts.<p>
<p>
     <i>Data Collection Tools</i>. Four sets of open-ended and structured interview
questions were used in the study.  The first set focussed on background
information on the family as a whole.  The second set focussed on prenatal
maternal and child care practices, beliefs and needs.  The third and fourth
sets included questions focussed on care during early and late childhood,
respectively.  They also included questions about community goals in relation
to child care and development.<p>
<p>
     <i>Procedure</i>. Before the study began the Principal Investigator visited
Uukwaluudhi and met with members of the education and health committees of the
UNICEF programme already in place.  At the meeting the purpose of the study was
explained and community involvement in the effort was sought.  There was
enthusiastic support for it.  The next step was to discuss the study with the
area chief.  The chief was impressed with the team and underscored the
importance of creating activities  that would be of benefit to women, men and
children.<p>
<p>
     Data were gathered by teams of two making visits to homes. During the home
visit, the questionnaire was administered and observations made of what
children did, what was done to them, what was done with them, and how the
caregivers interacted with the children.<p>
<p>
     <i>Data Analysis</i>.  The quantitative data gathered through the
questionnaires were scored, coded and entered.  Data were analyzed using the
SPSS-X statistical analysis programme.  The qualitative data were transcribed,
coded and interpreted.  The quantitative and qualitative data, together with
the investigators' and research assistants' field observations, were combined
to provide a description of practices among the Uukwaluudhi peoples in relation
to childrearing practices and beliefs during the prenatal, perinatal, 0-3 year,
and 3-6 year periods in the life of a child.<p>
<p>
<b>2.  Zambia</b><p>
<p>
<i>CRZ/UNICEF Study on Childrearing Practices in Zambia</i>. P.S. Chibuye, M.
Mwenda &amp; C. Osborne. (1986) Zambia Association for Research and
Development. Lusaka, Zambia.<p>
<p>
     <i>Purpose</i>.  This study was conducted in the mid 1980s, with support from
UNICEF, the Zambia Association for Research and Development and the Ministry of
Home Affairs.  The study was aimed at documenting traditional childrearing
practices (TCRPs) for the purposes of formulating appropriate national level
policies.   The study was designed to provide a country-wide picture of
childrearing practices and beliefs. (Previous studies had focussed only on
individual provinces.) <p>
<p>
     Specifically the researchers were attempting to identify: 1)  good TCRPs which
could be encouraged to help reduce infant and childhood mortality and morbidity
rates; 2) harmful TCRPs which needed to be discouraged by intensifying health
education efforts; and 3) harmless TCRPs which, like the good ones, should
remain as part of the cultural heritage and be incorporated into health
education programmes. (pg. 9)  This micro-level study was meant to complement
the macro-level statistics on children in Zambia, both of which were gathered
as a part of UNICEF's situational analysis of women and children in Zambia. <p>
<p>
     <i>Sample</i>. Data were collected from 740 adults and 232 children (ages 1-7)
in 8 of the 9 provinces in Zambia.  Areas were selected to be representative of
Zambia's population groups.  These included rural, peri-urban and urban
communities, those involved in agriculture, fishing, and mining, and families
with matrilineal and patrilineal traditions.  The areas selected represented
diverse communities which differed by tribe, language, education and income.
(pg.  10)<p>
<p>
     <i>Data Collection Tools/Procedure</i>.  Data were collected through two
structured interview schedules.  One was used with adults, with the questions
designed to elicit information on socio-demographic variables related to
antenatal, perinatal, general care of the baby, feeding and weaning, social
development and health care practices.<p>
<p>
     The second interview was administered to children "who could talk".<b>[1]</b>  Questions
were designed to obtain an
understanding of children's general knowledge of current affairs and the mental
and physical development activities they engage in.  The responses of adults
and children were then compared.<p>
<p>
     <i>Data Analysis</i>.  From the responses, categories were devised and
responses grouped accordingly. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS) was used to analyze the data.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>3.   Malawi</b><p>
<p>
<i>Childrearing Practices and Beliefs in Malawi and their Implications for
Programming</i>. E. Kalemba (1993) Paper presented at the Workshop on
Childrearing Practices and Beliefs, Windhoek, Namibia, October 26-29, 1993.<p>
<p>
     <i>Purpose</i>.  A study to assess the childrearing practices in four
different communities in Malawi was undertaken in 1984.  The focus of the study
was on the socio-cultural, nutritional, physical and health conditions
prevalent in the culture.  The study was envisaged to provide information on
both positive areas and gaps in relation to child stimulation, and problems
faced by parents in providing total care. (pg. 5) <p>
<p>
     Specifically the study focussed on information concerning practices and
beliefs related to conception, birth, child nutrition, socialization, attitudes
toward children, sex of the child, weaning and general care of children.  It
looked at what children do between the ages of 2 and 6, what they play with,
and their interaction with older family members (parents and siblings). <p>
<p>
     <i>Sample</i>.  The study was conducted in four areas of Malawi (one urban and
three rural), selected on the basis of the dominant culture, the geographic and
physical environment and the level of economic and social development.  In the
urban area sampling was based on existing residential areas, treated as
clusters, from which households were randomly sampled.<p>
<p>
     In the three rural areas, which were more homogeneous, lists of villages were
obtained from chiefs.  From these an appropriate number of villages was
randomly selected.  A further random sample provided the actual households
where interviews were conducted and observations made.<p>
<p>
     The total sample size was 382 households, composed of 2123 individuals,
including 671 children under five.<p>
<p>
<i>  Data Collection Tools/Procedure</i>.  A checklist of variables to be
investigated was drawn up. This was used for the purposes of making
observations. In addition a structured questionnaire was completed with each
household.  Individual investigators were assigned households to observe over a
four-week period during which they made notes and completed the questionnaires.
All the investigators lived among their subjects during this four-week
period.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>4.  Nigeria</b><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Childrearing Practices and Their Associated Beliefs in Nigeria: A Paper
Based on the Baseline Studies Conducted in Five Local Government Areas in
Nigeria UNICEF (1987-1990).</i> M.A. Akinware &amp; A. A. Ojomo (1993)  Paper
presented at the Workshop on Childrearing Practices and Beliefs, Windhoek,
Namibia, October 26-29, 1993. <p>
<p>
     <i>Purpose</i>. In 1987, baseline studies were conducted in five areas of
Nigeria for the purposes of assessing the health and nutritional status of
children, child care arrangements and stimulation, and maternal attitudes
toward achievement, formal education and organized day care.   The information
gathered was used as the basis for a programme being developed jointly by
UNICEF and the Bernard van Leer Foundation.<p>
<p>
     <i>Sample</i>.  A four-stage sampling procedure was used.  First, a mapping of
the geographical area was conducted in each of the five Local Government Areas
(LGAs) to be surveyed. Second, a stratification within the LGAs was made which
led to the selection of representative geographic areas and/or communities.
Third, households with children between the ages of 1.5 and 6 years, (generally
between 2 and 4), were randomly selected within the stratified areas.  Fourth,
children were selected for testing within the households. <p>
<p>
     Overall a total of 1507 households were surveyed, averaging 300/LGA, split
between urban and rural populations.  Between 24 and 30 children were observed
in each LGA.<p>
<p>
     <i>Data Collection Tools/Procedure</i>.  An early Child Care Development and
Education Questionnaire (ECCDEQ), consisting of 93 items was created.  The
questionnaire was divided into three sections. 1) A Household Questionnaire,
completed with the Head of the Household,  included questions which provided
general information on the community.  This questionnaire served as an entry
point into the household. Once the male was interviewed he would permit the
woman to respond to a questionnaire also. 2) A Mother Questionnaire,
administered to the target child's biological mother, was used to obtain
information on family composition and demographics, as well as specific
information on child birth,  childrearing patterns and family planning methods.
3) A Child Development Questionnaire, again administered to the target child's
biological mother,  provided specific information on the child's birth record,
nutritional and health history, current health status,  physical, emotional and
social development patterns, task performance and intellectual development. It
also elicited information on the mother's socialization practices, child care
options and arrangements and her aspirations for the child. In addition, the
Bayley Mental Development Test was  administered to some children.<p>
<p>
     An Observational Assessment Checklist was also developed to facilitate
observation of the activities and interactions of selected children within the
sample. Through observations information was gathered on children's physical
development, interaction with peers and adults, types of playmates, feeding
habits, relationship to primary caregiver and siblings, degree of emotional
support provided and language skills.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>5.  Mali</b><p>
<p>
<i>Research Work on Early Childhood Attitudes, Practices and Beliefs in
Kolondeba, Southern Mali.</i> U. Dembele &amp; M. Poulton. (1993) Paper
presented at the Workshop on Childrearing Practices and Beliefs in Sub-Saharan
Africa.   Windhoek, Namibia 26-29 October 1993.<p>
<p>
     <i>Purpose.</i>    It was known that the Bambara people in Southern Mali have
developed a 'genuine sustainable caregiving system'.  The question was, how
best can this native enterprise system be built upon to promote the child's
development?  The research undertaken in January 1993 was a joint effort
between a national research institute (ISFRA) and Save The Children (USA) for
the specific purpose of developing a childcare program that was built on and
reflected traditional childrearing practices and beliefs.<p>
     The objectives of the study were: 1) to identify the development of the
Bamanan (Bambara) child and the specific educational activities taking place at
each stage of the child's development; 2) to analyze practices associated with
motor skills, socio-affective and cognitive development; 3) to define and
illustrate the educational practice, attitudes, stimulation, personality and
'awakening' as experienced by the Bambara; and 4) to describe the traditional
learning process and specify the roles and responsibilities of caregivers (e.g.
mothers) in that process. (pg. 1)<p>
<p>
     <i>Sample</i>.  The specific focus of the study was the Bambara peoples in
Kolondeba, Southern Mali.  Eight villages participated in the study.  All
traditional institutions concerned with education in those villages were
included in the study, to find out about childrearing practices and beliefs
that impacted on children from 1 to 4 years of age. <p>
<p>
     <i>Procedure</i>.  The researchers employed an action research approach rather
than a single survey in order to understand the practices more fully.  The
researchers worked with Bamanan organizations (women, youth, traditional
healers, religious leaders and indigenous change agents) to explore the popular
perception of child care.  This involved gathering information about myths and
the reality of practices, beliefs and attitudes. <p>
<p>
     In the second phase, the researchers sought the rationale behind the popular
perceptions identified.  They looked closely at the various components of
caregiving and tried to find out some meaning and relationship between them.
When, how, where and why different people act the way they do and what is
expected, were issues taken into consideration. The process included the
running of Focus groups, RAP and observations.<p>
<p>
     <i>Data Analysis</i>. As noted by the research team, "an eclectic data
collection and analysis method was used." (pg.2)  The conclusions evolved.  As
data were gathered and summarized they were shared with the groups involved in
data collection to ascertain the validity of the conclusions. If they were
incorrect further discussions and observations took place until there was
agreement on study results. <p>
<p>
<p>
     In sum, the methodologies employed differed across the countries studied; some
were more formal, some less.  All but the Mali study employed questionnaires
that were completed through interviews of household members.  The majority of
the studies also included observations of adult and child behaviour to validate
interview data and/or provide a more in-depth understanding of the dimensions
being explored. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PRACTICES, PATTERNS, AND BELIEFS</b><p>
<p>
<p>
     It was expected that the reports would illustrate the diversity among the
cultures within sub-Saharan Africa.  And while the differences were apparent,
what was striking to all at the Workshop was the similarity of beliefs and
practices found within traditional societies studied in Mali, Nigeria, Namibia,
Zambia and Malawi.  The positive and negative practices and beliefs which are
similar across all the studies are noted in the synthesis which follows. <p>
<p>
<b>B.     Positive beliefs/values:</b><p>
<p>
 Children are highly valued.  They are gifts from God and have a very special
role to play in perpetuating the family and culture and in providing care for
elders.<p>
<p>
 Children are the responsibility of the community. When primary caregivers are
not available, the community creates a system for caring for children.  As a
proverb from Malawi states: <i>Nurture any child, even those who are not your
own, for in the future they will look after you.</i> <p>
 <p>
 Parental and community goals for children are centered around social and human
values. These include: respect, self-reliance, being helpful, cooperative, and
obedient. The more 'modern' the culture, the more likely there is to be a shift
to more materialistic values.  <p>
<p>
 A woman's actions are believed to be important in terms of birth outcomes for
the woman and for the baby. Each of the cultures has beliefs and practices
related to pregnancy.  These center around what women should and should not
eat, and what they should and should not do. <p>
<p>
 Each culture has a set of rituals related to the birth process itself.  These
are designed to provide a safe birth for the baby and to assure the mother's
well-being.<p>
<p>
 After birth there is a period of confinement that is designed to allow the
mother to regain her energy and for the bonding and attachment to occur between
the mother and child.<p>
<p>
 The naming of the child is a significant event.  Names have meaning and are
chosen carefully. <p>
<p>
 In support of good nutrition for the child, mothers breastfeed, generally for
fairly extended periods of time. The benefits of this practice include:
providing appropriate nutrition for the infant and  assuring appropriate child
spacing.<p>
<p>
 Practices related to caring for one child and conceiving another has meant
that traditionally there was adequate child spacing. There is an implicit
understanding that there should be 2+ years between children and a more
explicit belief that while women are breastfeeding they should not get
pregnant.<p>
<p>
 The childrearing practices related to the care of the infant (breastfeeding on
demand, the carrying of the child on the mother's back, sleeping with the
child) create a close and intimate relationship between the mother and child
and security for the child.<p>
<p>
 When the child is no longer breastfed there is a separation from the mother
physically and emotionally.  At this point others in the family and community
play an increasingly important role in caring for the child.<p>
<p>
 There is an expectation that a variety of community members will support the
child's growth and development. This begins with traditional birth attendants
and then includes extended family members, older brothers and sisters, and then
the community at large, including the elderly. <p>
<p>
 Older children (even beginning at age 4) play a significant role in providing
care for younger children.<p>
<p>
 The elders have a special role in the society.  They are valued for their
wisdom and have considerable power. They have an important role to play in the
transmission of cultural values and in teaching the young.<p>
<p>
 Much learning occurs through the modeling of the behaviour of adults and older
children.<p>
<p>
 There are traditional games, stories, toys, songs, and ways of playing that
are passed on from the older children to the younger children, many of which
support children's physical, emotional, social and intellectual development.<p>
<p>
 Traditional healers are commonly turned to when families have health problems.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>C.     Values/ Beliefs that may be detrimental</b><p>
<p>
 Some of the food taboos associated with pregnancy increase the likelihood of
mothers being anaemic (e.g. pregnant women are not allowed to eat eggs, fish,
and sometimes meats).<p>
<p>
 Men are seldom involved in direct care of the young child. In some cultures
they provide support to women; in others they are essentially absent until the
child is older.<p>
<p>
 There is little understanding of the value of interacting with infants and
young children.  Adults don't really "play" with children, at least until the
child reaches the pre-school years.<p>
<p>
 The etiology of many diseases is misunderstood. Diseases are attributed to
human fallibility and/or witchcraft  (e.g. Kwashiorkor and marasmus are
believed to be caused by infidelity).<p>
<p>
 There is little understanding of the process of development and children's
needs at different stages (e.g. teething is seen as causing diarrhoea and other
illnesses, and meal frequency is usually tied to adult patterns of eating when
in fact young children need to eat more often).<p>
<p>
<p>
     Beyond these generalizations, the participants in the workshop sought a more
in-depth understanding of the cultures being studied. Thus, in preparation for
the workshop each set of researchers was asked to respond to a common set of
questions in relation to the findings in their study.   The section which
follows presents a summary of their responses. Because the purposes of the
studies were different, there are some questions that only one or two of the
studies may have addressed.  In other instances, all the studies could provide
relevant information.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>VI.  The Specifics</b><p>
<p>
<b>A.     Goals and expectations for children in the culture</b><p>
<p>
As noted, what comes through as a dominant theme in all the cultures studied is
that children are highly valued.  In Mali the child is seen as a "celestial,
social and material being; a complex being to be handled with great care...Many
traditional communities consider the child as part of the cosmos before it is
born. (Dembele &amp; Poulton, 1993, pgs. 4-5)  Beyond that the child is: a gift
from God, an ancestor, an evil spirit, a social product, a community
possession, its genitor's replacer, a consolation for childless relatives.
(pg. 5)<p>
<p>
     In Nigeria children are the reason for people to marry. "The essence of
marriage in the Nigerian context, as in Africa, is to have children." (Akinware
&amp; Ojomo, 1993, pg.5)  "Wedding dates are not fixed until the woman's
pregnancy is obvious ... childbirth is usually announced some few weeks or
months after the wedding." (pg. 6)  There is nothing worse than a childless
marriage.  It is "one of distress, unhappiness and (frequently) ends in
divorce." (pg.5)<p>
<p>
     In Nigeria it is said, "omo l'aso",  the child is clothing. This has several
levels of meaning.  The child covers the father at his death, meaning he takes
on the lineage.  This "covering" occurs during the father's life as well.  The
child is expected to take care of or cover the needs of the parents.  This
responsibility is conveyed to the child early on.  When the child is young,
parents emphasize how much they are doing for the child.  In turn, the
expectation is that this caretaking will be reversed when the child is grown
and the parents are old and require care.<p>
<p>
     In Zambia the importance of children is seen by the fact that parents are
known as the father or mother of a given child.  They do not use their own
names.  They are given status in relation to the child they have parented.  As
a result children are not likely to know their own surnames. (Chibuye, et al.,
1986, pg. 86)<p>
<p>
     As a result of the high value placed on children, parents desire many
children. In the Zambian study, of those interviewed only 20% wanted fewer than
5 children, 44% wanted 5-10, 8% wanted more than 10.  The remainder stated they
would be content with any number.  The reasons for wanting the given number of
children was: 'some children may die (26%), children are an investment (21%),
and children are a gift of God (18%)."  The other 35% cited the high cost of
living.<b>[2]</b> (pg. 34)<p>
<p>
     In Mali there is also a desire for large families.  "The more children there
are, the more varied the tasks the family can carry out and the more prosperous
it can be as production is still done by hand." (Dembele &amp; Poulton, 1993,
pg.6)<p>
<p>
     How do you treat these children that are the gift of God?  In Malawi they say
"M'mera ndipoyamba" - meaning that the child is like a plant.  It must be
nurtured while it is still young for it to grow up strong, healthy and
productive. (Kalemba, 1993, pg 6)<p>
<p>
     What do parents expect of children?  By and large, the majority of the goals
for children center around the development of appropriate social skills and
humanistic values.  In Namibia, among the Uukwaluudhi, parents want their
children to respect their elders. It is also important for the child to be
cooperative, helpful, hardworking and to participate in the work at home and in
the field.  Frequently mentioned was the fact that it was important for the
child to be educated, obedient, and believe in God. Only two people mentioned
specific occupations they would like to see their children pursue (teacher and
nurse). (Zimba &amp; Otaala, 1991, pg.71, 86)<p>
<p>
     Among the Bambara in Mali, the traits most desired in children are courage,
perseverance, trustworthiness, reliability, generosity, self-reliance,
industriousness, and charitability. (Dembele &amp; Poulton, 1993, pg 6) <p>
<p>
     In Nigeria there is a clear expectation that the child should be 'good'.  A
good child is one who follows cultural tradition and cares for the parents.
While traditionally the good child was one who was moral, as defined by
traditional values, now the good child is one who is a good provider. 'Good'
now has a much more material definition.  <p>
<p>
     But all children are not good.  When there is a 'bad' child, one who does not
conform to cultural norms, parents disown him/her. "I have not given birth." "I
have no child."  <p>
<p>
     Whether one has a good or bad child is the result of fate. In Nigeria it is
believed that God infuses a newborn with certain characteristics which produce
either a good or a bad child. The child is essentially given an allotment that
determines the type of existence the child will have, and his/her personality.
The ingredients that go into creating a new child, and the state of mind of the
creator at the time, determine the child's destiny.  (Akinware &amp; Ojomo,
1993, pg. 12-13)  Since parents do not know who will turn out to be the good
child, large families are the norm in Nigeria.<p>
<p>
     In addition to there being a differentiation between good and bad children,
there are also gender preferences and expectations.  Not surprisingly, male
children are preferred since they pass on the family name.  Families where the
first several children are girls generally have many children, in the hope of
having a male child.  "Each successive female issue is accompanied with greater
distress which at best is masked with fake joy."  (Akinware &amp; Ojomo, 1993,
pg. 8)<p>
<p>
     Another dimension is the impact of polygamy on the number of children born.
In Nigeria, a mark of a successful marriage is children.  Thus there are
jealousies among the women to produce the most children and children are not
well cared for by co-wives.  Death of an infant gets blamed on witchcraft
generated by co-wives.  However, this jealousy among co-wives is
counterbalanced by the need for the community to share responsibility for child
care. (Akinware &amp; Ojomo, 1993, pg.30)  <p>
<p>
<p>
     In sum, in each of the cultures studied great importance is placed on having
children.  Thus it is not surprising that there are numerous beliefs and
rituals that support the birth and raising of a healthy child.   What follows
is a description of some of the beliefs, rituals and childrearing practices
associated with different times in the child's life.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>B.     Childrearing practices and beliefs associated with conception, pregnancy
and birth.</b><p>
<p>
In the Zambian study the comment is made that "the delivery of the mother and
the birth of the children are subject to more beliefs and superstitions than
any other period of life" (pg 49).  This was echoed in the other reports as
well. In general, it can be stated that the younger the child the more
information there is about the childrearing practices and beliefs associated
with that age.  Within most of the cultures there are a variety of practices
and beliefs that surround the period from conception through infancy. This may
be due to the fact that this is a critical time in terms of a child's survival.
It is also an important time in terms of a woman's role within the culture. <p>
<p>
<b><i>    </i>1.  <i>Conception</i></b><p>
<b></b><p>
In general, there is little understanding of the biological process of
conceiving a child.  The dominant belief that God gives children is enough of
an explanation for many.  This lack of scientific knowledge about how children
are produced allows people to make their own interpretations of outcomes.  For
example, in Nigeria if the children are healthy (and male) the father takes
credit.  If the child has a defect, or there is a continuous issuance of female
children, then it is the woman who is at fault.  Barrenness is always seen as
the woman's fault and frequently it is ascribed to her infidelity.<p>
<p>
     As noted earlier, the traditional practices surrounding the care of infants
generally meant there was adequate spacing between children.  The belief was
that mothers who are breast feeding should not get pregnant.  In Malawi the
belief is that the milk of a pregnant woman is bad for the child.  In
polygamous cultures there was little pressure on women to resume sexual
relations with the father.  He could satisfy himself elsewhere until the child
was fully weaned. With the move toward more nuclear families and the
introduction of bottle feeding, sexual relations are restored soon after the
birth of the child, increasing the likelihood of women having many children
within a short time period.  <p>
<p>
     The impact of modernization can be seen from the Namibia data.  In terms of
child spacing, this was the first child for 2% of the sample;  62.2% stated
there was less than a year between the birth of two of their children; and
20.6% said the next child came within 2 years.  Only 24% indicated that the
spacing was 2+ years.<p>
<p>
<b><i>    </i>2.   <i>Pregnancy practices  </i></b><p>
<b></b><p>
In Malawi the practice was for the couple to abstain from sex from the 7th
month of pregnancy until the child is 2.  As noted earlier, the practice of
polygamy helped make this possible.  Abstinence from sex is common in Nigeria
with the onset of pregnancy.<p>
<p>
     Dietary practices are important in all the cultures studied. In both Malawi
and Nigeria women's diets are supplemented by traditional medicines in the
forms of various drinks.  While there is dietary supplementation, likewise
there are a number of foods that women are forbidden to eat.  In Zambia the
food taboos include not eating eggs, fish and certain kinds of chilies, and not
drinking bitter medicines. In Nigeria the belief is that meat will harm the
foetus.<p>
     <p>
     Historically in Namibia pregnant women were not to eat oranges (the child will
have low birth weight and suffer from liver problems), eggs (the child will be
born without hair), fish (the child will have eyes like a fish), chicken or
groundnuts (the child may be born dirty and develop the propensity to steal).
It should be noted that the reason for these taboos were <i>known</i> by only
41% of the sample.  It is unclear how many actually adhered to the taboos.
Today the people's diets include many carbohydrates but little protein or fresh
fruits and vegetables.  Of more concern than the taboos is the fact that few
women have enough food available (30% reported they did not have enough to eat,
and alcohol consumption is common). (pg. 10)<p>
<p>
     In terms of their behaviour, pregnant women in Nigeria are admonished not to
go out at night for fear of falling under the influence of the evil eye, and
not revealing the expected birth date for fear that the child's birth will be
jeopardized in some way.  Behavioural taboos in Namibia include: wake up early
in the morning, not to do so may lead to prolonged labour; do not go through
the door backwards, you may experience a breech birth.<p>
<p>
     In Mali there is essentially no change in a woman's activities while she is
pregnant.  In Namibia, the majority of pregnant women (about 70%) continued
their chores during pregnancy without help from others.  Those with older
children or younger siblings got some help.  When asked where they got advice
about their pregnancy 37.5% reported they got no advice,  39% said they got
advice from a nurse,  4.4% said from a doctor, and 14% reported getting advice
from a midwife. (Zimba &amp; Otaala, 1991, pg. 39).  79% of the women attended
the antenatal clinic more than 3 times during pregnancy, although the average
distance was 17 kilometers. (pg. 10)  The women appeared to gain little
information from the visits.  Thus what is available to support childbirth in
the village is extremely important.<p>
<p>
     <b>3<i>.  Childbirth </i></b><p>
<p>
Traditionally there were a variety of practices and beliefs surrounding
childbirth.  While these are maintained by all the members of the society, the
primary responsibility for their perpetuation is that of the traditional birth
attendant (TBA).  She plays a critical role in assuring the survival of both
the child and the mother.   The extent to which family members, the pregnant
woman's mother, the child's father, and others are involved in the birth varied
by cultural group.  Today all the cultures studied have a mix of the
traditional and Western medicine that influences the birthing process.<p>
<p>
     In Malawi most children are born at home (75%) with birth attendants and close
relatives on hand to facilitate the process. Breastfeeding is begun
immediately.  The umbilical cord is cut with an unsterilized instrument and cow
dung is generally applied to the wound. (Ash is used  in Zambia).<p>
<p>
     In the 1986 survey in Zambia, although about 75% of the women were attending
antenatal clinics, 50% delivered at home (the preferred place of delivery),
with the other half delivering in a health clinic or hospital.  Outside the
hospital, TBAs attended 42% of the births, 33% were attended by relatives;  11%
of the women reported delivering the child on their own. (Chibuye, 1986,
pg.18)<p>
     <p>
     Within the Namibia sample it was noted that people had to travel great
distances to get to a health clinic (average 17 kilometers). Despite the
distance to the clinics, 68% of the sample reported giving birth to their
children in hospitals, 27% reported the children were born at home, 1.3% were
born in clinic and 3.9% were born on the way to the hospital or clinic.  Those
born at home were delivered by TBAs.  (Zimba &amp; Otaala,  1991, pg. 42)<p>
<p>
       Within the Nigerian sample there was a bias toward families in urban areas.
That may be why more than half of the births in the Nigerian study are reported
to occur in a health facility, generally a maternity centre.  Many families
employed in urban areas are entitled to medical care as a result of their
employment.  This is believed to have increased the use of hospital and medical
facilities.  These statistics  may not accurately reflect rural access to
health care facilities.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>  4. <i> Confinement</i></b><p>
     <p>
The period immediately following the birth of the child is critical in terms of
both the infant's and the mother's survival.  During this time the mother needs
extra rest, food and care. Postpartum hemorrhaging and anaemia are common
problems.   <p>
     Traditionally, in Malawi and Mali there was a period of confinement for the
mother and child.  In Malawi this confinement of mother and child ('chikuta')
lasts for at least a week.  The explanation for the confinement is that it
helps the mother and child bond, rest after the trauma of the childbirth and
begin breastfeeding.  During this time the mother does nothing but eat and feed
her child. <p>
<p>
     One of the reasons for the confinement may well be that in Malawi males are
reported to be "revolted" by the smell of the woman who has just given birth
and the infant is seen as "fragile".  Thus they stay away from the mother and
infant.  While they refuse to touch and carry the child they may regard it
lovingly from afar. <p>
<p>
     While mothers do not have a period of confinement in Nigeria they are well
cared for by other women, primarily the mother's mother. They are given special
foods and bathed daily in a warm bath to restore them to health.  The child is
also bathed daily and provided with adornments that are designed to provide the
child with spiritual protection and serve as decorations.  The young child in
Malawi is also provided with charms for use on its arms, legs or around the
neck.  <p>
<p>
     In Zambia there is no confinement for the woman and infant. The child is shown
to others within 24 hours. Visitors frequently bring gifts (predominantly money
or food) when they come to view the child.  Gifts are also brought to the
mother.  The infant is bathed daily by any number of people.  <p>
<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>  </i><b>5. <i> Naming</i> </b><p>
<p>
An important ceremony in all the cultures studied is the naming of the child.
The names chosen for the child have great significance, both in terms of
passing on a lineage, and in terms of providing a description of the child.<p>
 <p>
     In Nigeria the infant is named on the 8th day after delivery. The naming
ceremony is full of rituals and serves as the public presentation of the baby.
The names chosen reflect events that have happened in conjunction with the
birth.  "Naming goes far beyond mere identification of the person that bears
it, it depicts events, situations and traits that could go a long way to
influence the personality formation and socialization of the individual."
(Akinware et al., 1993, pg. 21)<p>
<p>
     In Malawi the naming of the child is also delayed, probably to assure the
child's survival.   The child is then named for both sides of the family and
given names of the deceased to emphasize continuity of the clan.<p>
<p>
     While naming is an important part of a child's life, subsequent birthdays are
not always celebrated.  In Zambia only 63% of the respondents indicated that
birthdays were celebrated, 11% said they were celebrated sometimes, and 26%
said they were not celebrated. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>  6. <i> Infant deaths</i></b><p>
<p>
In traditional cultures there have always been high infant mortality rates.
Thus one of the areas of interest is how societies understand the reasons for
and respond to an infant's death. In the studies included in the Workshop, it
was reported that it was difficult to get information on infant deaths as these
are not commonly discussed.<p>
<p>
     In Malawi the death is handled with secrecy, and in fact, it is taboo to talk
about infants dying.  In Zambia also, infant deaths are not often discussed.
Deaths are attributed to witchcraft and little more is said about them.  In
Malawi and Nigeria there is little discussion of abortion and/or still births.
Thus it is hard to obtain accurate data on the reasons for these deaths. <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>C.   Caretakers for different stages and their specific roles;</b><p>
<p>
Once the child is born and is on the road to survival there are different
people that care for and assist in the raising of the child.  Across all the
cultures studied there is a progression from the mother, to others in the
family, to 'extended' family members, to the community at large. The rapidity
with which this happens differs, depending on the culture and its stage of
modernization.<p>
<p>
     In the study from Zambia it was noted that traditionally there was no concept
of the extended family - everyone was family.  Even in the 1984 sample
households included adults other than parents and 16% of the children were
being looked after by someone other than their biological parents. (Chibuye et
al., 1986, pg.44)  The concept of the community, or everyone being responsible
for the child was echoed in the work from Malawi, where the saying is 'Mwana
wanzako ndiwako yemwe, ukachenjera manja udyanaye'.  Nurture any child, even
those who are not your own, for in the future they will look after you.
(Kalemba, 1993, pg.6).  All children belong to the clan or family. The concept
of a <i>bastard </i>does not exist.<p>
<p>
What follows is a more specific description of caretaking during the various
stages of infancy and early childhood.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b><i>    </i>1.  <i>Infancy</i></b><p>
<p>
During the first year of the child's life the primary caregiver is the mother.
The child is generally fed on demand, and is carried by and sleeps with the
mother, leading to a physical and emotional closeness between the mother and
infant.<p>
<p>
     In Nigeria the interaction between the mother and child occurs primarily in
skin-to-skin contact providing the children with "unconditional warmth".  The
researchers noted that this was in contrast to the West where the contact comes
through eye contact and cuddling and kissing. (Akinware &amp; Ojomo, 1993,  pg.
25)<p>
     In Mali the child's mother is the initial caregiver until the child is at
least 1 year of age.  However, among the Bambara grandmothers play a very
important role as well.  Among the Bambara,  "social coherence and security are
considered a goal which every child's education should help foster."  (Dembele
&amp; Poulton, 1993,  pg. 7)  To reach this goal the people have developed a
system of child care where young children in the village, in small groups, are
looked after by the grandmothers. While the grandmothers do not have the energy
to do the caretaking themselves, they provide instruction to and supervise
children, sometimes as young as four years of age, who are caring for even
younger children. <p>
<p>
     It Malawi it is women who care for children at any time day and night.  The
woman's workload, which includes fetching water and fuel wood, gardening and
doing domestic chores, means that she must adapt her lifestyle to accommodate
the needs of her children. In this process, children sometimes suffer as, for
example, when their feeding needs are in conflict with the mother's work
demands. <p>
     <p>
     In all the cultural groups studied, men play a minor role in the early years.
In Mali it was noted that men stay "aloof"  in terms of caring for children.
In Malawi  most men are traditionally distanced from their children; they
rarely hold and play with them. (Kalemba, 1993,  pg  13)<p>
<p>
     As the child gets older, however, fathers interact more with the child and
take more responsibility for the child's socialization.  Overall, however, men
are generally associated with the provision of financial support while women
are seen as the ones responsible for nurturing.  As noted in the Nigerian
study, males pay for school fees, women care for and feed the child.  This view
of the differences between what women and men provide for a child continues as
the child grows older. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b><i>    </i>2.<i>  Toddlers</i></b><p>
<p>
The toddler period (18 months to 3 years) is a time of moving out from the
mother.  It is during this time that children stop breastfeeding.   Children
spend time exploring their environment.  They are taken care of by older
siblings and learn quickly from them.  In general children have few things to
play with.  Sometimes there are toys that are made by siblings or older members
of the community.  <p>
<p>
     In some cultures fathers get more involved with the children during this
stage.  In Nigeria the child as a toddler is more attractive to the father.
Now he will carry and play with the child.  The father also takes on a somewhat
negative role in that he is  'the law' when the child begins walking and moving
out on his own.  The father is also the decision-maker in the family.  75% of
the health care decisions are made by the father, except in families where the
mother has some education.<p>
<p>
     In the Nigerian study where there were both a rural and an urban sample, the
role of the fathers was found to be different in the two settings.  In rural
areas males are more tolerant of children's behaviour as there is more space.
Thus children are not as disciplined in rural as urban areas.  Within the
Nigerian group, one of the positive features of being in an urban area is that
there is a higher probability of father-child attachment due to the fact that
there is less help available from other members of the family and community.<p>
<p>
     The Nigerian study also looked at what was happening for the child emotionally
during toddlerhood.  The researchers saw this time as presenting a conflict for
children as they make a shift in their loyalties.  "At some stage in the early
childhood, there is a complex ambivalence in the Nigerian society about the
greater attachment to the mother on the one hand and the greater loyalty
demanded for the father on the other hand, and this interplays in the rearing
of the child." (Akinware &amp; Ojomo, 1993, pg.30) <p>
<p>
     The necessity to shift from the mother as the focus of care and attention to
the ever-expanding world of 'others' was evidenced in all the cultures.  As the
child enters the early childhood period (ages 3-6 years) this movement away
from the mother is even more pronounced.<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>  </i>4.  <b><i>Early Childhood  3-6</i></b><p>
<p>
It is during the early childhood years that the child becomes socialized into
culturally-appropriate male and female roles and begins taking on adult
responsibilities - around the house and in terms of family business, whatever
that might be.  The contact between the child and the mother is greatly reduced
during these years and the child learns to interact with a variety of other
people.  For example, among the Uukwaluudhi, only 10% of the children in this
age group are with their mother all day;  52% of the mothers reported they had
no contact with their child during the day.  It is at this point that others
take on some responsibility for caring for the child.  Older siblings (43%) or
grandparents (30%) were the primary caregivers.  It is important to note that
the father contributed  less to the child's care than either siblings or
grandparents.  60% were completely absent. (Zimba &amp; Otaala, 1992, pgs. 14,
17) Older children enjoy considerable liberty and essentially take care of
themselves as elders look after the younger children. <p>
     <p>
     Play is an important part of the child's life.  A common saying in the West is
that 'play is the work of children'. This is also the belief of the Bambara in
Mali.  Children's play is extremely important among the Bambara.  Members of a
Bamanan family play pretend games with the child.  When the child can sit, a
four-year-old sibling is asked to play with it. (Dembele &amp; Poulton, 1993,
pg. 5)  However,  adults and siblings are not always directly involved in a
child's play.  Sometimes they watch the child's play from a distance.  <p>
      <p>
     As in Mali, many of the adults among the Uukwaluudhi in Namibia did not think
it was appropriate for adults - particularly fathers - to play with children.
Not too surprisingly this lack of direct adult involvement with children leads
to many accidents.  Among the Uukwaluudhi, 24% of the children had been
involved in domestic accidents. Hot water and fire were the main causes of the
accidents.  In 33% of the cases these accidents took place when the children
were alone.  In the other instances they were in the company of older siblings
or busy mothers.  When asked how accidents could be prevented 60% of the
respondents said they had no idea. (Zimba &amp; Otaala, 1991, pg.69)<p>
<p>
     Toys for the pre-school age group are now sophisticated, but they are not
expensive.  In  Zambia children play with balls, clay toys, wire toys, bottles,
and tins, all of which are made from things found in the environment.   For the
most part the children make these themselves (59% reported doing so).  Other
toys are bought and/or made by parents. <p>
<p>
     Among the Uukwaluudhi in Namibia, there are more toys available to the
pre-school aged child than are available to infants. Caregivers reported they
are more likely to make toys for older children than for infants and toddlers.
85% of the children reported making their own toys, 54% said caregivers made
toys for them.  During the early childhood period, the kinds of games and toys
available to children are supportive of children's cognitive and psycho-social
development.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>D.     Childrearing practices and beliefs in relation to the promotion of
health, nutrition, cognitive and psycho-social development.  </b><p>
<p>
While the first two years are a critical time in terms of the child's physical
survival, they are also critical in terms of building the foundations for
cognitive and psycho-social development.  But these latter aspects of a child's
growth and development have not been researched to the extent that health and
nutrition practices have been.  Thus while the studies yielded rich information
on cultural beliefs and practices that would impact a child's health, less
information was available on childrearing practices and beliefs related to the
full range of a child's development. What follows is a brief description of
what was found in relation to health and nutrition beliefs and practices, and a
description of activities that take place which help promote cognitive and
psycho-social development.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b><i>    </i>1.  <i>Health</i></b><p>
<p>
The studies revealed that currently people are using a mix of western and
traditional medicines in the healing of diseases. All of the cultures studied
have been exposed to Western medicine to some degree.  This is evidenced from
the reports on the use of health clinics for pre-natal care and treatment for
infants and young children.  The timing of <i>when </i>Western medicine is used
appears to depend on availability and ease of access rather than beliefs about
the value of Western versus traditional medicine.<p>
     <p>
     In Nigeria, in urban areas where there is access to western medicine, parents
buy western drugs first and if these fail then parents turn to traditional
medicines.  In rural areas traditional medicines are used first and other
health care sought outside the village only if the traditional medicines do not
work.   In Nigeria there are 2 traditional systems of health care - the
indigenous healers who were in existence before colonial times and a recent
group referred to as 'syncretic churches'.  While seemingly different, there is
a high degree of convergence between the two.  They both use: herbal medicines,
divination, exorcism, symbolic rituals, incision, and non-formal psychotherapy.
Syncretic practitioners are consulted by people from all walks of life, rural
and urban, literate and illiterate, Christians and Muslims.<p>
<p>
     In Zambia, all respondents reported using traditional herbal medicines to heal
childhood accidents and diseases.  In addition, about 50%, those who lived
relatively near health centres, took their children to the clinics.  Most
people (91%) correctly understood the purpose of immunizations.  (Chibuye, et
al., 1986, pg. 33)<p>
<p>
<p>
<b><i>    </i>2. <i> Nutrition</i></b><p>
<p>
Nutrition is a critical feature of young children's development. Thus within
each of the reports there was considerable information on breastfeeding and
weaning practices.  The reports include a description of what happens
physically and some reports provide an indication of how changes in practice
had an impact on the child emotionally.<p>
<p>
     <b><i>a.  Breastfeeding.</i></b><i> </i> During the first two years of the
child's life, there is a fairly uniform pattern across all the cultures
presented at the Workshop.  Children are carried on the mother's back and are
breastfed on demand during the early months.  At the point at which the mother
wants to stop breastfeeding the child is separated from the mother.  Sometimes
care for the child is shifted to someone else even though the mother is around.
In other instances the child is actually sent from the village to relatives
elsewhere.  <p>
<p>
     Breastfeeding is common in Zambia. 97% of those in the study said they
breastfed their babies, most on-demand. 53% said they breastfed until the child
was between 1 and 1 1/2 years old. 42% said they breastfed for more than 2
years.   Nigeria is not unlike Zambia.  In Nigeria nearly 100% of the mothers
breastfeed, generally for about 18 months.  Those in rural areas breastfeed for
longer than those in urban areas. Breastfeeding is on demand and is used as a
pacifier in addition to being used to feed the child.  Unfortunately those with
the most education breastfeed for the least amount of time. <p>
<p>
     Among the Yoruba a traditional practice was the force feeding of medicinal
(agbo) teas soon after birth and later 'pap' (cereals) to infants.  These
practices are not followed by more literate women.  In the other cultures
included in the Workshop, only breastmilk is provided until the child is at
least three months old.  <p>
     <p>
     <b>  b<i>. The introduction of weaning foods.  </i></b>In Namibia, exclusive
breastfeeding lasts no longer than the sixth month. Most mothers start
providing additional food after the third month.  The most common addition
being a porridge known as 'omahangu'.   Of those in the Namibian sample,  78%
reported that children have three meals a day.  For those who have less this is
due either to a lack of food or lack of caregiver time to prepare the food.
The pattern for adults is two meals a day. <p>
     Like in Namibia, the practice in Malawi was to introduce solid foods at about
the 3rd month.  While the range of ages within which children stop
breastfeeding, is from 6 months to two + years, it is most common for children
to be breastfed for two years.  If the mother dies, the surrogate mother
breastfeeds, if possible.<p>
<p>
     As the Malawian child becomes a toddler, breastfeeding continues for some.
The frequency of their eating solid foods is tied to that of adults, among whom
food is shared communally 2-3 times a day.  There are some food taboos, most
notably the taboo against eating eggs.  Early on children are taught
self-feeding skills.<p>
<p>
     In Mali, children are given no special weaning foods. They eat the same foods
as those given to adults, with the exception being that children are not given
eggs.  However children eat more frequently than adults.  In Zambia, children
are expected to begin eating on their own at a young age: 92% of the
respondents said children are eating on their own before age 1.  While
children's eating is supervised primarily by the mothers, other relatives also
participate in this activity.  There are also food taboos in this culture.
Children should not eat 'hard foods, sweet stuff, game meat and eggs', nor
should there be too much variety in their diet.   (Chibuye, et al., 1986,  pg.
25)<p>
<p>
     In terms of food distribution, in both Nigeria and Zambia, feeding follows a
hierarchy, with adults eating the good food first and the remains passed from
the oldest to the youngest child.  In times of scarcity the youngest suffer the
most.  In Zambia males and females are fed separately.  Male children generally
eat with adult males, but female children eat on their own. <p>
<p>
     <b>c. <i>Complete weaning.</i> </b> In most of the cultures studied, the most
common way to end breastfeeding was to remove the child from the mother.<b>
</b>In Mali, when the mother wants to stop breastfeeding the child she sends
the child away overnight to a relative   <b> </b>Complete weaning in Namibia
occurs by putting bitter substances on the nipples, sending children away to
their grandparents or simply refusing the child access to the breast.   In
Zambia, 47% said they stopped breastfeeding abruptly,  46% said it was a
gradual process. (69% used feeding bottles when weaning the child from the
breast.)  <p>
<p>
     It was only in the Namibian study that there was some attempt to look at the
impact of  abrupt  withdrawal of breastfeeding.  In that study adults reported
that children's immediate response to complete weaning was to cry a lot
(41.3%), become sad (34.8%), and become irritable (8.7%).  15.2% of the
caregivers reported that there was no response.  They reported that sometimes
children refuse to eat other foods and withdraw, becoming listless.  (Zimba
&amp; Otaala, 1991, pg. 79)<p>
<p>
<p>
<b><i>    </i>3.<i>  Cognitive and Psycho-Social Development</i></b><p>
<p>
In the Mali study there was specific emphasis on the ways in which traditional
practices impacted on a child's cognitive development.  Thus within that study
there was a discussion of the ways in which traditional games, songs, and
stories are supportive of children's overall development.  The researchers
noted that many traditional games promote cognitive development.  "They
necessitate recalling, memorizing, sequencing and logical thinking. Traditional
tales and riddles ... help develop intellectual capacity." Dembele &amp;
Poulton, 1993, pg. 11)  <p>
<p>
     <b>a.<i>  Language development.</i>  </b>Language development is promoted
through the use of language with children.  In Mali, adults talk to children
from the moment they are born.  As the child grows older (ages 3-6) there is a
conscious teaching of language skills through story-telling, questioning,
songs.<p>
<p>
     This pattern is similar in Namibia.  About 82% of the mothers reported talking
to their children at birth, but they do not describe themselves as telling
children stories.  In fact, 86% said they did not tell stories, claiming
children could not understand them.  29% of the adults reported talking to,
singing with and teaching children traditional dances.  While parents said that
they helped foster language development by asking children to get things, name
them, touch them, they claim they do not talk about the objects nor describe
them to the child. (Zimba &amp; Otaala,  1991,  pg. 15)  <p>
<p>
     As in Mali, the Namibia sample reported doing more things to stimulate
language development when children are within the pre-school age group. 46% of
the caregivers reported telling stories to pre-school aged children.  71% of
them asked children to tell their own stories.  76% of the caregivers reported
teaching the children songs about people, animals, birds, religion and
politics.  96% reported answering children's questions, and 87% of them said
they asked children to describe events that took place in the community.
(Zimba &amp; Otaala,  1991,  pg. 16)  <p>
<p>
     In Zambia, the games that children engage in include hide-and-seek, ball
games, singing and dancing. (Chibuye et. al., 1986, pg. 29)  31% of the parents
said they played with the children sometimes; 80% said they told their children
stories and proverbs.  The majority of the story-tellers are the women  (40%
mothers, 5% fathers).   (Chibuye, et al.,  1986,  pg. 84)<p>
<p>
     <b>b.<i>  Psycho-social development: the importance of chores.</i></b><i>
</i>Another way that psycho-social development is promoted in many traditional
cultures is through the chores children are asked to perform.  The Bamanan
children in Mali, for example, have specific tasks they are expected to
undertake from an early age.  Under the age of four, these tasks are not
differentiated by sex.  Over the age of four, boys are expected to care for
poultry and animals, learn manual labour such as hiving and mat weaving and
cutting thatch for roofing.  Girls do house-related chores.  Both boys and
girls run errands for those older than they, scare birds and monkeys from the
field, provide the elderly with firewood, and engage in caregiving of younger
siblings.  <p>
<p>
     Chores are important in other cultures as well.  In Zambia, 53% of the parents
expected children ages 4-6 to be helping with the chores.  As in Mali there are
different chores depending on the sex of the child, although there is some
overlap.  Boys are involved in gardening, fetching firewood, running errands
and washing plates.  The chores for girls include washing plates, fetching
water and firewood, bathing babies, running errands, pounding food, and
cooking.  <p>
<p>
     In Namibia chores were also allocated depending on the child's gender.  The
most frequent tasks performed by boys in Namibia included looking after goats
and cattle, collecting and chopping firewood, plowing and fetching water.  For
girls the most frequent tasks were fetching water, cooking, collecting
firewood, pounding grain, washing up, and cleaning.<p>
<p>
     Beyond simply looking at the kinds of chores that children performed, in the
Namibia study an attempt was made to understand how children were taught the
chores, the kind of rewards they received for doing a task well and how they
were treated if they did not perform well.  The researchers asked the
caregivers how they responded to the way children performed their tasks.   93%
of the caregivers reported thanking children and praising them for performing
tasks successfully.  About 46% clarified tasks when children failed to
accomplish them, while 52% responded to a child's failure by rebuking or
punishing the child.<p>
<p>
     In terms of more general socialization,  74% of the adults said they would
smile back in  response to a child's smile.   They were less responsive to
children's requests to play and seldom offered help.  When the child had
difficulty with a task, 29% said they would tell the child how to do it and
have them try again.  18% blamed the child for his/her failure, and a small
percentage would simply have someone else do the task.  (Zimba &amp; Otaala,
1991, pg. 58)<p>
<p>
     In some studies there were specific questions relating to how children are
taught to be obedient.  In Zambia 60% of the adults stated that children are
corrected by beating, 30% use reasoning, and 7% verbally rebuke the child.  But
once again, boys and girls are not treated the same.  It was stated that boys
need more severe punishment since they are stronger than girls and more
'notorious'. (Chibuye, et. al,  1986,  pg 28)  <p>
<p>
<p>
<b><i>    </i>4. <i> Education</i></b><p>
<p>
<b>  a.  <i>Non-formal education.</i> </b> In Malawi, the researchers looked at
who taught children different skills.  The results indicated that mothers and
siblings talk to and cuddle the child.  Further, the child is taught to sit,
talk, crawl and walk by the mother and siblings. Toileting and independent
living skills are taught by the mother.  Language is introduced by both the
mother and siblings both of whom teach the child to walk.  Songs, dance, games,
riddles are introduced by the wider community through play with older children
and interaction with adults.  (Kalemba, 1993, pg. 10)<p>
<p>
     <b>b<i>. Formal education.</i> </b> In terms of attendance in school, parents
in the Zambian study reported that they sent their children to school, but the
age at which children were sent varied (from 5 years to 9 years of age).
Parents reported that they sent the children when they were "ready".  94% said
it was important to send both boys and girls to school.  The reasons given
were: "so that they are both given a chance to succeed (46%); they should have
an equal opportunity (34%). (Chibuye et al., 1986,  pg. 30)<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>E.     The degree of traditionalism (traditional, transitional, modern) evident
in current childrearing practices and beliefs;</b><p>
<b></b><p>
One of the major tasks of the workshop was to analyze the reports on
childrearing practices and beliefs in terms of the extent to which traditional
practices still held sway and the extent to which the traditional practices had
been 'modernized'.  The report on Malawi addressed this question specifically.
As these were presented researchers from the other countries indicated that
similar changes were taking place within the societies they studied.  What
follows is a summary of the perceived changes.<p>
<p>
<b>1.</b> Most traditional childrearing practices persist to date in some form,
although they have been influenced by changes occurring in the society as a
whole.  For example, pregnancy is no longer as sensitive a subject as it was.
The reason for this is that there is considerable modern information available
and being provided to women.  When they receive this information they are
encouraged to talk about their own situation.   Pregnant mothers are now eating
foods which benefit  the unborn child, although traditionally these foods were
taboo.<p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> Traditional practices related to the birth of the child are still
persistent, with TBAs and close relatives playing a crucial role in helping to
deliver the child.  However, increasingly children are being born in health
facilities and the traditional practices are not being followed.  Also, the
confinement period is breaking down for those who deliver their child in the
hospital or birthing clinic.  This is due to short hospital stays and being
exposed to the public on discharge from the maternity hospital.<p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> There are still strong taboos surrounding the discussion of still
births and abortions.   It is unclear if women have more accurate information
about the causes of still births since still births are not discussed openly.<p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> People now have correct information regarding the causes of
kwashiorkor and marasmus.  They know they are caused by poor nutrition and
improper feeding habits rather than infidelity.  Also there is an understanding
that witches do not cause diseases like measles.<p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> Mothers and siblings are still the primary caregivers.  In cities,
increasingly there is the use of nannies.<p>
<p>
<b>6.</b> Girls' enrolment in school has decreased their role as child-minders.
While unsubstantiated by research,  there is a fear that this has increased the
risk to infants and young children who are deprived of care as a result of the
older girls attending school. <p>
<b>7. </b>     Most mothers still breastfeed on demand, but increasingly they are
decreasing the number of months they breastfeed. Bottle feeding is practiced in
towns and to a large extent by working mothers. <p>
<p>
<b>8</b>. Post-partum abstinence is no longer ruled by tradition, making child
spacing a problem.  There is no longer the taboo against a breastfeeding woman
becoming pregnant.  A related problem is the fact that when a woman becomes
pregnant she stops breastfeeding, thus shortening the amount of time the child
receives breastmilk.<p>
<p>
<b>9.</b>      The bond between the mother and child is weakening as the child is
now left to be taken care of  by siblings or other caregivers earlier than this
would have happened traditionally.  There is a sense that care, such as feeding
and bathing, may no longer be as consistent as it was when the young child was
always with the mother.<p>
<p>
<b>10.</b>     The youngest children continue to have the lowest status in terms of
receiving food in the communal eating situation. When there is a shortage of
food, the youngest suffer most.  This is indicated by increased mortality rates
for children between 12 and 24 months when breastmilk is less available (or not
available at all) and it is not being replaced by appropriate foods.<p>
<p>
<b>11.</b>     Large families continue to be valued, particularly in rural areas.
The high fertility rates among the groups studied is indicative of this.  With
limited resources, the care of children is problematic.  Further, the fact that
increasingly child spacing is a problem means that children are not given
adequate care.<p>
<p>
<b>12.</b>     Some traditional beliefs about illness persist, particularly in
terms of cures.  The extent to which families use traditional medicines depends
on their proximity and ease of access to Western health care.  Rural families
turn to traditional medicines first.  When those don't work modern medical
treatment is sought.  Sometimes, this comes too late.   Urban families, with
access to and experience with Western medicine tend to turn to it first.
Traditional medicine is sought when Western medicine is found lacking. <p>
<p>
In sum, there are instances where more 'modern' practices are replacing
traditional practices.  In some instances the replacements are of benefit to
the mother and child, as in the situation where women have more information
about the conceptualization, pregnancy and birth process and they are using
this information to assure the birth of a health baby and to take care of
themselves physically.  However, there are a number of instances where the more
'modern'  practices  have supplanted the traditional and this has had a
negative impact on the child and/or the mother.  This is true in the case of
child spacing and the introduction of bottle feeding.<p>
<p>
     <p>
<b>F.     Where there is agreement between traditional practices and "scientific"
knowledge;</b><p>
<p>
Too often the assumption is made that what is 'traditional' is based on myths
and beliefs which are not scientifically valid.  The reasoning goes further.
Since traditional practices lack scientific backing they are invalid and should
be changed.  Those attending the workshop were not willing to accept this
conclusion.  There was a strong feeling that there are a number of traditional
childrearing beliefs and practices that are very much in agreement with current
scientific thinking.  One of the tasks of the Workshop was to identify those
practices which are beneficial from both points of view.  What follows is a
listing of those generated during the workshop:<p>
<p>
<b>1.</b> The practice of breastfeeding the child on demand and breastfeeding
for a lengthy period of time are both beneficial.  The issue is that in times
of food shortage, children may not be given anything other than breastmilk.
From the sixth month on children require more than just breastmilk.  Another
issue is the fact that the mothers themselves may be very undernourished and
breastfeeding further depletes their own resources.  <p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> The mother-child bond is also in line with current scientific
knowledge about the importance of a primary relationship for the child, a
relationship that provides the child with basic security as he/she moves out
into the world at large.  In most of the cultures presented at the Workshop,
traditionally there was constant contact between the mother and child for at
least the first year.  Mothers carried their children on their backs, spoke to
and cuddled the child. Mothers also slept with their children until they were
between two and three years of age.  This helped strengthen the bond between
them.  The Malawi study indicated that under these conditions, cot deaths are
extremely rare. This was ascribed to the physical closeness between the mother
and infant.  (Kalemba,  1993,  pg. 14)<p>
<p>
<b>3. </b>     The community as a whole takes responsibility for raising the
child.  As children grow a variety of people are involved in their care,
socialization and education.  Caregivers include siblings, grandmothers, other
relatives, and eventually the community.  Expectations in terms of a child's
behaviour are reinforced by community members.  Thus the child is given a
consistent image of what he/she should become.  Scientific knowledge also
reinforces the importance of children having a number of people that he/she can
turn to for support and guidance.  A nuclear family, particularly one headed by
a single parent, provides the child with few resources.  The resources
available within an extended family can be of great benefit to a child.<p>
<p>
<b>4. </b>     Play is viewed as an important part of a child's development within
both traditional and more modern views of the child.  Traditional cultures have
provided toys and playthings made from materials found in the environment.  The
skills required to make these toys are handed down from generation to
generation.    The act of making the toy brings the adult into the life of the
child.   <p>
<p>
<b>5. </b>     There are traditional games that children play which stimulate
cognitive development (problem solving, math, and reasoning skills) and which
support the development of  communication skills.  <p>
<b>6.</b> The songs, stories and riddles handed down through the oral tradition
are an important part of children's learning process, promoting language as
well as social development.<p>
<p>
<b>7.</b> Children develop a sense of social responsibility through their
involvement in age-appropriate tasks.  From these they learn obedience,
helpfulness, cooperation, and respect.<p>
 <p>
In sum, in the sub-Saharan cultures represented at the Workshop, the
traditional world of the child is very rich. "By the time a child goes to
school it will have had a very wide experience of its own environment."
(Kalemba, 1993, pg 14)   This experience needs to be acknowledged and built
upon to promote the child's development.  <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>G.     Where there are disagreements between the traditional and scientific
practices being promoted</b><p>
<p>
While there are many traditional beliefs and practices that are supported by
current understanding of how to promote healthy growth and development, there
are some that are 'at odds' with current theory.  These were also explored at
the Workshop.  What follows is a description of  some of these practices.<p>
<p>
<b>1.  </b>    Traditional food taboos for pregnant women can have a negative
impact on the child's development and the woman's own health.  For example,
taboos against eating eggs, fish and certain types of meat limit women's intake
of protein.  What is of interest is the fact that the specifics of the food
taboos are so similar across all the cultures studied.  Unanswered questions
include:  Why do these widely geographically divergent cultures have such
similar food taboos?   How did these taboos develop?   What function have they
served historically?  Are they important today?<p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> There are practices associated with the birth of the child that are
potentially dangerous for the child.  The use of unsterilized instruments to
cut the umbilical cord and applying dung or ash to the wound increase the risk
of infection.  These practices are easily addressed, although changing the
behaviour of TBAs who do not have access to appropriate instruments and
medicines is more difficult.<p>
<p>
<b>3. </b>     The practices related to the introduction of solid foods varied
considerably across the cultures studied. While in some cultures solids, in the
form of a porridge, were introduced as early as 3 months of age, in other
settings solid foods are introduced much later.  In most cases children are
provided maize meal or a single type of porridge as the only weaning food.
Frequently there is imbalance between solid foods and breastfeeding with the
result being an inadequately nourished child.  While in some instances this
lack of balance is the result of lack of knowledge about what a child requires,
at other times families lack access to appropriate food. <p>
<b>4. </b>     Feeding patterns are not based on an understanding of children's
developmental needs (i.e. that children need to eat small amounts of food at
frequent intervals rather than large quantities at 2-3 sittings).  In most
traditional cultures children are fed when adults are fed. This amounts to
being fed only twice a day in Malawi.<p>
<p>
<b>5</b>. Across the cultures examined at the Workshop, fathers are at a
distance from the childrearing process.   While they may be part of the
presentation of the child to the community, they take little or no
responsibility for the child during the early years.  Sometimes as the child
gets older (age 3+) the father will take some interest in the child and get
involved, at least in a minimal way, in the child's socialization.   The
pattern across cultures in terms of the urban father's involvement with
children differed.   While in urban Nigeria the father tended to get more
involved with the child since there were fewer extended family members
available to help provide care, in Malawi, the additional stresses of urban
life meant that the father was even more distant from the child. <p>
<p>
<b>6</b>. Tradition sets clear boundaries on roles based on gender.  Children
are socialized very early into appropriate roles.  This is done through the
assignment of chores and tasks, based on the child's gender.   There is little
opportunity for children to explore their full range of interests.<p>
<p>
<b>7.</b> There is little recognition by the formal school system of the
knowledge, skills and beliefs that children bring to school.   This is not a
problem of the traditional culture, it is a problem with current practice.  The
formal school system, most often implicitly, assumes that children lack
knowledge and skills in relation to problem-solving, reasoning, maths and
language when they  come from a 'traditional' setting.   Little is done to
assess what children already know, how they think,  and what they have
experienced.    Teachers are assuming they are dealing with a 'blank slate'
when in fact children arrive at school with a wealth of experiences behind them
that need to be recognized and built upon.<p>


 <b>[1]</b>. The age of these children was not specified.  However, it was noted that the oldest
children in the sample were seven years of age, so the children were younger than eight years of
age.<br><p>    

  <b>[2]</b>.It is unclear if the latter was in support of more or fewer children. <br><p>

<title>Resilient Children and Families</title><body><b>Resilient Children and Families</b><p>
<p>
	by Claudia A. Blackburn<p>
<p>
<i>Claudia Blackburn is a psychologist who works internationally with programs
that serve families living in difficult conditions, and individuals traumatized
by alcoholism, abuses, and social dissolution.   </i><p>
<p>
<p>
<i>	The importance of traditional practices, patterns and beliefs is especially
evident when dealing with children and families who are victims of traumatic
conditions.  Traditions can provide a source of strength and reorientation when
an individual or family's world is disrupted, and can enhance the child's
ability to survive and thrive. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>	It is quite extraordinary that some children and adults not only
survive trauma but are able to continue to thrive regardless of their many
losses, trauma, and difficult living conditions.  How does one child survive
over another even when both possess the same painful history?  Why does one
individual adjust to the many traumas with fewer problems than a family member
who has shared the same experiences? <p>
<p>
	These questions have led researchers to study the impact of trauma and the
conditions for resiliency.  Resiliency is the ability to recover from or adjust
easily to misfortune or change.  It is the capability of a strained body and
mind to withstand shock and recover without permanent deformation.<p>
<p>
	Living with trauma and its effects, children and adults will frequently
possess a belief in a foreshortened future and a behavioral pattern of learned
helplessness.  Life appears to have little meaning or purpose.  It is common
for victims to repeatedly experience an inability to effect change for
themselves or their family.  How then can resiliency be created or reinforced
with this level of hopelessness and helplessness?<p>
<p>
	The current research on resiliency and trauma has led to interesting
observations and conclusions that can guide us in developing programs that
support young children and families in difficult circumstances.  Through
research, several major factors have been identified that appear to preserve or
build the resiliency of an individual.  These elements have strong implications
for establishing programs in unstable or hostile environments where a child or
adult may be at high risk for victimization.  It is suggested that parenting
and child care programs explore ways to incorporate the following factors to
build a program consistent in strengthening the emotional and physical
well-being of their population.<p>
<p>
<b>1. Access to culturally-appropriate personal support.</b><p>
<b></b>A major factor that appears to contribute to resiliency is access to
support from either family members or outside significant resources.  If a
child or adult can rely on some form of personal contact that is consistent
with their culture and customs, particularly with family members or other
individuals from their community,  they will remain more emotionally
resourceful.  A personal support network provides a safety net to prevent
individual parents or children from falling into the desolation often caused by
poor living conditions and severe trauma.<p>
<p>
<b>2. Continuance of traditional rituals, celebrations and practices.</b><p>
<b></b>Meaningful community events based on the cultural norms can also help to
maintain hope and stability in an ever-changing environment.  Even in the midst
of war and poverty, traditional cultural rituals, celebrations, and gatherings
can be adjusted to the conditions to enable individuals and families to either
maintain or reestablish a sense of community and a sense of self.<p>
<p>
<b>3. The opportunity to exercise control over some aspect of their
lives.</b><p>
<b></b>Individuals' beliefs  regarding their degree of control over the
occurrence and outcome of traumatic events will generally influence their
adjustment.  If  individuals believe they have little or no control over the
traumatic conditions, they will have more difficulty overall in their ability
to adjust favorably.  Therefore, in order to decrease helplessness and to
maximize coping skills, programs serving families in difficult circumstances
need to incorporate ways to give participants a sense of decision-making power,
self-determination, and true "ownership" of the program.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>4. The maintenance of daily routines and common rituals.</b> <p>
 Often, everyday activities are drastically interrupted by traumatic life
events, thus destroying a basic road map of daily living.  Through the use of
culturally-based rituals and routines, children and adults can rely on these
familiar activities to maintain a sense of orientation and level of control
over their environment.  Religious rituals, meal time practices, morning
routines and common celebrations all help individuals to keep their bearings,
even when living in severe conditions.<p>
<p>
<b>5. Provision of consistency through the intervention program
structure.</b><p>
<b></b> Maintaining or creating <i>consistent </i>routines no matter how
mundane this may appear, can give a sense of safety and continuity for those
inflicted repeatedly by trauma. In viewing life through the eyes of trauma,
life itself appears tentative, fragile, and unpredictable.  Through a program
structure, a level of security, control, predictability can be generated to
create an atmosphere which will allow children and adult participants to
thrive.  The program structures will lay the foundation that enables
individuals to accomplish simple tasks and reestablish a sense of competence
and normalcy.<p>
<p>
<b>6. Interaction with positive role models from the individual's cultural
tradition.</b><p>
<b></b>Providing and identifying role models who exhibit problem-solving skills
can help build resiliency in children and parents.  Through observation of
others, individuals can see how to develop tools to confront the physical and
emotional hardships caused by the trauma.  In addition, they can witness how
others cope with problems and survive their history.  Role models who are
accepted by the community and reinforce positive values within the culture, can
give a sense of hope to others who believed that survival is futile.<p>
<p>
<b>7. Opportunities to express feelings and sort out thoughts and
beliefs.</b><p>
Individuals need opportunities to express their thoughts and feelings about a
painful or traumatic situation, in order to better handle the emotional and
social effects of the experience.  A valuable component of resiliency is the
process of acknowledging, retelling and addressing the emotions and beliefs
pertaining to the trauma or painful events in a supportive and safe
environment.  The means of creating this atmosphere must be based on cultural
norms and local customs in order to generate participation.  If children or
adults don't have an opportunity to address the stress in a
culturally-comfortable context, their ability to heal may be limited.  Coping
skills become strained when individuals are unable to manage information,
memories, and emotions produced by the traumas.  This limits a person's present
and future ability to cope with additional stresses.<p>
<p>
<b>8. Context in which to develop (or which provides) a sense of purpose.
</b><p>
<b></b>The development of a sense of purpose and meaning for the suffering is
an important ingredient in healing and reinforcing suffering..  Children and
families often need guidance, support, and a format to initiate or enhance this
healing process.  This is the final stage of recovery.  To move beyond the pain
and devastation, individuals must be able to generate reasons to endure their
losses and painful history and a hope for the future.<p>
	In conclusion, it is the hope of this author when reviewing the emotional
impact of trauma and the factors that lead to a healthier adjustment to stress,
that consideration be given to incorporating activities that promote resiliency
within programs that serve young children and their families.  Especially in
view of the research which underscores the importance of the early years in a
child's subsequent development, such programs can become
a significant avenue to creating a resilient population.

<title>Related Research in Childrearing Practices</title><body><b>Related Research in Childrearing Practices</b><p>
<b></b> From the Coordinators&#146; Notebook, Issue 15, 1994<p>
<p>
Outside of the countries covered by the Latin American and Sub-Saharan African
workshops organized by the Secretariat of the Consultative Group, UNICEF
country offices in other parts of the world are also undertaking research on
childrearing practices, patterns and beliefs and using the information gathered
as the basis for programme development. What follows is a description of the
experiences in two countries: Egypt and Lao PDR. <p>
<p>
<b>A Rapid Appraisal of Early Childrearing Practices in Egypt,</b> UNICEF,
1992<p>
<p>
The main objective of the research on early childrearing practices in Egypt was
to identify and comprehend existing practices, beliefs and perceptions
concerning childrearing and child development in selected communities. The
focus was on communication with the most disadvantaged groups, particularly
women and the poor. <p>
<p>
The research process was meant to be practical and to build on local strengths
and knowledge while at the same time developing the capacity of local NGOs to
collect research data. Consequently UNICEF decided to rely on the experience
and efforts of actual community developers from the very inception of the
project.  Accordingly, Egyptian NGOs were invited to participate in the
project.  There were 6 NGOs ultimately involved.<p>
<p>
The individuals involved in collecting data were trained in Participatory Rapid
Appraisal (PRA) techniques. The training was both theoretical and practical. By
the end of the training process the group had selected a number of basic PRA
research tools which they thought most appropriate for their task. In the
gathering of data they were encouraged to employ a mix of research techniques
(semi-structured interviews, observation, secondary sources and key
informants), to work in multi-disciplinary teams, and to use more than one
source of information. A process of data-collection by triangulation was
employed. This involved using different techniques and sources to gather data
on the same issue. This allowed for the cross-checking of information and
getting a more in-depth understanding.<p>
<p>
Rather than trying to cover a large sample, it was decided that researchers
would compile case studies of family practices on a limited number of families.
Households to be included had to have at least one infant, a child under three
years of age and a child between the ages of 3 and 6.  Selection of families
was determined by the degree to which researchers felt they could establish a
relationship with family members and make them feel enough at ease to willingly
participate in the project.  Five to nine families were chosen in each of seven
sites. <p>
<p>
The results yielded information on: the physical conditions/environment,
feeding/eating practices, daily routine for the child, playing, children's
interaction with the mother, parental perception in terms of expectations for
the child, children's behavior, etc., how children learn, children's
interaction with others (peers and adults), and the use of TV and other media.
<p>
<p>
The data generated were then used as the basis for the development of a
curriculum on Early Childhood Development. The curriculum was designed to
"provide caretakers with the confidence to sustain constructive/positive
practices and the knowledge to correct other practices which are detrimental to
the physical, intellectual, and/or emotional growth of children."<p>

<b>Traditional Childrearing Practices Among Different Ethnic Groups in Houphan
Province, Lao People's Democratic Republic,</b>  UNICEF, Somporn Phanjaruniti,
1994<p>
<p>
Taken from the Executive Summary of  the UNICEF Report<p>
<p>
The Lao Women's Union, with support from UNICEF, has since 1992 been
implementing the Women's Development Programme - a village based community
development initiative working in five provinces of the Lao PDR to improve the
well-being of women and their families. A particular concern in initiating this
programme was the status of Lao children -- their very high rates of infant
mortality and overall health education, and developmental situation. WDP staff
have recognized that their work related closely to child survival and
development issues but have lacked both specific information on traditional Lao
attitudes and practices towards child-raising and a strategy to incorporate
these issues directly into the programme.<p>
<p>
Thus a study was conducted to gain better knowledge of these traditional
practices and attitudes toward child-raising and the overall developmental
situation for children growing up in rural areas of the country. The focus was
on analyzing some of the strengths and weaknesses of traditional practices and
the factors that lead to child development problems such as high infant
mortality rates, low levels of girls' education, and delayed development.  <p>
<p>
The study was conducted in six villages representing the three main ethnic
groups in northern Lao PDR (Lao Loum/Tai Daeng, Khmu and Hmong).  It was
carried out by a 7-person team who stayed in each village for 5-6 days and used
techniques of Participatory Rural Appraisal to learn from and with villagers
about issues and practices that impact on the lives of young children.<p>
<p>
Many different aspects of childcare and childrearing practices were covered --
including traditional maternal and child care practices, attitudes and behavior
of parents towards raising children, traditional play and toys for children,
and other issues impacting on child development and survival.<p>
<p>
Many positive factors were present, such as the presence of voluntary childcare
providers (grandparents and other relatives), positive attitudes and spiritual
beliefs towards children, availability of good traditional toys and play,
strong self-help skills among children, a reliance on breastfeeding and a good
availability on traditional medicines and knowledge, and strong traditions of
mutual support and cooperation within the villages. <p>
<p>
There are also areas for concern. These include inappropriate traditional
knowledge and practices and a lack of knowledge about essential child care and
development concepts.  There are low overall levels of knowledge of child
development, especially in terms of cognition and physical growth, a lack of
knowledge about proper nutrition and supplementary feeding, and traditional
attitudes of preference for male children that result in girls losing the
opportunity to attend school beyond very low levels.<p>
<p>
The very difficult economic situation in some villages and families also
severely impacts on child welfare by limiting the parent's available time (due
to labor requirements), inadequate food in some cases, and a lack of access to
outside health care and education services. The situation for children varies
widely among the three ethnic groups included in the study. Khmu children are
in an especially precarious situation which deserves special attention.<p>
<p>
Based on the findings of the study, the team recommends that UNICEF and the Lao
Women's Union make Early Child and Family Development (ECFD) an integral
component of the Women's Development programme and that other agencies
implementing village development projects in Lao PDR also consider similar
initiatives. It is argued that ECFD is a strategy for working with children,
their caregivers and the whole family and that it should be implemented as part
of wider rural development activities that address root issues of child
development problems. Further, it should be implemented using a participatory
approach, building on the traditional strengths and knowledge of villagers. <p>
<p>
The report recommends specifically that ECFD activities focus on training and
include: caregiver education, strengthening the system of traditional
home-based childcare, child-to-child activities, integration with wider
development initiatives, and advocacy aimed at policy makers.  <p>
<p>
Since the report was just issued, these recommendations are under
consideration. <p>

1<b>.  Introduction</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	Based on a review of literature dealing with childrearing practices, the
following can be argued:<p>
 Children, in whatever setting, have general physical, social and emotional
needs that require responses from others.<p>
 The specific ways in which these general needs manifest themselves and the
childrearing practices adopted to meet these needs differ widely from place to
place and from caregiver to caregiver,  influenced by physical and social
contexts, by beliefs, values and norms, by available technologies, and by the
characteristics and knowledge of particular caregivers.<p>
 In a rapidly changing world, it is difficult for cultures to adjust their
norms and practices to fluctuating conditions.  This results, more frequently
than in the past, in beliefs, values, norms and practices that do not fit well
with actual conditions.  These can work against the sound rearing and
development of children.<p>
 Rapid change has produced both a move away from so-

called
traditional and family-

centered
practices and toward placing greater responsibility for childrearing in
institutional settings outside the family.  As these trends and specific
changes in practices associated with them are judged, it is  important not to
equate "modern" with "good" and "traditional" with "outmoded" or "bad," or vice
versa.  Rather, if we are to retain the good practices from traditional systems
and to develop quality child care in response to the major changes thrust upon
us by industrialization and so-

called
modernization, we will need to be much more systematic in our assessments and
much more open to potential advantages of both the new and the old than we have
been in the past.  <p>
        Before entering directly into the review that substantiates this line
of argument, and in a desire to avoid perpetuating stereotypes or promoting
outmoded concepts, it is important to clarify three points.  First, although
the childrearing topic is set here within the general theme of "marriage and
family," it is important to recognize that a great deal of childrearing has
always occurred outside the home and family in both formal and informal
arrangements.  It is common, for instance, for the larger community of which
families are a part to play a significant role in raising children. (Ki-

Zerbo,
1990)   This is not only the case for so-

called
" traditional" cultures but is increasingly common today as more and more
children are being cared for during long periods of the day in specialized
centers that are not family-

run
and have nothing to do with marriage ties. (Olmsted and Weikart, 1994)   In
brief, while marital and family status certainly affect childrearing (and
sometimes vice versa), so do many other factors.   Thus, to consider
childrearing only within the context of marriage and the family would be to
limit both description<p>
and understanding of the process. <p>
        Second, because marriage and family activities tend to be associated
with the<i> reproductive</i> role of women in society, it is important to
stress that childrearing is an economically <i>productive</i> activity as
well.<b>[1]</b>   Ironically, when "childrearing" is
redefined as "child care" because it occurs outside the home and/or is paid, it
is recognized as an economically productive activity and is  included in
national accounts.  However, when childrearing occurs in the home and is
unpaid, it is not.  But whether or not children are raised primarily in the
home and whether or not a caregiver is paid, childrearing constitutes a
productive as well as reproductive activity because it affects the ability of a
child to make a productive contribution to the family and increases the child's
chance of becoming productive in later life.  Those who are involved in rearing
children are performing a service to society that has economic as well as
social value. Today's children are tomorrow's citizens and workers who will
determine the general course of society.  <p>
        Third, childrearing is not, nor should it be seen as, an activity
restricted to women.<b>[2]</b>  A growing literature
shows fathering as well as mothering is important to the childrearing process
(Engle, 1994, Lamb,1987),  and that the absence of fathers can leave important
areas of a child's development unattended. (Zoller Booth, 1995)   We will
return to this point when discussing who participates in childrearing.  <p>
        Having cautioned the reader against a narrow and stereotyped view of
childrearing as a reproductive role to be carried out exclusively by women in
the context of the family, we will now proceed to discuss childrearing, what it
means, who it involves, how it is changing, and what is required in terms of
programming and policies to provide a healthy environment for all children.<p>
<p>
<b>2.  The Childrearing Process</b><b>[3]</b><p>
       <b> 2.1.  An Overview.</b>  Childrearing, or the process of bringing up
children, can be described in terms of practices and activities that reflect a
society's response to the survival and developmental needs of both children and
the society.  Individual practices are influenced by cultural norms or patterns
that have evolved over time and which, in turn, are grounded in cultural
beliefs and values. They are influenced by the physical, social and economic
context as well as by the types of  technology available to and associated with
childrearing.  The choice among possible childrearing practices, the manner in
which they are carried out, and the results seen in children will also depend
on the character and knowledge of the individual(s) who are responsible for
childrearing. <b>[4]</b> To understand the process of
childrearing, then, it is necessary to understand:<p>
 the basic needs of children and the general practices required to meet them;<p>
 who is responsible for childrearing; <p>
 differences among, and changes in physical, social, economic and technological
characteristics of the environments in which childrearing occur;<p>
 the cultural beliefs, values and norms that have grown up to guide and ground
choices among the available options in the form and content of childrearing,
and changes in them.<p>
It is necessary also to identify how these various dimensions of childrearing
are interwoven and how changes in any one dimension can produce changes in
others, sometimes to the benefit and sometimes to the detriment of the child,
the family, or the culture.<p>
        <b>2.2.  Children's Needs and Common General Practices.</b> Children
everywhere have certain basic needs that must be met if they are to survive,
grow and develop.  For this reason it is possible to specify general areas of
childrearing practices that will be common to all societies.  For example:<p>
 In order to meet needs that will guarantee the child's physical well-

being,
childrearing must  include provision of proper attention to mothers during
pregnancy and at birth, provision for the child of an adequate environment for
sleeping, protection from harm, provision of shelter and clothing, feeding,
bathing, provision of safe places to play and explore, and prevention of and
attention to illness.<p>
 In order to promote the child's psycho-

social
well-

being,
childrearing must include affection and nurturing activities that allow a child
to form attachments, to develop emotional security, to develop a sense of
mastery and confidence, and to seek some independence.<p>
 In order to promote the child's mental development, childrearing must include
interaction,   stimulation (things to look at, touch, hear, smell, and taste),
opportunities to explore the world, appropriate language stimulation, and
play.<p>
 In order to facilitate the child's social development, childrearing must
provide opportunities to acquire values, exposure to the wisdom of the culture,
and the chance to practice socially-


and culturally-

related
skills.  In most cultures this will include opportunities to learn to cooperate
and to share by participating in group activities with members of the family
and community.  <p>
        Although these four general areas have been separated conceptually, in
practice, they come<p>
together.  Attention to a mother during pregnancy affects mental and social
development as well as physical development.  Providing affection and nurturing
influences physical as well as psycho-

social
development. (Lester and Brazelton, 1982; Zeitlin, Ghassemi and Mansour,
1990)<p>
        <b>2.3.  Specific Practices. </b> At a very general level, children's
needs are similar across all cultures and will require common areas of
activity, as indicated above.  But the specific ways in which these needs are
manifested and the specific practices developed to meet these needs will vary
widely from place to place.  Contrasting examples of specific practices could
be provided for each one of the general categories and areas of activity
mentioned above, but with space limitations, we focus on practices in two
areas, <i>feeding </i>and<i> protecting from harm,</i> in order to illustrate
variation.<p>
        Feeding is a common practice to all cultures, but the age-

old
practice of breastfeeding contrasts with the recent practice of bottle-

feeding.
 Feeding on demand, which is still characteristic of most rural cultures,
contrasts with the scheduled feeding brought on by adjustments to city life.
Active feeding contrasts (favorably, according to Zeitlin, et al., n.d. ) with
letting young children feed as they wish or with "bottle-

propping"
(allowing an infant to hold a bottle by herself ), shown to be a prevalent and
detrimental practice followed, for instance, among  low-

income
urban Mexican women.  (Perez-

Excamilla,
et al.,1993)   Weaning at three months, or nine, contrasts with weaning at two
years.  <p>
	The practice of protecting a child from harm occurs in many cultures through
constant carrying, either by parents or by siblings or others who help mothers
(Hewlett, 1987; Tronick, Winn and Morelli, 1990; Paolisso, Baksh and Thomas,
1989).  In other cultures, children are placed in a crib, cradle, hammock or
playpen for long periods of time. (Kotchabhakdi, 1987)<p>
        As we discuss the various dimensions that influence childrearing and as
we look at changes along these dimensions, we will return to these examples.<p>
    <p>
<b>3.  Who Cares for Children?</b><p>
        The activities chosen to meet children's needs are dependent in part on
who cares for the child, which, in turn, is influenced by context, cultural
beliefs and by the realities of daily life.  The<p>
selection (or assignment by circumstance) of the person (or people) who take
responsibility for raising a child is important because people differ with
respect to their knowledge about childrearing, their experience, and their
beliefs and their level of self-

confidence.
 These differences will affect the choice of practices and affect the
development of children.<p>
        As indicated at the outset, childrearing does not always fall to
parents and may occur outside the circle of immediate family members.  In
Zambia, for instance, a study which included an extremely diverse sample from
throughout the country found that 16 percent of the children were being cared
for by someone other than their own parents. (Chibuye, Mwenda and Osborne,
1986) Still, in most societies and in most cases, the family, however defined,
remains the primary unit given responsibility for raising children.  Notable
exceptions to this pattern include the collectivized childrearing of Israeli
Kibbutzim or Chinese communes.  And, although legal and social responsibility
may remain with the immediate family, in some cultures it has always been
common to assign responsibility for daily childrearing activities to non-

family
members -

-

wet nurses, servants, or neighbors, for instance.  In a sense, the growth of
childcare centers has formalized what were previously informal patterns of
childrearing outside the home.   Because non-

family
individuals sometimes bring to the childrearing task a very different knowledge
base, set of beliefs and cultural background than those of family members,
their practices can be very different from those that are, or would be, applied
by family members.  These discontinuities can foster cultural disruption or can
help to integrate children into changing cultures, or both, depending on the
particular circumstances. <p>
        Even when childrearing is held closely within the family, there is
considerable variation in who takes responsibility for childrearing, depending
in part on who is present in the family, but also on cultural norms for
assigning childrearing roles, on the degree to which other family
responsibilities compete with childrearing given the particular economic and
social conditions in which the family lives, and on the psychological make-

up
of the available caregivers.  Only rarely is childrearing assigned exclusively
to the mother, although that may be the case during the first months of life.
In parts of Andean Peru, for instance, a child is considered to be part of the
mother until it is baptized -

-

usually during the first weeks after birth. During that period, the mother
provides exclusive care.  Until weaning, others may only be allowed to see or
talk to the baby for brief periods, but even then they are not to be effusive.
(Ortiz &amp; Souffez, 1989)<p>
        In many cultures, grandmothers or mothers-

in-
law
play a major role in upbringing (e.g., in Nepal -

Acharya
and Bennett , 1982; in Mexico's Yucatan -


Howrigan, 1984).  This is particularly true for the first child. The mother is
not yet considered capable of providing proper upbringing on her own.  This
arrangement provides informal parental education.  But care by grandmothers or
mothers-

in-
laws
is also linked to maintaining kinship ties and power relationships within the
broader family and society, and to the necessity for young women to work while
older women are available to provide child care.  It may even be linked to a
sense of obligation to grandparents to whom a child is "fostered". (Dare and
Adejomo, 1983)<p>
        Siblings have played an important role in upbringing (Werner, 1983;
Weisner and Gallimore, 1977; Whiting and Whiting, 1967), particularly when
mothers must farm or work outside the home (e.g., in Malawi, Kalemba, 1993).
In some cases, the necessity of placing major responsibility on siblings has
been shown to have a negative effect on a young child's welfare  Shah, Walimbe
and Dhole (1979) report such an effect for rural Maharastra in India.  In other
instances the presence of older siblings to help out is seen as an important
aid to child development and/or as a deterrent to illness. Paolisso, Baksh and
Thomas (1989) describe<p>
increased diarrhea among young children during periods when siblings must be in
school and are not available for caring.<p>
        The role that fathers play in childrearing differs across cultures.<a
href="women2_fn.html#fn3">[5]</a>  At one extreme, one can cite the increase in
male one-

parent
families in the United States or the case of  fathers in the Aka group of
pygmies in West Africa who have been observed to spend as much as 20 percent of
their time holding and interacting with their infant children. (Hewlett, 1987)
At the other extreme are cases in which a high percentage of fathers are absent
from the home during most of the pre-

school
life of a child, either because they have migrated to work -- as in rural
Swaziland  (Zoller Booth, 1995) or in rural Ecuador (Roloff, Nunez and
Vasconez, 1995) -- or because of an increasing divorce rate.<p>
        Even when fathers are present in nuclear or extended family
arrangements, however, it is common to find that "fathers and under-

five
children have very rare contacts..." (Kalemba, 1993, p. 26.)    This statement
is borne out by such diverse sources as an 11-

country
study of 4-

year
olds which showed fathers in all countries averaged less than one hour per day
alone with the child, vs. more than five hours for mothers (Olmsted and
Weikart, 1994),<b>[6]</b> by a study of Indian
families which concluded that "... the Indian father has abrogated his
responsibility of parenting" (Anadalakshmy, 1994, p. 66), and by a study of Lao
childrearing practices revealing that fathers do not get involved in any child
care until the child is 3 to 4 years of age.  (Phanjaruniti, 1994)  When
fathers are present, it is common for them to be assigned the role of
disciplinarian and to serve as a role model for their sons as they approach and
enter school age.  (Evans, 1994) Fathers also influence the childrearing
process indirectly by assuming (or not) the role of economic provider and by
providing (or not) emotional support to mothers.<p>
        Research, mostly carried out in the North, suggests that when fathers
are a significant part of a child's life from birth, the children score higher
on intelligence tests and do better in school than<p>
children whose fathers are less involved.  (Engle and Breaux, 1994)  This
result must, however, be treated with care because it may be more the presence
of  "another person" than presence of a "father" that produces the effect.
According to Lamb (1987), level and type of a father's involvement seem to be
more important in determining positive effects on child development than the
amount of time that a father spends interacting directly with the child.
Further, that involvement seems to be determined not only by the time available
to fathers outside their work routines, but also by their motivation
(influenced in part by norms related to masculinity), by levels of confidence
related to knowledge and skills (often low because fathers do not have<p>
prior experience or time alone with young children), and by the degree of
support provided within the family.  (In a majority of families, women do not
want husbands to be more involved in childrearing because it further undercuts
their own status.)  The results of studies of father absence vary from "no
effects" to detrimental effects, related variously to length of absence, to the
age of children at absence, to whether or not economic support continues during
absence, to the degree of extended family support provided, and to cultural
limitations on women as they try to fill the gap left by absence.<p>

<b>4.  The Influence of Environmental on Childrearing Practices  </b><p>
        The wide variation in the physical, social, economic and cultural
settings in which childrearing occurs will obviously have a major influence on
who brings up children and on the practices they follow.<p>
       <b> 4.1. The Physical Environment.</b>  The climate and geography of an
area will help to define both children's specific needs and the practices
adopted to meet those needs.  In a review of literature on this subject, John
Whiting (1981) states that ". . . the manner in which infants are cared for
during their waking and sleeping hours is to a considerable extent constrained
by the physical environment, the temperature of the coldest month of the year
being the most important factor."  He also concludes that there is not
sufficient evidence to indicate whether or not these variations in methods of
infant care have any enduring effects.<p>
        Continuing the focus on feeding and protection, consider the following
contrasting examples of how specific childrearing practices and techniques used
must be adapted to varied physical settings, even though the needs they are
designed to meet and the ends they serve are similar across them.  Both an
Eskimo(Canada) and Yoruba (Nigeria) mother may carry their babies and
breastfeed on demand.  But for the Eskimo mother to do so requires wearing a
heavy, warm, very large and loose garment that allows the baby to be carried on
her back and swung around, inside the garment, at the time of feeding.  A hood
on the garment channels air to the baby while it is on the mother's back at the
same time that it helps to keep the mother and baby warm.  The Yoruba mother,
faced with a tropical climate, needs only to sling the baby on her back, open
to the elements.  In both cases, the baby is in direct touch with the mother.
In the Eskimo case, however, the baby cannot benefit from the sight of other
people and of the world in general  while being carried.  Other means are
required for providing that kind of stimulation and social interaction.<p>
       <b> 4.2.  The Social and Economic Environment.</b>  The physical
environment helps to determine settlement patterns which will also affect
childrearing choices and patterns.   The conditions for childrearing in a
nomadic society differ from those in a settled society.  And among those who
are settled, conditions for those who live in dispersed settlements will differ
dramatically from those who live in concentrated areas.  Further, small
concentrations in rural towns provide different conditions from large
concentrations in major cities.<p>
        Childrearing practices will also be influenced by variations in forms
of economic livelihood and the division of labor.  In some societies, when both
parents directly share work obligations, as among the Aka (cited above) it
improves the possibility that both will share childrearing tasks.   However,
this sharing of childrearing tasks is not usually the case.  Studies from
Jamaica, India and the United States (cited in Engle and Breaux, 1994),
indicate that when a woman works outside the home this usually does not relieve
her of childrearing responsibility nor lead to greater involvement in
childrearing by men.  Particularly in urban areas, when women work outside the
home, the demand for and use of institutional care increases.<p>
        Practices are also influenced by social organization at the level of
family, community and larger society.   Factors such as: divisions by caste and
class; whether a culture is patrilineal or<p>
matrilineal; the social definition of men's and women's roles; the degree of
solidarity and hierarchy in communities; family size and composition; and
organization into extended, polygamous, nuclear or single-

parent
families all have an effect on childrearing.  For instance, extended and
polygamous families, in which the kinship groupings are large, patterned and
complicated will provide a wider range of potential caregivers than either a
nuclear or a single-

parent
family where there is isolation from other kin.  At the same time, polygamy can
bring jealousies among women and conditions which negatively affect
childrearing practices (Akinware and Ojomo, 1993, p. 30), and in-

laws
are not always supportive.  (Sempebwa Nagawa, 1994)<p>
<p>
<b>5.  Beliefs and Values, Norms and Practices</b><p>
        Beliefs help to rationalize, justify and explain particular practices
that have grown up over the ages or that are carried out by individuals.
Beliefs merge with values in helping to give meaning to practices by defining
the kind of child (and adult) a particular society seeks to produce.  Beliefs
and values also provide the backdrop against which cultural norms are
established, representing how particular cultures define the way in which their
children should be reared.<p>
      <b>  5.1  Beliefs, Values and Childrearing Goals. </b> Cultures are
guided, and distinguished by, their beliefs about what happens both in this
world and in an after life.  These beliefs may arise from long and practical
experience in particular conditions that daily life presents or they may
represent attempts to deal with the unknown (e.g. a belief in the power of the
evil eye).  <p>
        In Ethiopia, for instance, a belief, derived from concrete experience,
that a baby should be small at birth, has persisted in rural areas .
Accordingly, food taboos keeping weight increases down during pregnancy
commonly lead to the birth of what the World Health Organization would define
as "low birthweight" babies.  The origin of this apparently irrational belief
lies in the fact that at one stage rickets was prevalent among teenage girls in
Ethiopia, affecting pelvic growth and making it dangerous to give birth to a
large child.    With a change in conditions, however, the belief, originally
well-

grounded,
and related to a value placed on the life of the mother so that another child
could be born, had not changed as recently as the late 1980s.  (Negussie, 1988)
 The belief and the associated practice persists despite the fact that low
birthweight babies tend to be low in their level of activity and attentiveness,
and are relatively irritable (Brazelton, 1982), and despite a demonstrated
relationship to infant mortality and to delayed or debilitated development.  <p>
        In a less tangible vein, newborns are considered to have different
relationships to the spirit<p>
world.  In many cultures a newborn is considered to be a gift from god. (Evans,
1995)  This means that children are to be treated with the utmost respect and
indulgence in the early years.  "The newborn are treated as celestial creatures
entering a more humdrum existence and, at the moment of birth, are addressed
with high sounding honorific phrases for gods, the souls of ancestors, princes
and people of a higher caste ." (Mead, 1955, Bali, Indonesia)  By way of
contrast, in Northeast Thailand,  "Newborn infants are usually wrapped and
placed in a basket lined with a blanket, close to the mother for a few days.
Parents, relatives and neighbors usually do not openly express their enjoyment
or admiration of the baby for fear that the spirits might take the baby away.
Relatives usually say aloud, 'What an ugly baby he is,' in order to deceive the
spirit". (Kotchabhakdi, 1987)   In societies in which a high level of infant
mortality was, or<p>
is, common, beliefs have arisen that help to explain and accept a young child's
death.  For instance, the newborn is believed to remain in a pure state for
some period.  If the child dies during the early period, it returns to the
spirit world, having avoided the trials and tribulations of a temporary stay on
earth. (Scheper-

Hughes,
1985)  When children are looked upon as a human creation and responsibility is
assigned to people, "letting go" is more difficult.<p>
        Most cultures have a set of beliefs about how children develop
physically, mentally and socially.  In some cultures a child is believed to be
fragile, in others the child is perceived to be hardy. Therefore, handling
practices differ.  In some, children are believed capable of learning in their
early years, but not of being taught.  This affects the practice of direct
instruction, as contrasted with learning by observation and imitation.  In some
it is believed necessary to take an active role in helping a child learn to sit
and walk; in others this is not seen as necessary. (Evans and Myers, 1994)<p>
        Beliefs merge with values to define the kind of child (and adult) a
particular society seeks to<p>
produce. Some cultures want children to be obedient, others foster a
questioning child.  Some tolerate aggressiveness; others value a quiet
submissive child.  Some strengthen individualism, others have a collective
orientation and promote strong social responsibility.  As an example, a study
of Thai ways of childrearing (Sumon Amornvivat, et al., 1989) identified the
following key values: obedience and respect for seniority; diligence and
responsibility; being economical; generosity; honesty; gratitude; and self-

reliance.<p>
       <b> 5.2.  Cultural Norms.</b>  Derived from experience, tied to beliefs
and values, and influencing the choice of how to respond to children's needs
are cultural norms or patterns.  These represent the generally-

accepted
styles and types of care expected of caregivers in responding to the needs of
children in their early months and years.  Normative patterns represent a
culture's way of trying to assure behaviors that will maximize the survival,
maintenance and development of the group or culture as well as of the child.
Norms apply to behaviors expected at various points in a child's life.  For
example, societies differ in expectations for parental and community behavior
with respect to such activities as birthing practices, how a child should be
named, how an infant's death is handled, when to stop breastfeeding, what games
to play, how a child should be punished, etc.<p>
        As a perverse example of how beliefs, values and norms may operate, we
refer to a study of an Ecuadorian community where a belief that women should
not be aggressive and where value was placed on women's submissiveness led to
differential norms guiding the length that boys and girls should be breastfed.
Girls were weaned earlier than boys.  This had an impact on differential growth
and development.  The shorter time to weaning for girls was related to a higher
mortality rate for girls prior to age five.  (McKee,1980).  <p>
	To balance this example, one could point to many norms, embodied in
traditional wisdom,  that seem to have a salutary effect on the survival and
development of young children.  For instance, a norm that young children should
participate at an early age in work and ritual activity (as well as play and
formal education) has many positive consequences.  It provides learning that
occurs in context and in naturally occurring sequences.  Children are required
to take on tasks that are increasingly complex and they are provided with
direct and repeated monitoring.  This process builds confidence and competence
and inculcates social responsibility.  (UNESCO, 1988)<p>
        While general agreement about what should be done in bringing up
children may exist for the culture as a whole, these norms may or may not be
followed by individuals who are affected also by their particular circumstances
and who bring different beliefs and knowledge to the task. Sometimes within a
culture deviation from the norm leads to ostracism.  In other instances, there
is considerable latitude in terms of adherence to cultural patterns.  In times
of rapid change, norms often blur and they are hard to define. <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>6. Changes in Childrearing</b><p>
<b>	6.1. Changes in the Environment.</b>  Perhaps more important than the fact
that contexts within which childrearing occurs are different is the fact that
contexts are changing continuously, sometimes slowly and almost imperceptively,
allowing adjustments to occur along the way, sometimes rapidly and with
potentially disastrous consequences because adjustment is difficult.  A
historical view helps one to understand the impact of changing contexts on
childrearing practices.  For instance, in the Western World, important changes
in childrearing practices and patterns can be seen accompanying the Industrial
Revolution in the 18th Century.  In the predominantly agricultural and rural
society that preceded industrialization, children were usually found within an
intact, extended family.  These children were socialized to a relatively
limited and unchanging world with agreed upon community values.  The rural
setting provided space to explore and a stimulating environment.  The
responsibility for childrearing lay clearly with women whose work usually
permitted them to breastfeed and to attend directly to the child in the early
years.  Families were often large and older children were expected to help with
childcare tasks.  Indeed, children quickly entered an adult world and, in a
sense, did not have a separate <i>childhood </i>as they do today.  (Aries,
1962)<p>
        The rural conditions of the 18th and 19th centuries in the West, and in
most parts of the developing world of today, should not be romanticized.  Life
was demanding and survival was continually threatened by disease, and
occasionally by lack of food.  But for those rural children who managed to
survive their early months, their<i> development</i> was less problematic than
it would be for many of their peers in new urban environments.  The
childrearing practices evolved over the years were suited to socialization in a
rural environment; they were not suited to cities.<p>
        With industrialization and migration to the cities came changes in
values, in living conditions, in family arrangements and in working patterns.
The new conditions brought with them both a need to care for children of
working mothers and a need to provide adequate stimulation for children within
a restricted physical environment.  They called for new parenting skills and a
different kind of socialization process. The older forms of child care and
development were not always adequate guides for those living in these
dramatically different contexts.<p>
        There is a striking parallel between the changes in values, living
patterns, family structure, and work associated with the industrial revolution,
and the changes occurring today in the rapidly urbanizing and sometimes
industrializing nations of the so-

called
Third World.  These shifts have affected childrearing.  In addition,
childrearing is being affected by population growth and changes in fertility
patterns, in economic policies, geopolitical shifts, and the changes in
technology that have occurred over the last 35 years.   While population growth
and the related pressure on land has helped to fuel migration to cities,
exacerbating the changes noted above, declining fertility in recent years has
meant smaller families, which means there are fewer children to care for, but
also fewer siblings to help with childrearing.  A declining infant and child
mortality rate means that more attention needs to be paid to strategies of
childrearing geared to improving child development rather than focussing on
child survival.  This basic shift in outlook does not come easily.<p>
        Economic shifts, including the longer term trends toward inclusion of
all people in a monetary economy, toward cash cropping and toward
industrialization, and the more recent changes associated with neo-

liberal
adjustment policies, have had profound effects on the form and content of
childrearing.  Economic adjustments in many countries, focussing on
stabilization and production, have been accompanied by increases in
unemployment, reductions in social expenditures, and the need for poorer
families to turn toward self-

generated
employment in the informal sector, either as a supplement to formal sector
earnings or as their sole source of support.  These policies have helped to
continue the trends toward a greater presence of<p>
women in the paid labor force, changing occupational distributions within
households, and the growth of female-

headed
households.  While women have entered the labor force in greater numbers, they
have often done so in informal sector jobs that are too frequently insecure,
require long hours of work, and carry with them no social benefits.  These
trends have posed painful dilemmas for women with childrearing
responsibilities. They can lead to leaving children alone for longer or shorter
periods of the day.  (e.g., Acevedo, et al., 1986)<p>
        Over the last two decades, the global cold war has given way to local
hot wars and conflicts among and within nations.  As a result, the displacement
of families has become a problem of major proportions.  An important part of
that problem centers on how to rear children under such conditions. <p>
        Technology has brought new dimensions to everyone's lives. A
communications revolution has helped to create the <i>global village.</i>
Transistor radios now reach into most corners of the world, and even television
is reaching rural areas to a degree not thought possible 25 years ago.  The
educational revolution, with its emphasis on literacy and schooling has
dramatically altered socialization patterns and defined new childrearing needs.
For instance, participation in schooling requires much greater emphasis on
cognitive skills related to abstract reasoning.  The arrival, perhaps
intrusion, of schools into rural areas has brought competition with indigenous
educational forms.  And schooling competes with domestic work that has been
such a central part of children's lives over the centuries.  Technology has
also affected childrearing by making available such products as bottles and
cribs and plastic toys.<p>
        Transportation and organizational revolutions have occurred as well.
Buses not only help rural people visit cities and migrate to them; they also
aid periodic or permanent return to villages where new ideas and modes of
behavior can be displayed.  Communication and transportation revolutions have
facilitated the outreach of business and governmental organizations to
villages.  There is, then, not only a shift to the city with accompanying
changes, but also a reach of the city into rural areas.  With this urban
influence bottle-

feeding
has arrived to compete with breast-

feeding
and plastic toys have arrived to compete with home-

made
toys. There is a changing sense of <i>community,</i> and confusion about
responsibilities and loyalties.  The changes bring uncertainty about old values
and ways of doing things, including rearing children.  The implication of all
of this is that even children who remain in rural areas increasingly live
simultaneously in national and global cultures, but they are rooted in a local
culture sometimes unsure about its own roots and directions.  This leads us to
a discussion of beliefs, values and norms.<p>
      <b>  6.2.  Changes in Beliefs, Values and Norms. </b>  With changes in
the environment come changes in beliefs, values and norms, all of which evolve
as the contexts and specific needs of people change.  When societies were more
or less isolated from one another and there<p>
were few outside influences, what one generation passed on was similar to the
way the next generation raised its children and there was relative stability of
values, beliefs and norms.  Changes could be incorporated without losing the
traditional. (LeVine, 1977)  However, few cultures have remained relatively
isolated and intact.  As suggested above, most are vulnerable to outside
influences -

-

schools, mass media, missionaries, returned migrants -

-

that challenge established beliefs, values and norms.  The juxtaposition of the
old and the new can leave cultures disorganized and groups of people at a loss
in terms of their values and beliefs.  In the jargon of present-

day
psychology, these cultures might be classified as "dysfunctional".  They cannot
define norms and no longer provide children with the grounding, stability, and
vision that was found within traditional belief systems. <p>
        In the struggle for identity and in the desire to be modern some
cultures have completely cast off their traditions, or think they have. Yet
both rural and urban, or indigenous and industrialized cultures are recognizing
that adopting "modern" ways does not always offer the best means of providing
what is desirable for children to grow and develop.  As a result, people are
seeking to identify and recapture traditional values.  There is an increasing
awareness that much of what existed within traditional cultures was positive
and supportive of growth and development, for the individual and for the
society.  Likewise some traditional beliefs and practices that may have had a
logical origin, are recognized today as harmful to a person's health and well-

being
(the Ethiopian example given above) and are being changed.<p>
       <b> 6.3.  Changes in Childrearing Practices.</b>   As noted, the general
needs of children do not change.  For children to survive, grow and develop
they still need to be nourished, to avoid disease and accidents, to be
nurtured, and to learn the ways of the world.  But, against the background
presented of changing environments, and changing beliefs, values and norms, it
is clear that childrearing practices must change and are changing.  This is
true for rural families who are asked to assimilate new ways but resist changes
that may indeed be necessary for their children to function in the transitional
world, or multiple worlds, that surround them. It is true for young single-

parent
mothers who draw upon their memory of how they were brought up even<p>
though conditions have changed drastically. It is true for those who migrate to
cities.  They need to make adjustments to a new environment.  For instance, to
protect a child in an urban setting it may be necessary to keep the child
indoors a large part of the time.  If a child must be indoors in a confined
space rather than in the open countryside, new ways of stimulating the child
must be created.  If a family cannot grow its own crops, it must rely on what
is available in a market. Thus feeding practices change.  If a mother must work
and cannot take the child along, breastfeeding may not be possible.  If a child
is now expected to do well in school rather than do well tending animals, there
is a need to be socialized to new ways.<p>
          In general, childrearing practices change slowly, despite pressures
for change and despite<p>
increasing access to information that supports alternative practices.  However,
as new demands are made on families, changes do occur and in that process,
sound and solid practices that worked well previously may be set aside.  These
include such practices as breastfeeding, massage, carrying, story-

telling.
These are now being replaced by new practices such as bottle feeding, bathing
in a bathtub, putting children in playpens and watching television.   <p>
	Childrearing practices do not stand alone.  In general it is possible to
identify a cluster of childrearing practices. This cluster is created as a
result of the interrelatedness of children's developmental needs, environmental
conditions, and the fact that practical choices made to satisfy one need may
limit what it is possible to do to satisfy another.  For instance, the choice
of breastfeeding on demand requires a kind of physical proximity to the mother
at all times that scheduled bottle-

feeding
does not.  That requirement affects carrying and sleeping practices.  The
physical closeness of mother to child also permits, or reinforces, a kind of
nurturing that is different from that employed when there is greater physical
separation. <p>
        Figure 1 provides a rough approximation of two very distinct clusters
of practices. Cluster 1 presents childrearing practices associated with a
socially mobile, industrialized, and developmentally-

oriented
world dominated by technological change. Cluster 2 presents childrearing
practices generally associated with a socially stable but survival-

oriented
world dominated by tradition.  <p>

     <b>   6.4.  Changes in Who Cares for the Child. </b>   We have noted that
with the decrease in the number of extended families, the childrearing role of
grandparents and in-

laws
and near relatives is diminishing.   We have noted that changes in context and
family structures, more often than in the past, lead to the absence of fathers.
In addition, both the need for children to attend school and the tendency
toward smaller families make it less feasible for siblings to participate in
childcare in a major way.  Moreover, in urban areas the sense of community is
often very weak and neighbors are often unfamiliar people.  Leaving children
with the neighbor becomes more difficult and the traditional tendency for
childrearing to be a responsibility of all community members is lost.<p>
        A result of the above shifts is that women, who are under more pressure
to work outside the home, but who, in most cultures, continue to be assigned
the responsibility for childrearing, have fewer options than before for help
with the childrearing task.   It is not surprising, then, that the demand for
institutionalized forms of childcare should be increasing in most parts of the
world and that a major share of childrearing is being assigned to non-

family
members working in non-

family
 institutions.   One example of  dependence on institutional care outside the
home comes from Belgium where a recent study found that 4-

year
old children spent more of their waking hours with "other caregivers" in child
care centers than they spent alone with their mothers and fathers. (Olmsted and
Weikart, 1995)<p>
        Indeed, institutionalized forms of childcare have grown by leaps and
bounds in the last 25 years.<b>[7]</b> These include
pre-

schools,
creches, centers for integrated attention to the child, nurseries, home day
care, each with its own characteristics as well as name.  Some of these
institutions are<i> formal</i> governmental systems of care, often created as a
worker's benefit.  Others are considered to be <i>non-

formal
</i>in the sense that the people who run the centers are not part of the
government payroll, even though their center may receive some sort of subsidy
from the government.<p>
        A review of literature dealing with women's work and child care (Myers
and Indriso, 1987) suggests that for childcare centers, whether classified as
formal or informal, to be judged adequate by women they should be: affordable,
accessible, flexible (particularly with respect to hours), run by trusted and
accountable persons, and meet minimum quality standards.  Many centers do not
meet such standards.  This helps to explain why it is sometimes possible to
encounter a supply of available places that are unused, but at the same time a
demand for places that is unsatisfied.<p>
<p>
<b>7.  Effects of Institutionalized Child Care on Children </b><p>
        Working women's expectations with respect to the need for adequate
child care arrangements are backed by a literature regarding the actual and
potential effects of institutionalized care on children.  This literature shows
that, if an institutional setting provides a warm, loving, safe place, child
care outside the home can provide children with the types of experiences that
foster healthy growth and development. (Evans &amp; Shah, 1993)  This is
particularly so if previously they were reared exclusively in a home
environment that did not provide these conditions.  If, however, centers are
custodial places of poor quality, children may suffer developmentally and be
worse off than peers who are cared for at home.  (Kagitcibasi, in press)   Thus
the quality of a child's experiences in the child care setting and at home<p>
is more important than whether or not the child is involved in programs of care
outside the home.<p>
        There is some evidence that various kinds of programs of child care
and/or pre-

schooling
can be of particular benefit to children from impoverished or socially-

disadvantaged
homes and for girls living in conditions that put them at a disadvantage.  Such
children will be more likely to attend school and perform well than their peers
who have not had a similar opportunity.  They will also be less likely to
repeat or leave school early.  (Myers, 1992)  In the best of circumstances, one
might expect that quality programs of early education will lead to social and
economic benefits for the participating individual and society.  (Schweinhart,
et al., 1993)<p>
<p>
<b>8.   Implications for Policy and Programming</b><p>
        It is clear that the balance of responsibility for childrearing is
shifting.  Institutionalized<p>
forms of child care are becoming more prominent and family responsibility is
being reduced.  This has been true for many decades as government-

run
institutions called schools have taken over the educational function beginning
at about age six.  The shift to government responsibility for young children is
now occurring for children during their preschool years and all signs point to
this trend continuing.<p>
        As the care for young children continues to shift to preschools,
creches, home daycare centers and other institutions, often under the auspices
of the State, it is important to be sure that a process is in place that will
provide for the development of the best possible childrearing practices.  To do
this there are several steps in the process. These include an examination of
the situation and action from the micro (child) to the macro (political) level.
 <p>
        <b>8.1.  Assess the Situation for Children.</b> It is important to
assess children's needs in a given<p>
context  Are the children living in a relatively stable environment or is their
world shifting on a daily basis?  Do they have adequate nutrition? Are there
gender differences in the way children are cared for?  <p>
       <b> 8.2.  Current Child Care</b>.  It is important to understand the
current child care situation. Who is caring for the children? Has there been a
shift in this as a result of recent economic and social changes? Where are
children being cared for and under what conditions?  Are mothers the only ones
caring for children?  To what extent are older siblings involved?  If more and
more girls are attending and remaining in school, what does that mean in terms
of who is caring for the youngest children? <p>
        If children are being left at home alone when mothers are involved in
income-generating activities outside the home, and older siblings are in
school, then alternative child care systems need to be developed.  This might
involve the development of neighborhood daycare where care is provided in the
home of someone nearby.  If a greater number of children require care,  then
perhaps it is appropriate to create a child care center. <p>
     <b>   8.3.  Supports for Caregivers. </b> It is important to understand
the caregiving environment.  What kind of supports do the current caregivers
require? Are these adequate?  One place to begin is to look specifically at the
situation of the caregiver, primarily mothers, in the community.  What supports
do they have and what do they need?  What resources do they have available to
them -

-

human and financial?  What kinds of stress are they under?  What are the
demands on their time?<p>
        <b>8.4. Current Childrearing Practices.</b>  Another place to look is
at the childrearing practices<p>
themselves.  There is a need to make an assessment of whether or not current
childrearing practices are adequate to support the child's growth and
development. What other forms of childrearing are required to meet children's
needs?  <p>
        As socialization for parenthood through experience with younger
siblings and under the strict supervision of parents has diminished (Howrigan,
1984), an ever greater need appears for parental education programs.  Parental
education programs are one vehicle for focussing on the family.  An
understanding of childrearing practices and beliefs can provide the content for
such programs. For example, in Chile, a study of childrearing practices was
integrated into a program designed to educate and empower parents.
(UNICEF,1994)  Data from the study were used to identify specific areas that
should be stressed in the program, and to develop positive parenting modules.<p>
        Parenting education can begin in the late years of primary school or in
secondary school.  Parental education can occur in health centers, in
conjunction with monitoring during pregnancy and lactation.  It can also be
included in literacy courses.  However, it is not only the content that is
important.  It is also critical to be aware of the process used to convey the
information to parents.  If the information builds on strengths parents already
have, the new information will be incorporated much more easily than if parents
feel or are led to believe that they are inadequate. It is best to begin by
asking, what are the local childrearing practices and beliefs that can be built
upon to strengthen childrearing practices?<p>
        <b>8.5.  Child Care Outside the Home.</b>  If alternative forms of
childrearing are required, a question to ask is, what resources are available
within the community to create supports for caregivers and/or alternative child
care?  Are there untapped resources within the community that could be used in
providing better support for children's development? <p>
        It is important for the community to understand the need for a focus on
child care.  Those to be involved in the programme (sponsors, community members
and parents) must come to believe in the importance of childrearing and to
understand the importance of their role in the process.  Further, it can be
argued that since parents are the policy makers in their children's lives,
their involvement in the design and operation of alternative child care options
is critical.  The greater the level of parent and community involvement, the
more likely it is that the program will meet family needs and become an
integral part of community life.  <p>
        In the development of alternative forms of childcare it is
increasingly important to:<p>
 assure programs of quality and avoid sub-

standard
programs for the disadvantaged;<p>
 work against the tendency to expand programs so rapidly that the system cannot
keep up, leading to poor quality programs for the poor;<p>
 see ways to decentralize programs so that a culturally and geographically
appropriate response can be made to demands for institutionalized care and so
that the possibility of real community participation will be increased;<p>
 assure that programs are accessible, affordable, and  flexible; are run by
trusted and accountable persons; and that they meet minimal quality
standards.<p>
       <b> 8.6.  The Development of Economic and Social Programs. </b> Programs
that have a positive impact on children do not necessarily need to have a child
development or parent education focus.  By uplifting the lives of family
members, particularly mothers, and supporting the community, there are indirect
benefits for children. Programs which give women additional income that is at
their disposal have indirectly affected children in that women tend to use
these new resources to benefit children's health and education. (Engle,1994)
Thus a variety of social support system efforts can be put into place to
improve and strengthen the context within which children live.<p>
       <b> 8.7.  The Political Climate.</b>  Beyond the community there is a
need to assess the broader political climate. There are certain pre-

existing
conditions that enhance or hinder the likelihood of success of any effort to
support childrearing.  What is the climate of support for childrearing concerns
within the larger socio-

political
arena?  Political commitment at all levels should include an appropriate
supportive policy, adequate budget allocations, and a willingness to make
structural reforms where necessary. <p>
        One question to ask is, what is required in terms of national policy
and support in order to provide for children's healthy growth and development?
Legal changes are called for in many countries in order to enable working women
to dedicate full time to the care of their children during the first year of
life without fear of losing their jobs or benefits.  Legal provisions that
promote greater participation of men in childrearing are also needed.<p>
        There is an additional need to recognize childrearing and child care as
productive.  On the one hand this means that people (mostly women) who are
entrusted with the care of children in institutions should be properly
compensated.  The tendency to exploit women in childcare positions by paying sub-

standard
wages and by withholding benefits, is directly related to the lingering belief
that a woman's place is in the home and that it is natural for women to care
for children, and anybody can do it.  Therefore it is believed that a woman's
services in helping to rear children should be voluntary.  A step toward
recognition of child care as a productive activity would be to include this
work in national statistics related to economic productivity.<p>
        <p>
        In conclusion, we are at a time of major change in childrearing
beliefs, norms and practices.  If we are to retain the good practices from
traditional systems and to make needed shifts to respond to the major changes
thrust upon us by industrialization and so-

called
modernization, we will need to be much more open than we have been in the past.
We must recognize both the wisdom of experience and the necessity of change.<p>

<b>[1]</b>  Women's activities are often
classified as productive or <i>reproductive</i>.  This classification is
unfortunate in our view because it does not adequately represent the complexity
of women's lives.  Rather than distinguish these two roles, assigning economic
value to one and not to the other, it seems more useful to place women's
activities on a continuum.  At one end of the continuum is work outside the
home that is paid.  This work, normally classified as <i>productive</i>, also
supports<i> reproductive </i>activity.  The next point on the continuum would
be reserved for work that women do at home for which they earn money.  Next
comes support that women provide to other family members who are earning income
(e.g. provision of food to those working outside the home), and production for
family consumption (caring for small agricultural plots).  Toward the other end
of the continuum are such tasks as maintenance of the household (gathering
firewood, collecting water, cooking, etc.) <b>and childcare.</b>  If these
household chores, normally classified as<i> reproductive</i>, were not
performed by women as their duty to the family, they would have to be paid for,
and if women did not care for children this service would also have to be
bought, in which case the services would be classified as <i>productive
</i>activities.<p>

<tt></tt><b>I.  Introduction</b><tt></tt><p>
<i>Among various ethnic groups in Africa...the greatest misfortune that can
befall a man or woman is to be childless.  No matter how rich and successful
the individual may be, life is miserable and unfulfilled without children....
According to a Yoruba folk song, they are considered to be 'clothing and
adornment' for their parents.  Anyone who does not have children has nothing to
cover his shame and nakedness.  </i>

               <p>

<tt></tt>Within countries in Sub-Saharan Africa children are highly valued;
they are a "gift of God".  Children are the perpetuators of the family and
society.  Because of this, it is the responsibility of the community to see
that children are raised appropriately, and it is expected that as they grow
into adulthood they will provide for the older members of the community. This
view of children influences how their needs are met. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Within traditional cultures child rearing practices are based on a
culturally-bound understanding of what children need and what they are expected
to become.  The practices and beliefs surrounding pregnancy, childbirth and
early childhood development are passed on from one generation to another.  When
societies are more or less isolated from one another and outside influences
limited, what one generation passes on is similar to the way the next
generation raises its children and there is a relative stability of values,
practices and beliefs.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In all societies there are traditional rituals and practices
surrounding the death of infants and young children.  There are also belief
systems which explain the etiology of diseases and there are ways of treating
these diseases.  Healers pass on their wisdom from generation to generation and
are able to heal many illnesses.  Traditional birth attendants are trained by
their elders to facilitate the birth process, to assure both the well-being of
the mother and the infant.  They also provide the new mother and family with
support during the infant's early life. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> While some cultures have remained relatively isolated and intact,
there are other cultures which have been more vulnerable to change. This
vulnerability is the result of increased exposure to other ideas, sometimes
through formal education, and increasingly through mass media.  For some
societies the introduction of different ideas has resulted in a relatively easy
incorporation of the new, with maintenance of the traditional.  For others, the
juxtaposition of the traditional and the new, along with economic changes which
have threatened people's survival, have left cultures disorganized and peoples
at a loss in terms of their values and beliefs.  In the jargon of present-day
psychology, these cultures could be classified as 'dysfunctional'.  They no
longer provide children with the grounding, stability, and vision that was
found within traditional belief systems. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In the struggle for identity and in the desire to be "modern", some
have completely cast off their traditions, or think they have. Yet the modern
does not always work for them.  As a result, people are seeking to identify and
recapture traditional values.  There is an increasing awareness that much of
what existed within traditional cultures was positive and supportive of growth
and development, for the individual and for the society.  Likewise there were
practices that today we recognize as harmful to a person's health and
well-being.  It is this search to define and understand the traditional in
relation to what is known today that is the basis of current research and
programmes in many parts of the world.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> The Workshop on Child Rearing Practices and Beliefs in Sub-Saharan
Africa, held in Windhoek, Namibia in October 1993 was a part of that process.
It provided a context within which studies of five different cultural groups
were presented and discussed.  As specific child rearing practices and beliefs
were delineated they were assessed in terms of which were positive supports to
children's growth and development and which were 'out-of-synch' with current
medical knowledge.  The participants then developed guidelines for how this
information could be used in the creation of policies and programmes designed
to provide supports to families as they are raising their children.  <p>
     This document provides a summary of the Workshop. The report begins with a
discussion of the relationship between child rearing practices and children's
development.  The next section includes an overview of the role of the family
and community in supporting children's growth and development.  Then beyond the
family and community there is the wider physical and socio-economic context
that plays a part in determining how children are raised.  The dimensions of
context are defined.   A part of this definition is the extent to which
traditional cultures have remained intact and the degree of modernization being
experienced by the culture.  A continuum from traditional to more modern
practices, with examples of what it means for young children as a culture moves
along the continuum, is presented.  Data from the various studies reported on
at the workshop are then presented. The report concludes with guidelines for
the use of child rearing practices and beliefs as the basis for programme
development. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>II.     The Impact of Child Rearing Practices on Children's Growth and
Development</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Child rearing practices are embedded in a culture and determine, to a
large extent, the behaviours and expectations surrounding a child's birth and
infancy. They also influence childhood, adolescence and the way these children
parent as adults.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Child rearing includes much more than keeping the child safe and free
from harm.  Within the household child rearing practices include activities
connected with providing emotional security and reducing the child's stress;
providing shelter, clothing, feeding, bathing, supervision of the child's
toilet; preventing and attending to illness; nurturing and showing affection,
interaction and stimulation; playing and socializing; protecting from exposure
to pathogens; and providing a relatively safe environment for exploration
(Zeitlin, 1993, Myers, 1992).  A second set of child rearing behaviours
includes the use of resources outside the family, including health clinics,
prenatal care, the use of traditional healers, or members of the extended
family network (Engle, 1992).  All of these behaviours are a part of supporting
the development of young children.<p>
  <p>
     While child rearing practices may be different across cultures, there are
basic needs that all children have and a predictable pattern of development
during the early years that is universal.  Studies from different parts of the
world reveal that young children need adequate nutrition, health and care from
birth onwards.  The lack of these supports during the early years has a
permanent effect on later development.  Not only are there consequences for the
child's physical well-being; in addition, these variables interact with and
have an impact on the child's social and cognitive development.  While these
factors are influenced by the economic and political context within which the
child lives, they are mediated through child rearing practices and beliefs. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> The type of child rearing practices required at a given point in time
depends to a large degree on the child's developmental age and the health and
nutritional risks the child is facing. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Influences on the child during the prenatal period and into the first
few months of life include the mother's pre-pregnancy health and how much
weight she gains during pregnancy, her dietary intake, how much energy she
expends, and her emotional state. (Engle, 1992) There are traditional beliefs
and practices that impact on the mother's health and preparedness to give birth
to a healthy infant.   For example, in many cultures in Sub-Saharan Africa the
practice is for pregnant women to observe food taboos that restrict their
consumption of foods that are in fact important to their nutrition and the
growth of the foetus.  In some instances these taboos compound women's
undernourishment and lead to high maternal and infant mortality rates. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> At birth and during the first year of life the child is at the
greatest risk of mortality.  That may be why there are so many beliefs and
practices within traditional cultures that surround the birth of a child.  It
is recognized as a critical time for both the child and the mother.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> During the post-partum and early infancy stages the child is
completely dependent on others for care.  Generally the mother is the primary
caregiver, sometimes with considerable support from others and sometime alone.
She is responsible for providing all the things an infant needs:  protection
from physical danger; adequate nutrition and health care; an adult who can
understand and respond to signals; things to look at, touch, hear, smell, and
taste; opportunities to explore the world, appropriate language stimulation,
and an adult with whom to form an attachment.  (Donohue-Colletta, 1992, pg. 65)
The level of support the mother receives from others in the family and from
society plays an important role in the kind of care she is able to provide
during this time.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> During late infancy (or when complementary foods are introduced), the
child is at greatest risk of growth faltering.  While growth faltering may be
the result of inadequate nutrition, there is clear evidence to suggest that the
feeding process itself is important in determining a child's later development.
(Evans, 1994)   Thus, not only is it important to know what kinds of foods are
available to children, it is also important to understand the context within
which food is provided.  Once again, there are traditional practices (positive
and negative) that provide insight into the factors affecting a  child's
nutritional status. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> As children become toddlers and begin to move around on their own,
environmental cleanliness and vigilance in terms of the child's safety are of
utmost importance.  In addition to the kinds of supports the children required
as infants, when they become toddlers (1-3 years of age) they need: support in
acquiring new motor, language and thinking skills; a chance to develop some
independence; help in learning how to control their own behaviour;
opportunities to begin to learn to care for themselves;  daily opportunities to
play with a variety of objects. (Donohue-Colletta, 1992 pg. 65) <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> While the mother remains the primary person responsible for the
safety, care and feeding of the child, it is during toddlerhood that the child
moves out from the mother.  Over time others in the family and community play
an increasingly important role in the care of the child, particularly in terms
of socializing and teaching the child through direct instruction and modelling.
In some cultures 'over time' means a few weeks after the child is born.  In
other cultures this can mean several months or years later. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> The pre-school child (3-6 years of age) is more self-reliant.  Upon
reaching this age children "are initiated into the culture of children, and may
even become fledgling caregivers themselves... they may have developed skills
to obtain food for themselves, and the wisdom to protect themselves a little
from pathogens in the environment." (Engle, 1992, pg. 25)  Again, the culture
the child is raised in determines the timing and the kinds of skills acquired
in relation to self-care.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> While in many traditional cultures in Sub-Saharan Africa children may
be given the role of caretaker for younger siblings, children ages 3-6 also
have needs.  They need: opportunities to develop fine motor skills;
encouragement of language through talking, reading,  singing;  activities that
will develop a positive sense of mastery;  opportunities to learn cooperation,
helping, sharing; and experimentation with pre-writing and pre-reading skills.
(Donohue-Colletta 1992, pg. 65)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> While there is continuity in children's development, there are
transition points that represent a real shift in children's experience.  For
example, when the child is weaned from the breast, when new foods are
introduced, when the primary caregiver shifts from being the mother, and when
the child takes on adult responsibilities, to name but a few.  These
developmental transitions require adjustments by the child.  Within traditional
cultures there are frequently practices and/or rituals which help mark these
transitions.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In sum, traditional societies have evolved ways to support the growth
and development of children in response to contextual needs.  Today the context
is changing rapidly, bringing into question goals and expectations for children
and the appropriateness of traditional practices. New demands and the absence
of traditional supports are forcing families to do things differently.  Some
parents are aware that they are raising their children different from the way
they were raised.  Other parents are implementing alternative child rearing
strategies in response to changing conditions without being particularly
conscious of what is being lost and what retained from traditional practice. In
either instance, what the parents do impacts on how the child grows and
develops.      <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Research and experience would suggest that the differences between
children who thrive and those who falter are determined by the type of
interaction that occurs between the child and the environment.  (Werner, 1979;
Zeitlin, 1993)  The primary mediators of that environment are the family and
the community.  Thus in order to create appropriate supports for the child it
is important to understand how the community operates and how the child fits
within the family and community. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>III.  The Family and Community</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><i>Children are more than the object of their parents' attention and
love; they are also a biological and social necessity.  The human species
perpetuates itself through children; cultural, religious and national groups
transmit their values and traditions through children; families maintain their
lineage through children; and individuals pass on their genetic and social
heritage through children.  The ultimate value of children is the continuity of
humanity.</i>                                              Arnold, et al.,
1975, pg.
1<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>In most societies the family, however defined, is the primary unit
given responsibility for raising children.  Within the cultures reviewed at the
Workshop, the community also had clear responsibility for the raising of
children.  In pursuit of this task the family and community implement specific
child rearing practices which they see as:<p>
     <p>
      Ensuring the survival and health of the child, including the development of
the child's reproductive capacity to continue the lineage and society.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>  Developing the child's capacity for economic self-maintenance at
maturity, to provide security for the elders and younger members of the
society.<p>
      Ensuring the survival of the social group by assuring that children
assimilate, embody and transmit appropriate social and cultural values to their
children.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> To meet their goals, parents adopt a set of practices, based on
beliefs and values, from those made available to them through their culture.
While parents rely heavily on the child rearing beliefs which are a part of the
culture as the basis for their parenting, there is considerable individual
variation in practice, depending on the psychological characteristics of the
parents, made up of their own personality, the experiences they had as
children, and the conditions under which they are living.  The role of other
members of the society in the raising of children differs depending on the
specific cultural group, with community members playing a significant role in
some settings and a more distant role in others.   <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Just as programmes cannot be developed by looking at the child in
isolation, neither is it possible to define the impact of child rearing
practices only in relation to the ways in which the family and community
function.    The broader context which surrounds the family and community must
also be taken into account.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In societies with limited exposure to outside influences, the context
is relatively constant and as a result child rearing practices remain more or
less the same across generations.  In societies in rapid flux, there are
dramatic changes from one generation to the next in the context within which
children are raised.  These lead to differences in the type of care that is
provided to children.   A discussion of the way in which the  context impacts
child rearing practices and beliefs follows.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>IV.  The Context</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Understanding the context helps provide an understanding both of the
ways in which child rearing practices have developed and the ways in which they
are evolving.  The context is composed of many things.  It includes:<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>  the physical environment -  the climate/geography of the area that
determines the need for shelter from the heat or cold, and the relative ease of
raising food crops to sustain the family;<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>  the socio-political climate that determines whether families have
security or a life dominated by fear;<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>  the economic climate that determines a family's ability to survive
and thrive;<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>      the philosophical and religious systems that provide a base for the
values and beliefs of the society;<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>      the past, which is presented to the child through legends, myths,
proverbs, riddles and songs that justify the existing social order and
reinforce customs;<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>      the family and community who act as models of expected
behaviour;<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>      the village, which presents a variety of situations calling for
prescribed behaviour.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> The configuration of these dimensions determines the kinds of
supports (or detractors) present as families and communities raise children.
One way to analyze possible configurations is along a continuum.  In 1990,
Negussie completed an analysis of child rearing practices in Sub-Saharan Africa
(1990a).  She chose to represent these child rearing practices along a
continuum related to degree of modernization..  At one end of the continuum
are<b> <i>traditional</i></b> cultures.  These are defined as cultures within
which child rearing practices and beliefs are based on inherited and orally
transmitted knowledge.  The context is more or less stable and there are
adequate resources to support  the traditional way of life.   Negussie notes
that, in general, traditional cultures are more characteristic of rural than
urban areas.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Societies that would be placed along the continuum between the two
ends are characterized as<b> <i>transitional</i>.</b>  For these societies
there is a shift away from traditional practices as they are exposed to new
ideas and/or there are changes in the environment which threaten their
survival, forcing them the make changes.  Negussie suggests that those
migrating from rural to urban areas and/or living in marginal communities can
be characterized as in transition.  Within societies that are in transition,
child rearing practices and beliefs include a mix of the traditional and
modern, and the mix is different depending on what is required of families.
<p>
     <p>
     The other end of the continuum can be defined as <b><i>modern</i></b><i>.</i>
Cultures located at this point on the continuum have access to and are using
non-traditional health care and education in place of traditional systems.
Negussie found that those living in peri-urban and urban areas are most likely
to be placed at this point on the continuum.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> This way of defining contexts is elaborated on below. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>A. Traditional:  reliance on inherited and orally transmitted
knowledge</b>.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Many of the studies of child rearing beliefs and practices in
Sub-Saharan Africa conducted earlier in this century captured the child rearing
practices found within traditional societies.<b
>[1]</b>  In some countries there are pockets where
these cultures continue to exist, but these are few and far between.  In most
countries, traditional child rearing practices, both positive and negative, are
changing as families are exposed to other beliefs and practices.  Where
traditional practices have been interrupted the society may be classified as in
<i>transition.</i><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>B. Transitional: the shift as a society that relied primarily on
traditional wisdom begins to adopt alternative beliefs and practices.</b><p>
<b></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><i>If the goals set by the 'modern society' [are] different from those
earlier set by the indigenous society, the individual follows the former.  The
result is the disintegration of the earlier set of goals and values.  Nigerian
society and culture is one undergoing such disintegration.  The generally set
goals seem to be western, materialistic and individualistic.  In the rural area
though, there still seems to exist traditional values, but these too are rocked
by the waves of principles of democratization and modernization, the vehicle of
which is education - western education.</i> (Akinware &amp; Ojomo, 1993, pg
40)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Many African cultures can be characterized as in a time of
<i>transition</i> as a result of changes which impact family life.  These
changes indirectly affect child rearing beliefs and practices and the growth
and development of children.  Families and communities are in transition as a
result of: <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>      1.  <b> <i>Changes in the traditional functions of the family.
</i></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>One particularly important support to parents has been the community
and the extended family system. In the past, close family ties provided a
built-in measure of economic, emotional and social security to children and
families, but this traditional support for families has been disrupted as
families are moving from the rural to urban areas, as families are migrating in
search of work, and as individual family members leave the village in search of
educational and economic opportunities.  Many of the previous roles of the
community are being taken on by society or falling by the wayside.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> 2.  <b><i> Changes in the structure of the family.
</i></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>The size of families is declining.  This is due partly to the fact
that people are having fewer children, but more significantly the decline in
family size is due to a move from multi-generational family groupings to the
nuclear family, which, by virtue of its limited number of adults, often fails
to provide the care and support required by children.  It is also important to
note that these smaller families are frequently not very stable units.  There
is fluctuation in the numbers and members in a household as a result of
seasonal and work-related in- and out-migration.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> 3.   <b><i>Changes for the girl child. </i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Women and girls have become the focus of international attention.
Child rearing practices which relied on the older girl child to care for
younger children in the family are being challenged.  Girls who have
traditionally been responsible for the care of younger siblings are attending
school at an increased rate and being encouraged to complete their education.
This has an impact on arrangements for child care within the family.  <p>
     4.  <b><i>Changes in the nature of women's work. </i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Women have always played multiple roles that compete for their time
and physical and emotional energy.  Regardless of the context within which
children are raised, care of children, particularly young children, is still
the woman's responsibility.  In addition, the woman is responsible for
household management and operations, and economic/productive activity.  New
economic pressures on and possibilities presented to women mean that
increasingly they work outside the home, often for long hours and following
schedules that limit their availability and thus the time they can devote to
child care.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In rural areas women often work in the fields.  While in many
cultures women have historically constituted a majority of the agricultural
work force, in other settings the out-migration of men who are seeking
employment has increased women's agricultural role.  In addition, in some
agricultural settings plantation economies and cash crop production have meant
that women are increasingly being exposed to the demands of rigid time and work
schedules similar to those common in urban environments. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In both urban and rural environments there is an increase in the
number of women-headed households.  This necessarily impacts the woman's work
load.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> 5.  <b><i> Changes in men's roles.</i></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Traditionally in cultures in Sub-Saharan Africa men have not been
heavily involved with children.  But, as societies change, men's role has been
changing.  It is no longer defined by tradition.  More and more it is being
defined by changes in the economic situation and configuration of the family.
<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Within the cultures reported on at the Workshop, the movement of
families from rural to urban areas has impacted both positively and negatively
on the role of the father.  For example, in Nigeria it was found that as
families move to urban areas they lose the support of the extended family.
Because the majority of the families cannot afford to hire caregivers, the men
became more involved in providing care for the children.  Quite the opposite
was found in Malawi. There when families move to urban areas, even the little
interaction men have with their children is generally decreased. <p>
     <p>
     6. <b><i>  Changes in migration patterns.  </i></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Until recently men were the most likely to migrate in search of paid
employment.  In recent years, however, with the creation of free market zones,
more and more women are migrating to these zones to obtain work. The
potentially negative impact of this migration on families and young children is
of concern to many.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Within traditional societies the norms, beliefs and practices were
relatively stable.  Expectations in terms of parental behaviour were clear.
For families in transition child rearing practices are not clear.  These
families may lack the skills to live in the state of flux represented by
transitional cultures.  In this situation parents may have a sense of
powerlessness and be less self-confident in terms of their parenting skills.
This can lead to child rearing practices that are inconsistent and/or overly
restrictive (Werner, 1979).  For those families who have been living in urban
areas for a generation or two, they may well have incorporated more "modern"
child rearing beliefs and practices.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>C. Modernity: when non-traditional health, education, and social
supports are available and relied upon more than the
traditional.</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Technology has made a wide variety of supports available to families
that are not available within traditional cultures.  While there are pros and
cons on just about every technology that has been introduced, the availability
of these technologies has radically changed people's lives.  For example,
bottle feeding has made it easier for women to enter the labour market.  But
the introduction of bottle feeding and the decrease in breastfeeding has
resulted in high infant mortality and morbidity rates due to improper use of
bottles and infant formula.  Another example is the introduction of a local
primary school, facilitating the attendance of girls in school.  This may mean
that infants are cared for by siblings older than the infant but too young to
go to school, putting both at risk.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> There have been numerous studies assessing the consequences of
changes in family and community life as a result of modernization.  Werner
(1979) reviewed studies of modernity conducted by anthropologists working with
the Yoruba in Nigeria. In her synthesis of the studies, Werner described the
ways in which child rearing patterns changed as families moved from the rural
to urban settings, away from the community and extended family to a nuclear
family where the role of both parents changed, resulting in differences in
child rearing patterns and in the characteristics of children raised under
these new practices.  Werner described a shift to a more intimate, affectionate
and egalitarian parent-child relationship and the raising of fewer, more
self-reliant and achievement-oriented children, with a decline in social
distance between husband and wife. (pg. 303)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> According to Werner, modern individuals are defined by their: "i)
openness to new experiences, including family planning and birth control; ii)
assertion of increasing independence from traditional authority figures; iii)
belief in the efficacy of science and technology coupled with abandonment of
passivity and fatalism; and iv) ambitions for (their) children to achieve
higher educational and occupational goals." (pg 303)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> It is interesting to note that the traditional and modern Yoruba
families included in Werner's analysis were only one generation apart.  The
parents of the more-modern elite who were included in the study were illiterate
farmers from the traditional village in the study.   Thus while in some
instances there are several generations between the traditional societies and
the modern, this movement can occur within only one generation.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> More recent research has confirmed many of the conclusions reached by
Werner.  In a research study conducted in Nigeria, Zeitlin (1993) was able to
identify parental behaviours among modern families that were both positive and
negative for children.  In the research Zeitlin identified modern parental
behaviour associated with better school performance. These include:<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>  <i>A change in parental discipline away from immediate physical
punishment to tolerance of slower obedience.</i> There was also an expectation
that the child would have an understanding of the reasons for rules.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>  <i>Prolonged parental protection</i>.  Parents accepted the child's
physical dependency up to an older age, and they provided more attentive
feeding and care. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>  <i>More affection and intimacy</i>. A more personal relationship
existed between the children and the father, and there were more recreations
shared by parents and children;<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>  <i>Increased verbal responsiveness to the child</i>.  This included
the use of explanation in addition to physical demonstration in teaching. (pg
10-11)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>The negative aspects noted in Zeitlin's research included:  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>  <i>A dehumanization of the care environment</i> (with increased use
of the bottle rather than the breast, and a reliance on mass media rather than
human interaction for entertainment).<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>  <i>The disintegration of family and community units</i> and of
commitment to each other.  Smaller units of ownership and residence lead to
less sharing and more individualism.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>  <i>A reduction in the ability of families and communities to provide
care</i> given the changing demands of work outside the home.  The nature of
this work does not nurture stable family formation.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>  <i>The feminization of poverty.</i>  When families dissolve, the
woman and her children generally fall into poverty and lack adequate resources
for child care.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>  <i>A reduction in children's altruism.</i> Preparing children to be
autonomous tends to make them precocious, self-centered and unruly.  Those
children reared in more traditional societies are more altruistic.  As
modernization occurs they become more egotistical. (pgs. 11-12)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> What do these findings mean in the context of programming to meet the
needs of young children and their families?  What would it be appropriate to
advocate as child rearing practices in these settings?  To answer these
questions it is necessary to look more closely at what is happening within
specific cultures.  What follows is a synthesis of what was learned through an
analysis of the studies conducted in Mali, Nigeria, Zambia, Namibia and Malawi,
and presented at the Workshop.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>V.    An Introduction to the Studies </b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <p>
     One of the goals for the Workshop was: <i>to bring together information from
existing studies of child rearing practices and to draw implications for policy
and programming.</i>  Thus in preparation for the Workshop several studies of
child rearing practices and beliefs in sub-Saharan Africa were selected for
review at the Workshop.  The researchers were asked to make a presentation at
the Workshop on their findings. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>A.  The Methodology</b><p>
<b></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Before looking at the specific information generated in the five
research projects reported on at the Workshop, it is important to provide an
overview of the methodologies employed in each study.  None of the studies was
conducted specifically for the purposes of the Workshop.  Each study was
conducted for a specific purpose prior to the Workshop, one as early as 1984,
with the most recent being completed in 1991.  Because these studies were not
generally available, the Workshop was seen as an opportunity to share the
results with a wider audience and to further the discussion of ways in which an
understanding of child rearing practices could facilitate programme
development.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> The studies in Namibia, Zambia, Malawi and Nigeria were all
undertaken with the support of UNICEF and were conducted by national research
and/or academic institutions.  The study in Mali was supported by Save the
Children USA and was conducted in collaboration with a national research
institute.  Since the studies were done in isolation of one another, they lack
a common methodology.  The methodologies employed in each study were based on
the study purposes and reflected the expertise of the research group involved
in the effort.  What follows is a brief description of the  methodologies
developed by each research group.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>1.  Namibia</b>  <tt></tt><p>

<tt></tt><i>Child Care and Development in Uukwaluudhi, Northern Namibia.</i>
R.F. Zimba, &amp; B. Otaala. (1991) UNICEF, Namibia.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <i>Purpose</i>.  This study was completed in 1991 and was undertaken
for the express purpose of understanding traditional child rearing practices
and beliefs among  the Uukwaluudhi peoples in northern Namibia.  This was the
initial step in the implementation of a UNICEF child development project, the
general objective of which was "to create optimal conditions for early
childhood development and care at the household and community levels."  (pg.
23)  In order to do this, UNICEF staff felt it was important to undertake
research that would "provide background data for establishing developmentally
stimulating household based child care." (pg. 25)  More specifically, the
purpose of the research was "to assess the extent to which qualities of a
developmentally stimulating environment were provided by the Uukwaluudhi
community." pg. 27) <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> The study was undertaken by two members of the Faculty of Education
at the University of Namibia. They were assisted by six field workers.
Community workers also participated in the study, facilitating communication
among the researchers and community members. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <i>Sample</i>.  136 Uukwaluudhi households were selected randomly and
visited by the 2 researchers and 6 research assistants.  An average of 13.6
households were visited in each of 10 districts.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <i>Data Collection Tools</i>. Four sets of open-ended and structured
interview questions were used in the study.  The first set focussed on
background information on the family as a whole.  The second set focussed on
prenatal maternal and child care practices, beliefs and needs.  The third and
fourth sets included questions focussed on care during early and late
childhood, respectively.  They also included questions about community goals in
relation to child care and development.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <i>Procedure</i>. Before the study began the Principal Investigator
visited Uukwaluudhi and met with members of the education and health committees
of the UNICEF programme already in place.  At the meeting the purpose of the
study was explained and community involvement in the effort was sought.  There
was enthusiastic support for it.  The next step was to discuss the study with
the area chief.  The chief was impressed with the team and underscored the
importance of creating activities  that would be of benefit to women, men and
children.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Data were gathered by teams of two making visits to homes. During the
home visit, the questionnaire was administered and observations made of what
children did, what was done to them, what was done with them, and how the
caregivers interacted with the children.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <i>Data Analysis</i>.  The quantitative data gathered through the
questionnaires were scored, coded and entered.  Data were analyzed using the
SPSS-X statistical analysis programme.  The qualitative data were transcribed,
coded and interpreted.  The quantitative and qualitative data, together with
the investigators' and research assistants' field observations, were combined
to provide a description of practices among the Uukwaluudhi peoples in relation
to child rearing practices and beliefs during the prenatal, perinatal, 0-3
year, and 3-6 year periods in the life of a child.<p>
<tt></tt><p>

Chibuye, M. Mwenda &amp; C. Osborne. (1986) Zambia Association for Research and
Development. Lusaka, Zambia.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <i>Purpose</i>.  This study was conducted in the mid 1980s, with
support from UNICEF, the Zambia Association for Research and Development and
the Ministry of Home Affairs.  The study was aimed at documenting traditional
child rearing practices (TCRPs) for the purposes of formulating appropriate
national level policies.   The study was designed to provide a country-wide
picture of child rearing practices and beliefs. (Previous studies had focussed
only on individual provinces.) <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Specifically the researchers were attempting to identify: 1)  good
TCRPs which could be encouraged to help reduce infant and childhood mortality
and morbidity rates; 2) harmful TCRPs which needed to be discouraged by
intensifying health education efforts; and 3) harmless TCRPs which, like the
good ones, should remain as part of the cultural heritage and be incorporated
into health education programmes. (pg. 9)  This micro-level study was meant to
complement the macro-level statistics on children in Zambia, both of which were
gathered as a part of UNICEF's situational analysis of women and children in
Zambia. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <i>Sample</i>. Data were collected from 740 adults and 232 children
(ages 1-7) in 8 of the 9 provinces in Zambia.  Areas were selected to be
representative of Zambia's population groups.  These included rural, peri-urban
and urban communities, those involved in agriculture, fishing, and mining, and
families with matrilineal and patrilineal traditions.  The areas selected
represented diverse communities which differed by tribe, language, education
and income. (pg.  10)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <i>Data Collection Tools/Procedure</i>.  Data were collected through
two structured interview schedules.  One was used with adults, with the
questions designed to elicit information on socio-demographic variables related
to antenatal, perinatal, general care of the baby, feeding and weaning, social
development and health care practices.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> The second interview was administered to children "who could talk".<
b>[2]</b>  Questions were designed to obtain an
understanding of children's general knowledge of current affairs and the mental
and physical development activities they engage in.  The responses of adults
and children were then compared.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <i>Data Analysis</i>.  From the responses, categories were devised
and responses grouped accordingly. The Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze the data.<p>

<tt></tt><i>Child rearing Practices and Beliefs in Malawi and their
Implications for Programming</i>. E. Kalemba (1993) Paper presented at the
Workshop on Child Rearing Practices and Beliefs, Windhoek, Namibia, October
26-29, 1993.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <i>Purpose</i>.  A study to assess the child rearing practices in
four different communities in Malawi was undertaken in 1984.  The focus of the
study was on the socio-cultural, nutritional, physical and health conditions
prevalent in the culture.  The study was envisaged to provide information on
both positive areas and gaps in relation to child stimulation, and problems
faced by parents in providing total care. (pg. 5) <p>
     Specifically the study focussed on information concerning practices and
beliefs related to conception, birth, child nutrition, socialization, attitudes
toward children, sex of the child, weaning and general care of children.  It
looked at what children do between the ages of 2 and 6, what they play with,
and their interaction with older family members (parents and siblings). <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <i>Sample</i>.  The study was conducted in four areas of Malawi (one
urban and three rural), selected on the basis of the dominant culture, the
geographic and physical environment and the level of economic and social
development.  In the urban area sampling was based on existing residential
areas, treated as clusters, from which households were randomly sampled.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In the three rural areas, which were more homogeneous, lists of
villages were obtained from chiefs.  From these an appropriate number of
villages was randomly selected.  A further random sample provided the actual
households where interviews were conducted and observations made.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> The total sample size was 382 households, composed of 2123
individuals, including 671 children under-five.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><i>   Data Collection Tools/Procedure</i>.  A checklist of variables to
be investigated was drawn up. This was used for the purposes of making
observations. In addition a structured questionnaire was completed with each
household.  Individual investigators were assigned households to observe over a
four week period during which they made notes and completed the questionnaires.
All the investigators lived among their subjects during this four week
period.<p>

Paper Based on the Baseline studies Conducted in Five local government Areas in
Nigeria UNICEF (1987-1990).</i> M.A. Akinware &amp; A. A. Ojomo (1993)  Paper
presented at the Workshop on Child rearing Practices and Beliefs, Windhoek,
Namibia, October 26-29, 1993. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <i>Purpose</i>. In 1987, baseline studies were conducted in five
areas of Nigeria for the purposes of assessing the health and nutritional
status of children, child care arrangements and stimulation, and maternal
attitudes toward achievement, formal education and organized day care.   The
information gathered was used as the basis for a programme being developed
jointly by UNICEF and the Bernard van Leer Foundation.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <i>Sample</i>.  A four-stage sampling procedure was used.  First,  a
mapping of the geographical area was conducted in each of the five Local
Government Areas (LGAs) to be surveyed. Second, a stratification within the
LGAs was made which led to the selection of representative geographic areas
and/or communities.  Third, households with children between the ages of 1.5
and 6 years, (generally between 2 and 4), were randomly selected within the
stratified areas.  Fourth, children were selected for testing within the
households. <p>
     Overall a total of 1507 households were surveyed, averaging 300/LGA, split
between urban and rural populations.  Between 24 and 30 children were observed
in each LGA.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <i>Data Collection Tools/Procedure</i>.  An early Child Care
Development and Education Questionnaire (ECCDEQ), consisting of 93 items was
created.  The questionnaire was divided into three sections. 1) A Household
Questionnaire, completed with the Head of the Household,  included questions
which provided general information on the community.  This questionnaire served
as an entry point into the household. Once the male was interviewed he would
permit the woman to respond to a questionnaire also. 2) A Mother Questionnaire,
administered to the target child's biological mother, was used to obtain
information on family composition and demographics, as well as specific
information on child birth,  child rearing patterns and family planning
methods. 3) A Child Development Questionnaire, again administered to the target
child's biological mother,  provided specific information on the child's birth
record, nutritional and health history, current health status,  physical,
emotional and social development patterns, task performance and intellectual
development. It also elicited information on the mother's socialization
practices, child care options and arrangements and her aspirations for the
child. In addition, the Bayley Mental Development Test was  administered to
some children.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> An Observational Assessment Checklist was also developed to
facilitate observation of the activities and interactions of selected children
within the sample. Through observations information was gathered on children's
physical development, interaction with peers and adults, types of playmates,
feeding habits, relationship to primary caregiver and siblings, degree of
emotional support provided and language skills.<p>

<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><i>Research Work on Early Childhood Attitudes, Practices and Beliefs
in Kolondeba, Southern Mali.</i> U. Dembele &amp; M. Poulton. (1993) Paper
presented at the Workshop on Child Rearing Practices and Beliefs in Sub-Saharan
Africa.   Windhoek, Namibia 26-19 October 1993.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <i>Purpose.</i>    It was known that the Bambara people in Southern
Mali have developed a 'genuine sustainable caregiving system'.  The question
was, how best can this 'native enterprise' system be built upon to promote the
child's development?  The research undertaken in January 1993 was a joint
effort between a national research institute (ISFRA) and Save The Children
(USA) for the specific purpose of developing a child care programme that was
built on and reflected traditional child rearing practices and beliefs.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> The objectives of the study were: 1) to identify the development of
the Bamanan child and the specific educational activities taking place at each
stage of the child's development; 2) to analyze practices associated with motor
skills, socio-affective and cognitive development; 3) to define and illustrate
the educational practice, attitudes, stimulation, personality and 'awakening'
as experienced by the Bambara; and 4) to describe the traditional learning
process and specify the roles and responsibilities of caregivers (e.g. mothers)
in that process. (pg. 1)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <i>Sample</i>.  The specific focus of the study was the Bambara
peoples in Kolondeba, Southern Mali.  Eight villages participated in the study.
All traditional institutions concerned with education in those villages were
included in the study, to find out about child rearing practices and beliefs
that impacted on children from 1 to 4 years of age. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <i>Procedure</i>.  The researchers employed an action research
approach rather than a single survey in order to understand the practices more
fully.  The researchers worked with Bamanan organizations (women, youth,
traditional healers, religious leaders and indigenous change agents) to explore
the popular perception of child care.  This involved gathering information
about myths and the reality of practices, beliefs and attitudes. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In the second phase, the researchers sought the rationale behind the
popular perceptions identified.  They looked closely at the various components
of caregiving and tried to find out some meaning and relationship between them.
When, how, where and why different people act the way they do and what is
expected, were issues taken into consideration. The process  included the
running of Focus groups, RAP and observations.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <i>Data Analysis</i>. As noted by the research team. "an eclectic
data collection and analysis method was used." (pg.2)  The conclusions evolved.
As data were gathered and summarized they were shared with the groups involved
in data collection to ascertain the validity of the conclusions. If they were
incorrect further discussions and observations took place until there was
agreement on study results. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In sum, the methodologies employed differed across the countries
studied; some were more formal, some less.  All but the Mali study employed
questionnaires that were completed through interviews of household members.
The majority of the studies also included observations of adult and child
behaviour to validate interview data and/or provide a more in-depth
understanding of the dimensions being explored. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> It was expected that the reports would illustrate the diversity among
the cultures within sub-Saharan Africa.  And while the differences were
apparent, what was striking to all at the Workshop was the similarity of
beliefs and practices found within traditional societies studied in Mali,
Nigeria, Namibia, Zambia and Malawi.  The positive and negative practices and
beliefs which are similar across all the studies are noted in the synthesis
which follows. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>B. Positive beliefs/values:</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Children are highly valued.  They are gifts from God and have a very
special role to play<p>
     in perpetuating the family and culture and n providing care for elders<p>
<p>
 Children are the responsibility of the community. When primary caregivers are
not available, the community creates a system for caring for children.  As a
proverb from Malawi states: <i>Nurture any child, even those who are not your
own, for in the future they will look after you.</i>  <p>
 Parental and community goals for children are centered around social and human
values. These include: respect, self-reliance, being helpful, cooperative, and
obedient. The more 'modern' the culture, the more likely there is to be a shift
to more materialistic values.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> A woman's actions are believed to be important in terms of birth
outcomes for the woman and for the baby. Each of the cultures have beliefs and
practices related to pregnancy.  These center around what women should and
should not eat, and what they should and should not do. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Each culture has a set of rituals related to the birth process
itself.  These are designed to provide a safe birth for the baby and to assure
the mother's well-being.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> After birth there is a period of confinement that is designed to
allow the mother to regain her energy and for the bonding and attachment to
occur between the mother and child.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> The naming of the child is a significant event.  Names have meaning
and are chosen carefully. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In support of good nutrition for the child, mothers breastfeed,
generally for fairly extended periods of time. The benefits of this practice
include: providing appropriate nutrition for the infant and  assuring
appropriate child spacing.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Practices related to caring for one child and conceiving another has
meant that traditionally there was adequate child spacing. There is an implicit
understanding that there should be 2+ years between children and a more
explicit belief that while women are breastfeeding they should not get
pregnant.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> The child rearing practices related to the care of the infant
(breastfeeding on demand, the carrying of the child on the mother's back,
sleeping with the child) create a close and intimate relationship between the
mother and child and security for the child.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> When the child is no longer breastfed there is a separation from the
mother physically and emotionally.  At this point others in the family and
community play an increasingly important role in caring for the child.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> There is an expectation that a variety of community members will
support the child's growth and development. This begins with traditional birth
attendants and then includes extended family members, older brothers and
sisters, and then the community at large, including the elderly. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Older children (even beginning at age 4) play a significant role in
providing care for younger children.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> The elders have a special role in the society.  They are valued for
their wisdom and have considerable power. They have an important role to play
in the transmission of cultural values and in teaching the young.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Much learning occurs through the modeling of the behaviour of adults
and older children.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> There are traditional games, stories, toys, songs, and ways of
playing that are passed on from the older children to the younger children,
many of which support children's physical, emotional, social and intellectual
development.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Traditional healers are commonly turned to when families have health
problems.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>C.      Values/ Beliefs that may be detrimental</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Some of the food taboos associated with pregnancy increase the
likelihood of mothers being anaemic (e.g. pregnant women are not allowed to eat
eggs, fish, and sometimes meats).<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Men are seldom involved in direct care of the young child. In some
cultures they provide support to women; in others they are essentially absent
until the child is older.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> There is little understanding of the value of interacting with
infants and young children.  Adults don't really "play" with children, at least
until the child reaches the pre-school years.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> The etiology of many diseases is misunderstood. Diseases are
attributed to human fallibility and/or witchcraft  (e.g. Kwashiorkor and
marasmus are believed to be caused by infidelity).<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> There is little understanding of the process of development and
children's needs at different stages (e.g. teething is seen as causing
diarrhoea and other illnesses, and meal frequency is usually tied to adult
patterns of eating when in fact young children need to eat more often).<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Beyond these generalizations, the participants in the workshop sought
a more in-depth understanding of the cultures being studied. Thus, in
preparation for the workshop each set of researchers was asked to respond to a
common set of questions in relation to the findings in their study.    The
section which follows presents a summary of their responses. Because the
purposes of the studies were different, there are some questions that only one
or two of the studies may have addressed.  In other instances, all the studies
could provide relevant information.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>VI.  The Specifics</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>A. Goals and expectations for children in the
culture</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>As noted, what comes through as a dominant theme in all the cultures
studied is that children are highly valued.  In Mali the child is seen as a
"celestial, social and material being; a complex being to be handled with great
care...Many traditional communities consider the child as part of the cosmos
before it is born. (Dembele &amp; Poulton, 1993, pgs. 4-5)  Beyond that the
child is: a gift from God, an ancestor, an evil spirit, a social product, a
community possession, its genitor's replacer, a consolation for childless
relatives.  (pg. 5)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In Nigeria children are the reason for people to marry. "The essence
of marriage in the Nigerian context, as in Africa, is to have children."
(Akinware &amp; Ojomo, 1993, pg.5)  "Wedding dates are not fixed until the
woman's pregnancy is obvious ... childbirth is usually announced some few weeks
or months after the wedding." (pg. 6)  There is nothing worse than a childless
marriage.  It is "one of distress, unhappiness and (frequently) ends in
divorce." (pg.5)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In Nigeria it is said, "omo l'aso",  the child is clothing. This has
several levels of meaning.  The child covers the father at his death, meaning
he takes on the lineage.  This "covering" occurs during the father's life as
well.  The child is expected to take care of or cover the needs of the parents.
This responsibility is conveyed to the child early on.  When the child is
young, parents emphasize how much they are doing for the child.  In turn, the
expectation is that this caretaking will be reversed when the child is grown
and the parents are old and require care.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In Zambia the importance of children is seen by the fact that parents
are known as the father or mother of a given child.  They do not use their own
names.  They are given status in relation to the child they have parented.  As
a result children are not likely to know their own surnames. (Chibuye, et al.,
1986, pg. 86)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> As a result of the high value placed on children, parents desire many
children. In the Zambian study, of those interviewed only 20% wanted fewer than
5 children, 44% wanted 5-10, 8% wanted more than 10.  The remainder stated they
would be content with any number.  The reasons for wanting the given number of
children was: 'some children may die (26%), children are an investment (21%),
and children are a gift of God (18%)."  The other 35% cited the high cost of
living.<b>[3]</b> (pg. 34)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In Mali there is also a desire for large families.  "The more
children there are, the more varied the tasks the family can carry out and the
more prosperous it can be as production is still done by hand." (Dembele &amp;
Poulton, 1993, pg.6)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> How do you treat these children that are the gift of God?  In Malawi
they say "M'mera ndipoyamba" - meaning that the child is like a plant.  It must
be nurtured while it is still young for it to grow up strong, healthy and
productive. (Kalemba, 1993, pg 6)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> What do parents expect of children?  By and large, the majority of
the goals for children center around the development of appropriate social
skills and humanistic values.  In Namibia, among the Uukwaluudhi, parents want
their children to respect their elders. It is also important for the child to
be cooperative, helpful, hardworking and to participate in the work at home and
in the field.  Frequently mentioned was the fact that it was important for the
child to be educated, obedient, and believe in God. Only two people mentioned
specific occupations they would like to see their children pursue (teacher and
nurse). (Zimba &amp; Otaala, 1991, pg.71, 86)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Among the Bambara in Mali, the traits most desired in children are
courage, perseverance, trustworthiness, reliability, generosity self-reliance,
industriousness, and charitability. (Dembele &amp; Poulton, 1993, pg 6) <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In Nigeria there is a clear expectation that the child should be
'good'.  A good child is one who follows cultural tradition and cares for the
parents. While traditionally the good child was one who was moral, as defined
by traditional values, now the good child is one who is a good provider. 'Good'
now has a much more material definition.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> But all children are not good.  When there is a 'bad' child, one who
does not conform to cultural norms, parents disown him/her. "I have not given
birth." "I have no child."  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Whether one has a good or bad child is the result of fate. In Nigeria
it is believed that God infuses a newborn with certain characteristics which
produce either a good or a bad child. The child is essentially given an
allotment that determines the type of existence the child will have, and
his/her personality.  The ingredients that go into creating a new child, and
the state of mind of the creator at the time, determine the child's destiny.
(Akinware &amp; Ojomo, 1993, pg. 12-13)  Since parents do not know who will
turn out to be the good child, large families are the norm in Nigeria.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In addition to there being a differentiation between good and bad
children, there are also gender preferences and expectations.  Not
surprisingly, male children are preferred since they pass on the family name.
Families where the first several children are girls generally have many
children, in the hope of having a male child.  "Each successive female issue is
accompanied with greater distress which at best is masked with fake joy."
(Akinware &amp; Ojomo, 1993, pg. 8)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Another dimension is the impact of polygamy on the number of children
born.  In Nigeria, a mark of a successful marriage is children.  Thus there are
jealousies among the women to produce the most children and children are not
well cared for by co-wives.  Death of an infant gets blamed on witchcraft
generated by co-wives.  However, this jealousy among co-wives is
counterbalanced by the need for the community to share responsibility for child
care. (Akinware &amp; Ojomo, 1993, pg.30)  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In sum, in each of the cultures studied great importance is placed on
having children.  Thus it is not surprising that there are numerous beliefs and
rituals that support the birth and raising of a healthy child.   What follows
is a description of some of the beliefs, rituals and child rearing practices
associated with different times in the child's life.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>B. Child rearing practices and beliefs associated with conception,
pregnancy and birth.</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>In the Zambian study the comment is made that "the delivery of the
mother and the birth of the children are subject to more beliefs and
superstitions than any other period of life" (pg 49).  This was echoed in the
other reports as well. In general, it can be stated that the younger the child
the more information there is about the child rearing practices and beliefs
associated with that age.  Within most of the cultures there are a variety of
practices and beliefs that surround the period from conception through infancy.
This may be due to the fact that this is a critical time in terms of a child's
survival.  It is also an important time in terms of a woman's role within the
culture. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b><i>     </i>1.  <i>Conception</i></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>In general, there is little understanding of the biological process of
conceiving a child.  The dominant belief that God gives children is enough of
an explanation for many.  This lack of scientific knowledge about how children
are produced allows people to make their own interpretations of outcomes.  For
example, in Nigeria if the children are healthy (and male) the father takes
credit.  If the child has a defect, or there is a continuous issuance of female
children, then it is the woman who is at fault.  Barrenness is always seen as
the woman's fault and frequently it is ascribed to her infidelity.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> As noted earlier, the traditional practices surrounding the care of
infants generally meant there was adequate spacing between children.  The
belief was that mothers who are breast feeding should not get pregnant.  In
Malawi the belief is that the milk of a pregnant woman is bad for the child.
In polygamous cultures there was little pressure on women to resume sexual
relations with the father.  He could satisfy himself elsewhere until the child
was fully weaned. With the move toward more nuclear families and the
introduction of bottle feeding, sexual relations are restored soon after the
birth of the child, increasing the likelihood of women having many children
within a short time period.  <p>
     The impact of modernization can be seen from the Namibia data.  In terms of
child spacing, this was the first child for 2% of the sample;  62.2% stated
there was less than a year between the birth of two of their children; and
20.6% said the next child came within 2 years.  Only 24% indicated that the
spacing was 2+ years.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b><i>     </i>2.   <i>Pregnancy practices  </i></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>In Malawi the practice was for the couple to abstain from sex from the
7th month of pregnancy until the child is 2.  As noted earlier, the practice of
polygamy helped make this possible.  Abstinence from sex is common in Nigeria
with the onset of pregnancy.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Dietary practices are important in all the cultures studied. In both
Malawi and Nigeria women's diets are supplemented by traditional medicines in
the forms of various drinks.  While there is dietary supplementation, likewise
there are a number of foods that women are forbidden to eat.  In Zambia the
food taboos include not eating eggs, fish and certain kinds of chilies, and not
drinking bitter medicines. In Nigeria the belief is that meat will harm the
foetus.<p>
     <p>
     Historically in Namibia pregnant women were not to eat oranges (the child will
have low birth weight and suffer from liver problems), eggs (the child will be
born without hair), fish (the child will have eyes like a fish), chicken or
groundnuts (the child may be born dirty and develop the propensity to steal).
It should be noted that the reason for these taboos were <i>known</i> by only
41% of the sample.  It is unclear how many actually adhered to the taboos.
Today the people's diets include many carbohydrates but little protein or fresh
fruits and vegetables.  Of more concern than the taboos is the fact that few
women have enough food available (30% reported they did not have enough to eat,
and alcohol consumption is common.). (pg. 10)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In terms of their behaviour, pregnant women in Nigeria are admonished
not to go out at night for fear of falling under the influence of the evil eye,
and not revealing the expected birth date for fear that the child's birth will
be jeopardized in some way.  Behavioural taboos in Namibia include: wake up
early in the morning, not to do so may lead to prolonged labour; do not go
through the door backwards, you may experience a breech birth.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In Mali there is essentially no change in a woman's activities while
she is pregnant.  In Namibia, the majority of pregnant women (about 70%)
continued their chores during pregnancy without help from others.  Those with
older children or younger siblings got some help.  When asked where they got
advice about their pregnancy 37.5% reported they got no advice,  39% said they
got advice from a nurse,  4.4% said from a doctor, and 14% reported getting
advice from a midwife. (Zimba &amp; Otaala, 1991, pg. 39).  79% of the women
attended the antenatal clinic more than 3 times during pregnancy, although the
average distance was 17 kilometers. (pg. 10)  The women appeared to gain little
information from the visits.  Thus what is available to support childbirth in
the village is extremely important.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <b>3<i>.  Childbirth </i></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Traditionally there were a variety of practices and beliefs
surrounding childbirth.  While these are maintained by all the members of the
society, the primary responsibility for their perpetuation is that of the
traditional birth attendant (TBA).  She plays a critical role in assuring the
survival of both the child and the mother.   The extent to which family
members, the pregnant woman's mother, the child's father, and others are
involved in the birth varied by cultural group.  Today all the cultures studied
have a mix of the traditional and Western medicine that influences the birthing
process.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In Malawi most children are born at home (75%) with birth attendants
and close relatives on hand to facilitate the process. Breastfeeding is begun
immediately.  The umbilical cord is cut with an unsterilized instrument and cow
dung is generally applied to the wound. (Ash is used  in Zambia).<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In the 1986 survey in Zambia , although about 75% of the women were
attending antenatal clinics, 50% delivered at home (the preferred place of
delivery),  with the other half delivering in a health clinic or hospital.
Outside the hospital, TBAs attended 42% of the births, 33% were attended by
relatives;  11% of the women reported delivering the child on their own.
(Chibuye, 1986, pg.18)<p>
     <p>
     Within the Namibia sample it was noted that people had to travel great
distances to get to a health clinic ( average 17 kilometers). Despite the
distance to the clinics, 68% of the sample reported giving birth to their
children in hospitals, 27% reported the children were born at home, 1.3% were
born in clinic and 3.9% were born on the way to the hospital or clinic.  Those
born at home were delivered by TBAs.  (Zimba &amp; Otaala,  1991, pg. 42)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>   Within the Nigerian sample there was a bias toward families in
urban areas.  That may be why more than half of the births in the Nigerian
study are reported to occur in a health facility, generally a maternity centre.
Many families employed in urban areas are entitled to medical care as a result
of their employment.  This is believed to have increased the use of hospital
and medical facilities.  These statistics  may not accurately reflect rural
access to health care facilities.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>   4. <i> Confinement</i></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <p>
The period immediately following the birth of the child is critical in terms of
both the infant's and the mother's survival.  During this time the mother needs
extra rest, food and care. Postpartum hemorrhaging and anaemia are common
problems.   <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Traditionally, in Malawi and Mali there was a period of confinement
for the mother and child.  In Malawi this confinement of mother and child
('chikuta') lasts for at least a week.  The explanation for the confinement is
that it helps the mother and child bond, rest after the trauma of the
childbirth and begin breastfeeding.  During this time the mother does nothing
but eat and feed her child. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> One of the reasons for the confinement may well be that in Malawi
males are reported to be "revolted" by the smell of the woman who has just
given birth and the infant is seen as "fragile.  Thus they stay away from the
mother and infant.  While they refuse to touch and carry the child they may
regard it lovingly from afar. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> While mothers do not have a period of confinement in Nigeria they are
well cared for by other women, primarily the mother's mother. They are given
special foods and bathed daily in a warm bath to restore them to health.  The
child is also bathed daily and provided with adornments that are designed to
provide the child with spiritual protection and serve as decorations.  The
young child in Malawi  is also provided with charms for use on its arms, legs
or around the neck.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In Zambia there is no confinement for the woman and infant. The child
is shown to others within 24 hours. Visitors frequently bring gifts
(predominantly money or food) when they come to view the child.  Gifts are also
brought to the mother.  The infant is bathed daily by any number of people.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><i>   </i><b>5. <i> Naming</i> </b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>An important ceremony in all the cultures studied is the naming of the
child.  The names chosen for the child have great significance, both in terms
of passing on a lineage, and in terms of providing a description of the
child.<p>
 <p>
     In Nigeria the infant is named on the 8th day after delivery. The naming
ceremony is full of rituals and serves as the public presentation of the baby.
The names chosen reflect events that have happened in conjunction with the
birth.  "Naming goes far beyond mere identification of the person that bears
it, it depicts events, situations and traits that could go a long way to
influence the personality formation and socialization of the individual."
(Akinware et al., 1993, pg. 21)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In Malawi the naming of the child is also delayed, probably to assure
the child's survival.   The child is then named for both sides of the family
and given names of the deceased to emphasize continuity of the clan.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> While naming is an important part of a child's life, subsequent
birthdays are not always celebrated.  In Zambia only 63% of the respondents
indicated that birthdays were celebrated, 11% said they were celebrated
sometimes, and 26% said they were not celebrated. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>   6. <i> Infant deaths</i></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>In traditional cultures there have always been high infant mortality
rates.  Thus one of the areas of interest is how societies understand the
reasons for and respond to an infant's death. In the studies included in the
Workshop, it was reported that it was difficult to get information on infant
deaths as these are not commonly discussed.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In Malawi the death is handled with secrecy, and in fact, it is taboo
to talk about infants dying.  In Zambia also, infant deaths are not often
discussed.  Deaths are attributed to witchcraft and little more is said about
them.  In Malawi and Nigeria there is little discussion of abortion and/or
still births.  Thus it is hard to obtain accurate data on the reasons for these
deaths. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>C.   Caretakers at different ages and their specific
roles;</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Once the child is born and is on the road to survival there are
different people that care for and assist in the raising of the child.  Across
all the cultures studied there is a progression from the mother, to others in
the family, to 'extended' family members, to the community at large. The
rapidity with which this happens differs, depending on the culture and its
stage of  'modernization'.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In the study from Zambia it was noted that traditionally there was no
concept of the 'extended' family - everyone was family.  Even in the 1984
sample households included adults other than parents and 16% of the children
were being looked after by someone other than their biological parents.
(Chibuye et al., 1986, pg.44)  The concept of the community, or everyone being
responsible for the child was echoed in the work from Malawi, where the saying
is 'Mwana wanzako ndiwako yemwe, ukachenjera manja udyanaye'.  Nurture any
child, even those who are not your own, for in the future they will look after
you. (Kalemba, 1993, pg.6).  All children belong to the clan or family. The
concept of a "bastard" does not exist.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>What follows is a more specific description of caretaking during the
various stages of infancy and early childhood.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b><i>     </i>1.  <i>Infancy</i></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>During the first year of the child's life the primary caregiver is the
mother.  The child is generally fed on demand, and is carried by and sleeps
with the mother, leading to a physical and emotional closeness between the
mother and infant.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In Nigeria the interaction between the mother and child occurs
primarily in skin-to-skin contact providing the children with "unconditional
warmth".  The researchers noted that this was in contrast to the West where the
contact comes through eye contact and cuddling and kissing. (Akinware &amp;
Ojomo, 1993,  pg. 25)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In Mali the child's mother is the initial caregiver until the child
is at least 1 year of age.  However, among the Bambara grandmothers play a very
important role as well.  Among the Bambara,  "social coherence and security are
considered a goal which every child's education should help foster."  (Dembele
&amp; Poulton, 1993,  pg. 7)  To reach this goal the people have developed a
system of child care where young children in the village, in small groups, are
looked after by the grandmothers. While the grandmothers do not have the energy
to do the caretaking themselves, they provide instruction to and supervise
children, sometimes as young as four years of age, who are caring for even
younger children. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> It Malawi it is women who care for children at anytime day and night.
The woman's workload, which includes fetching water and fuelwood, gardening and
domestic chores, means that she must adapt her lifestyle to accommodate the
needs of her children. In this process, children sometimes suffer as, for
example, when their feeding needs are in conflict with the mother's work
demands. <p>
     <p>
     In all the cultural groups studied, men play a minor role in the early years.
In Mali it was noted that men stay "aloof"  in terms of caring for children.
In Malawi  most men are traditionally distanced from their children; they
rarely hold and play with them. (Kalemba, 1993,  pg  13)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> As the child gets older, however, fathers interact more with the
child and take more responsibility for the child's socialization.  Overall,
however, men are generally associated with the provision of financial support
while women are seen as the ones responsible for nurturing.  As noted in the
Nigerian study, males pay for school fees, women care for and feed the child.
This view of the differences between what women and men provide for a child
continues as the child grows older. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b><i>     </i>2.<i>  Toddlers</i></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>The toddler period (18 months to 3 years) is a time of moving out from
the mother.  It is during this time that children stop breastfeeding.
Children spend time exploring their environment.  They are taken care of by
older siblings and learn quickly from them.  In general children have few
things to play with.  Sometimes there are toys that are made by siblings or
older members of the community.  <p>
     In some culture fathers get more involved with the children during this stage.
In Nigeria the child as a toddler is more attractive to the father.  Now he
will carry and play with the child.  The father also takes on a somewhat
negative role in that he is  'the law' when the child begins walking and moving
out on his own.  The father is also the decision-maker in the family.  75% of
the health care decisions are made by the father, except in families where the
mother has some education.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In the Nigerian study where there were both a rural and an urban
sample, the role of the fathers was found to be different in the two settings.
In rural areas males are more tolerant of children's behaviour as there is more
space.  Thus children are not as disciplined in rural as urban areas.  Within
the Nigerian group, one of the positive features of being in an urban area is
that there is a higher probability of father-child attachment due to the fact
that there is less help available from other members of the family and
community.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> The Nigerian study also looked at what was happening for the child
emotionally during toddlerhood.  The researchers saw this time as presenting a
conflict for children as they make a shift in their loyalties.  "At some stage
in the early childhood, there is a complex ambivalence in the Nigerian society
about the greater attachment to the mother on the one hand and the greater
loyalty demanded for the father on the other hand, and this interplays in the
rearing of the child." (Akinware &amp; Ojomo, 1993, pg.30) <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> The necessity to shift from the mother as the focus of care and
attention to the ever expanding world of 'others' was evidenced in all the
cultures.  As the child enters the early childhood period (ages 3-6 years) this
movement away from the mother is even more pronounced.<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><i>   </i>4.  <b><i>Early Childhood  3-6</i></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>It is during the early childhood years that the child becomes
socialized into appropriate male and female roles and begins taking on adult
responsibilities - around the house and in terms of family business, whatever
that might be.  The contact between the child and the mother is greatly reduced
during these years and the child learns to interact with a variety of other
people.  For example, among the Uukwaluudhi, only 10% of the children in this
age group are with their mother all day;  52% of the mothers reported they had
no contact with their child during the day.  It is at this point that others
take on some responsibility for caring for the child.  Older siblings (43%) or
grandparents (30%) were the primary caregivers.  It is important to note that
the father contributed  less to the child's care than either siblings or
grandparents.  60% were completely absent. (Zimba &amp; Otaala, 1992, pgs. 14,
17) Older children enjoy considerable liberty and essentially take care of
themselves as elders look after the younger children. <p>
     <p>
     Play is an important part of the child's life.  A common saying in the West is
that 'play is the work of children'. This is also the belief of the Bambara in
Mali.  Children's play is extremely important among the Bambara.  Members of a
Bamanan family play pretend games with the child.  When the child can sit, a
four-year-old sibling is asked to play with it. (Dembele &amp; Poulton, 1993,
pg. 5)  However,  adults and siblings are not always directly involved in a
child's play.  Sometimes they watch the child's play from a distance.  <p>
      <p>
     As in Mali, many of the adults among the Uukwaluudhi in Namibia did not think
it was appropriate for adults - particularly fathers - to play with children.
Not too surprisingly this lack of direct adult involvement with children leads
to many accidents.  Among the Uukwaluudhi, 24% of the children had been
involved in domestic accidents. Hot water and fire were the main causes of the
accidents.  In 33% of the cases these accidents took place when the children
were alone.  In the other instances they were in the company of older siblings
or busy mothers.  When asked how accidents could be prevented 60% of the
respondents said they had no idea. (Zimba &amp; Otaala, 1991, pg.69)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Toys for the pre-school age group are now sophisticated, but they are
not expensive.  In  Zambia children play with balls, clay toys, wire toys,
bottles, and tins, all of which are made from things found in the environment.
For the most part the children make these themselves (59% reported doing so).
Other toys are bought and/or made by parents.     <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Among the Uukwaluudhi in Namibia, there are more toys available to
the pre-school aged child than are available to infants. Caregivers reported
they are more likely to make toys for older children than for infants and
toddlers.  85% of the children reported making their own toys, 54% said
caregivers made toys for them.  During the early childhood period, the kinds of
games and toys available to children are  supportive of children's cognitive
and psycho-social development.<p>
<p>
<b>D.     Child rearing practices and beliefs in relation to the promotion of
health, nutrition, cognitive and psycho-social development.  </b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>While the first two years are a critical time in terms of the child's
physical survival, they are also critical in terms of building the foundations
for cognitive and psycho-social development.  But these latter aspects of a
child's growth and development have not been researched to the extent that
health and nutrition practices have been.  Thus while the studies yielded rich
information on cultural beliefs and practices that would impact a child's
health, less information was available on child rearing practices and beliefs
related to the full range of a child's development. What follows is a brief
description of what was found in relation to health and nutrition beliefs and
practices, and a description of activities that take place which help promote
cognitive and psycho-social development.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b><i>     </i>1.  <i>Health</i></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>The studies revealed that currently people are using a mix of western
and traditional medicines in the healing of diseases. All of the cultures
studied have been exposed to Western medicine to some degree.  This is
evidenced from the reports on the use of health clinics for pre-natal care and
treatment for infants and young children.  The timing of <i>when </i>Western
medicine is used appears to depend on availability and ease of access rather
than beliefs about the value of Western versus traditional medicine.<p>
     <p>
     In Nigeria, in urban areas where there is access to western medicine, parents
buy western drugs first and if these fail then parents turn to traditional
medicines.  In rural areas traditional medicines are used first and other
health care sought outside the village only if the traditional medicines do not
work.   In Nigeria there are 2 traditional systems of health care - the
indigenous healers who were in existence before colonial times and a recent
group referred to as 'syncretic churches'.  While seemingly different, there is
a high degree of convergence between the two.  They both use: herbal medicines,
divination, exorcism, symbolic rituals, incision, and non-formal psychotherapy.
Syncretic practitioners are consulted by people from all walks of life, rural
and urban, literate and illiterate, Christians and Muslims.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In Zambia, all respondents reported using traditional herbal
medicines to heal childhood accidents and diseases.  In addition, about 50%,
those who lived relatively near health centres, took their children to the
clinics.  Most people (91%) correctly understood the purpose of immunizations.
(Chibuye, et al., 1986, pg. 33)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b><i>     </i>2. <i> Nutrition</i></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Nutrition is a critical feature of young children's development. Thus
within each of the reports there was considerable reporting on breastfeeding
and weaning practices.  The reports include a description of what happens
physically and some reports provide an indication of how changes in practice
impact on the child emotionally.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <b><i>a.  Breastfeeding.</i></b><i> </i> During the first two years
of the child's life, there is a fairly uniform pattern across all the cultures
presented at the Workshop.  Children are carried on the mother's back and are
breastfed on demand during the early months.  At the point at which the mother
wants to stop breastfeeding the child is separated from the mother.  Sometimes
care for the child is shifted to someone else even though the mother is around.
In other instances the child is actually sent from the village to relatives
elsewhere.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Breastfeeding is common in Zambia. 97% of those in the study said
they breastfed their babies, most on-demand. 53% said they breastfed until the
child was between 1 and 1 1/2 years old. 42% said they breastfed for more than
2 years.   Nigeria is not unlike Zambia.  In Nigeria nearly 100% of the mothers
breastfeed, generally for about 18 months.  Those in rural areas breastfeed for
longer than those in urban areas. Breastfeeding is on demand and is used as a
pacifier in addition to being used to feed the child.  Unfortunately those with
the most education breastfeed for the least amount of time. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Among the Yoruba a traditional practice was the force feeding of
medicinal (agbo) teas soon after birth and later 'pap' (cereals) to infants.
These practices are not followed by more literate women.  In the other cultures
included in the Workshop, only breastmilk is provided until the child is at
least  three months old.  <p>
     <p>
     <b>  b<i>. The introduction of weaning foods.  </i></b>In Namibia, exclusive
breastfeeding lasts no longer than the sixth month. Most mothers start
providing additional food after the third month.  The most common addition
being a porridge known as 'omahangu'.   Of those in the Namibian sample,  78%
reported that children have three meals a day.  For those who have less this is
due either to a lack of food or lack of caregiver time to prepare the food.
The pattern for adults is two meals a day. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Like in Namibia, the practice in Malawi was to introduce solid foods
at about the 3rd month.  While the range of ages within which children stop
breastfeeding, is from 6 months to two + years, it is most common for children
to be breastfed for two years.  If the mother dies the surrogate mother
breastfeeds, if possible .<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> As the Malawian child becomes a toddler, breastfeeding continues for
some.  The frequency of their eating solid foods is tied to that of adults,
among whom food is shared communally 2-3 times a day.  There are some food
taboos, most notably the taboo against eating eggs.  Early on children are
taught self-feeding skills.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In Mali, children are given no special weaning foods. They eat the
same foods as those given to adults, with the exception being that children are
not given eggs.  However children eat more frequently than adults.  In Zambia,
children are expected to begin eating on their own at a young age: 92% of the
respondents said children are eating on their own before age 1.  While
children's eating is supervised primarily by the mothers, other relatives also
participate in this activity.  There are also food taboos in this culture.
Children should not eat 'hard foods, sweet stuff, game meat and eggs', nor
should there be too much variety in their diet.   (Chibuye, et al., 1986,  pg.
25)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In terms of food distribution, in both Nigeria and Zambia, feeding
follows a hierarchy, with adults eating the good food first and the remains
passed from the oldest to the youngest child.  In times of scarcity the
youngest suffer the most.  In Zambia males and females are fed separately.
Male children generally eat with adult males, but female children eat on their
own. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <b>c. <i>Complete weaning.</i> </b> In most of the cultures studied,
the most common way to end breastfeeding was to remove the child from the
mother.<b> </b>In Mali, when the mother wants to stop breastfeeding the child
she sends the child away overnight to a relative   <b> </b>Complete weaning in
Namibia occurs by putting bitter substances on the nipples, sending children
away to their grandparents or simply refusing the child access to the breast.
In Zambia, 47% said they stopped breastfeeding abruptly,  46% said it was a
gradual process. (69% used feeding bottles when weaning the child from the
breast.)  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> It was only in the Namibian study that there was some attempt to look
at the impact of  abrupt  withdrawal of breastfeeding.  In that study adults
reported that children's immediate response to complete weaning was to cry a
lot (41.3%), become sad (34.8%), and become irritable (8.7%).  15.2% of the
caregivers reported that there was no response.  They reported that sometimes
children refuse to eat other foods and withdraw, becoming listless.  (Zimba
&amp; Otaala, 1991, pg. 79)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b><i>     </i>3.<i>  Cognitive and Psycho-Social
Development</i></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>In the Mali study there was specific emphasis on the ways in which
traditional practices impacted on a child's cognitive development.  Thus within
that study there was a discussion of the ways in which traditional games,
songs, and stories are supportive of children's overall development.  The
researchers noted that many traditional games promote cognitive development.
"They necessitate recalling, memorizing, sequencing and logical thinking.
Traditional tales and riddles ... help develop intellectual capacity." Dembele
&amp; Poulton, 1993, pg. 11)  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <b>a.<i>  Language development.</i>  </b>Language development is
promoted through the use of language with children.  In Mali, adults talk to
children from the moment they are born.  As the child grows older (ages 3-6)
there is a conscious teaching of language skills through story telling,
questioning, songs.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> This pattern is similar in Namibia.  About 82% of the mothers
reported talking to their children at birth, but they do not describe
themselves as telling children stories.  In fact, 86% said they did not tell
stories, claiming children could not understand them.  29% of the adults
reported talking to, singing with and teaching children traditional dances.
While parents said that they helped foster language development by asking
children to get things, name them, touch them, they claim they do not talk
about the objects nor describe them to the child. (Zimba &amp; Otaala,  1991,
pg. 15)  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> As in Mali, the Namibia sample reported doing more things to
stimulate language development when children are within the pre-school age
group. 46% of the caregivers reported telling stories to pre-school aged
children.  71% of them asked children to tell their own stories.  76% of the
caregivers reported teaching the children songs about people, animals, birds,
religion and politics.  96% reported answering children's questions, and 87% of
them said they asked children to describe events that took place in the
community.  (Zimba &amp; Otaala,  1991,  pg. 16)  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In Zambia, the games that children engage in include hide-and-seek,
ball games, singing and dancing. (Chibuye et. al., 1986, pg. 29)  31% of the
parents said they played with the children sometimes; 80% said they told their
children stories and proverbs.  The majority of the story-tellers are the women
(40% mothers, 5% fathers).   (Chibuye, et al.,  1986,  pg. 84)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <b>b.<i>  Psycho-social development: the importance of
chores.</i></b><i>  </i>Another way that psycho-social development is promoted
in many traditional cultures is through the chores children are asked to
perform.  The Bamanan children in Mali, for example, have specific tasks they
are expected to undertake from an early age.  Under the age of four, these
tasks are not differentiated by sex.  Over the age of four, boys are expected
to care for poultry and animals, learn manual labour such as hiving and mat
weaving and cutting thatch for roofing.  Girls do house-related chores.  Both
boys and girls run errands for those older than they, scare birds and monkeys
from the field, provide the elderly with firewood, and engage in caregiving of
younger siblings.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Chores are important in other cultures as well.  In Zambia, 53% of
the parents expected children ages 4-6 to be helping with the chores.  As in
Mali there are different chores depending on the sex of the child, although
there is some overlap.  Boys are involved in gardening, fetching firewood,
running errands and washing plates.  The chores for girls include washing
plates, fetching water and firewood, bathing babies, running errands, pounding
food, and cooking.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In Namibia chores were also allocated depending on the child's
gender.  The most frequent tasks performed by boys in Namibia included looking
after goats and cattle, collecting and chopping firewood, plowing and fetching
water.  For girls the most frequently tasks were fetching water, cooking,
collecting firewood, pounding grain, washing up, and cleaning.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> Beyond simply looking at the kinds of chores that children performed,
in the Namibia study an attempt was made to understand how children were taught
the chores, the kind of rewards they received for doing a task well and how
they were treated if they did not perform well.  The researchers  asked the
caregiver how they responded to the way children performed their tasks.   93%
of the caregivers reported thanking children and praising them for performing
tasks successfully.  About 46% clarified tasks when children failed to
accomplish them, while 52% responded to a child's failure by rebuking or
punishing the child.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In terms of more general socialization,  74% of the adults said there
would smile back in  response to a child's smile.   They were less responsive
to children's requests to play and seldom offered help.  When the child had
difficulty with a task, 29% said they would tell the child how to do it and
have them try again.  18% blamed the child for his/her failure, and a small
percentage would simply have someone else do the task.  (Zimba &amp; Otaala,
1991, pg. 58)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> In some studies there were specific questions relating to how
children are taught to be obedient.  In Zambia 60% of the adults stated that
children are corrected by beating, 30% use reasoning, and 7% verbally rebuke
the child.  But once again, boys and girls are not treated the same.  It was
stated that boys need more severe punishment since they are stronger than girls
and more 'notorious'. (Chibuye, et. al,  1986,  pg 28)  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b><i>     </i>4. <i> Education</i></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>   a.  <i>Non-formal education.</i> </b> In Malawi, the researchers
looked at who taught children different skills.  The results indicated that
mothers and siblings talk to and cuddle the child.  Further, the child is
taught to sit, talk, crawl and walk by the mother and siblings. Toileting and
independent living skills are taught by the mother.  Language is introduced by
both the mother and siblings both of whom teach the child to walk.  Songs,
dance, games, riddles are introduced by the wider community through play with
older children and interaction with adults.  (Kalemba, 1993, pg. 10)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <b>b<i>. Formal education.</i> </b> In terms of attendance in school,
parents in the Zambian study reported that they sent their children to school,
but the age at which children were sent varied (from 5 years to 9 years of
age).  Parents reported that they sent the children when they were "ready".
94% said it was important to send both boys and girls to school.  The reasons
given were: "so that they are both given a chance to succeed (46%); they should
have an equal opportunity (34%). (Chibuye et al.., 1986,  pg. 30)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>E. The degree of traditionalism (traditional, transitional, modern)
evident in current child rearing practices and beliefs;</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>One of the major tasks of the workshop was to analyze the reports on
child rearing practices and beliefs in terms of the extent to which traditional
practices still held sway and the extent to which the traditional practices had
been 'modernized'.  The report on Malawi addressed this question specifically.
As these were presented researchers from the other countries indicated that
similar changes were taking place within the societies they studied.  What
follows is a summary of the perceived changes.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>1.</b>  Most traditional child rearing practices persist to date in
some form, although they have been influenced by changes occurring in the
society as a whole.  For example, pregnancy is no longer as sensitive a subject
as it was.  The reason for this is that there is considerable modern
information available and being provided to women.  When they receive this
information they are encouraged to talk about their own situation.   Pregnant
mothers are now eating foods which benefit  the unborn child, although
traditionally  these foods were taboo.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>2.</b>  Traditional practices related to the birth of the child are
still persistent, with TBAs and close relatives playing a crucial role in
helping to deliver the child.  However, increasingly children are being born in
health facilities and the traditional practices are not being followed.  Also,
the confinement period is breaking down for those who deliver their child in
the hospital or birthing clinic.  This is due to short hospital stays and being
exposed to the public on discharge from the maternity hospital.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>3.</b>  There are still strong taboos surrounding the discussion of
still births and abortions.   It is unclear if women have more accurate
information about the causes of still births since still births are not
discussed openly.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>4.</b>  People now have correct information regarding the causes of
kwashiorkor and marasmus.  They know they are caused by poor nutrition and
improper feeding habits rather than infidelity.  Also there is an understanding
that witches do not cause diseases like measles.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>5.</b>  Mothers and siblings are still the primary caregivers.  In
cities, increasingly there is the use of nannies.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>6.</b>  Girls' enrolment in school has decreased their role as child
minders. While unsubstantiated by research,  there is a fear that this has
increased the risk to infants and young children who are deprived of care as a
result of the older girls attending school. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>7. </b> Most mothers still breastfeed on demand, but increasingly
they are decreasing the number of months they breastfeed. Bottle feeding is
practiced in towns and to a large extent by working mothers. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>8</b>.  Post-partum abstinence is no longer ruled by tradition,
making child spacing a problem.  There is no longer the taboo against a
breastfeeding woman becoming pregnant.  A related problem is the fact that when
a woman becomes pregnant she stops breastfeeding, thus shortening the amount of
time the child receives breastmilk.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>9.</b>  The bond between the mother and child is weakening as the
child is now left to be taken care of by siblings or other caregivers earlier
than this would have happened traditionally.  There is a sense that care, such
as feeding and bathing, may no longer be as consistent as it was when the young
child was always with the mother.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>10.</b> The youngest children continue to have the lowest status in
terms of receiving food in the communal eating situation. When there is a
shortage of food, the youngest suffer most.  This is indicated by increased
mortality rates for children between 12 and 24 months when breastmilk is less
available (or not available at all) and it is not being replaced by appropriate
foods.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>11.</b> Large families continue to be valued, particularly in rural
areas.  The high fertility rates among the groups studied is indicative of
this.  With limited resources, the care of children is problematic.  Further,
the fact that increasingly child spacing is a problem means that children are
not given adequate care.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>12.</b> Some traditional beliefs about illness persist,
particularly in terms of cures.  The extent to which families use traditional
medicines depends on their proximity and ease of access to Western health care.
Rural families turn to traditional medicines first.  When those don't work
modern medical treatment is sought.  Sometimes, this comes too late.   Urban
families, with access to and experience with Western medicine tend to turn to
it first.  Traditional medicine is sought when Western medicine is found
lacking. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>In sum, there are instances where more 'modern' practices are
replacing traditional practices.  In some instances the replacements are of
benefit to the mother and child, as in the situation where women have more
information about the conceptualization, pregnancy and birth process and they
are using this information  to assure the birth of a health baby and to take
care of themselves physically.  However, there are a number of instances where
the more 'modern'  practices  have supplanted the traditional and this has had
a negative impact on the child and/or the mother.  This is true in the case of
child spacing and the introduction of bottle feeding.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <p>
<b>F.     Where there is agreement between traditional practices and "scientific"
knowledge;</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Too often the assumption is made that what is 'traditional' is based
on myths and beliefs which are not scientifically valid.  The reasoning goes
further.  Since traditional lack scientific backing they are invalid and should
be changed.  Those attending the workshop were not willing to accept this
conclusion.  There was a strong feeling that there are a number of traditional
child rearing beliefs and practices that are very much in agreement with
current scientific thinking.  One of the tasks of the Workshop was to identify
those practices which are beneficial from both points of view.  What follows is
a listing of those generated during the workshop:<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>1.</b>  The practice of breastfeeding the child on demand and
breastfeeding for a lengthy period of time are both beneficial.  The issue is
that in times of food shortage, children may not be given anything other than
breastmilk.  From the sixth month on children require more than just
breastmilk.  Another issue is the fact that the mothers themselves may be very
undernourished and breastfeeding further depletes their own resources.  <p>
<b>2.</b> The mother-child bond is also in line with current scientific
knowledge about the importance of a primary relationship for the child, a
relationship that provides the child with basic security as he/she moves out
into the world at large.  In most of the cultures presented at the Workshop,
traditionally there was constant contact between the mother and child for at
least the first year.  Mothers carried their children on their backs, spoke to
and cuddled the child. Mothers also slept with their children until they were
between two and three years of age.  This helped strengthen the bond between
them.  The Malawi study indicated that under these conditions, cot deaths are
extremely rare. This was ascribed to the physical closeness between the mother
and infant.  (Kalemba,  1993,  pg. 14)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>3. </b>      The community as a whole takes responsibility for raising
the child.  As children grow a variety of people are involved in their care,
socialization and education.  Caregivers include siblings, grandmothers, other
relatives, and eventually the community.  Expectations in terms of a child's
behaviour are reinforced by community members.  Thus the child is given a
consistent image of what he/she should become.  Scientific knowledge also
reinforces the importance of children having a number of people that he/she can
turn to for support and guidance.  A nuclear family, particularly one headed by
a single parent, provides the child with few resources.  The resources
available within an extended family can be of great benefit to a child.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>4. </b> Play is viewed as an important part of a child's
development within both traditional and more modern views of the child.
Traditional cultures have provided toys and playthings made from materials
found in the environment.  The skills required to make these toys are handed
down from generation to generation.    The act of making the toy brings the
adult into the life of the child.   <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>5. </b> There are traditional games that children play which
stimulate cognitive development (problem solving, math, and reasoning skills)
and which support the development of  communication skills.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>6.</b>  The songs, stories and riddles handed down through the oral
tradition are an important part of children's learning process, promoting
language as well as social development.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>7.</b>  Children develop a sense of social responsibility through
their involvement in age-appropriate tasks.  From these they learn obedience,
helpfulness, cooperation, and respect.<p>
 <p>
In sum,  in the sub-Saharan cultures represented at the Workshop, the
traditional world of the child is very rich.  "By the time a child goes to
school it will have had a very wide experience of its own environment."
(Kalemba, 1993, pg 14)   This experience needs to be acknowledged and built
upon<p>
to promote the child's development.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>G. Where there are disagreements between the traditional and
scientific practices being promoted</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>While there are many traditional beliefs and practices that are
supported by current understanding of how to promote healthy growth and
development, there are some that are 'at odds' with current theory.  These were
also explored at the Workshop.  What follows is a description of  some of these
practices.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>1.  </b>     Traditional food taboos for pregnant women can have a
negative impact on the child's development and the woman's own health.  For
example, taboos against eating eggs, fish and certain types of meat limit
women's intake of protein.  What is of interest is the fact that the specifics
of the food taboos are so similar across all the cultures studied.  Unanswered
questions include:  Why do these widely geographically divergent cultures have
such similar food taboos?   How did these taboos develop?   What function have
they served historically?  Are they important today?<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>2.</b>  There are practices associated with the birth of the child
that are potentially dangerous for the child.  The use of unsterilized
instruments to cut the umbilical cord and applying dung or ash to the wound
increase the risk of infection.  These practices are easily addressed, although
changing the behaviour of TBAs who do not have access to appropriate
instruments and medicines is more difficult.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>3. </b> The practices related to the introduction of solid foods
varied considerably across the cultures studied. While in some cultures solids,
in the form of a porridge, were introduced as early as 3 months of age, in
other settings solid foods are introduced much later.  In most cases children
are provided maize meal or a single type of porridge as the only weaning food.
Frequently there is imbalance between solid foods and breastfeeding with the
result being an inadequately nourished child.  While is some instances this
lack of balance is the result of lack of knowledge about what a child requires,
at other times families lack access to appropriate food. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>4. </b> Feeding patterns are not based on an understanding of
children's developmental needs (i.e. that children need to eat small amounts of
food at frequent intervals rather than large quantities at 2-3 sittings).  In
most traditional cultures children are fed when adults are fed. This amounts to
being fed only twice a day in Malawi.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>5</b>.  Across the cultures examined at the Workshop, fathers are at
a distance from the child rearing process.   While they may be part of the
presentation of the child to the community, they take little or no
responsibility for the child during the early years.  Sometimes as the child
gets older (age 3+) the father will take some interest in the child and get
involved, at least in a minimal way, in the child's socialization.   The
pattern across cultures in terms of the urban father's involvement with
children differed.   While in urban Nigeria the father tended to get more
involved with the child since there were fewer extended family members
available to help provide care, in Malawi, the additional stresses of urban
life meant that the father was even more distant from the child. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>6</b>.  Tradition sets clear boundaries on roles based on gender.
Children are socialized very early into appropriate roles.  This is done
through the assignment of chores and tasks, based on the child's gender.
There is little opportunity for children to explore their full range of
interests.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>7.</b>  There is little recognition by the formal school system of
the knowledge, skills and beliefs that children bring to school.   This is not
a problem of the traditional culture, it is a problem with current practice.
The formal school system, most often implicitly, assumes that children lack
knowledge and skills in relation to problem-solving, reasoning, maths and
language when they  come from a 'traditional' setting.   Little is done to
assess what children already know, how they think,  and what they have
experienced.    Teachers are assuming they are dealing with a 'blank slate'
when in fact children arrive at school with a wealth of experiences behind them
that need to be recognized and built upon.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>VII.     Developing  Appropriate Programmes</b><p>
<b></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><i>The challenge lies in changing the negative things without changing
the positive ones.  Unfortunately experience has shown that new changes bring
new problems...It is therefore important to fully understand the implications
of any action before embarking on it, </i>                                 
Kalemba, 1993,  pg. 17<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>The primary reason for looking at the ways in which traditional
beliefs and practices coincide with more recent thinking is for the purpose of
creating programmes which support the positive and provide alternatives for the
negative practices and beliefs.  Thus the final task of the Workshop was to
develop principles that could be used in the development  of programmes which
supported the growth and development of children within the context of their
family and community.   The principles of programming generated by the group
coincide with what is known as a result of considerable programming experience
and an accumulated knowledge about the kinds of approaches that are most
effective.  For example:<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> <p>
<b>A.     Gather the relevant information. </b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> All agreed that there is a need for in-depth studies of specific
topics rather than the kind of broad sweep studies that have been carried out
to date.   An example of an in-depth study was the one in Mali where the focus
was on understanding how traditional child care systems work.  Another was the
study in Namibia where the researchers were asked to look specifically at child
rearing practices that supported children's cognitive and socio-emotional
development.   While these studies were focussed on providing an in-depth look
at a particular aspect of a culture, additional data were gathered that
provided a picture of the overall context within which children are being
raised.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>        </b><p>
<b>B.     Build on what exists.</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>It is important to recognize, acknowledge and build on what the
community provides.  Traditional systems have evolved sustainable caregiving
systems whereby members of the society are brought up and socialized.  Once
these are identified they can be built upon.  This will ensure that supports
developed with communities are culturally sensitive, meaningful, and
sustainable. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>C.       Involve the community.</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Involve the community in the development of the project. Success comes
through involving the people themselves in creating projects which benefit
their children.  In addition to creating a service that is needed, there can be
some spin-off benefits that are unanticipated. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>D.</b>  <b>Create partnerships. </b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>In order to make programmes sustainable it is important to develop
partnerships.  Partnerships can be created among parents and communities,
governments, non-governmental organizations and other organizations.  Such
collaboration appears to be the key to meeting costs and extending the
financing base as well as to sustainability.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>E. </b> <b>Demystify the services. </b><p>
<b></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Professionals frequently feel that extensive training and an in-depth
understanding is required to perform a function well.  Yet, many of the tasks
that lead to a better quality of life can be simplified and made accessible to
people with little formal education.  Again the example comes from Malawi
where, as a result of simple technologies, people have developed safer birth
practices, provided the community with water, created pre-school centres, and
undertaken growth monitoring and the treatment of common ailments. (Kalemba,
1993,  pg. 16)<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>F. Seek to upgrade the quality of life in the entire village.
</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Children will benefit from an uplifting of the general living
conditions, especially for women.  Firstly this would allow mothers more time
to look after their children and secondly there would be more resources at the
disposal of the family. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>G.</b>  <b>Provide integrated services. </b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>People's lives are not as fragmented as government social services.
We know that multi-sectoral supports are more effective than mono-focal
efforts.  In the early years development is closely tied to health and
nutrition.  Supports for children in the first three years must take a holistic
approach, including attention to mental, social, as well as physical
development.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>H.</b>  <b>Build on existing programmes. </b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>An effective way to keep costs manageable is to build child care and
development components into existing programmes.  Options that have been tried
include incorporating early childhood development actions into on-going adult
education, community development, child care, health and/or nutrition
programmes.  This strategy avoids the need for the development of expensive new
infrastructure.  Although not without cost, experience shows that such
integration can be efficient and produce a synergism that benefits the original
programme.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Beyond these rather general guidelines that provide a framework for
the development of programmes and policies, specific recommendations were made
at the Workshop as to how an understanding of traditional child rearing
practices and beliefs could be used as the basis for the development of support
systems for families with young children. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>VIII.   Analysis of Beliefs as the Basis for Action</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Within the workshop there was an opportunity to take a traditional
practice or belief related to a child's socio-emotional or cognitive
development and to try and develop an intervention that appropriately built on
positive practices and helped change some of the more negative practices.  This
task turned out to be a challenge and there was not adequate time to fully work
through the various interventions the groups decided upon.  Thus the results of
the small group discussion are not included in this report.  However, the group
developed a general procedure for establishing an intervention programme based
on an analysis of traditional attitudes, beliefs and practices.  A description
of that process follows.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>A.  </b>  <b>     Gain an overall view of the practices and beliefs
within a given culture.</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>One of the tasks of current researchers is to explore questions such
as:  What practices have fallen by the wayside over time?  Why?  (Because they
were practices that no longer served the culture?  Because they could not be
maintained due to changes in caregivers?  Because of the introduction of
"scientific" knowledge? <b>[4]</b>  As a result of
changes in child rearing practices have some good practices been lost?  What
practices have been maintained?  How do they serve the culture of today?  Why
are some practices that we know to be harmful still being maintained (e.g. the
circumcision of girls)?  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>B. Identify the particular attitudes/beliefs/practices related to
your area of interest.</b> <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>The first step is to identify what the current practice is in relation
to an area that either needs to be given more support in the culture or one
where you desire to see changes made. During the Workshop the participants
generated a list of indicators that are useful in beginning the process of
identifying child rearing beliefs and practices related to specific variables
(e.g. safe motherhood, gender issues in seeking preventative care, child care,
psycho-social stimulation, etc.)  In relation to each of these variables
suggestions were made as to how appropriate data can be gathered, in terms of
sources of information, data collection tools that might be used, and
methodologies to be employed.  This information is presented in Annex A.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> As can be seen in Annex A, one of the primary ways of collecting
valid data is through the use of Focus Groups and RAP strategies.  These can be
used with leaders in the community. The more the whole community is involved in
this process, the more fruitful the outcome and the more likely they are to
become involved in the intervention that is developed.<p>
     <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>C.      Assess those beliefs and practices in relation to 'scientific'
knowledge.</b><p>
<b></b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>If the traditional practice is in agreement with the current
understanding of ways in which children's growth and development can be
promoted, then it is important to find ways to support that activity.  It is
also important to explore what serves as a reinforcer for that practice and to
identify what might interfere with its continuation.  For example, it would be
useful to ask if there are changes within the broader socio-political context
that are likely to have a negative impact on positive practices.   If so,  one
question to answer is, can the potentially negative impact be avoided by
strengthening the  current practice?<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> While some of the traditional practices and beliefs identified will
be in accord with current thinking, there will be others that are not.  When
the traditional and more modern practices are at odds with one another (e.g.
negative feedback to children that deceases their feelings of self-worth), then
strategy D can  be undertaken. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>D.</b>  <b>Identify the function the belief/practice serves in the
society.</b> <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>It is important to ask, why is the practice what it is?  How has it
evolved?  Most traditions have evolved in response to changing needs within the
environment and culture.  It can be hypothesized that some practices are held
onto although they are no longer really functional for the culture.  But more
needs to be known about whether or not this is true.  The more that is
understood about a practice and/or belief, the more likely it is that a way can
be found to introduce changes. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>E.</b>  <b>Identify how vulnerable the practice/belief  is to being
changed</b>.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Once a practice is understood more completely, then it is possible to
determine whether or not it is amenable to change.  The best strategy is to
begin with a practice that appears to be vulnerable to change.  If people are
beginning to question the practice, then it may be open to being changed.
Questioning can lead to discussion.  This provides an opportunity for people to
receive new information.  Alternatives can be discussed and perhaps tried.
Once one behaviour or practice has been changed, people may be more willing to
look at some of the practices that at this point appear to be  intractable. <p>
          <p>
If the practice appears to be malleable,  then it is possible to move to step
F. <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>F. </b> <b>Identify what would motivate someone to change the
current practice. </b> <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>What is reinforcing the current practice?  Given the reinforcers in
the current situation, what might be used to motivate someone to change?   An
example comes from the Malawi study where traditionally children were not
bathed very often.  Rather than telling people they had to bathe their children
to make them more healthy, the strategy was to find a way to motivate the women
to bathe their children frequently.  The answer came when a childcare programme
was created.  A rule was made that in order for children to participate in the
programme they had to arrive bathed and in clean clothes.  As a result mothers
began to keep their children cleaner because they wanted their children in the
child care.  Child care was something the mothers valued. There was no need to
'preach' to the mothers about the value of keeping children clean. The desire
to have the child in the programme was what changed the mother's behaviour, not
the abstract concept that this would help keep the child healthy.  (Kalemba,
1993,  pg.  16) <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>G.</b>  <b>Develop the intervention in line with the behaviours you
want to change.  </b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>The strategy so far has provided data on the problem, as defined by
the community.  It has also allowed those involved in planning the programme to
understand the child rearing practices and beliefs associated with the problem.
With this background there is a basis for determining project goals and
actually putting a project in place.  The case studies presented at the
Workshop provided examples of how this might be done.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt><b>IX.      Summary</b><tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>The strategy developed at the Workshop is untried.  However, the idea
of working from child rearing practices to create appropriate programmes is
not..  At the present time there are a number of projects being implemented
which are based on an understanding of child rearing beliefs and practices.
These have been developed primarily by UNICEF in Egypt, Namibia and Nigeria.
Other donor agencies have also begun to develop programmes using this strategy.
The Save the Children USA project in Mali is an example of this.  Among donor
agencies and non-governmental agencies there is increasing interest in
developing the strategy more fully.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> The exchange that took place during at the Workshop in Namibia
provided a better understanding of both the rationale for and the process of
using child rearing practices and beliefs as the basis for programme
development.  It is hoped that readers of this document will be stimulated to
understand more about the traditional beliefs and practices of those they are
working with and will find ways to reinforce the positive practices and begin
to change practices which are debilitating to women and children.  <p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt> The remarks made by Dr. Katjavivi in his opening of the workshop
serve as a summary of the challenges ahead.   He noted, <i>Traditional African
societies are rooted in the family.  However, with the rapid socio-economic
changes that have taken place in most countries, the traditional ways of
bringing up children have undergone many changes.  The early childhood care and
education that once occurred naturally and without much conscious planning, in
small communities of extended families, is now fractured and ill-defined in
many parts of urban and rural Africa.  The promotion of developmental, social
and educational opportunities for young children is a priority now, and will
continue to be a priority beyond the year 2000. The challenge is to double our
efforts to improve opportunities for children in Africa</i>.  <p>

<p><b>ANTECEDENTS</b></p>

<p>Over the past two years, the Latin American Council of Bishops (CELAM),
the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the Consultative Group
on Early Childhood Care and Development have collaborated in a project
whose overarching purpose is to improve programs of attention to young
children living in conditions that put them at risk of delayed or debilitated
physical, mental, social and/or emotional development. The specific approach
to improving programs taken in this project begins with the study of childrearing
practices and patterns affecting early childhood development, from conception
to about the time children are ready to enter primary school. As the title
of this report suggests, however, knowledge about childrearing is not sought
for knowledge sake but is, rather, to be translated into action. Accordingly,
the explicit purposes of the project were taken to be:</p>

<p>1. To gather, synthesize and draw implications from information about
childrearing practices and beliefs in such a way that the knowledge will
be useful to people charged with planning and implementing programs intended
to improve child care and to enhance early childhood development. </p>

<p>2. To describe methods that can be used by practitioners to gather information
locally and to incorporate it into their activities.</p>

<p>3. To develop materials that will help the Roman Catholic Church and
UNICEF incorporate childrearing information into their program activities.</p>

<p>4. To identify gaps in knowledge that should be filled.</p>

<p>The childrearing project was conceived in three phases. Phase I consisted
of a pilot review of the literature on childrearing practices and patterns
in one country (Mexico), and the development of a general framework for
collecting information. In addition, a workshop was held to discuss results
and to plan the next phase. Phase II, reported upon in this document, has
involved additional reviews of the literature and field work in nine Latin
American countries where case studies were carried out using a variety
of methodologies for collecting and analyzing information. A third phase
of the project will involve application of the results to adjusting planning
and programming procedures, creating materials, training, and applying
what has been learned in specific institutional and community settings.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this document is to bring together results from
the country reviews and case studies carried out during the first half
of 1992. The synthesis is based both on the presentation and discussion
of study results at a workshop in Bogot&aacute; in early September 1992
and on reading of the case studies from each country. A complete set of
references to the studies is included as Attachment 1.</p>

<p>Common elements and differences in practices, patterns and beliefs will
be identified and the methodologies used will be described, with an eye
to their broader relevance and application. To begin the process of translating
that knowledge into action, implications for practice will also be drawn.</p>

<p>In order to orient readers who have not participated in the project
and who did not attend the Bogot&aacute; meeting, the remainder of this
introductory section will be devoted to: 1) a brief statement about why
the study of child-rearing practices is important, 2) an explanation of
how practices, patterns and beliefs were defined in the project, and 3)
a very synthetic treatment of results from Phase I of the project, upon
which the second phase was constructed. The introduction will be followed
by a section describing the several forms in which the study was approached
in different countries, both in terms of the selection of the population
that was included and in terms of the methodology used. Section IV will
attempt to synthesize results about who cares for children, about childcare
practices and about why practices are as they are. Finally, a set of conclusions
will be drawn about: 1) methods that seem useful and/or promising to pursue
in working with communities to examine, to reflect on, and to reinforce
or change their childrearing practices, 2) actions that can be taken to
strengthen childcare and development in the region.</p>

<p><b>Why Is Knowledge of Childrearing Practices, Patterns and Beliefs
Important?</b></p>

<p>1. <b>To understand, support and improve the childrearing process.</b>
A child develops in interaction with the surrounding environment. An important
part of that environment consists of family members and of others who care
for a child. Caregivers not only initiate interaction and provide direct
responses to the needs of the child, they also help to arrange a child's
physical environment and to protect the child from aspects of the environment
when necessary.</p>

<p>In this process, a caregiver brings to the task: 1) a certain technology
(set of practices), 2) an idea about what should be done, that is, of accepted
practices (normative patterns), and 3) beliefs about why one or another
practice and pattern is better than another. These affect the style and
quality of care-giving. For instance, the practice of carrying a child
has a different effect on the development of that child than the practice
of placing the child in a cradle or playpen. A social and parental belief
that children are given by God and therefore should be treated in a particular
way has effects that are different from the belief that children are human
creations.</p>

<p>Unless the effects on development of different practices, patterns and
beliefs are detected and understood, in context, the sometimes salutary
but often discouraging and flawed process of early childhood development
cannot be under-stood, properly supported, or constructively imported upon.</p>

<p>2. <b>To respond to diversity.</b> Children grow up in such different
physical, social and cultural circumstances and are themselves so different
at birth that there can be no one &quot;right way&quot; to bring up children.
Still, many programs intended to help young children survive and grow and
develop are conceived as if all children and circumstances are the same
-- as if there is only one right way. Understanding practices and patterns
and incorporating that knowledge into programs is, then crucial if programs
of early childhood development are to serve the variety of children and
families and circumstances that any program is bound to encompass. </p>

<p>3. <b>To respect cultural values.</b> Practices, patterns and beliefs
define the manner in which children are socialized to particular cultural
values and ways. The rhetoric of most programs includes a plea to respect
cultural differences. Indeed, the Convention of the Rights of the Child
indicates that children have a right to their cultural identity. If this
is to occur, a much greater effort must be made to describe and understand
the reasons for cultural differences in the up-bringing of children. Unfortunately,
ideas about practices to be promoted in a program frequently come from
individuals who are not part of the culture or group that the program is
intended to serve.</p>

<p>4. <b>To overcome negative effects of change.</b> Knowledge of practices,
patterns and beliefs is also important because environments and practices
are changing, sometimes rapidly and sometimes with important effects on
development. In the process, some practices are being lost that continue
to have both cultural and scientific value. Other practices that appear
to be &quot;deviant&quot; practices, but which represent novel adaptations
to particular settings, may be followed for good reasons and with good
results; they should not be suppressed. Conversely, old practices are being
applied in new settings or new practices are being adopted that may not
be appropriate to the changing settings in which a child is growing up.
Unless these changes in circumstances and in forms of childrearing are
identified and understood, policy and programs may take a misguided view.</p>

<p><b>Where is this knowledge located and how can it be tapped?</b></p>

<p>There are at least two main sources of knowledge about childrearing
practices, patterns and beliefs -- in a scientific literature and in everyday
life, i.e., in experience and folkways.</p>

<p><b>Science.</b> The accumulated &quot;scientific&quot; literature includes
basic studies of child development which are often directed toward identifying
universal principles of development. However, that literature also includes
psychological, medical, anthropological, and sociological and other studies
of how people in particular cultural and geographic settings care for their
young children.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this literature dealing with childrearing practices and
patterns, although in written form, is not easily captured and put to work.
First, it is very dispersed because child development cuts across many
disciplinary lines. Second, the form of presentation is often academic
and requires translation into a form that is useful to program and policy
people. Third, for the most part, the existing literature is derived from
a Western or Northern conceptual base that can distort some of the findings.
Fourth, some of the literature is outdated. Nevertheless, this literature,
placed in perspective, provides an important starting point. In the project,
a concerted attempt has been made to locate and synthesize results from
studies in various countries.</p>

<p><b>Experience.</b> Another source of knowledge about childrearing is
experience. This experience is of two types. One is based on immediate,
personal experience, reflecting the particular circumstances of particular
individuals in particular families and communities. A second type is accumulated
experience adding up to a &quot;traditional wisdom.&quot; Usually, experience
is not brought together in a systematic way or written up. A major challenge
of this project has been to capture current experience and to describe
&quot;traditional wisdom&quot; without making a prior judgement about its
value. </p>

<p><b>How are practices, patterns and beliefs defined?</b></p>

<p>The question of how to define practices, patterns and beliefs was the
subject of considerable debate as the project developed. Along the way,
a relative consensus developed which, put in the simplest terms, was as
follows:</p>

<p>o practices are what people actually do</p>

<p>o patterns are what people think they should do (roughly equal to norms)</p>

<p>o beliefs are accepted explanations, rooted in the religious or magical,
for why patterns and practices are as they are or as they should be.</p>

<p><b>Practices: What and How?</b> For children to survive, grow and develop,
they need to be nourished, to avoid disease and accidents, to be nurtured
and to learn the ways of the world that surrounds them in order to adapt
to, cope with and transform that world. Practices are actual activities
that caregivers use in daily life to respond to these needs.</p>

<p>At a general level, one can specify areas of practice common to all
societies, such as: feeding, sleeping, handling and carrying, bathing,
preventing and attending to illness, protecting from harm, nurturing, socializing
and teaching skills.</p>

<p>But at a more specific level, &quot;what&quot; is done to help a child
survive, grow and develop merges with &quot;how&quot; it is done to define
and distinguish practices that vary widely from place to place. For instance,
in responding to the need for food, the practice of breastfeeding contrasts
with the practice of bottle feeding. Feeding &quot;on demand&quot; contrasts
with scheduled feeding. The practice of constant carrying differs dramatically
from the practice of placing a child in a crib, cradle, hammock or playpen
for prolonged periods. Or, the practice of talking to a child about what
should be done contrasts with an emphasis on non-verbal forms of communication
in the socialization process.</p>

<p><b>Patterns: What should be done?</b> Childrearing patterns are the
generally-accepted ways of care that guide caregivers in responding to
the needs of children in their early months and years in a way that assures
the survival and maintenance and development of the group or culture as
well as of the child. These childrearing norms may or may not be followed
by individuals, reflecting the particular circumstances in which a child
is being raised and/or differences in the beliefs and knowledge of individual
caregivers.<b>[1]</b></p>

<p>Having set out reasons why knowledge of childrearing practices is important,
having noted where such knowledge may be found, and having provided the
reader with definitions, we now turn to the project, beginning with Phase
I. </p>

<p><b>Results from Phase I</b></p>

<p>Within the larger project, Phase I was directed toward the elaboration
of a framework and strategy to guide the gathering of information from
an existing literature. The pilot exercise also produced a range of information
about childrearing in Mexico. The strategy and results of its application
are incorporated into a discussion document written by Maria Eugenia Linares.<b>[2]</b>
That document was discussed in a workshop held at CELAM in April 1991,
and was revised to reflect comments made in the workshop.</p>

<p>As a result, a three-dimensional framework was developed for systematizing
and analyzing information about childrearing.</p>

<p>o A first dimension derives from the fact that child development is
a continuing process, beginning with conception and in this case, carrying
through to the period of entry into school. That period was divided roughly
into the following periods: pregnancy, birth, post birth, newborn, infant,
child less than three, and child less than six.</p>

<p>o The second dimension derives from the definition of development as
a multi-dimensional and integral process including physical as well as
mental and social development and requiring attention, at a minimum, to
health, nutrition, and psychosocial wellbeing of a child.</p>

<p>o A third dimension is defined by economic and cultural differences
among groups. The three rough categories or groups chosen for analysis
were: urban marginal, rural indigenous, and rural transitional. </p>

<p>Figure 1 illustrates an adaptation of the framework worked out at the
April 1991 workshop. The adapted framework incorporates the idea that practices
can be judged from both the viewpoints of science and of popular wisdom.</p>

<p>With the framework as a base, a set of index cards were designed, each
with a set of questions pertinent to the particular category. (For the
cards and questions, please see Attachment 3.) These categories and questions
not only served for reviews of the literature, but also helped to organize
attempts in Phase II to systematize experience.</p>

<p>The Phase I pilot study and literature review:</p>

<p>o Confirmed the utility of the framework as a starting point.</p>

<p>o Uncovered, as expected, tremendous variety in the topics and groups
studied, in the methods used to study practices and in the practices. This
tended to confirm the idea that there is no formula with respect to childrearing
practices.</p>

<p>o Identified gaps in the study of, and information about practices,
patterns and beliefs, particularly in urban marginal populations. For instance,
a weakness was found in the treatment of practices related to psychosocial
development, as contrasted with the more extensive treatment of health
and nutritional practices.</p>

<p>o Suggested that the healthiest, and most effective practices did <b>not</b>
show an unequivocal linear relationship to degree of &quot;modernization&quot;
or to family structure. Breastfeeding, for instance, is most common in
less-industrialized settings. </p>

<p><b>Figure 1. Categories for the Analysis of Childrearing Practices</b></p>

<p><b>and Child Development</b></p>

<p>The review of the literature suggested the importance to programming
of having current and situation-specific information about practices, something
that a broad academic literature cannot easily provide. This led naturally
into Phase II with its focus on development of a field-based methodologies
for recovering and systematizing local information.</p>

<p>From the discussion of the pilot study came two specific suggestions
for approaches that seemed to merit testing. One suggestion was to work
with community &quot;agents&quot; (including, for example, community educators
and health workers, animators of grassroots organizations, parish priests)
who have long experience in communities and who have presumably acquired
a deep knowledge of practices and patterns in the specific communities
in which they have worked. It was not clear, however, whether this approach
would lead to the conclusion that most agents, because they are part of
or work closely with a community, are knowledgeable about childrearing
practices, or are not.</p>

<p>The second suggestion was to turn more directly to parents and other
community members in a process of discovering and describing local practices.
More specifically, it was suggested that attention be given to the utility
of a participatory method used by the Roman Catholic Church in its planning,
termed &quot;The Study of Reality.&quot; This method, which is similar
to popular education approaches, involves community members in a process
of 1) seeing (collecting information), 2) judging (analyzing) and 3) acting
(using the information to play and carry out activities). It was felt that
the method, with which the Church has had wide experience, could be focussed
on examining the condition of children, ages 0 to 6, and the childrearing
practices that affect that condition in a particular community. Doing so
would not only provide knowledge about childrearing but would also, presumably,
provide a basis for action by the practitioners and caregivers participating
in the process. </p>

<p>As the reader will see, other methods were also applied in Phase II.</p>

<p><b>Phase II in Context</b></p>

<p>The social and institutional contexts within which the studies of Phase
II were undertaken are important to describe for two reasons.</p>

<p>First, a set of common social conditions can be identified that seem
to cut across the extra-ordinarily diverse settings in which the study
was carried out and that help to moderate diversity. Therefore, it seems
reasonable, in spite of the major differences among settings, to be able
to make general statements about childrearing which, if not applicable
in 100% of the settings, nevertheless characterize conditions and practices
in a majority of the communities.</p>

<p>Second, location of the study within the institutional structure of
the Roman Catholic Church has influenced its organization and conduct.
In particular, at the time of the study, the Church was considering a proposal
to institutionalize a new pastorate within the Church called &quot;Pastoral
de la Infancia.&quot; In several countries of the continent this pastorate
has been accepted and is being tried out. It was hoped that the Fourth
General Conference of Latin American Bishops would give its general endorsement
to the idea of a pastorate at its meeting in October in Santo Domingo.
It was felt that the studies could contribute to development of activities
related to this initiative.</p>

<p><b>Common influences on childrearing practices</b></p>

<p>Several historical and contemporary influences cut across cultural and
geographic settings, moderating differences. Among the general influences
identified in the studies and in the Phase II workshop were:</p>

<p><b>1. 500 years of Spanish cultural hegemony.</b> Even the most resistant
native cultures of Latin America have been influenced to some degree by
the Conquest and its long aftermath. Perhaps foremost among these influences
has been that of the Roman Catholic church which, over the centuries, has
influenced beliefs and values, including those affecting childrearing (CELAM,
1992)</p>

<p><b>2. Economic decline during the &quot;lost decade&quot; of the 1980s.</b>
Without exception, the countries included in the study suffered major economic
declines during the 1980's, affecting employment levels, increasing the
number of people living in poverty (IDB, 1990).</p>

<p><b>3. The impact of the neo-liberal economic policies</b> applied in
an attempt to overcome the economic problems of the 1980s. The so-called
neo-liberal economic policy has been characterized by economic programs
providing incentives to attract local and foreign investment, and favoring
large scale industry and a shift to cash cropping, while increasing economic
inequalities, placing additional burdens on the poor and reducing social
spending.</p>

<p>The combination of the economic recession and of the neo-liberal policies
has led to a marked increase in the level of poverty in the region and
has forced more and more families to pursue survival strategies. Economic
pressures not only lower the level of resources available to meet daily
needs, but also affect livelihood and work patterns, family structures
and relationships, and childrearing practices and patterns. </p>

<p><b>4. The growth of conflict in the region.</b> Major strife in Central
America, the Southern Cone Sur, Colombia and Peru has created difficult
conditions of life for a growing number of Latin Americans, affecting basic
beliefs and patterns as well as daily routines, introducing new survival
and socialization needs.</p>

<p><b>5. The continuing growth of urban areas.</b> This long term trend
has been accelerated by economic declines and civil disturbances over the
last decade or more. With the move to urban areas, old ways of doing things
do not always apply. The space and conditions in which children are reared
change dramatically requiring shifts in practices.</p>

<p><b>6. The continuing move of women into the paid labor force and into
non-formal employment</b>. Associated with economic pressures and changes,
urban growth and shifting values is an increase in the participation by
women in the paid labor force. Because society still assigns primary responsibility
for child-rearing to mothers, this shift, when combined with a decrease
in extended families and with longer periods of children in school has
brought with it a demand for alternative forms of childcare and rearing
outside the home. Or, it has forced adjustments in practices and patterns
of child care which allow women to combine work and care. </p>

<p><b>7. The rapid advance of technology on many fronts</b> -- in transportation,
communication, education as well as in industry and commerce -- has not
only brought new ways of doing things, including raise children; it has
also helped to provoke a general clash of values. That advance, with origins
in &quot;science&quot; and an occidental culture places competition, individualism
and consumerism against cooperation, solidarity, and spiritualism. It has
helped to dampen the force of tradition and experience. It has brought
bottle feeding and plastic toys and television other accoutrements of childrearing
that were not available in the past and which often substitute today for
more traditional childrearing technologies. </p>

<p>8. <b>An impressive reduction has occurred in the rate of infant mortality
--</b> even in a time of economic difficulties. With this reduction has
come an in-creasing shift from a cultural orientation focussed on accepting
death and promoting the survival of children, with its harsh tone based
on a high probability of an early death, to a more optimistic and open
cultural orientation toward growth and development.</p>

<p>In brief, all of the above widespread conditions have had their influence
on practices by affecting the immediate physical and social environments
in which children are reared, by affecting the values toward which childrearing
is directed and some of the beliefs that underpin traditional practices,
and by affecting the technologies available to be applied in the process
of childrearing. In so doing, these increasingly common conditions provide
pressures for common responses.</p>

<p><b>II</b></p>

<p><b>THE PHASE II CASE STUDIES:</b></p>

<p><b>WHERE WERE THEY DONE AND WHO PARTICIPATED</b>?</p>

<p>In Phase II of the Project on childrearing practices and patterns, case
studies were carried out in 35 communities in 9 countries: Bolivia, Chile,
Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Peru.
Included were low-income urban and rural communities, communities with
varying ethnic compositions and of different sizes and degrees of community
solidarity, communities directly affected by war and or civil strife, and
communities located in very different geographic conditions. Table 1 provides
basic information about the specific communities studied in each country.</p>

<p>The information presented suggests a relatively even split between urban
and rural communities. Aymara, Quechua, Mapuche, Shipiba, and Negro cultures
are represented as well as predominantly mestizo and hispanic cultures.
Urban groups included both communities on the periphery and in the central
city. Rural communities included isolated communities and those relatively
near to major cities but still involved in agriculture. Ecuador contributed
the greatest variation within a single country, with information from 14
different communities located in five different areas of the country and
covering Indian, mestizo, and Negro cultures, and various mixtures of these
cultures.</p>

<p>More than 600 people provided information within the various studies.
Almost all of the participants were mothers. In Honduras, Peru and Chile,
a conscious effort was made to select both younger and older mothers for
interviews. Only in Chile (with the temporary workers) and in Ecuador,
were a handful of fathers included. In various locations, men were among
the experts or community agents consulted. </p>

<p>The population with whom researchers worked in each country is not a
statistically representative population. Communities were not selected
randomly, nor were people; rather, a purposive approach was taken, linking
selection to particular conditions. Criteria differed by location, influenced
by a desire to provide variation (Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Central
America taken as a whole), to include a particular cultural group (for
example, the Negro culture in Ecuador), to work with communities in which
the Catholic Church was active (Mexico), or to study communities undergoing
a particular change (as in the resettlement situation in El Salvador).
In Chile and Peru, an effort was made to select individuals for participation
in the study who had <b>not</b> been involved in a program run by non-governmental
organizations.</p>

<p><b>Analyzing the existing literature</b></p>

<p><b>How it was done.</b> All countries included in their studies a literature
search and analysis. Most took as the starting point the framework developed
by Linares in the pilot phase of the project (Figure 1, p. 6, and Attachment
3). Methods used to locate material included: computer searches, reviews
of theses and of library holdings in major universities, and consultation
with experts with a knowledge of the literature.</p>

<p>In general, identifying apparently relevant studies and obtaining them
in order to examine their content was an onerous task, carried out with
varying energy and success in the different countries. The process was
complicated by the dispersion of sources across disciplines, by the uncatalogued
nature of many sources, by breakdowns in computer search systems or difficulty
in selecting appropriate key words, and by a general lack of previous attempts
to search the literature upon which current efforts could build.</p>

<p><b>Results.</b> Although some excellent studies of childrearing practices,
patterns and beliefs were encountered as a result of the literature search,
these were few and far between, were often found embedded in a larger work,
and tended to concentrate on certain communities or groups. Consistently
greater attention was given to health and nutritional practices than to
practices related to early education or to psycho-social development. Studies
also tended to be more descriptive than analytical, failing to get at why
practices are as they are. In too many cases, studies included an interpretation
of findings based on a normative position rooted in the dominant culture,
prejudging practices and beliefs without looking closely at real outcomes
of &quot;different&quot; practices and without searching for the reasons
why practices are as they are.</p>

<p>One unfortunate conclusion that might be drawn from the above is that
turning to published or unpublished writings as a source of information
is not worth the effort. However, in spite of the difficulties noted, the
process did seem to be useful in several ways. First, it did uncover some
excellent work that could be drawn upon. Second, in some cases the written
work provided quantitative results, complementing the essentially qualitative
approaches taken in most of the country studies. Third, particular studies
were found that served as a check on field work results. Indeed, a look
at the nine country reports suggests that descriptive results found in
the literature were generally consistent with results found in field work,
giving credence to results of the field work or complementing it. Fourth,
the process helped to identify gaps in information that should be filled.</p>

<p>In the Bogot&aacute; meeting, it was felt that literature searches should
be extended to include information found outside the scientific literature
-- in such sources as novels, biographies and catequesis -- none of which
were included in the present exploration.</p>

<p><b>Going to the field: two approaches</b></p>

<p>Two purposes guided field work in the project: collecting information
and promoting reflection and change. The main purpose adopted in eight
of the studies was to collect information about childrearing practices
and patterns. Directly promoting change as part of that process was, at
best, a secondary goal in these studies. In the Mexican study, by way of
contrast, the information collecting purpose was subordinated to promoting
reflection and change, resulting in a different methodological approach
from the others. </p>

<p><b>Collecting information</b></p>

<p>The two most common methods used to collect information in the project
were questionnaires and interviews. Structured questionnaires served as
the basis for work in the Central American countries and in Ecuador. In
Central America an extensive instrument was carefully constructed to cover
each of the contextual and developmental variables for which information
was desired. This instrument was administered to individual mothers. In
Ecuador, a briefer questionnaire served as the basis for interviews in
family settings. In group settings, it became a kind of semi-structured
interview schedule. Whether individually or in group, an attempt was made
to use questionnaires and conduct interviews in such a way that they began
with the concerns of the families interviewed about the up-bringing of
their children. Thus, an attempt was made to avoid &quot;extracting&quot;
information from people and, rather, to place the emphasis on helping people
to understand better and to satisfy their concerns. </p>

<p>The questionnaires produced quantitative results, allowing a description
and comparisons among groups with respect to some standard categories and
questions.</p>

<p>In Chile, Peru and Bolivia, a semi-structured interview schedule provided
the starting point for conversations in focus groups. The schedule was
followed more closely in Bolivia, in order to help systematic recording
of information, than in Chile and Peru, where conversations were tape-recorded
and then transcribed. The Chilean approach allowed group interviews to
flow spontaneously. Tapes were analyzed after a first interview and gaps
in information were identified that could then be filled at a second or
third session with the group. The results of these interviews were submitted
to a content analysis and are presented in qualitative terms.</p>

<p>In all of the above cases, instruments were field tested and adjusted
before being used. Adjustments continued during the period of application.
</p>

<p>The instruments all included information about the people interviewed
and about the general conditions of life in the family. In addition to
obtaining an idea about the economic situation and work patterns, family
structure, and educational levels, instruments included questions about
family relationships, about the distribution of roles and responsibilities,
and about alcoholism and abuse. With respect to practices, patterns and
beliefs, information was sought at different periods of development (pregnancy,
birth, infancy, early childhood and the preschool period), about practices
related to health, nutrition, and psycho-social development. </p>

<p><b>Promoting reflection and change</b></p>

<p>The Mexican study differed from the other eight studies in several respects.
First, because it took as its main purpose promoting reflection and change,
the methodology used was a participatory one in which the subjects of the
exercise were accompanied in a process of constructing their own set of
questions and answers about childrearing practices, patterns and beliefs.
The basic premise of this methodology is that, in the process of gathering
and discussing information, those involved will identify areas in which
action is desirable and will be motivated to carry out those actions. Accordingly,
the <b>process</b> used to carry out the study took on even greater importance
than the <b>content</b>. Applying the participatory methodology meant that
the outside &quot;researchers&quot; began by discussing basic concepts
with the community workers rather than by administering a questionnaire
or semi-structured interview schedule or accepting the categories developed
in Phase I, as given.</p>

<p>Second, the study in Mexico focussed on community agents rather than
on parents. This focus was adopted because community action is the business
of community agents. Working with agents to understand and apply a participatory
methodology to examining explicitly the well-being of young children and,
as part of that, at the childrearing practices and patterns in their community,
constitutes a strategy for improving the condition of young children. But
the focus was also taken in order to test out an assumption that is often
made -- that because community agents come from a community or have lived
for a long time in a community they will have absorbed and can articulate
the traditional wisdom of that community. In this case, the emphasis was
on traditional wisdom about childrearing. To some extent, the Ecuadorian
study also incorporated this dimension, by involving people from different
communities and/or governmental agencies in the process of collecting information.</p>

<p>Third, the Mexican study was more directly related than others to the
activities and thinking of the Roman Catholic church. The communities chosen
were communities in which a system of &quot;comunidades de base&quot; were
functioning and entrance to these communities was sought through the local
parish priest or another representative of the church. The community agents
with whom the project worked were primarily church workers and lay members
active in the comunidades de base. The methodology employed was consistent
with the church's method of analyzing community problems through use of
&quot;An Analysis of Reality,&quot; involving the three steps of &quot;looking
(gathering information), judging (analyzing the information), and acting
(identifying solutions to problems identified and carrying them out).&quot;
To a limited degree it provided a test of that methodology, as applied
to childrearing.</p>

<p>Another feature of the Mexican project that sets it apart is that the
groups with whom community agents were working in one of the communities
were groups of older children; the approach to childrearing in families
was through these children rather than through parents.</p>

<p>The participatory methodology applied in Mexico called for several different
techniques of gathering and processing information and for working in the
community. For instance:</p>

<p>o Group exercises to motivate and aid reflection were used, such as
games or role playing or creating posters that expressed a viewpoint about
childrearing (or about the role of the community agent). One of the most
successful and insightful of these involved asking participants to act
out something from their childhood, or to reflect on what their childhood
was like. This method helped to bring out inter-generational comparisons,
a comparison that was sought in other studies by working with groups of
older and younger women.</p>

<p>o A rough instrument was constructed to record &quot;A Day in the Life
of a Child.&quot; This was found to be useful when working with the older
children to observe their younger siblings.</p>

<p>Finally, the Mexican study involved working closely and continuously
with a limited number of people, in only two communities, over a period
of several months, as contrasted with other studies that involved interaction
during, at most, several hours, at one or two points in time.</p>

<p>To record observations and conversations over time, detailed notes were
taken and a field diary was kept. Notes from periodic meetings with community
agents were analyzed and a systematic reformulation was provided to the
group as a basis for discussion at the next session.</p>

<p><b>Observations from the Bogot&aacute; meeting and some lessons learned</b></p>

<p>1. There was general agreement that questionnaires and interview schedule
should not be used rigidly because this inhibits responses and limits conversation.
Rigid adherence to a format with a particular order and categories does
not allow important issues and practices to emerge that might not have
been included in the original instrument. It also increases the chances
that respondents will say what they think the interviewer wants to hear.</p>

<p>2. Reliance of all of the above methodologies on verbal responses was
noted and the validity of this method was questioned. What people say they
do or believe is not necessarily what they actually do or believe. Indeed,
none of the studies described relied on systematic observation, nor were
they set up as experimental studies.</p>

<p>In reply, researchers pointed to a set of &quot;validity checks&quot;
that were used to determine whether answers provided were distorted. Results
of the interviews and of the participatory process were compared with what
was found in the literature, with opinions of local informants, and with
opinions of specialists in the field. In some cases (in addition to Mexico)
results were also discussed directly with the people from whom the information
was originally obtained. In addition to helping spot incorrect interpretations
and to look for explanations, this process was intended to aid the second
purpose mentioned above - to promote reflection and change.</p>

<p>This discussion of dependence on verbal responses and personal recounting
of experience rather than on direct observation led to several conclusions:</p>

<p>o Checks on the validity of the information obtained did support the
quantitative and qualitative findings based that were based on &quot;the
word&quot; and the findings were, therefore, thought to be reasonably accurate.
Such checks should form part of any exploration of childrearing practices.</p>

<p>o Some form of systematic observation of what people actually do should
be incorporated into methodologies whenever possible.</p>

<p>o Organizing discussions of systematized results of interviews and/or
group conversations is an important methodological device that should be
incorporated into childrearing studies. Such discussions not only provide
a validity check, but can begin to move knowledge toward action by promoting
reflection and change in the group.</p>

<p>3. The feasibility of adopting a time consuming process of &quot;accompa&ntilde;amiento&quot;
such as was employed in the Mexican study was questioned. Indeed, the process,
which covered four months in Mexico, did not run its full course because
time ran out. It was not possible to accompany participants in the third
step in the process; that is, of acting on what was being discovered.</p>

<p>In response, it was noted that community workers, who are continuously
present in a community and who are not limited by a project's time table
would be able to carry through such a methodology. The Mexican study was,
in effect, a kind of training for community workers to do that, incorporating
it into their regular work. At the same time, it was suggested that the
process of acompa&ntilde;amiento is much more feasible in communities that
are strong and have already achieved some level of organization autonomy.
The method is less appropriate for weak and dependent communities.</p>

<p>4. A number of useful techniques were identified that can be drawn upon
in future work. These include:</p>

<p>o Asking adults to reflect on their own childhood. Remembering childhood
helps to establish key themes, can identify continuity and change in practices,
contributes to the empathy of the parents with the child, and can provide
an easy way of including men in the conversation. This exercise seems particularly
important because of the marked tendency for parents to repeat practices
applied to them when they were children, even if they do not think those
practices were appropriate or just.</p>

<p>o Comparing practices and beliefs across generations by seeking out
older and younger parents. This technique also helps to identify continuities
or discontinuities in practices across generations -- the &quot;generational
matrix&quot;.</p>

<p>o Group dynamic exercises. Such exercises help to get members of a group
involved and serve also as a form of expression with respect to particular
topics.</p>

<p>o Constructing a &quot;day in the life of a child.&quot; This technique
helps to make observations more systematic.</p>

<p>5. Community workers are not necessarily a good source of information
about childrearing practices. Neither parish priests nor nuns nor health
workers showed a firm grasp of traditional practices. Nor was traditional
knowledge incorporated into planning and daily work.</p>

<p>6. The framework and sets of questions developed in Phase I (Attachment
3) provided a good point of departure for exploring childrearing practices
in a community. It is important in each study, however, to re-examine the
relevance of particular questions and, to the extent possible, involve
participants in the reconstruction of a framework and questions. This process
both helps to promote understanding of the process and the outcomes and
to make adjustments to local realities. </p>

<p>7. The Mexican study suggests that a participatory methodology, similar
to the &quot;Analysis of Reality,&quot; applied to examining the well being
of young children in a community, is potentially useful. </p>

<p><b>IV </b></p>

<p><b>WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED ABOUT PRACTICES, PATTERNS AND BELIEFS?</b></p>

<p>The following synthesis brings together results and conclusions that
appeared in the various reports and conclusions that were presented at
the Bogot&aacute; meeting in September of 1992. Results will be reported
that deal with: who cares for young children; how they are cared for; what
the perceived norms for care are; beliefs; and the conditions affecting
practices, patterns and beliefs.</p>

<p>About Practices, Patterns and Beliefs</p>

<p><b>Who cares for the child?</b></p>

<p>1. It is obvious that the mother continues to be the main person who
cares for children, but that her role varies a great deal according to
the age of the child (less time is spent with the passing of time) and
according to social economic, cultural and family circumstances. In many
places, grandmothers and older siblings have an important role in care.
In the post-natal period, the mother-in-law is important in some places.
</p>

<p>2. The father rarely participates directly in early childrearing. The
degree and presence and support varies from place to place but, in general,
the contribution seems to be minimal and for the sake of appearance. There
are exceptions. For example, fathers frequently participate directly in
the birthing process in the Andean cultures of Bolivia and Peru. In El
Salvador, rural Bolivia and the Mapuche culture in Chile, fathers take
on a more important role in socialization of boys during the later pre-school
years. Among the temporary laborers studied in Chile, the work routine
demands that fathers take an active role in the care of their children.</p>

<p>The opinions of mothers regarding the help they receive from their partner
in caring for children is marked by a cultural pattern that, in the main,
protects the positive image of the male even though his participation is
minimal or missing. This opinion may or may not be based on the financial
help that males provide. Also appearing in the studies is a general opinion
that men do not know how to, and do not have the capacity to, participate
in the childrearing process. </p>

<p>3. In many of the places studied, the role of the honorary mother or
of the mid-wife continues to be important during pregnancy and birth.</p>

<p><b>How is the child cared for?</b></p>

<p><b>Pre-natal</b></p>

<p>1. Birth control is rarely practiced in the groups studied. Many mothers
wish to have less children and they are in favor of birth control but do
not practice it. Men are particularly resistent to the use of anti-conceptives.</p>

<p>2. The practice of abortion is not accepted as a norm nor followed in
the groups studied, with very few exceptions.</p>

<p>3. Although there is variation from place to place, in many places no
change in dietary practices occurs during pregnancy. This is especially
so in Peru and in Bolivia. In Central America, between 50% and 60% of the
participants in the case studies changed their eating practices.</p>

<p>4. It is common to have cravings and to believe that they ought to be
satisfied. In Peru, there exists a belief that cravings come from the fetus
and therefore one has to respond. Apparently, cravings serve to insure
that a pregnant woman will eat more and that the father, in helping to
satisfy the cravings, participates in the process.</p>

<p>5. In general, a high percentage of women use either the formal or informal
health systems at their disposal for monitoring pregnancy, but in some
rural areas, a very low percentage of women seek attention (e.g., Bolivia,
Per&amp;; y Cotopaxi in Ecuador). Moreover, the monitoring, many times,
is partial. According to the Ecuadorean study, less than 40% of the women
practiced &quot;integral&quot; control; that is to say, monitored their
health, ate better and reduced physical labor during pregnancy. In Chile,
among the Mapuches, women avoid heavy labor but continue working until
the last minute at habitual chores.</p>

<p>6. The use of formal vs informal (mid-wives and honorary mothers) systems
varied a great deal among places, including within countries.</p>

<p>7. In general, pregnancy is seen by the mothers as a natural process
rather than as an abnormal process or as a sickness. This &quot;normal&quot;
vision is not shared by the formal health system.</p>

<p><b>Birth and Post-partum</b></p>

<p>1. As with pregnancy, birth is viewed by the women studied as a natural
process, whereas the health system treats it as an equivalent of sickness.</p>

<p>2. The place of birth and the person who attends the birth varies a
great deal in the case studies. In Costa Rica, 100% gave birth in hospitals
and were attended by trained personnel. In Bolivia, almost all births occurred
at home, attended by members of the family, neighbor women with experience
or a mid-wife.</p>

<p>3. Only in the cases of Andean and rural Peru and Bolivia, was the physical
presence of the father notable during birth. In other cases, the father
&quot;accompanied&quot; the birth by remaining nearby or by taking care
of other children. Frequently, the father was absent.</p>

<p>4. In the case of births attended by mid-wives, there exists a variety
of traditional methods that facilitate the birthing process.</p>

<p>5. In the majority of the places studied, the mother is given the baby
immediately after birth. Also, colostrum is given. At the same time, there
exist areas in which a high percentage do not follow these practices. There
are also areas, as in Peru, in which colostrum is seen as harmful.</p>

<p>6. A range of beliefs was found regarding causes of problems at birth,
many related to magic or to religion.</p>

<p><b>The First 40 days and the Lactation Period</b></p>

<p>1. A special period of 40 days (&quot;la cuarentena,&quot; related to
the idea of &quot;quarantine&quot; in which people are isolated) is observed
in some places, with the help of grandmothers, friends, or mothers-in-law.
These women help with household chores and with other parts of the mother's
normal work load. But in other places, such as rural Bolivia for example,
the return to routine work is almost immediate.</p>

<p>2. Almost all mothers breastfeed their babies. But marked differences
exist in practices and beliefs about the timing of introduction of supplementary
food and the time of weaning. In urban areas, weaning frequently occurs
before 6 months. In Chile, the health system advises new mothers to stop
breastfeeding after 6 months.</p>

<p>3. Although weaning occurs in a gradual form in most cases, the practice
of abrupt weaning was also found with some frequency in the studies, accompanied
by the use of disagreeable substances applied to the breasts, or in conjunction
with sending the baby outside the home for a period.</p>

<p>4. In the majority of the cases, babies sleep with their mothers; in
some cases until two years of age or later. This practice facilitates breastfeeding
on demand. </p>

<p>5. The practice of constant carrying of the young child is common, especially
in Bolivia, Per&amp;;, Ecuador, and Guatemala.</p>

<p>6. The practice of binding the baby appeared frequently in Bolivia and
Peru, and among the Mapuches of Chile. Information about this practice
was not sought in all of the studies. The origin of the practice is not
given. In Peru, it is linked to a belief that children who are closely
bound will grow up strong and straight.</p>

<p>7. Health check-ups during the first months vary greatly from place
to place, related to the availability of health posts, but also to attitudes
toward the formal health system (or attitudes of the health system toward
the people) and toward the need for check-ups.</p>

<p>8. Comments related to practices of stimulation or of play with the
small child included:</p>

<p>Peru: Mothers do not have an idea of the need for stimulation.</p>

<p>Chile: In urban areas children are not played with because there is
a belief that they do have social or psychological needs before 8-10 months.
Among the Mapuches, the young child is considered a &quot;person,&quot;
and this translates into loving and attentive treatment, including talking
to the baby.</p>

<p>Ecuador: Undervaluing of child's play is estimated at 53% among respondents
in rural areas and 41% in urban marginal areas.</p>

<p>Honduras: 76% of the mothers interviewed showed colorful objects to
their children.</p>

<p>9. The great majority of the mothers said that they talked to their
small children. In Costa Rica, 100% affirmed this practice; in Guatemala,
92%. In Ecuador 85% said they help their child learn to talk, but only
72% assigned importance to talking with their child during the first six
months. In Chimborazo and Cotopaxi in Ecuador, only 33% and 28%, respectively,
considered it important to talk to the child before six months of age.
</p>

<p><b>Infancy</b></p>

<p>1. The practice of health check-ups varied greatly according to availability
and beliefs. Health attention was more frequent for emergency treatment
than for prevention. A certain lack of confidence in the formal health
system continues in various places. Also, the practice of using the informal
system of health continues with respect to such problems as &quot;mal de
ojo&quot; or &quot;susto&quot; which appear in almost all the places studied
but which are ignored by the formal health system. </p>

<p>The percentage of people who recognized the value of immunization is
high, but in some places the percentage of vaccinations completed had not
reached the 80% level.</p>

<p>2. Feeding. There was little information in the studies about feeding
practices for this period in the child's live.</p>

<p>3. According to the Central American studies, children crawl and walk
&quot;on time.&quot; In the Guatemalan case, a delay in the development
of language was identified.</p>

<p>4. In Bolivia and Peru, the studies found that the parents (particularly
the fathers) did not express affection to their children because this was
thought to result in a lack of respect and disobedience. </p>

<p>5. The practice of physical punishment is very generalized. In many
cases, this practice represents a repetition of what parents experienced
in their infancy. While the use of physical punishment is common, there
exist important differences in the frequency, the severity, and the occasions
in which punishment is applied, as well as in the forms of application.
In some cases, use is related to the belief that punishment permits learning
in the child. The tendency to use physical punishment appears to be stronger
than the use of rewards to reinforce desired behaviors.</p>

<p>6. The manner in which young children are helped to learn to talk appears
to be restricted to repeating words in some places (e.g., Ecuador) while
in others (Costa Rica) in includes such activities as telling stories and
singing.</p>

<p>7. For the majority of people, the ability of a child to use &quot;reason&quot;
is thought to appear between 3 and 7 years of age. Among the Shipiba of
Peru, reason begins with the ability to walk, and among the Mapuches, the
child is thought to begin learning from birth.</p>

<p><b>The Pre-school Period</b></p>

<p>1. Little information exists in the studies about health practices or
nutrition during this period.</p>

<p>2. Beginning at three years of age (or a little earlier in some of the
areas studied) it is common to assign errands or tasks to children, particularly
in rural areas.</p>

<p>3. In the games that children play during this period, gender differences
begin to appear.</p>

<p>4. The general use of physical punishment continues.</p>

<p>5. Major differences exist in the physical space that is available and
free from danger in which children can play.</p>

<p>6. Differences were also found in the importance of television as an
influence on young children. In Chile, the influence has become very strong;
in other places, the clear tendency is toward an ever greater influence
over childrens' lives. </p>

<p><b>Why Are Practices As They Are</b>?</p>

<p>In this section, we will present four categories of response to the
question, &quot;Why Do They Do What They Do?&quot; The answers focus, respectively,
on the influence of: &quot;scientific&quot; knowledge; social norms (patterns);
beliefs, and the conditions in which children live. We make these distinctions
even though the relationships among categories makes it difficult, from
time to time, to distinguish norms from beliefs or from levels of knowledge.
</p>

<p><b>1. Lack of Knowledge</b></p>

<p>One premise of many programs is that there exists a lack of scientific
knowledge and that it is possible to change practices by introducing people
to new scientific information. It is not difficult, using the results from
these studies, to locate practices and patterns that, from a scientific
viewpoint, seem to be &quot;wrong.&quot; For example: science shows us
that the development of the brain is influenced by the exercise of the
senses. But the studies show that, in many cases, there is a lack of interaction
between mother and child and little stimulation of the child during the
first months. This seems related to a perception of babies as incapable
of using their senses or as incapable of learning or understanding during
their first months.</p>

<p>Other gaps in caregiver Knowledge that exist, from a scientific viewpoint,
include knowledge about:</p>

<p>o feeding habits during pregnancy and lactation</p>

<p>o the most appropriate time to introduce supplementary foods</p>

<p>o the importance of talking to the child</p>

<p>o effects of play on intellectual development</p>

<p>o emotional effects of physical punishment</p>

<p>Although there are gaps in the presentation and understanding of scientific
information, it is evident that the process of filling these gaps would
be a partial solution to the problem. It is clear that some of the ideas
and/or scientific technologies are not accepted because other ideas continue
to be dominant about the established ways of bringing up children. Also,
concrete conditions of life for each family plan a role. </p>

<p><b>2. Existing cultural patterns serve as norms of conduct.</b></p>

<p>In the studies it is possible to identify some general patterns that
evidently influence practice, such as:</p>

<p>o Care of the child is the responsibility of women. Men do not know
how to provide care and should remain on the margin.</p>

<p>o Breastfeeding is good and necessary.</p>

<p>o Physical punishment is necessary (at least every once in awhile) in
order for a child to develop well.</p>

<p>Other patterns are more limited in their extension but appear to have
an influence on practice. For example, in some parts of Peru, one should
not show love to children because they will lose their respect for adults
and become disobedient. In this case, the norm is related closely to the
social values: respect and obedience. Separating these values from &quot;beliefs&quot;
is difficult.</p>

<p>At the same time, a main conclusion of these studies is that norms vary
a great deal from place to place and that, frequently, there is a difference
between the norms (what &quot;should be&quot;) and the practices (what
&quot;is). The congruence between norms and practices actually seems to
be greater in rural areas with groups that are more isolated and homogeneous.
In urban areas, it is common to find discrepancies between norms and practices.</p>

<p>It is apparent that some cultural practices have become diffuse and
confusing in some places. The confusion is evident in <b>inter-generational
</b>differences. For example, the older and younger mothers in urban marginal
areas of Peru follow different patterns with respect to use of the formal
health system and with respect to the custom of binding children. The confusion
is evident also <b>among people of the same age living in the same community
but coming from very different cultural and geographic areas.</b> Indeed,
in the study of urban areas in Chile, it seemed difficult to find common
patterns. </p>

<p>In other places, patterns continue to be more or less clear, but the
practices do not correspond to these supposed norms or patterns. For example,
there exists a consensus that breastfeeding is good and necessary, but
many women stop breastfeeding very early.</p>

<p>3<b>. They do what they do because of their beliefs.</b></p>

<p>Even in the more &quot;modernized&quot; places in Latin America, &quot;rational-empirical&quot;
ways of thinking exist side by side with dogmas based in the magical or
supernatural. In order to understand the &quot;why&quot; of practices it
is necessary to understand beliefs, whether magical or religious in origin.</p>

<p>In the studies many examples appear of beliefs that influence childrearing
practice:</p>

<p>o Abortion is a sin.</p>

<p>o What is done with the umbilical cord has an influence over the life
of the child.</p>

<p>o &quot;Mal de ojo&quot; is a cause of sickness. It is possible to protect
oneself from &quot;mal de ojo&quot; by putting on a bracelet (or using
another magical remedy).</p>

<p>o A child who is abnormal at birth represents a divine punishment (rather
than, for instance), a problem caused by such vices as smoking or drinking).
</p>

<p>o A small child is &quot;weak.&quot;</p>

<p>o A child is (or is not) a &quot;person&quot; at birth. Or, only with
baptism does a child acquire the character of a person.</p>

<p>o To bind up babies produces strong and straight children.</p>

<p>In many cases, the magical beliefs do not have any effect that contradicts
science; to the contrary, in some cases it is possible that they can be
called upon to support a scientific belief. For example, the belief in
the use of a bracelet to avoid &quot;mal de ojo&quot; is a form of prevention
and can be related to the broader scientific concept of prevention.</p>

<p>On the basis of these studies, it seems that <b>the lack of a sense
of what &quot;should be&quot;</b>&quot;(whether defined by science or by
traditional wisdom or by religion), may be present in some cases but <b>is
not the main cause of deviation of practices from norms.</b> These deviations
between norms and practices seem linked to changes in beliefs and in the
conditions in which children are brought up.</p>

<p><b>4. Practices depend on the conditions of life</b></p>

<p>There are many conditions that influence practices, patterns and beliefs.
These include geographic (climate, topography, etc.), economic (level of
poverty), social (the use of alcohol and drugs) y political (the level
of violence) conditions at a general level. At the level of each family
there are special conditions influencing practices such as: the work situation
and the conditions of work, the structure and size of the family, the particular
moment of a family in its cycle, alcoholism in the home, etc.</p>

<p>Of equal (or greater) importance in the interpretation of the results
of the studies are<b> changing conditions</b> -- a generalized phenomenon
in Latin America as in other parts of the world. Among the more important
of these changes, mentioned in the first section of this document, with
an effect on practices, patterns and beliefs are:</p>

<p>o <b>migration to cities</b> (where practices that served will in rural
areas do not serve so well);</p>

<p>o <b>changes in information and in available services in rural areas</b>
related to the advance of the communications media, to re-migration or
periodic visits from the cities, and to the arrival of services such as
the school, and health centers (bringing with them modifications in practices
and norms that do not necessarily conform to the rural context);</p>

<p>o <b>violence and war</b> (that dislocate people and which define new
priorities and means of seeing the world, affecting practices and patterns;
and </p>

<p>o <b>social and economic changes</b> such as the neo-liberal economic
strategies that have been accompanied by increased poverty. The conditions
of poverty demand, frequently, strategies of accommodation in practices
of childrearing to precarious conditions of life. These accommodations
are functional in terms of the survival of family members, but negative
from the point of view of the health of the child. That is to say, the
up-bringing of children does not always occupy first place in the list
of priorities of a family pressured by the need to survive.</p>

<p>All these changes in conditions were found in the case studies.</p>

<p>Constant change creates a tension between practices that represent,
on one hand, belonging to and the preservation of a particular culture
and, on the other hand, a cultural adjustment to actual and future changes.
</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<p>o When judging practices, the prevalence of change makes it necessary
to distinguish the desire to maintain &quot;traditional&quot; patterns
and practices simply in order to maintain them, from a desire to maintain
them because the continue to respond to basic and real needs of the people.
</p>

<p>o In some situations, it is difficult to identify norms.</p>

<p>o in many cases practices diverge from norms, creating contradictions
and guilt in daily life.</p>

<p>o it is necessary to put in context the findings of the case studies
and the recommendations to improve childrearing practices.</p>

<p><b>Traditional and Scientific Viewpoints</b></p>

<p>1. It is possible to find &quot;traditional&quot; patterns and practices
in many places that, in spite of marked differences in geographic and cultural
differences, have at the same time a &quot;scientific&quot; and a &quot;cultural&quot;
value. These traditional patterns and practices may not be accepted by
all people in a particular place but they are common. They represent a
form of adaptation to precarious conditions and should be supported. For
example:</p>

<p>o Treating pregnancy as &quot;normal&quot; and not as a &quot;disease&quot;
or as an abnormal condition.</p>

<p>o The psychological help provided to a pregnant woman by mid-wives.
</p>

<p>o The creation of a friendly and familial atmosphere in the home at
the time of birth.</p>

<p>o The use of certain herbs to facilitate birth.</p>

<p>o The practice of reserving &quot;forty days&quot; for recovery and
of substituting for the mother in her daily work during the post-partum
period.</p>

<p>o Breastfeeding on demand.</p>

<p>o The practice of carrying the child (which facilitates breastfeeding
and the possibility of interaction with the general surroundings as well
as with the mother).</p>

<p>o The practice of sleeping with the child (which facilitates touch and
breastfeeding will helping the process of attachment). </p>

<p>o Gradual weaning (in many places).</p>

<p>o The presence and use of natural toys.</p>

<p>o Assigning tasks to the young child, consistent with ability and with
a progression in difficulty.</p>

<p>2. At the same time, there exist patterns and practices that represent
tensions between a &quot;scientific&quot; point of view and a cultural,
traditional, popular point of view. For example:</p>

<p>o During pregnancy, many times the lack of check-ups and the failure
to change eating habits is associated with problems. </p>

<p>o At birth, in a significant number of cases, the baby is not brought
to the mother right away.</p>

<p>o In Peru, colostrum is seen as harmful.</p>

<p>o The idea that the small child is not capable of learning appears often
in popular wisdom. </p>

<p>o Abrupt weaning occurs with some frequency.</p>

<p>o Delay in the introduction of supplementary foods is common. </p>

<p>o There is a lack of stimulation and verbal interaction between parents
and their babies.</p>

<p>o There is little recognition that babies are sensitive to their surrounding
emotional environment.</p>

<p>o Physical punishment is seen as necessary.</p>

<p>o Play is often seen as a waste of time.</p>

<p>3. There also exist patterns, practices and beliefs that have a high
cultural value but, according to science, do not have a major affect on
the physical or psycho-social development of a child. </p>

<p>o The practice of saving and/or burying the placenta. </p>

<p>o The use of a bracelet as a protection against &quot;mal de ojo.&quot;</p>

<p>o The ritual cutting of hair (in Bolivia and Per&amp;;).</p>

<p>o The application of eggwhite if the child does not walk (Honduras).</p>

<p><b>V</b></p>

<p><b>IMPLICATIONES</b></p>

<p>In the studies of each country and in the discussion of results in Bogota,
some implications for programming and action were identified.</p>

<p><b>General implications for programming</b></p>

<p>1. <b>There are no formulas.</b> The rich diversity of the studies is
difficult to capture in a summary. The breadth of conditions and contexts,
and the variation encountered in practices, patterns and beliefs confirms
the general conclusion that programs of early childhood care and development
need to be adjusted to local variations and realities. If not, it will
be impossible to respect cultural differences. If not, it will be impossible
to &quot;begin with the knowledge of the people.&quot;</p>

<p>2. <b>Methods of work at the local level should be reinforced that permit
description and analysis of practices, patterns and beliefs and that promote
changes in the process.</b> The emphasis on methods that can be applied
at the local level is of equal or greater importance than an emphasis on
the discovery of general patterns with the goal of setting policies related
to the entire population. Therefore; in the preparation of plans, in training
materials, and in field work, processes should be promoted that permit
educational agents to work with community groups in investigating, reflecting
on, and acting in accordance with their childrearing practices. This is
more important than dictating practices.</p>

<p>3. <b>It is necessary to revive those &quot;traditional&quot; practices
and popular wisdom that favor healthy and integral development of the young
child.</b> In the process, it is important to avoid value judgements about
popular wisdom that, if made from the beginning, would not permit understanding
and the revival of such practices.</p>

<p>4. <b>Emphasis should be placed on work and discussion in groups in
order to make information about childrearing practices.</b> The presentation
of practices derived from scientific and/or ecumenical ideas ought to be
seen as the source of &quot;themes&quot; for discussion and dialogue (more
than as the basis for &quot;messages&quot;) with communities. The dialogue
should not be based on the attempt to convince people to accept certain
practices or patterns or beliefs originating in science or church doctrine,
but should require identification, valuing and appropriating practices
with roots in the popular wisdom of various cultures.</p>

<p>5. <b>It is neither valid nor just to continue to use &quot;marginal&quot;
to put a label on certain social groups.</b> The fact that poverty defines
the conditions of life for a major proportion of the population in many
societies makes it necessary to question the concepts of &quot;normality&quot;
and of &quot;marginality,&quot; reserving the latter for conditions in
which the people lack services that can better their life. </p>

<p>6. <b>There is a tension between a &quot;global vision&quot; in which
everything seems inter-related and important and a necessity to assign
priorities.</b> One form of overcoming this tension is to distinguish short
term and long term actions, focussing on areas of priority in the short
run and working with the integrated vision for long term plans. In such
a process, it is necessary to recognize that short-term priorities will
not be the same in all places and that all priorities should be chosen
with participation of the people. </p>

<p>7. <b>It is not sufficient to speak only of &quot;preventive&quot; actions
in conditions that offer little opportunity of avoiding the future problems
that preventive actions are supposed to prevent.</b> In order to evaluate
the effects of childrearing practices, it is important to look not only
at immediate effects but also to evaluate effects of the practices in later
years.</p>

<p>8. <b>A &quot;constructive&quot; vision is needed.&quot;</b> It is important
to maintain a positive and constructive vision. Accordingly, emphasis should
be placed on recognizing good practice rather than on punishing bad practice.</p>

<p>9. <b>More attention should be given to the entire family in childrearing.</b>
Programs should not only be directed to mothers. Also:</p>

<p>o Much more attention should be given to fathers.</p>

<p>o The care given by grandparents and siblings should be recognized.</p>

<p>10. <b>Working with parents and other members of the family is essentially
a matter of adult education.</b> Therefore, professionals and other people
with experience in work with children also need training in how to work
with adults.</p>

<p>11.<b> There is a need to examine the influence on childrearing practices
of the social construction of gender roles, with emphasis on the role of
the male.</b></p>

<p>12. <b>There are examples of efforts made by communities to respond
to change with new forms of childrearing that combine the traditional with
new arrangements and methods.</b> One example was found in the resettlement
community of El Cen&iacute;cero studied in El Salvador. Another is the
community of San Jos&eacute; Nacahuil in Guatemala which shows the incorporation
of many &quot;modern&quot; practices while maintaining other &quot;traditional&quot;
practices.&quot; </p>

<p>13. <b>Alliances should be sought out among institutions seeking to
better the welfare of young children.</b> Neither the government nor non-governmental
institutions , nor the church can expect the desired results working alone.</p>

<p>14. <b>Greater effort needs to be made to integrate the intellectual,
social and emotional part of development of children into programs of health
and nutrition.</b></p>

<p>15. <b>It is necessary to take into account, more than has been done,
the force and potential which television has as an influence over young
children.</b> </p>

<p><b>Implications according to developmental stages</b></p>

<p><b>Pre-natal y birth</b></p>

<p>o Greater attention to &quot;birth spacing&quot; is necessary.</p>

<p>o Greater attention to food habits and nutritional status in the pre-natal
period is called for.</p>

<p>o Practices with a high cultural value, such as burying the placenta
ought to be respected in the birthing process.</p>

<p>o The training of traditional mid-wives should continue, respecting
practices that have served well and incorporating elements from formal
medicine into their reparatory.</p>

<p>o It is necessary to produce a radical change in the attitudes of doctors
and others working in the formal health sector who should stop treating
pregnancy and birth as abnormal or as a condition of illness.</p>

<p>o It is worthwhile strengthening such existing practices as:</p>

<p>- birth at home (with, however, training of mid-wives, birthing &quot;kits&quot;
and provision of contingencies for possible problems)</p>

<p>- the use of traditional methods that facilitate giving birth.</p>

<p>o Hospitals should be reorganized in order to permit a more &quot;human&quot;
environment, including the participation of family members and facilitating
the nearness of mother and child from the moment of birth onwards. </p>

<p><b>Forty days and Lactencia</b></p>

<p>o Nutritional campaigns have had very little effect on the practice
of introducing supplementary food on the maintenance of breastfeeding and
on weaning. The ways in which information about these practices is presented
would be re-examined.</p>

<p><b>Infancy and Pre-school</b></p>

<p>o More space is needed in communities dedicated to play.</p>

<p>o It is possible to strengthen learning by reinforcing the practice
of assigning children errands and daily tasks.</p>

<p>o The practice of physical discipline requires additional attention.</p>

<p><b>Implications for Organizations</b></p>

<p><b>UNICEF</b></p>

<p>A. <b>Situation Analysis</b>. Information about childrearing practices
should be included systematically in Situation Analyses. This implies incorporating
qualitative information and suggests a need to look for links with (and/or
to strengthen links with) groups that have an institutional capacity for
continuing analysis. </p>

<p>B. <b>Publications</b> such as &quot;Facts for Life&quot; dealing with
child development need to be re-examined from the perspective of childrearing
practices and need to be seen as an invitation to dialogue rather than
as a presentation of universal truths.</p>

<p>C. <b>Training</b></p>

<p>o A large challenge and necessity exists to help reorient health personnel
in the formal sector toward a more humane position incorporating also into
their work elements of traditional wisdom.</p>

<p>o It is important to continue support for the training of traditional
mid-wives.</p>

<p>o In programs of training for community agents, whether in nutrition,
health, psycho-social development or community promotion, it is worthwhile
including a participatory exercise dealing with the collection of local
childrearing practices. This would help to raise the consciousness of these
agents and could also provide them with a methodology for promoting change
with participation. </p>

<p>D. The emphasis of UNICEF on <b>&quot;baby friendly hospitals&quot;</b>
is very limited and should be redefined as &quot;baby-friendly birthing&quot;
in order to include attention to births that occur in locations outside
the formal system.</p>

<p>E. <b>Integration.</b> A continuing challenge exists of seeking greater
integration across sectors in the work of UNICEF, and more particularly
of incorporating a psycho-social dimension of development into existing
programs.</p>

<p>F. <b>Definition of &quot;scale.&quot; </b>It is necessary to modify
or extend the concept of &quot;going to scale&quot; that predominates in
UNICEF if the organization wishes to resolve the tension in the process
of programming between broad coverage and work in interaction with communities,
respecting their cultural history and their particular life conditions.
The idea of &quot;scale&quot; as the extension to all of one solution at
a national level ought to be revised to include the idea of &quot;scale&quot;
as the sum of various efforts and programs directed toward the same goal
but different in their operation and directed to different groups at the
local or regional level. (This is consistent with an idea of decentralization.)
The fact that UNICEF also helps small projects and basic service projects
taking the child as a central focus ought to help the appreciation of scale
as the sum of various activities.</p>

<p>G. <b>Complementary strategies.</b> If a profound change is expected
in childrearing practices, it is not sufficient to work with the topic
of practices at the level of the child and the family; it is also necessary
to look for changes in patterns and beliefs at the community level, in
social institutions and in the culture at large. In order to work at all
of these levels, it is necessary to formulate a set of complementary strategies
including:</p>

<p>o work in institutions or centers, directly with the child;</p>

<p>o work with adults and others who care for the child;</p>

<p>o work with the conditions and organization of the community;</p>

<p>o work with social institutions (and with professionals in the institutions)
y</p>

<p>o work at the level of the culture.</p>

<p>H. <b>From institutions toward families.</b> In many programs, the tendency
is to offer an institutional service that converts community members into
&quot;users&quot; of services that are offered from inside the institutions.
The user must go to the institution to obtain the service. The study of
childrearing practices suggests that, in order to obtain better results,
the emphasis should shift &quot;from and toward the institution&quot; to
&quot;from and toward the family.&quot; That is to say, actions should
be adjusted to the needs of the population as expressed by family members
and the locus of action for programs should be moved ever closer to the
family and the child in their own living space.</p>

<p><b>CELAM</b></p>

<p>A. A need exists to <b>mount a general strategy </b>for the promotion
of attention to young children, at a regional level and in each country.
A process of conscientization is needed within distinct levels of the church.</p>

<p>B. <b>Promote intra-institutional collaboration.</b> Forms need to be
sought in which existing institutional spaces and practices can be used
to work with the topic of the young child. For example, the content of
the social pastorate and of family programs includes activities pertinent
to children. Practices such as the preparation of parents for the baptism
of their child or of young couples for marriage gives an opportunity to
include material oriented toward improving the welfare of young children.</p>

<p>C. There is a need to <b>create new institutional spaces</b> within
the church for the attention to young children, such as the &quot;pastorales
de la infancia.&quot;</p>

<p>D. There is a need to <b>reorient some of the materials</b> about child
development produced by the church in order to incorporate men in the process
and to open out the limited concept of what constitutes a &quot;family.&quot;
At the same time, new materials can be developed to assist training courses
(see the following point) and the process of educational communication
in the community work of the church. </p>

<p>E. <b>Training</b> courses are needed for parish priests and others
working at the village level in:</p>

<p>o fundamentals of child survival and development</p>

<p>o application of the method &quot;Analysis of Reality&quot; to the situation
of children.</p>

<p>o application of other methods to describe and analyze childrearing
practices and patterns. </p>

<p>F. <b>Community agents.</b> It is important to work with nuns and lay
groups as well as with parish priests.</p>

<p>G. The existing <b>catechism</b> should be examined with respect to
its treatment of the child and new forms should be sought for including
the topic in the catechism. (A useful example comes from the work of Padre
Bravo in Mexico.)</p>

<p>H. <b>Community.</b> It would be worthwhile re-examining the definition
of &quot;community&quot; to extend the concept beyond those who are active
in the church. Children and families who do not participate in the activities
of the church have needs and, up to a certain point, influence practices
and the condition of those who are part of the church. In order to work
at the level of the community ( and not only at the level of the church)
it links to other organizations in the Civil Society and with the government
are suggested.</p>

<p>I. The church should look for new forms and mechanisms of assistance
to the family related to the changing context in which more women are working
outside the home.</p>

<p>J. A re-examination of the <b>role of men</b> in childrearing should
be undertaken and new ways sought of strengthening the role of men in the
childrearing process.</p>

<p><b>Governments</b></p>

<p>A. In order to moderate the negative effects of programs of economic
adjustment, greater attention is needed to investment in the social sector.</p>

<p>B. Formal health systems need to be reoriented in order to work more
closely with the informal health sector and in order to change attitudes
of the health personnel.</p>

<p>C. The psycho-social component of development should be incorporated
into health and nutrition programs.</p>

<p>D. Governments should give greater support to the efforts of non-governmental
organizations working for the benefit of young children.</p>

<p><b>Non-governmental organizations</b></p>

<p>A. It would be worthwhile to re-examine the tension between external
agents paid for by NGOs and local volunteers with respect to the effect
of the differences on the process of &quot;accompaniment&quot; that is
at the heart of many NGO programs.</p>

<p><b>Implications for further study and experimentation</b></p>

<p>1. The role of fathers in childrearing merits further study, including
study of the actual role and of the process that leads to his marginal
involvement.</p>

<p>2. The area of psycho-social development should be treated more systematically.
For instance, the theme of &quot;stimulation&quot; should be examined not
only in relation to play and the presentation of stimuli such as colors,
but also in terms of the stimulation that occurs (or does not) in relation
to the practices of feeding, carrying, bathing, etc.</p>

<p>3. Relatively little information was found in the studies reviewed about
the communication between young children and those who care for them. When
there are results, these seem to identify a pattern of neglect. Given the
apparent delay in linguistic development for many children, systematic
study is required.</p>

<p>4. The topic of child abuse came out in all of the studies even though
this was not originally included as a topic for study. Even recognizing
that the topic is a difficult one, it seems critical to try and quantify
the problem and to study causes.</p>

<p>5. Related to the previous point is the theme of alcoholism. The development
and testing of materials dealing with that topic should be undertaken and
activities should be developed to try and deal with this widespread problem
affecting the early development of children.</p>

<p>6. Older children. The experience in the Mexican case study with older
children in communities suggests that it would be worthwhile to experiment
in programs of the &quot;Child-to-Child&quot; type with activities focussed
on childrearing practices. </p>

<p>7. The search for pertinent information contained in secondary sources
ought to be extended to bibliographies and other sources not included in
Phase II that might illuminate the &quot;why&quot; of certain patterns
and practices.</p>

<b>patterns</b> used in the study differs from two others that might have
been adopted. One alternative to the normative definition used is to define
patterns statistically, adding up individual practices in order to identify
the most common practice for a group (which would then be labled as characteristic
of the group) or looking at the statistical distribution of practices labeling
that as a &quot;pattern.&quot; Another use of &quot;pattern,&quot; not
adopted in this study, is defined by looking at the ways in which practices
responding to different needs cluster or group together. Clusters occur
because practices evolve together within particular settings, because a
child's needs are intertwined, and because the practical choices made to
satisfy one need help to set limits on what it is possible to do to satisfy
another. For instance, the choice of breastfeeding on demand requires a
kind of physical proximity to the mother at all times that scheduled bottle
feeding does not. That requirement affects carrying and sleeping practices.
It may also affect work options and schedules, or vice versa. The physical
closeness of mother to child also permits, or reinforces, a kind of nurturing
that is different from that employed when there is greater physical separation.</p>

<h3>Creating the Foundation Stones for  
Education for All:</h3>
<b>Action Initiatives in Early Childhood
Care and Development</b><br>

by Robert G. Myers<br>
<p>
	"Why invest in programmes of Early Childhood Care and 	Development as part of
a basic education strategy?  Before you can build a house, it is necessary to
lay foundation stones to support the entire structure.  Before a child enters
primary school, a similar foundation must be laid.  Embedded within their
family, their community, and their cultural values, very young children, (from
birth to six) need to be supported in the development of the physical, mental,
and social abilities that will enable them to survive and thrive in later
years.  The successful education of the child during its years of schooling
depends to a great degree upon the foundation stones laid during the pre-school
years." (from Meeting Basic Learning Needs)<p>
<p>
	In the first year and one-half following Jomtien, attention of the EFA
Consultative Forum and of the Forum Secretariat was directed toward primary
school education and literacy, with little attention to the early childhood
part of basic learning and education.  The first meeting of the EFA Forum, held
in Paris in December 1992, did not include early childhood on the agenda.  <p>
	This oversight was corrected with inclusion of the topic at the Second EFA
Forum, held in New Delhi, India from September 8 - 10, 1993.  The meeting
brought together approximately 120 individuals including resource people and
representatives of country, agency and NGO constituencies.  The central theme
of the meeting, Quality Education for All, was pursued in relation to four main
topics: Early Childhood Development; Improving Primary Schooling; Improving
Non-formal Education; Financing Quality Basic Education.  In addition, there
were roundtable discussions dealing with new partnerships in EFA, basic
education for girls and women, and the contribution of the media to EFA.  <p>
<p>
	In discussing each of the topics mentioned above, participants were asked to
address three cross-cutting themes: gender equality; assessment and monitoring
of learning (measuring success); and going to scale.<p>
<p>
	To prepare for the early childhood portion of the New Delhi Forum, an ad hoc
committee was formed.  The Bernard van Leer Foundation assumed the role of
organizer, assisted by the Secretariat of the Consultative Group on Early
Childhood Care and Development.  Funding was sought to prepare a handout
covering background issues and ECCD strategies (Meeting Basic Learning Needs),
case studies (summarized on p.  ), and a video (First Steps, see p.   ) to
support participation in the New Delhi meeting by presenters.  <p>
<p>
	As a result of the New Delhi discussions, the following was read into the
record as a statement of intent and in order to highlight several topics that
arose as areas of priority during the discussion:<p>
<p>
"During the Forum a group of institutions and individuals concerned with early
childhood learning and development met in order to identify key themes and
collaborative actions to pursue following the Forum.  The purpose of the
collabora-tive actions would be to strengthen policy, planning and
implementation of programs directed toward enhanced learning during the early
years, better preparing children for school and life.<p>
<p>
The Group emphasized the importance of continuing represen-tation of the early
childhood area on the Steering Committee of the EFA Forum and in future EFA
Fora.  We began by iden-tifying lines of action already being pursued by
organiza-tions within the Group and took into account suggestions for action
that emerged during the Forum, both in the plenary sessions and in informal
discussions with participants.  Extending collaborative effort was recommended
within three general lines of action:<p>
<ul>
	<li>  strengthening human and financial resources;<br>
	<li>   strengthening the knowledge and information base;<br>
	<li>  linking early childhood development with other 		   program lines.</ul>
<p>
Examples of priority issues to be worked on were also identified.  These
include:<p>
<ul>
<li>  strengthening regional and national centres which support     quality in
early childhood programs;<br>
<li>  costs and financing;<br>
<li>  development and use of indicators of early development in     order to
measure progress toward goals;<br>
<li>  collaboration of early childhood programs with primary        school
programs, adult education and literacy programs,       programs directed to
girls and women, health and              nutrition programs, and community
action programs.<br>
</ul>
To achieve these inter-relationships requires building partnerships.  To move
these ideas forward, it was decided to call a meeting in early November of an
expanded group in order to develop concrete plans of action in these priority
areas."<p>
<p>
	As a result of the New Delhi meeting, Early Childhood is again on the agenda.
A general report summarizing progress toward EFA goals (and reflecting the
renewed attention to early childhood development) will be available from the
EFA Consultative Forum Secretariat in early 1994. (see Related Resources). <p>
	The questions we are now asking include:<p>
<p>
	What can be done to move beyond the rhetoric of the meeting?  <p>
	What can be done to strengthen actions now being planned or carried out?<p>
<p>
	What can be done to extend the growing, but still weak, attention to early
learning and development within the priorities and budgets of organizations at
international, national and local levels?  <p>
<p>
	What needs to be done that is not being done?  <p>
<p>
	How can limited resources be used more effectively?<p>
<p>
	To address these questions, and to formulate a more concrete plan of action,
the follow-up meeting mentioned above was held in New York, hosted by UNICEF,
November 3-4, 1994.<p>

<b>The New York Meeting on ECCD</b><p>
<p>
	The general purpose of the meeting was to promote working together in common
cause in order to activate and strengthen work in the field of early childhood
development.  The specific purposes of the meeting were:  <p>
  <p>
	1.  To identify areas within the field of early childhood care and development
that need to be strengthened or extended (beginning with those suggested at the
New Delhi meeting).<p>
<p>
	2.  To suggest concrete activities that are being (or could be) carried out in
order to strengthen the field, in line with purpose No. 1.<p>
<p>
	3.  To identify partners in the task of improving and extending programs of
early childhood care and development.<p>
<p>
	4.  To arrange a mechanism (mechanisms) for mobilizing, monitoring, summing up
and extracting lessons learned from activities.  <p>
<p>
<p>
	Representatives from the following organisations were present for the
discussion: UNICEF, the World Bank, USAID, the Bernard van Leer Foundation,
Save the Children/USA, the Christian Children's Fund, High/Scope Foundation,
the Consultative Group on ECCD, and The US Coalition for EFA. <p>
	A set of background notes was prepared for the meeting, including an analysis
of responses to a questionnaire distributed prior to the meeting in which
organizations indicated their priorities and plans.  <p>
<p>
	The background document also included information on earlier EFA meetings,
some questions to guide discussion, as well as a cautionary note pointing out
that although early childhood development now seems to be actively on the
agenda of many organizations and although considerable strides have been made
since Jomtien, a great deal remains to be done.  This position was backed by
evidence that top officials and writers of the "World Reports" produced by the
four major organizations that sponsored Jomtien have not yet incorporated early
childhood development into the mainstream of their thinking.<p>
<p>
	Discussion began with efforts to specify what the group would like to see
happen as a result of formulating a larger, collaborative vision and a Plan of
Action.  It moved quickly to how that might be done. Most of the meeting time
was spent on discussion of specific issues and activities, which appear (or are
reflected) in the action plan outlined below.   <p>
<p>
<b>1. Identification of priority issues and areas for work</b><p>
<p>
	As a starting point, the participants turned to issues identified during the
New Delhi meeting.  These were:<ul>

	<li>  strengthening regional and national centres<br>
	  <li>  costs and financing<br>
	  <li>  indicators/monitoring<br>
	  <li>  linking early child development initiatives with primary 	 	  schooling,
health, adult education and women's programs.<br>
</ul>
	Two other topics were added to the list, based on the original Jomtien
declaration:<ul>
<li>	  social communication<br>
<li>  	  fundamental research.<br>
</ul>
<b>2. A Plan of Action</b><p>
<p>
	For each of the priority issues, participants first indicated what their
respective organizations were doing to address the issue and/or indicated the
level of organizational interest in cooperating with others to address the
issue.  Based on this discussion it was possible, for each issue, to identify
activities that could be completed over the next two years,  specify who would
participate, describe expected outcomes, and indicate the uses to which the
outcomes would be put over the longer haul.<p>
<p>
	Although the initial time frame for the activities chosen is approximately two
years, some activities are of shorter duration and will be used to mobilize
interest and support over a longer period with respect to each area.<p>

<b>3.  Assignment of Responsibilities</b><p>
<p>
	Each organization took responsibility for leadership in one or more of the
priority areas set out. (The responsible organisations are marked with an *).
<p>
<p>
	Liaison with the EFA Secretariat fell to the Bernard van Leer Foundation and
USAID, both of whom have members on the EFA Steering Committee.<p>
	General responsibility for keeping organizations informed of progress, for
seeking extended cooperation, for monitoring and for synthesizing results from
the various activities within the Plan of Action was assigned to the
Secretariat of the Consultative Group on Early Childhood Care and
Development.<p>
In addition, work on gender issues and the link to women's programming was
assigned (jointly with USAID) to Judith Evans of the Consultative Group
Secretariat.<p>
<p>
	Responsibilities were also assigned, where appropriate, for exploring how
early childhood care and development issues might be integrated into each of
several up-coming international meetings or initiatives.  Events specifically
identified were:<p>
<p>
	  The Nine Country Education Summit<br>
	  The Cairo Population Meeting<br>
	  The Copenhagen Social Development Summit<br>
	  The Vancouver Conference on "Stronger Children - Stronger 		Families"<br>
	  The Beijing Women's Conference<br>
	  Jomtien II<br>
 (see calendar for relevant dates).<p>
<p>
<b>4.  Plans for involving additional organizations</b><p>
<p>
	A long list of organizations that might be interested in collaboration was
drawn up, many of whom are located in Europe.  It was recommended, therefore,
that a similar meeting be held in Europe in early 1994.  Such a meeting would
have as its main purpose to extend collaboration in activities intended to
strengthen work in the field of early childhood development.  It would take as
its starting point the outcomes of the New York meeting.  The Secretariat of
the Consultative Group on Early Childhood Care and Development will convene the
meeting which will be hosted by UNESCO.<p>
<p>
	At the end of 1991, there was little evidence that young children and their
parents were a serious concern to those striving to achieve Education for All.
Yet much was being done, especially by the organizations mentioned above, to
address the conditions in which young children and their families are living.
Through the New Delhi meeting, there was a renewal of commitment and attention
to young children and women as part of the EFA basic education strategies.  The
more that specific efforts to address ECCD within countries or regions can be
communicated to others, evaluated and understood, the more likely they are to
contribute to the knowledge base and to the momentum that is being gained.
Thus this coordinated Action Plan represents an exciting step forward in the
efforts to move from EFA rhetoric to action in creating significant supports
for young children and their families around the globe.  <p>

<i>	If your organization is conducting work in ECCD, or would like to
collaborate in this coordinated effort, please contact Judith Evans of the
Consultative Group Secretariat.</i><p>

<title>Educating Young Children: A Broader Vision, by John Bennett</title><body>
<b>Educating Young Children: A Broader Vision</b><br>
<p>
<i>John Bennett</i><b>[1]</b><br>
<i>Coordinator Early Childhood and Family Programmes</i><p>
<i>UNESCO</i><p>
<p>
<p>
	The Jomtien World Conference on Education for All (WCEFA), convened in 1990,
was an attempt to improve education, especially in developing countries. Its
basic message was that developing countries and international agencies should
confront the problem of illiteracy and educational decline by concentrating
energies and investment in basic education.<b>[2]</b>   <p>
<p>
	According to the "Framework for Action to Meet Basic Learning Needs" developed
at WCEFA, national basic education would be composed of four pillars:<p>
<p>
	 a four-year concentrated, primary cycle for all children which would provide
basic reading, writing, numeracy and life skills, both family and
environmental;<p>
<p>
	 non-formal education for children and adults not reached by schools,
especially women;<p>
<p>
	 expansion and improvement of early child development, care and education
services;<p>
<p>
	 further teaching of basic knowledge and life skills to all the population
through the use of the various communication channels. <p>
<p>
	What is unique about this initiative is that the definition of basic education
is broader and more attuned to the realities of people's lives than earlier
attempts to address these issues.	Thus, although calling for educational
investments in the primary cycle where the bases of literacy and numeracy are
laid, the Jomtien initiative also provides an enlarged vision of national
education.  Education should reach out to all sections of society, should use
non-formal approaches where necessary, and, in the case of early childhood,
should include social inputs and community-based approaches. <p>
	<p>
	The initiative goes beyond asking countries (and donors) to invest more money
in education - it calls for a comprehensive re-thinking of priorities in
defining basic education.  This approach represents a clear recognition that
the formal schooling model is inadequate, in and of itself, to address all the
education needs and to prepare people to address social problems in developing
countries. <p>
 <p>
<p>
	Despite real success in providing education to growing numbers of children and
adults,<b>[3]</b> the outlook at the end of the eighties
for education throughout the world was giving rise to serious misgivings.  In
the developing world, four fifths of the world's children were now surviving
their first year of life, and their learning capacity was much diminished by
poverty in all its forms.  Educational progress made from 1960 to the early
1980s had to a large extent been overtaken by population gains.  Over 100
million children did not have access to primary education, and of those who
did, almost 50% dropped out before they were really literate or numerate.  To
add to the difficulties of education ministries, there was the realization that
of the non-schooled children, over two-thirds were girls, especially in South
East Asia and the Middle East, a factor destined to have serious educational
and social consequences for the next generation of children. (UNICEF, 1992) <p>
<p>
	Although the picture was infinitely better in the industrialized world, the
situation was far from ideal.  More children than ever were being educated.
These children enjoyed greater intelligence, better health and a higher
standard of living than ever before in human history.  Yet, paradoxically,
there was growing dissatisfaction with education, and evidence of a decline in
learning achievement.  More and more casualties of national education systems
were appearing, not only in the growing ranks of barely literate and unemployed
youth, but even more seriously, in the spiralling delinquency figures in the
poor areas of the large cities.  In short, although in Western democracies
education reforms had become a common feature of each change in government,
they generally failed to achieve the results intended.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
<p>
	Another recommendation made by the Jomtien initiative was that there should be
a serious renewal of education management.  At the national level, countries
following the Education for All (EFA) process should:<p>
<p>
	 hold regular, national-level policy meetings on EFA;<p>
<p>
	 create information campaigns to sensitize the public to the importance of
basic education;<p>
<p>
	 adopt concrete and measurable EFA goals;<p>
<p>
	 formulate a national strategy or national plan of action covering the
development of integrated basic education services;<p>
<p>
	 create a national body with executive responsibility for promoting and
coordinating basic education policies, programmes and services;<p>
<p>
	 increase significantly national investment in basic education;<p>
	<p>
	 hold pledging conferences with donor countries and agencies in order to bring
more resources to basic education.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Is the Jomtien approach working?</b><p>
<p>
	At the level of the international funding agencies, both the World Bank and
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have more than doubled their
funding of basic education in the developing world.  UNICEF has developed its
basic education personnel at national level and has created a central unit at
headquarters in New York to coordinate educational activities, including early
child development.  Its funding of basic education has increased from $46
million dollars to $79 million annually.<p>
<p>
	Similarly, UNESCO has stepped up its funding for basic education bringing it
up to $54 million biennially.  With UNICEF, it has created a joint committee
for EFA, and together both organizations have embarked on several co-operative
programmes, including the ambitious <i>Nine Most Populous Countries
Programme</i>, focussed on the countries in which the great majority of the
world's illiterate people live.  In addition, an early childhood and family
unit was established.<p>
<p>
	Reaction to Jomtien has been very positive at the country level as well, and
has elicited the formulation of EFA goals by over 100 countries.  Over half of
those countries have launched some sort of information campaign but far fewer
countries have yet taken concrete steps to establish a national EFA mechanism
or increase the national budget for basic education.  There seems to be a trend
toward greater investment in basic education, although it is still too early
for data to be complete.  Hopes are high that many countries will reach one of
the major EFA goals of minimum 80% enrollment by the year 2000.  <p>
<p>
	The following examples are taken from UNESCO's "Status and Trends" report,
updating progress toward EFA goals, produced by the EFA Consultative Forum
Secretariat: <p>
	  Costa Rica's national roundtable on EFA brought together the ministries of
education, health, labour, planning and agriculture, as well as private and
state universities, non-governmental organizations, educational associations,
and aid agencies.  It led to the preparation of a national action plan to
provide literacy and basic skills training for women, literacy campaigns in
educationally deprived areas, an integrated early childhood development
program, education provision for the disabled, and multicultural, bilingual
education for indigenous people.<p>
<p>
	  Mexico is undertaking a US $100 million non-formal education project aimed
at boosting the efficiency and quality of preschool education in ten of the
poorest states of the country.  By preparing children from poor families for
their entrance to primary school and introducing parent education, Mexico hopes
to help 1,200,000 children under the age of 4 to learn better.<p>
<p>
	  The Dominican Republic has launched a plan devoted to <i>rescuing
education</i>: to get all children between 4 and 15 in school by the year 2000
and to drastically cut the dropout rate.  School councils will be set up,
parent-teacher associations revived, curricula will be overhauled, and
teachers' salaries increased.  The education ministry has also started a
"breakfast-at-school" programme so every child will be given a morning snack,
which should lure them off the streets and back into school.<p>
<p>
	  In Africa, nine Sahel countries have agreed to tackle their problems in
unison.  In close dialogue with UNESCO, UNDP, the World Bank and major
bilateral donors, this group of countries drew up an action programme to
achieve EFA by the year 2000.  Through cooperation and joint action in such
fields as planning and management, production of learning materials, teacher
training and applied research, they intend to overcome their resource
constraints and realize important economies of scale.<p>
<p>
	  Yet another model endeavor is that of a small island country -- Mauritius --
whose "Education Master Plan" prepared in the wake of Jomtien, has brought
together several donors to assist the country to implement it.<p>
<p>
	  In Asia, where three-quarters of the world's illiterate adults live,
political support for basic education has been especially strong.  India, for
example, is launching several large-scale and long-term projects in the
country's most educationally deprived states.  In Rajasthan, for example, the
Lok Jumbish (People's Mobilization) has been set up to achieve EFA goals in 10
years.  The US$7 million programme, of which 50 percent will come from the
Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) and the rest from state and
central governments, aims at transferring responsibility for educational
management to the village community.  Every means, from electronic media to
folk theater, are being used, particularly to mobilize women.<p>
<p>
	  Nepal is striving to universalize primary education by introducing girls'
scholarships, improving teacher training programmes and distributing free
books.  It is also organizing basic education programmes for adults.<p>
<p>
	  Pakistan has launched a new national education plan aimed at improving basic
education in the country by involving NGOs and the private sector and by
increasing participation rates for girls by 8.8 percent per annum (compared to
2.5 percent for boys). Substantial government financing is being provided to
ensure the Plan's success.<p>
<p>
	  Countries in the North are also taking action.  Ireland, for example, is
intensifying its efforts to promote literacy for youths and adults by
significantly boosting its budget for this purpose.  Special attention will be
given to those who have basic literacy skills but do not read and write
sufficiently to cope in society.  Within school, Ireland is renewing its
efforts to identify and support those children with special learning needs.
These measures include improving assessment and remedial services and expanding
programmes to involve parents.  In addition, Ireland, which prior to Jomtien
funneled its educational aid exclusively to technical and higher education, has
re-examined its policy and now supports several basic education projects in
Africa.<p>
<p>
	  In line with Jomtien recommendations, the United States set a number of
education goals for the year 2000: that all children will start school ready to
learn, that at least 90 percent of high school students will graduate, and that
all adult Americans will be literate.  A National Education Goals Panel has
been set up to monitor progress.  Also, a non-governmental organization, the
U.S. Coalition for Education for All, has been established to promote EFA
awareness and action in the country.<p>
<p>
<p>
	The preceeding examples notwithstanding, what has arisen so far in response to
the EFA initiative is focussed mostly on the four year primary cycle.  There
are good reasons for this choice.  The primary school network already exits and
its potential is great if effectively used.  Yet this being said, certain
disquieting tendencies are emerging:<p>
<p>
   <i>A relative neglect of the three other pillars of basic education, i.e.
non-formal education, early child development and media education.</i> <p>
<p>
	The Jomtien declaration, based on sound and well-documented educational
research, recommends action in these three domains, and funding, in fact, is
growing slowly.  However, a difficulty international agencies encounter when
trying to work in these domains is that frequently neither young children nor
adults have a Ministry responsible for their education.  It is easier for
international agencies to work sectorally within an established formal system
rather than to launch out into the uncertain waters of non-formal education and
early childhood programming. In addition, in countries facing economic
austerity, family and community education is notoriously difficult to promote,
implement, and evaluate (especially in a context where the media are dominated
by commercial concerns).  <p>
<p>
	For this reason, most efforts aimed at young children have been carried out
essentially by the major international NGOs in the field of child care and
education, such as the Bernard van Leer Foundation and Save the Children. These
organizations continue to promote child welfare and parent education through a
multitude of cooperative ventures with government and local NGOs. (For
additional examples, see the International Directory of Young Child and Family
Institutions, UNESCO, 1991)  Their work has been exemplary in its concentration
on the integral development of the child, grass-roots contact, promotion of
local expertise, attention paid to community development and social change.
(Chetley, 1990)<p>
<p>
	On the other hand, most international donor agencies still tend to concentrate
on formal systems, despite the knowledge that the formal education approach
rarely reaches the more disadvantaged populations effectively.  <p>
<p>
	Developing countries worldwide are beginning to understand the advantages of
improving or establishing health and education services for the very young, in
which mothers are actively involved.  Though such initiatives have much wider
implications, they can be supported by education ministries as preparation for
successful learning, achievement and schooling. Unfortunately as yet,
sufficient investment has not emerged from most of the EFA country strategies,
despite the fact that the possibility of establishing low-cost national
programmes is real and effective models exist (Myers, 1992).  <p>
<p>
	Parental and adult education is even more poorly endowed, although it is clear
that community mobilization is essential for successful educational
intervention in disadvantaged milieux, in which the majority of the world's
children live.<p>
<p>
 <p>
  <i>The inability of education ministries and formal school systems to keep
pace with population increases</i>. <p>
	World population in 1960 was about three billion people, by the end of the
century it will be six billion, and will reach, if present trends continue, ten
billion by 2050.  In the face of such population pressure one must not be
overly pessimistic; the tripling of school enrollments since 1960 shows that
where there is a will there is a way.  Many developing countries have the
capacity, the personnel and, most importantly, the political will to finance
adequately and manage effectively their formal education systems.  <p>
<p>
	However, the ability of poorer countries to reform and expand formal
educational structures remains in doubt, particularly within a context of rapid
population increase, growing unemployment and the impoverishment of families.
The evidence suggests that many such countries - and large rural or social
pockets within successful countries - will need to rely on non-formal education
initiatives for many decades to come in order to cope with growing numbers of
children.<p>
<p>
  <i>The persistence of a school model often unsuited to social needs.</i><p>
<p>
	Many developing countries, in an effort to maintain continuity and good
standards, have made few changes to the education systems established under
colonial rule with their equivalencies to the French baccalaur&eacute;at or the
Cambridge certificates. A characteristic of the traditional, centralized
primary school system was to isolate children from parents and local
communities in order to socialize them in the national culture, language and
values as conceived by the State.  Emphasis was placed on certain skills useful
to the State, e.g. the acquisition of academic facts and skills more useful in
industrialized, urban settings than in daily rural living.   <p>
	<p>
	Although parents and local communities were eager to educate their children,
they were not encouraged to be active participants in the process.  During the
seventies and eighties, this model proved inadequate in most developing
countries, and led, in addition, to a breakdown in public esteem for education
and the school institution.  Buildings deteriorated, teachers remained unpaid,
teaching materials and school books fell into short supply.  Hence, the call
from Jomtien for decentralization of the traditional model, with more emphasis
placed on relevance. <p>
	The danger remains, however, that the traditional model may - from lack of
dynamism or political will - linger on and change more slowly than expected. In
most countries, administration, teacher recruitment, curricula and evaluations
are still heavily centralized and there is little encouragement of local
initiative. In terms of curriculum and pedagogy, rather than extending the more
pedagogically appropriate early childhood model upward to 8 year olds,
governments in many countries will choose to extend downward the formal
instructional model for use with 3 - 6 year old children.<p>
<p>
	The question remains, therefore, how can these weaknesses of public education
be overcome, while still striving toward the goal of universal education?	<p>
<p>
 <i> The failure to address the question of egalitarian access</i>: <p>
<p>
	Although tremendous efforts are being made to discourage gender discrimination
in school access, it is clear that relatively few countries have managed to
ensure educational access and success for girls.  This has serious
implications, not only for the girls themselves, but for future generations of
children who will be mothered by uneducated young women.  <p>
<p>
	Mothers, if they are educated in basic life skills, can dramatically change
life for their children and inspire social and economic progress in their
communities.  Studies of the question suggest that the education of mothers in
developing countries is as important in its effect as any other educational
enterprise.  The educational level of the mother has been linked significantly
with falling fertility rates, decreasing infant and mother mortality,(Cochrane,
et. al, 1980), enhanced levels of infant and child development, and greater
social outcomes for children. (King and Hills, 1991) <p>
<p>
	If one is serious about egalitarian access, intervention programmes need to be
put into place for infants and preschool children from disadvantaged milieux.
Even by age four, serious inequalities between children have already begun to
appear and assessments reveal developmental delay in large numbers of children
from poor or minority backgrounds. It has become apparent, particularly as the
multi-cultural nature of the industrial economies has increased, that
integrated and culturally appropriate intervention at an earlier level is
required if all the children of the nation are to be equally cherished, and
costly rehabilitation programmes avoided. <p>
<p>
	Child quality and learning capacity are much diminished by poverty in all its
forms. The consequences of poverty on parents and in turn on their children are
now well-documented.  They include poor personal health; low educational
attainment including poor knowledge of nutrition, hygiene and health care;
social isolation and a tendency to underutilize or have poor access to
essential education and health services; a tendency to remain in the poverty
trap through long-term unemployment; a tendency to become parents at a younger
age; greater likelihood of having high-risk babies, etc. (World Bank, 1980) <p>
<p>
	The psychosocial development of children from such a background is frequently
inhibited, leaving them branded already at the age of four as slow learners.
More seriously, poor prenatal care of mothers, premature or low-weight births,
malnutrition and ill-health at the infant stage - all endemic in very poor
communities - mark or disable the young child. <p>
<p>
	A third aspect of access which is often overlooked, not by the Jomtien
declaration itself, but in post-Jomtien practice, is that the economic
situation in many countries makes education seem impractical to pursue.  Even
if a government is capable of financing a basic education system, the social
and economic benefits for a child who follows the basic four-year cycle are not
immediately evident, especially when educational quality at the primary level
is poor and does not lead to a place either in secondary education or in the
world of work.  <p>
<p>
	For this reason, improving access involves both preparing children for school
- through strengthening the care and support they receive - and rethinking
schools to be relevant to the community, the society <i>and</i> the individuals
they serve.  Women's education, attention to the conditions of the poor, and
recognition of the inter-connections between an educational program and the
society it is preparing students to enter are all crucial.<p>
<p>
<b>Support for young children and families provides a necessary foundation
for</b> <b>Education For All.</b><p>
<p>
	 Social intervention at the family and community levels, especially through
non-formal education initiatives, is not, in our opinion, a luxury item.  It is
a necessary element in any sound education strategy.  This is particularly true
in situations dominated by poverty, where a large proportion of children are
incapable of benefiting from even excellent instruction when they enter school.
In order to improve the active learning capacity<b>[4]</b>
of disadvantaged children several types of intervention are needed which go
beyond the locus and range of the traditional school.<p>
<p>
<i>	Reaching children through families:</i> <p>
<p>
	The active learning capacity of a child as he or she enters primary school
depends to a great extent on the physical, intellectual and social gains that
stem from early experience.  Medical, psychological, and educational research
shows that the age from conception to 6 (and in particular, prenatal to three)
is the critical period in the human development cycle.  Nutritional, sensory
motor, psychological or cognitive progress made (or deficits incurred) by
children in those early years are interactive and cumulative to a much greater
extent than ever again in the life cycle.  <p>
	The problems which cause difficulty in school, such as lack of good health,
sight and hearing defects, lack of concentration, low learning ability, and
poor self-esteem, are generally rooted by the age of four when children enter
kindergarten.  Thus, it is necessary to provide family services that actually
reach the poor.  <p>
<b>Such measures as pre-natal and follow-up health care for young mothers and
their children, child health and immunization, social policies that improve
labor conditions, social security schemes, parental leave, day-care and family
education services, can no longer be seen as social welfare for poor people.
They are in fact a question of far-reaching political choice: the recognition
of the family unit as the primary provider and educator of children. </b><p>
<b></b><p>
	Societal breakdown and educational decline are attributed to many causes: to
overstretching of education systems, to social change, to badly prepared
immigration policies, etc.  These factors are real but secondary, in our
opinion, to the growing inability of families to supply health, care,
mediation<b>[5]</b> (significant interactions) and
education to children.  This failure is reflected in the growing number of
children - even in advanced economies - suffering from short-term hunger,
micronutrient deficiencies or protein energy malnutrition. <p>
<p>
	Many parents are too poor or too busy trying to survive, and do not realize
the importance of their role.  Many parents do not realize the profound
influence that a healthy diet and a secure and regular home environment has on
children.  They do not know that their own modelling of values, social skills
and curiosity about the world is necessary for their children's subsequent
success with learning.  They are unaware of the impact their talking to
children has on language acquisition, mental awareness and problem-solving
abilities. <p>
<p>
	Many young adults lack the confidence, knowledge and means to be good parents.
Hence, it is necessary to provide social support for families.  This can be
accomplished in large part through expanding non-formal<b>[6]</b>, parent education programmes and making a
conscious effort through the media to raise awareness and knowledge levels of
essential life-skills.<p>
<p>
<i>	Reaching Children through adequate community services:</i> <p>
<p>
	Can uneducated parents who live in sordid surroundings, in streets where
violence and drug-pushing are the rule, who have neither employment nor
self-respect, give education and self-esteem to their children?  The answer
must be: with great difficulty. Children and families do not exist - or thrive
- in a vacuum.  They need adequate community services, and in cases of serious
neighborhood decay, energetic community intervention.  More attention needs to
be given to the basic infrastructure in communities, if educational initiatives
are to be successful and reach those most in need. <p>
<p>
	More and more communities must collaborate in the major responsibilities which
governments traditionally handled: questions of primary health, the care and
education of children, employment, adequate housing, safety and preservation of
the environment and attention to the basic needs of all.  In fact, as we
approach the end of this century, the Welfare State seems to be giving way to a
society where families, local communities and NGOs are called to play an
important and creative role in providing social support services which the
State is reluctant or unable to provide.  Obviously, in countries or districts
where governmental or municipal services are weak or non-existent, the family
and voluntary bodies, such as the NGOs and the churches, play a central role in
providing an adequate supportive environment for young children and their
families.   <p>
<p>
	<i>Reaching children more realistically through the school.</i> <p>
<p>
	The Education for All initiative has called for a recognition that schools (if
they wish to serve all) should be more open to community needs.  Research would
suggest that the schools need to incorporate the following approaches in order
to become truly responsive to those in poverty:<p>
<p>
	  	a real attention to early child development, and to the 		idea that child
quality and active learning capacity can best be ensured through good parenting
and/or quality pre-school.  Recent research (Schweinhart et. al, 1993) shows
the values of such programmes for children and their necessity for egalitarian
access;<p>
<p>
	  	a broad curriculum that will include as well as the 		three Rs, knowledge
of thinking and life skills, basic personal and social values, relevant career
training;<p>
<p>
	 	high-quality, remedial programmes to address learning 		problems of young
children before they become habitual and lead into a cycle of failure and low
self-esteem;<p>
<p>
 	 	parenting and family support: that is, education 		offered to parents as
well as to children.  The school should offer or act as a conduit for community
support services, in particular to families in need.  Among the more important
aims of such programmes must be to provide basic health and nutrition services,
to improve the status and educational level of women,<b>[7]</b> to promote the rights of children
<b>[8]</b> either in situations of risk or within a
particular society, and to train parents to supplement school instruction by
giving their children "the inner engines of learning": that is, personal and
social skills such as confidence, motivation, caring, common sense,
perseverance and a sense of teamwork, which enable children to learn and
achieve in the school context. (Rich, 1992)<b>[9]</b><p>
<p>
	 	a dynamic linking of school, community and local 		government to tackle
questions of social and environmental milieu.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b><p>
<p>
	The Jomtien World Conference on Education for All has rightly called attention
to improving education through better management and expanded access to primary
education systems.  In attempting to outline how this might realistically be
achieved, it has offered a broader definition, unanimously embraced by the
participants, of basic education.  Post-Jomtien practice, however, has still
failed to embrace the three pillars of the declaration that do not relate
directly to formal primary schooling.  There are good reasons to believe,
however, that in many situations and countries, the call for investment in
families and communities, and support for decentralized, nonformal, education
initiatives toward parents, may be essential for realistically attaining the
goal of education for all.<p>

from 332 million to 593 million in 1988, an increase mostly taking place in the

<b>[5]</b> The concept of mediation is taken from R. Feuerstein's

<p>
Judith L. Evans and Robert G. Myers<p>
<p>
The three case studies presented at the EFA Meeting in New Delhi were
illustrative of ways in which government can be supportive of early childhood
programming.  Each case provides an example of a different programme approach.
In Venezuela a family/home day-care model has been developed.  The Kenya case
study shows a preschool programme for children from 3-6 years of age, and in
the Philippines the programme presented is one in which parent education is the
primary focus.  Each programme was developed in direct response to local need
and has expanded and evolved in line with available resources.  <p>
<p>
	For the Delhi EFA forum, each of the presenters was asked to include a brief
description of the country, its population and some characteristics of the
context within which the programme was developed. This was followed by a
history of the programme, a description of how the model works, what it has
meant to <i>go to scale</i> with the programme, and what lessons have been
learned in the process.  A summary of what was presented follows. Because there
are so any commonalities across the countries in terms of the lessons learned,
a summary of these will be presented at the end of all the case studies.<p>

<b>PROGRAMA HOGARES DE CUIDADO DIARIO: PLAN DE EXTENSION MASIVA</b><p>
<b>		Family Day-care Homes Program: Massive Extension Plan</b><p>
<p>
Venezuela, a country located in the northern part of South America has a
population of more than 19 million (1991), 7 million (36%) of which are under
the age of 14; nearly 20% are under six years of age. <p>
<p>
	Venezuela is a country of contrasting realities.  On the one hand it is rich
in oil and has a well-developed technical sector.  Its per capita income is
more than $2,500.  On the other hand it has an extremely high urban growth rate
(90% of the population lives in urban areas) and high poverty rates (67% of the
population is rated as being in <i>total poverty</i>, 1991).  Further, the
majority of the population lacks sufficient economic resources, literacy rates
are low, and infant mortality rates are high.<p>
<p>
	In Venezuela the extended family has played a significant role in the
upbringing of children.  But the violent social and cultural changes occurring
during the last 15 years have affected the Venezuelan family, contributing to
its dismantling.  In many households the mother has a strong family presence
while the father is very often remote.  In the majority of families women need
to seek work outside the home.  To do that they need to find appropriate care
for their children.<p>
<p>
	In response to the needs of working women, and to promote children's growth
and development, the <i>Hogares de Cuidado Diario</i>, a home day-care
programme, was developed in 1974. It is designed to attend to the care,
nutrition, health, education and developmental needs of children up to six
years of age.  Home day-care was chosen as the model to be developed, because
it supports and enriches a natural form of day-care in which working women turn
to neighbours for help in caring for their children during working hours.<p>
<p>
	The Venezuelan home day-care programme was developed in two stages.  Phase I
was begun in 1974.  Within the basic model women in the community were selected
to receive training and provide care in their home for five children under the
age of six, two of whom could be their own. Mothers were provided with
appropriate equipment and educational materials to support their work. Every 20
day-care homes were supported by a technical assistance team consisting of a
social worker who was responsible for administrative and functional
supervision, a child care worker responsible for coordinating this programme
with public health organizations, and a teacher who guided the home day-care
mother in terms of educational activities to be carried out in the programme.
There was a Coordinator for every three technical teams. And for every eight
<i>barrios</i> there was a legal aid advisor, to be used as needed.<p>
<p>
	An exhaustive evaluation of the programme in 1978 showed that it had a
positive effect on children and families, but there were a number of changes
needed in order for the program to function more efficiently and effectively at
a lower cost.  But before it was possible to implement the recommendations,
there was a change in government and the day-care homes programme was put <i>on
hold</i>. In its initial version (Phase I), taking place between 1974 and 1988,
it attained a moderate coverage of approximately 10,000 children.  From 1979 to
1988 the government put more emphasis on developing more formal and
conventional preschool models.  Meanwhile, the home day-care model, with
appropriate adjustments, took hold successfully in other countries in Latin
America.<p>
	In addition to there being a change in government, the favorable economic
conditions that prevailed in Venezuela during the 1970s when the programme
began, deteriorated in the 1980s. Early on the government introduced an
economic adjustment programme to try to halt the economic decline.  This was
largely unsuccessful.  The marked increase in poverty rates during the 80s was
accompanied by a decrease in the percentage of the Gross Domestic Product that
the government assigned to social programmes, further exacerbating the
situation for poor families.  <p>
	In 1989, a major social protest which highlighted both the deteriorating
conditions of the 1980s and the potentially regressive effects of economic
adjustment forced the government to reassess its policies.  A social policy was
formulated focussed on alleviating the situation of the most vulnerable
sectors.  The social package was compensatory in nature and focussed on
providing direct subsidies to specific groups.  It incorporated more effective
management practices and promoted the involvement of non-governmental
organizations and the private sector in the delivery of social services.<p>
<p>
	An integral part of the new social policy was an expansion of the day-care
homes programme.  Phase II of the programme drew on previous experiences,
recommendations from the 1978 evaluation, established expertise and the new
political context. Phase II developments were guided by four objectives: 1) to
attend to the needs of young children up to six years of age belonging to the
lowest income levels; 2) to provide a direct subsidy to families at critical
poverty levels with children up to the age of six; 3) to strengthen the family
unit, particularly mothers (through education, improved income and increased
community participation) in the process of bringing up their children; and 4)
to strengthen the capacity of civil organizations to participate in actions
promoting the development and welfare of young children living in impoverished
conditions.<p>
<p>
	The Ministry of the Family administers and oversees the programme.  The
Children's Foundation, a private organization headed by the wife of the
President, sets guidelines, provides technical input and is responsible for
implementing the programme in about 75% of the locations. In 1993 almost 300
non-governmental organizations were also involved in implementation of the
programme.<p>
<p>
	The day-care homes programme continues to outfit homes with necessary
equipment and provide training for the home day-care mothers who now care for
up to 8 children for a period normally running from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M.  In
addition to the initial training workshop, mothers participate in periodic
<i>learning encounters</i> and in special workshops.  They are supported by a
supervisor who is responsible for overseeing 25 homes. In the selection of home
day-care mothers, preference is given to those who are: experienced in the care
of children; between the ages of 30 and 45; from a nuclear family unit; with
fewer than two children below the age of six; literate; and representative of
the average economic situation within their community.<p>
<p>
	In order to carry out her job, the home day-care mother receives monthly
allotments from the government for the care and feeding of each child and a
monthly allotment from the mother of each child.  In the poorest communities,
the mothers of participating children are not required to pay and the cost is
assumed by the government.<p>
<p>
	In Phase II a new variation on home day-care has been added: multi-home care
in which 30 children are tended by 3 home day-care mothers in a community
setting specifically selected or constructed for the purpose.  These are
designed to serve densely populated areas and have incorporated children with
special needs. <p>
<p>
	In 1992 and 1993 the Phase II programme was evaluated, using a representative
sample of day-care homes.  Information gathered was used to make adjustments in
the programme.  The programme is meeting the needs of women and children. The
experience has verified the viability of providing care in home-like settings
with community mothers in charge.  By 1993, after four years of the expansion
phase, the programme is reaching 236,000 children. The cost of the programme is
estimated at $39 per child per month.<p>

The nutritional part of the Venezuelan programme is the most costly component,
representing 59% of the monthly costs. Professional support for the home
day-care mother and administrative costs of the programme together represent
25% of costs, and the subsidization of the day-care home mother's salary is 23%
of costs.  The remaining 3% is for educational materials.  The programme
provides full-day care for the child.  While this is important in terms of
supporting the child's development, another major benefit of the programme is
that it is supportive of women's work outside the home. Thus the true
beneficiaries are not only the children but the families.<p>
<p>
	Venezuela provides an example of a full-day programme for children, which is
primarily home- rather than centre-based. In the Kenya case study the approach
has been to provide a half-day centre-based preschool programme for children
3-6 years of age.  While in Venezuela impetus for the programme came from an
understanding of the intersecting needs of women and children living in urban
areas, in Kenya the programme began out of concern for the educational needs of
the child, particularly those living in rural areas.  The Kenya programme has
since expanded into a more holistic view of what can be provided through a
preschool programme. But we will let the case speak for itself.<p>
<p>
<b>Kenya</b><p>
<p>
<b>A CASE STUDY OF EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCATION IN KENYA</b><p>
<p>
Kenya whose population in 1992 was 25 million, has one of the highest growth
rates in the world (3.8%).  59% of the population is under 20 years of age; 18%
are under the age of five, many of whom are in preschools because of the
commitment of parents and the community to providing a preschool experience for
the child. <p>
<p>
	There is a long tradition of preschool education in Kenya.  The first
preschools were started in the 1940s by and for the exclusive use of the
European and Asian communities.  Later preschools were developed in African
locations in urban areas and on coffee, tea and sugar plantations.  After
independence preschool education expanded throughout the country.  <p>
<p>
	An important variable in the widespread availability of preschools is the
<i>Harambee</i> or self-help spirit which the late President Kenyatta fostered.
In essence what this means is that when a community defines a need, it creates
a programme to meet that need. In many villages parents have wanted preschools
for their children and so they have created them. They find a location for the
class and choose a woman to care for children 3-6 years of age.  As a result
early childhood care and education programmes (ECCE) in Kenya serve the entire
cross-section of social, economic, cultural and geographic groups within the
society.<p>
	Prior to the 1970s there was no organized curriculum, nor other support
materials for use in the preschools, and many of those teaching in these
schools were untrained.  Because they lacked training, many of the teachers
used formal teaching methods equivalent to those used in the primary schools
with older children. To address the situation presented by the ever-increasing
numbers of preschools and the lack of appropriate support for them, in 1991 the
Kenya government, with assistance from the Bernard van Leer Foundation created
the Preschool Education Project, based at the Kenya Institute of Education
(KIE).  The objectives of the project were to improve the quality of preschool
education through the development of viable training systems, and the creation
of curriculum and other support materials for use by trainers, teachers and
children.<p>
<p>
	Several events during the 1980s shaped the way in which preschool services are
being offered nationally. In 1980 responsibility for preschools was shifted
from the Ministry of Culture and Social services to the Ministry of Education
(MOE) which is now responsible for the administration of preschools. The MOE
has an infrastructure that is able to provide support to preschools anywhere in
the country.<p>
	<p>
	Another important event was the move in 1983 to decentralize government.  The
focus of development was shifted to the district level. The result of this
shift is that district and local governments have taken on the main
responsibility for ongoing support of preschool education, while MOE is
involved in the formulation of policy guidelines for early childhood
programmes, registration of preschools, coordination of government grants and
funds from external donors, and provision of early childhood personnel at all
levels.<p>
<p>
	When the Preschool Education Project was evaluated in 1982, it was recommended
that the activities of the project be continued.  This was done through the
creation of a National Centre for Early Childhood Education (NACECE),
established in 1984.  This was followed in 1985 by implementation of District
Centres for Early Childhood Education (DICECE), to facilitate decentralization
of ECCE support. <p>
<p>
	NACECE is located within the Kenya Institute of Education and it is
responsible for: developing training systems for ECCE personnel; developing and
disseminating curricula for ECCE programmes; identifying, designing,
undertaking and coordinating ECCE research; facilitating interaction between
agencies and sponsors; coordinating and liaising with external partners; and
informing the public of needs and developments within the ECCE programme.<p>
<p>
	The functions of the DICECE are: training of preschool teachers and other
personnel at the district level; supervision and inspection of district
preschool programmes; mobilization of local communities to improve the care,
health, nutrition and education of young children; development of localized
preschool curricula; and evaluation and research related to the preschool
child. The DICECE are staffed by NACECE trained trainers, accountable to the
District Education Officers for their day-to-day operations.<p>
<p>
	Training has remained one of the most important functions of the NACECE/DICECE
programme because it equips teachers and trainers with knowledge and skills
which help them to provide quality services to children and to mobilize the
parents and local communities to improve the welfare of young children and
families.  Trainers are provided with a nine-month induction course that
includes a residential and a field component.  Teacher training involves a
two-year inservice course which has six residential sessions (during school
holidays) alternating with field sessions during term time.<p>
<p>
	In terms of the actual preschool programme, NACECE/DICECE has adopted a
holistic approach to the support of children's growth and development.  That
means that it seeks to include health, nutrition, growth monitoring and
promotion as well as educational activities within the programme. <p>
<p>
	One of the unique characteristics and strengths of the ECCE programme in Kenya
is its policy of encouraging partnerships, at all levels. <i>Parents and local
communities</i> are the most important partners.  They have started and
currently manage over 75% of the preschools in the country.  Parents and local
communities provide land and funds for the construction and maintenance of the
physical facilities.  They also provide furniture, materials and labour and
they pay the teacher's salary.  In some communities feeding programmes are also
a part of the preschool; parents provide the ingredients and prepare the food.
<p>
<p>
	Complementing the work of the community are <i>local authorities</i> who pick
up the costs (equipment, furnishings and teacher salary) of running preschools
in towns.  Fees are charged in these schools to help cover the costs.<p>
<p>
	From the beginning, <i>voluntary organizations, religious bodies and
companies</i> have been heavily involved in preschool provision.  Religious
groups have established their own preschools in the church/temple/mosque.
Firms, cooperatives, and plantations have also established preschools for
children of their employees.  The main support from these preschools is the
provision of physical facilities, materials, furniture, feeding programmes and
payment of teachers' salaries.<p>
<p>
	The <i>Ministries</i> involved in preschool provision include the Ministry of
Health and the Ministry of Culture and Social Services, in addition to the
Ministry of Education.  And as noted earlier, <i>external partners</i> have
been and continue to be important.  Over the years these have included the
Bernard van Leer Foundation, the Aga Khan Foundation, and UNICEF, who have
provided financial support for the training of teachers, the purchasing of
equipment and materials, curriculum development, and parental and community
education. NACECE has taken on the primary responsibility for coordinating the
actions of the various partners and involving them in a meaningful way. <p>
<p>
	Decentralization of the programme to the district level has provided
flexibility and variation in terms of facilities provided and activities
undertaken.  The preschool setting and curriculum materials, for example,
differ from place to place depending on the resources available, leadership
abilities and motivation of the communities. <p>
<p>
	Decentralization is a healthy feature of the programme. Communities are
allowed to develop appropriate, affordable and relevant services without
external pressure and competition, and at their own pace. The curriculum
guidelines developed by NACECE are just that, guidelines. Localized materials
in the form of stories, poems, riddles and children's games have been developed
which preserve and strengthen local culture and tradition. <p>
<p>
	The Kenya early childhood programme has grown because it is rooted in the
community.  Through workshops and seminars organized by the DICECE, parents and
community members have been encouraged and empowered to increase their
participation beyond provision of physical facilities. They provide the feeding
programme, they take part in collecting, telling and demonstrating stories,
songs and dances in the mother tongue.  The incorporation of tradition and
folklore into the curriculum make the community feel proud of their
contribution to the learning and development of their children. <b> The lesson
from Kenya is that the community is a very important resource for the
development of the ECCE programme and must continue to be tapped and
appreciated.</b><p>
	<p>
	Today the programme is serving more than 900,000 children.  This is
approximately 30% of the 3-6 age group.  Government expenditure on preschool
programmes is only one-tenth of one percent of the national education budget
(or $.61 per child per year).  This compares to 60% of the education budget
going to primary education, 15% for secondary and 22% for universities. The
great majority of the costs of the preschools are borne by the communities and
external donors. (Myers, 1992:23)  The current expenditure on ECCE activities
is extremely low.  If it were increased to even 1% of the budget it could
provide more comprehensive and higher quality services. <p>

[<b><i>comment</i>]</b><p>
<b></b><p>
In Kenya the programme has been able to go to scale because of its heavy
reliance on the community to sustain the programme, and the monies provided by
external donor agencies.  While this programme is not nearly as expensive to
the government as the Venezuelan programme, it would be a mistake to make
direct cost comparisons.  The Kenya model is structured differently and
designed to meet a different need.  In addition, while Kenya is experimenting
with growth monitoring and nutritional inputs, it has not yet built in some of
the costly health and nutrition supports that exist within the Venezuela model.
In addition, there is heavy reliance in Kenya on external support to maintain
the system.<p>
<p>
	What the two models have in common is that they provide direct service to the
child.  The case study from the Philippines has taken a different approach.
There the emphasis is on reaching parents, with the intention of reaching the
child through the parent. <p>
<p>
<b>Philippines</b><p>
<p>
<b>PARENTS AS LEARNERS: TOWARD PARTNERSHIPS AND PARTICIPATION</b><p>
<p>
	The Philippines is the home of 11.5 million families, 62 million people
(1990).  Approximately 46% are below the age of 18, 14% are under the age of
five. The people are predominantly Malay, with Chinese, Spanish, Indian and
North American settlers forming the minority of the population.  There are 110
cultural and linguistic groups in the country; over 87 languages and dialects
are spoken. <p>
	<p>
	The Philippines is a land of contrasts.  The land is rich and blessed, but the
majority of the people live in abject poverty. There are wide disparities
between the life conditions of Filipino families across socioeconomic groups.
While the elite reside in well-guarded mansions, the plywood, plastic and
galvanized iron sheet 'homes' of the urban poor make up the biggest squatter
colonies in that part of Asia. Between 1985 and 1988 the top ten percent of all
families received more than one-third of all family income. 75% of Filipino
families live below the poverty line.<p>
<p>
	Beyond the physical and social contrasts, the clash of ideas between the
pervasive colonial mentality and the emerging fierce nationalism is evident in
the people's daily lives.   <p>
<p>
	The Filipino family is undergoing considerable change.  Rapid urbanization,
rural-urban migration, un- and underemployment, overseas employment, the
insurgency problems and continuing war in certain areas of the country are all
forces at work.  Also, the changing and emerging role of Filipino women at all
levels of society is a critical factor in the changing lifestyles and
structures of the Filipino family.<p>
<p>
	Traditionally, children have played a very important role in the Filipino
family. It is said that children give the Filipino family its form and
structure. Generally, parenting is considered a private, family affair.
Contemporary decision-making about parenting is a result of traditional wisdom
learned from parents and grandparents, blended with knowledge gained from
available literature. At best this results in a good balance between sound
indigenous practices that help to transmit the Filipino cultural heritage and
more progressive child-rearing practices.  Sometimes it can result in conflict
and confusion.  As families are faced with new challenges and traditional
supports are lacking, there is renewed interest in developing support systems
for parents to help them achieve a better balance.  <p>
<p>
	Parental support programmes have a long history in the Philippines. They were
begun originally in the 1930s by the then Department of Agriculture. Over time
parent programmes have been implemented by the Department of Health, Department
of Social Welfare and Development, the National Population Commission, the
Department of Education, and the Bureau of Agricultural Extension.  Government
efforts have been complemented by contributions from major donor agencies such
as UNICEF and WHO.  It is out of this history of parent support programmes that
the <b>Parent Effectiveness Services (PES)</b> came into being.<p>
<p>
	A basic premise of the PES is that by reaching parents it is possible to reach
the children.  PES was developed in 1978 by the Department of Social Welfare
and Development (DSWD).  To create the programme, groups of parents were
organized at the village (<i>barangay</i>) level to determine the type of
support they required.  To further understand the needs, parent congresses were
organized at the municipal, regional and national level with representatives
from the neighbourhood groups as participants.  A parent education programme
was then designed, based on what was learned through this consultative process.
A manual was developed which prescribes the content and methods for the parent
education programme. This manual is used by social workers as they work with
communities. <p>
		<p>
	PES, which currently resides in the Bureau of Family and Community Welfare
(BFCW) within the DSWD, is part of a much larger government-sponsored Early
Childhood Enrichment Programme (ECEP) that includes centre-based (day-care
centres, child-minding centers, supervised neighborhood playgroups) and
school-based programmes. The ECEP was developed in collaboration with UNICEF,
which funded the programme from 1981-1983. In 1984 the DSWD took over full
responsibility and now government funds cover salaries of programme
supervisors, training of day-care workers, and the purchase of teaching
materials for the home-based programme.  Since 1991, under the Local Government
Code, powers have been decentralized. Local government units are now directly
in charge of implementing the PES.<p>
<p>
	How does PES work?  The primary strategy within PES is to reach parents
through the Neighbourhood Parent Effectiveness Assembly (NPEA).  This is a
group of 10-20 parents who get together weekly to discuss common parenting
problems and their solutions. While families with children from birth to 6
years of age who might benefit from the programme are identified by the trained
ECCD worker from the local government unit, participation is voluntary and open
to all interested in attending. <p>
<p>
	A session generally consists of the following: <p>
1) Opening activities help bring the group together.<p>
2) There is a discussion of how the parents applied what they learned from the
previous session.<p>
3) The topic scheduled for the day is presented through an activity. This could
include such things as responsible parenthood, family relationships, health
care, child development, recognition and management of disabilities, nutrition,
etc.<p>
4) Specific activities are identified that parents can undertake in relation to
the topic.  <p>
5) The session ends with a summary of the major points and planning for the
next session.  Resource materials are available for parents to borrow and
purchase.<p>
<p>
	Home visiting is a complement to the NPEA.  Home visits are made when parents
join the assembly to orient them to the group.  The visit provides the social
worker with an opportunity to learn more about the family as well.  From then
on home visits are used on an as-needed basis.  When families require
additional support or when they have missed the group for a number of sessions,
or if parents request a home visit, these are made by the PES staff. A new
component of PES is a radio programme being developed in cooperation with the
Philippine Children's Television Foundation.<p>
	<p>
	There are two type of staff for the programme.  There are the professional
Social Workers, hired by local government. They receive a five-day training in
the implementation of PES.  Guided group discussion and role playing are an
important part of this training.  The social workers work side-by-side with PES
volunteers, who are parents from the community that have been trained to
facilitate the groups and conduct home visits.  Training for the volunteers
includes a 3-day orientation, followed by a one-month practicum.  This is
followed by another 2 days of training to consolidate what the volunteer has
learned and to plan future activities.  Annually there is a refresher
training.<p>
<p>
	In 1987-89 an evaluation was conducted.  It revealed strengths and weaknesses
of the programme, but by and large PES was deemed effective.  The issues
identified in the evaluation were addressed as an expanded version of the
programme was formulated. To strengthen the program, PES training was revised,
and in 1991 a new handbook was produced and additional materials were developed
for use by the PES volunteers.  <p>
<p>
	The evaluation revealed that the quality of PES depends greatly upon the
skills of the PES volunteer and the support mechanisms available to them
through the programme supervisors at the national, regional and municipal
levels.<p>
<p>
	UNICEF continues to be a partner in the implementation of PES. In the
programme of cooperation between UNICEF and the government of the Philippines
for 1994-1998 there are several proposed actions:<p>
<p>
	The <b>home-based programme will be strengthened</b> as this is seen as a
major strategy and a low-cost approach to providing ECCD services to children.
The expanded home-based component will be implemented in 7 depressed provinces
where there is a convergence of social services, in 13 provinces where the low
education levels indicate greatest need, and in 5 provinces affected by natural
and man-made disasters.<p>
<p>
	There will be <b>increased investment in training and supervision</b> and the
development of training materials.  The goal is to train 2,000 community
volunteers (parent leaders) as facilitators and 325 people to serve as
supervisors. 150,000 different sets of materials will be distributed to 3
million parents in 25 provinces.  Other materials will be developed to
facilitate training.<p>
<p>
	A core of trainers will train 900 (2 for each <i>barangay</i>) youth
volunteers on approaches and techniques in <b>mobilizing community
participation and support</b> for early childhood programmes.  Through the use
of theatre arts and indigenous folk media it is hoped to get the community more
involved in helping to sustain the programme.  One goal is to get a variety of
NGOs involved in the programme.<p>
<p>
	An additional goal will be to expand programme content in terms of:
<b>activities that promote gender equity; increasing the role of fathers in
child-rearing; and issues related to shared and single-parenting.</b><p>
<p>
	In 1978 when PES started it was being implemented at the municipal level by
120 social workers. In 1991, 143,000 parents were served. In 1992 this
increased to 160,000 parents (192,146 children) in 1,500 municipalities
throughout 14 regions of the country.  Working with these parents were 1,672
Early Childhood Care and Development workers in local government units and
1,452 PES Volunteers.  PES has also been implemented in centre-based programmes
by 18,633 day-care workers.<p>
<p>
	The costs of this programme were calculated, based on the government and
UNICEF input and the number of families and children served in 1992.  The cost
per parent was approximately $1.00/year.  The costs per child were $.81/year.
The time contributed by the parent volunteers was not taken into account in
these calculations.<p>
<p>
	In sum, all over the Philippines, through the PES and the many NGO programmes
for parents and families, lessons are being learned about children and parents
and how they grow, develop and learn. These teach us that an investment in
parents is a major investment in child growth and development. And while parent
education programmes will not be the major solution nor substitute for the
basic social services, they are part of a broader framework of community
development.<p>

<p>
<p>
<b>Lessons Learned</b><p>
<p>
While there are a number of lessons that have been learned by the three
projects that are specific to the kind of programme developed and the country
context, there are commonalities across the cases that are worth exploring.
They are as follows: <p>
<p>
1. First and foremost the cases illustrate the desirability of parent and
community participation in the process of developing the service.  They need to
be more than recipients of a service.  Programmes must designed in
collaboration with them and parents must be an integral part of its
implementation in order to assure sustainability.<p>
<p>
2.  Within the government there need to be policies, laws and structures that
provide support for the development of ECCD programmes.  Without political will
and commitment, localised ECCD programmes cannot hope to be expanded to a
significant degree or sustained over time.<p>
<p>
3.  Models for the collaboration of government and non-governmental agencies
and organizations are being developed.  Governments are unable to and should
not take on sole responsibility for the provision of early childhood
programmes.  Partnerships need to be developed which build on the strengths of
what both government and the nongovernmental agencies can provide. There is no
<i>right way</i> for this to happen.  The history, expertise and experience of
government and NGOs in each country will dictate the type of partnership that
it is possible to create.  These three cases represent different ways this can
happen.<p>
<p>
4.  To achieve an appropriate level of coverage, it takes time.  Massive
programmes cannot be implemented overnight.  The three cases illustrate the
importance of developing pilot programmes and evaluating them sufficiently so
that appropriate changes can be made as the programmes are expanded.<p>
<p>
5. The creation of supportive structures is crucial.  Those directly providing
the services need appropriate training and on-going supervision and support as
they work with children and families.<p>
<p>
<p>
The three cases presented above represent different ways in which governments
can support the EFA goals of basic education for all. As noted, no formula
exists to guarantee success in every situation.  Programmes need to be
developed within the context of needs and resources, and with full
participation of all the stakeholders.

<b>ABSTRACT</b><p>
<p>
Urbanisation, industrialisation, migration, expanding educational
opportunities, and other demographic trends have disrupted the cultural
practices and survival patterns that women have developed over the years to
cope with their many responsibilities. More and more women are heading
households and fewer can rely on men's economic and emotional support for their
families, spurring women's entry into the work force and exacerbating poverty
among women and children. Especially in countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin
America, where government support for women may be lacking, these changes in
family structure and shifting work patterns have created a child care dilemma,
whose consequences on children in their early, formative years can be
detrimental to their development.<p>
<p>
The cumulative effects of poverty on early child development have only lately
begun to garner the attention of policy makers in government, donor agencies,
and non-governmental organisations, who have perhaps placed child survival
goals ahead of efforts to address the quality of child survival. Recent
scientific findings indicate, however, that developmentally sensitive
interaction between caregiver and child -- and the lack thereof -- has a direct
and measurable impact on the child's health and nutritional status, and that
early child development programmes can have a positive effect on primary school
enrolment and children's performance and progress in school. The evidence
points to the enormous potential of investment in early child development
programmes as a means of strengthening existing programme activities in other
sectors, and to the favourable results that can be obtained by integrating
child development activities with other sectoral interventions. Research also
suggests that the potential for bringing about improvements may be greater when
social and economic conditions are more severe. With international attention
presently focused on the achievements and objectives of the Convention on the
Rights of the Child, the World Conference on Education for All, and the World
Summit for Children, development planners have a unique opportunity to
emphasise the need for governments, employers, families and communities to
identify affordable programmes of adequate child care within the context of an
overall child survival and development package.<p>
<p>
Acknowledging the interrelationship between growth and development, the
following <i>Interagency Policy Review</i> presents a forceful argument for the
incorporation of early child development programmes into a comprehensive agenda
of child survival and development activities. Integral to this holistic view is
an affirmation that children's biology is in constant interaction with their
environment, and that children are active participants in their own development
and knowledge, even before they enter primary school. Through an explication of
the processes of child development and learning, this report aims to identify
critical junctures beginning before birth and continuing through adolescence in
which infants and children are particularly sensitive to interaction with the
caregiver and the environment. Infants and children who are ill, malnourished,
brain-impaired or living in deprived environments are less responsive. As a
result, their physical, emotional, social, and intellectual development is in
jeopardy. How to target these at-risk groups at their various levels of
development with timely and quality interventions constitutes the essence of
this report. The challenge is not simply to reduce the risk factors that
threaten children's futures, but to overcome them by identifying and building
on the protective factors that exist naturally in the children's environment
and providing support when these factors are absent.<p>
<p>
Based on the body of scientific research and programmatic experiences, a
typology of seven complementary programme approaches to early child development
is presented in this report. Inherent in these approaches is a recognition of
the simultaneous nature of child survival and development, and the interaction
between children's physical, intellectual, social, and emotional capabilities.
These approaches affirm the idea that forces outside the family can and should
participate in methods of caring for young children, and involve a range of
players from families and communities to women's groups, programme
professionals, policy makers, and the media. The success of these programmes is
based on empowering caregivers and communities with the knowledge and skills
needed to provide for the health, nutritional, and development needs of
children.<p>
<p>
The various models of achieving scale are illustrated by case studies from
China, Colombia, India, Kenya, Morocco, Nepal, and Venezuela. The report
addresses questions of cost analysis, creating political will, the media's
role, quality control, training, and programme monitoring and evaluation. It
concludes by discussing specific opportunities for programmatic linkages
between child development initiatives and health and nutrition; women in
development; the girl child; primary education; childhood disability prevention
and rehabilitation; and children in especially difficult circumstances.<p>
<b>I   INTRODUCTION</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>A. EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT: DEFINITION OF TERMS</b> <p>
<p>
The wealth of existing knowledge regarding the development of children is not
always available to practitioners who care for children or to policy makers who
make decisions about programmes for children. In fact, there seems to be a
growing confusion about the terms <i>growth</i>, <i>development</i> and
<i>care</i>. These terms mean different things to different people and are
often used interchangeably. With the following simple definitions, we hope to
provide some conceptual clarity to the terminology as applied throughout this
document.<p>
<p>
Child development is not the same as growth. While growth is described by
changes in size, development is characterised by changes in complexity and
function. Child development encompasses the unfolding of behaviours from
immature to mature; patterns of behaviour that expand from simple to complex;
and the evolution of a child from dependency to autonomous adulthood. More
simply, child development is a process of change in which the child learns to
handle more complex levels of moving, thinking, feeling, and interacting with
people and objects in the environment. For a child to develop in a healthy and
normal way, it is necessary that his or her basic needs of protection, food,
and health care be met along with basic needs for affection, interaction and
stimulation, and learning through exploration and discovery.<p>
<p>
Child care is defined as the set of behaviours that support a child's
development, including, for example, breastfeeding and feeding, providing
shelter and supervision, and preventing and attending to illness, as well as
engaging the child in social interaction, and providing a stimulating and safe
environment for play and exploration. Recent research has highlighted that the
quality of care, characterised by the motivation, skill, physical capacity,
consistency, and responsiveness of the caregiver, is strongly linked to child
survival and development outcomes. Some authors differentiate between the
various types of care that return a child to a previously accepted state of
health or development (compensatory care), and those which serve to promote
further development such as language and social development (stimulating
care).<sup>1</sup><p>
<p>
To avoid definitional problems, the term <i>child development programme</i> is
used to describe a range of services that promote those conditions of care,
socialistation, and education in the home or community that enhance a child's
total development. Such services provided for a certain number of hours during
the day and in a safe environment, contribute to children's full development by
complementing the family environment and the formal education system. The type
of programmes best suited to this purpose will vary according to the age-group
concerned and the comprehensiveness of services provided, including health,
nutrition, and developmentally appropriate learning contexts. How a child's
development needs can and should be satisfied will vary widely according to the
particular characteristics of his or her environment.<p>
<p>
In this perspective, early childhood development programmes include both "child
care" and "child education" initiatives. Although the need exists for providing
an expanding child care and/or early education, there is a growing consensus
among researchers and practitioners that child care and early education are
inseparable issues and must be considered as one. For example, good child care
involves developmental and socialisation experience, cognitive stimulation, and
physical care. Children cannot be well cared for without their being educated,
and children cannot be well educated their being cared for. The goal of
policies should be to eliminate the divisions between early childhood education
and child care and to identify and expand the best qualities of
each.<sup>2</sup><p>
<p>
<p>
<b>B. PROGRAMMATIC CONCERNS</b><p>
<p>
It has long been widely accepted that good health and nutrition support the
psychological and social development of the young child. Less widely
recognised, however, are the most recent findings that developmentally
sensitive interaction with a child -- interaction that satisfies the child's
need to grow socially, psychologically, and cognitively -- has a direct and
measurable impact on both the health and the nutritional status of the child.
The scientific evidence accumulated during the past decade powerfully
demonstrates the importance of the early years of the child's life and the
long-term benefits associated with increased investments in well-conceived and
properly managed child development programmes. Not only should those involved
in programme implementation be spurred to confidence by the new scientific
evidence, but they should adopt a sense of optimism. In the past, policy makers
have been forced to rely on data from the industrialised world to justify their
investments in early child development activities. More recently, a growing
body of data from the developing world also indicates the long-term benefits of
early child development programmes, as reflected in increased primary school
enrolment and enhanced school progress and performance. These data not only
reinforce the assumption that similarly positive effects of early interventions
are possible in the developing world, but also imply that the potential for
bringing about improvements may be greater when social and economic conditions
are more severe.<p>
<p>
Although the implications of these interactive effects are of considerable
importance for the health and well-being of children, they have been generally
overlooked in development planning for children. Some of the resistance to
early childhood development programmes stems from misconceptions about the
factors that optimise or constrain children's early development. Rather than
attending to the interrelations between growth and development, skeptics of
child development efforts regard change in a sequential fashion, placing
survival goals first followed by efforts to address the quality of that
survival. Moreover, attention to the integrated or holistic needs of children
crosses bureaucratic lines, rendering no one institution with specific
programmatic responsibility or commitment.<p>
<p>
Another source of resistance is the erroneous perception that children in their
first few years are passive recipients rather than active creators of their own
knowledge. It is sometimes argued, moreover, that the coping strategies
developed by families and communities to care for the needs of young children
are quite sufficient and should not be interfered with by forces external to
the familial unit. In this perspective, learning begins upon a child's entry
into primary school and not, as the scientific evidence powerfully
demonstrates, from the moment of birth when the infant begins to actively
interact with people and things in his or her environment. Policy makers have
also rejected proposals for early childhood development programmes, based on
misleading assertions related to high costs or the need for sophisticated
teaching methodologies and equipment, and for fear of overburdening formal
school systems with the responsibilities for formal preschool programmes. <p>
<p>
In spite of this resistance, hundreds of demonstration programmes and projects
have underscored the possibilities for early child development programmes to
increase and foster children's abilities to cope with and creatively adapt to
their environments. The expansion of child development programmes in the
developing world over the last decade has been dramatic. For example, in Korea
during 1982-1986, the percentage of children attending early child development
programmes increased from 8 to 57 per cent. The expansion of
government-supported centre-based programmes stemmed in part from the increased
need for child care services resulting from women's entrance into the labour
force. This expansion is also seen in Sri Lanka's efforts to cover all five
year-old children by extending the age of entry downward into primary school
and transforming the first year of schooling into a kindergarten for all.
Thailand now provides some form of preschool for approximately 24 per cent of
all children between the ages of three and six in early non-formal centre-based
programmes combined with parental education activities. In the Philippines, 19
per cent of all children aged 3 to 6 participate in an early childhood
enrichment programme that delivers learning opportunities to disadvantaged
preschool children in a structured centre-based setting. In China, the All
China Women's Federation has created over 200,000 local parent-education
programmes within the past four years. The curriculum emphasises the
interaction between physical, nutritional, and psychosocial dimensions of
development. The programme, designed in collaboration with the community, is
integrated into existing preschools or primary schools or offered in
conjunction with periodic medical visits.<p>
<p>
However, this increased programmatic experience has been unable to reach the
scale required, and millions of young children and families are without
critical child care services. Although a detailed analysis of care programmes
in the developing world is not available, one is well aware of major geographic
areas of inactivity. The factors influencing national policies on child
development are many and complex reflecting unique historical conditions,
widely differing national attitudes, and a variety of political and economic
realities. While considerable progress has been made in many countries in Latin
America and Asia, programmes are virtually non-existent in many parts of
Africa. The majority of innovative programmes are unable to secure sustainable
sources of revenue necessary to expand coverage while maintaining programme
quality. Often the quality of existing programmes is so poor that positive
benefits to the child are minimal, and in some instances negative outcomes may
be apparent. Standards of quality control incorporating elements of staff/child
ratios; training and supervision; health, nutrition, and safety;
developmentally appropriate child-centred learning; and family partnerships
need to be defined and monitored. Moreover, the current set of strategies is
less successful in reaching high-risk mothers and infants during the prenatal
period through the first two years of life with integrated programmes that
provide the proper balance of health, nutrition, and psychosocial components.
The vertical thinking and sectoral competition characterising government
bureaucracies and international donors as well as child care providers often
conflict with this need to provide a comprehensive set of services.<p>
<p>
The challenges of meeting the needs of families with young children are set
before us. These challenges require solutions that demand long-term commitment
by professionals across many disciplines to address issues related to actual
rather than theoretical integration and convergence of services. How and when
to involve governments in the complex process of expansion, and how to define
the critical components in programme quality are pressing concerns. Utilising
the advances in media technology, we must continue in our efforts to create
flexible strategies that can respond to the diversity of skills and needs
reflected by early child development personnel. As indicated, without our
commitment to the infrastructure required to supplement intensive training
courses with ongoing supervision and follow-up, the kind of programmes we
expect will remain an ideal. The frustrations resulting from inefficient
monitoring systems must be assuaged by effective information management systems
enabling programmes to adjust themselves to a changing array of circumstances.
Finally, we must continue to allow for the systematic interaction among
families, children, and communities. Programmes should not only incorporate and
build upon parental wisdom but must begin to identify the culture-specific
opportunities for partnerships that children open to us, for a brief amount of
time, during their passage through infancy and early childhood. The question is
not so much whether but when and how community and family-based child
development programmes, particularly for high-risk families, will begin to
receive the attention so clearly and urgently required at all levels of
society.<p>
<p>
In an effort to refine our existing policies and to sharpen our programme
strategies, the principal objectives of this joint policy statement are to
highlight the rationale for investing in early childhood activities, synthesise
recent scientific knowledge and conceptual frameworks, review and critique
existing programmes, and suggest possible strategies for integrating child
development activities within other more narrowly defined sectoral
initiatives.<p>

<p>
<b>II  A CHANGED ENVIRONMENT: GLOBAL TRENDS AND CHALLENGES</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>A.  A RATIONALE FOR INVESTING IN EARLY CHILDHOOD ACTIVITIES</b><p>
<p>
The neglected subject of child development might well receive greater attention
at the international and national levels as a result of several global trends
and challenges. Current trends including, urbanisation, industrialisation,
migration, and expanding access to education have, to some extent created new
opportunities for women. However, they have also disrupted many familiar
cultural practices and survival patterns that women have developed over the
years to cope with their multiple responsibilities. One of the areas affected
by these trends is child care, which is increasingly recognised as an area of
critical, unmet need for the healthy development of children and the changing
economic and social circumstances characterising women's lives. The following
discussion briefly summarises some of the causes and consequences of these
trends.<sup>3</sup><p>
<p>
<b>Shifting Family Structures</b><p>
<p>
Family structures throughout the world continue to change in response to
industrialisation, urbanisation, population growth, increasing longevity and
migration. Only quite recently has the extent of diversity and fluidity in
family structures and in resource flows within families begun to be appreciated
for its policy implications. The model of a family in which one male head of
household has economic responsibility for and control over one wife and their
children has never been the norm in many parts of the world; and even when this
model has been considered the norm, its prevalence is declining.<p>
<p>
One notable trend is the decrease in average household size, an important
contributing factor of which is declining fertility rates. Over the past 25
years, total fertility rates have diminished dramatically in all regions of the
world except sub-Saharan Africa. The most dramatic declines have occurred in
Latin America and the Caribbean (from 5.5 to 3.4 births per woman) and in East
Asia (from 5.2 to 3.0 births per woman). A second important trend that has
influenced household size is the effect of increasing life expectancy combined
with male-female differences in marriage patterns. Because women initially
marry younger and live longer than men, the ratio of widows to widowers is
about 4 to 1 throughout most of the world. In addition, compared with women,
men are more likely to marry or re-marry in their later years. Among people
aged 60 and older, for example, about 75 per cent of men are married, compared
with only 40 per cent of women. The net result is that an increasing proportion
of older women live alone, again contributing to the decline in average
household size.<sup>4</sup><p>
<p>
Migration, both rural-to urban migration and, to a lesser extent, international
migration has also had a significant effect on family structure, separating
male and female partners, as well as generations, from each other. In terms of
rural-to-urban migration, there seem to be two distinct patterns in the
developing world -- one in which it is primarily men who migrate to cities, and
the other in which it is primarily women who migrate. In Latin America and the
Caribbean, for example, almost two-thirds of rural-to-urban migrants are women,
over half of them under the age of 15. While women migrants have greater
economic opportunities in cities, they tend to be extremely vulnerable, both
personally and economically, because they leave family and social networks
behind and bring few skills and resources with them. The other pattern of
rural-to-urban migration, which predominates in sub-Saharan Africa and in most
Asian countries, is of young men going to cities in search of work, leaving
women, children, and the elderly on farms and in rural villages. Most women who
are left behind in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia find themselves with heavier
work loads. Although some receive remittances, many do not. <p>
<p>
Both of the trends -- declining household size and migration -- have
contributed to the single most important trend in family structure that has
occurred in the last 25 years: the greater number of female-headed households.
While there are important discussions about how a female-headed household
should be defined, it is possible to obtain a reasonably accurate minimum
estimate of prevalence. According to relatively conservative estimates, almost
30 per cent of households in Latin America and the Caribbean and about 15 per
cent of households in East and Southeast Asia are female-headed. In North
Africa and West and South Asia, the proportion tends to be much lower -- only
around 5 per cent. Between half and a quarter of women householders in the
developing world are widowed and/or over age 60. Many elderly or widowed women
heading households live alone, whereas others have responsibility for children
or grandchildren living with them.<sup>5</sup><p>
<p>
Changes in family structure, as well as an increasing proportion of families
living in urban settings, have created their own set of child care dilemmas.
Child care problems associated with rural-to-urban migration are due not only
to the greater pressure experienced by urban women to generate income, and the
greater probability that urban women will be employed in the formal sector. The
problem also hinges on the fact that the normal pattern of migration to the
city is only for some and not all the members of the nuclear or extended
family. Thus, women are forced to enter the labour force, but lack the kin
networks that they might have been able to rely on for child care. Sometimes
residential support networks can replace kin networks in urban areas, but each
new move still entails a difficult period of adjustment. <p>
<p>
Household size and composition are relevant to child care. Declining fertility
rates and reduced average household size mean that women have fewer older
children and fewer other adults in the household to assist in the provision of
child care. Small households in general, and female-headed households in
particular, may be even more disadvantaged than it appears. With limited time
or resources to provide reciprocal services, heads of such households may be
less likely to have established strong positions within a kin or residential
network.<p>
<p>
<b>Changing Work Patterns</b><p>
<p>
In addition, the compound effect of increasingly monetised economies, greater
individual geographic mobility in search of work, and greater mobility and
instability in adult sexual relationships seems to have weakened the overall
claim of women and children upon male incomes and support. Since this has not,
in most cases, been accompanied by greater government support to women and
children, or by improvements in women's economic productivity, the consequence
has been an increase in the relative poverty of women and children. <p>
<p>
The status and role of a woman living with a male partner is also quite
variable. The fact that a woman has a husband or male partner does not
necessarily mean that he is a regular economic provider or even that he is
regularly physically present in the home.  Decision-making power within the
household, while strongly influenced by co-residence and relative economic
contribution, is also influenced by many other factors, such as age, fertility
(in many cultures women gain considerable status for bearing one or more sons),
and social or kin networks. It is also important to recognise that in many
cultures, not all children have equal claim to family support. Discrimination
against female children in South Asia has been documented widely. There is less
recognition of the fact that other categories of children, such as
non-first-born sons born and disabled or illegitimate children, often also
suffer from blatantly discriminatory behaviour.<p>
<p>
Women's work is obviously not new; women have always worked. Moreover, women's
work --  not only their household maintenance work and child care, but also
their food production or income generation -- has always been essential to
family survival. However, there have been significant changes in the patterns
of women's work. The second half of this century has seen significant increases
in the female proportion of the total paid labour force and in the proportion
of women 15 years of age or older who are in the paid labour force. These
trends began earlier and have been most dramatic in the industrialised
countries, but have also been significant in the developing countries.
Notwithstanding there are important regional and sub-regional variations,
available data suggest that in developing countries as a whole, between 1950
and 1985, the proportion of women aged 15 or older in the paid labour force
rose from 37 to 42 per cent. This figure undoubtedly  represents a lower bound
on the true extent of women's current economic participation. Difficulties
associated with defining and categorising non-paid labour, as well as cultural
preconceptions about the appropriate economic role for women, allow for a
systematic and large underestimation of the scope of women's contribution to
the economy.<sup>4,6</sup><p>
<p>
In spite of their limitations, available data highlight important regional
differences in the extent of the increase in women's labour force participation
as well as in the types of work that have accounted for most of the increase.
The highest levels of economic participation on the part of women are found in
East and Southeast Asia, where 50 to 60 per cent of women aged 15 or over are
economically active, and where women represent 40 per cent of the total labour
force. However, these proportions have risen little if at all over the last 20
years, and agriculture continues to provide the main source of work for women
in Asia. <p>
<p>
In contrast, urban growth has significantly changed economic opportunities for
women in Latin America and the Caribbean, where the percentage of women who are
economically active rose from 26 to 32 percent between 1970 and 1990, with
service sector jobs accounting for most of the increase. In sub-Saharan Africa,
the percentage of economically active women is high, but appears to have
actually declined from slightly above to slightly below 50 per cent in the
period since 1970. The vast majority of these women work in agriculture, but
unlike in other regions, only a small proportion are paid for their labour. In
North Africa and Western Asia, the most striking aspect of the phenomenon is
the low level of women's participation in the overall labour force (under 20
per cent), although even in these countries there has been a notable increase
in the percentage of economically active women as well as in women's share of
the total labour force.<sup>7</sup><p>
<p>
Traditional patterns of women's work have almost invariably involved long
hours, usually significantly longer hours than for men, at least in rural
areas. Recently, however, the effects of population growth, environmental
degradation and/or male migration have, in many places, made the circumstances
under which women carry out traditional work responsibilities increasingly
demanding. For example, deforestation, particularly in Central America and
South Asia, means that women have to walk farther to find fuel. Increasing
pressure on arable land means that women also walk farther to reach less
productive fields, and frequently have less help from men in strenuous tasks
such as land clearing. Smaller family size and increased school attendance
among children, while desirable trends in and of themselves, mean that women
receive less help from children. One study in Kenya found that agricultural
marginalisation and environmental deterioration were increasing the work burden
for women of reproductive age more than for other members of the household,
with measurable negative effects on their nutritional status and on the
prevalence of chronic disability.<p>
<p>
Particularly in recent years, women's increased economic activity has been not
so much a response to a wider range of opportunities for women as a response to
the erosion of family incomes. Faced with reduced access to male-generated
incomes, which are themselves declining in much of the world, more women are
entering the labour force and working for longer hours than ever before.
Unfortunately, given the constraints on women's productivity due to their
limited skills, their lack of access to credit, and the demands of their
multiple responsibilities, for most women the only way to increase their income
is to increase the number of hours they work. The necessity of working longer
hours further reduces women's opportunities for the acquisition of skills and
may impair their health and nutritional status, thus setting up a vicious cycle
in which lower productivity leads to ever more desperate efforts to increase
hours of work. Women's work burden has increased in recent years partly because
rising poverty has forced them to devote more time and effort to income
generation. At the same time, they have had to put more time into household
maintenance and caregiving in response to a decline in public and private
social and health services accompanied by the erosion of traditional family
support systems in most countries.<sup>8</sup><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b>The 1980s might well be called the decade of labour deregulation.
For many newly industrialising countries, prevailing economic strategies have
led to increased employment with lower incomes and less job security. These
strategies have also brought a renewed surge of feminisation of labour
activity. The types of work, labour relations, income, and insecurity
associated with women's work have been accompanied by a drop in men's
employment as well as by a "feminisation" of many jobs traditionally held by
men.<p>
<p>
Many of the reasons for the feminisation of the labour pool are well known.
Much of the assembly and production work is semi-skilled and low-paid. The
social and economic oppression of young women, particularly in Asia, has
resulted in "low aspiration" and "low efficiency" wages. Women are prepared to
work long hours for low wages, and when their productivity declines they are
quickly replaced by new and vulnerable cohorts. Most of these women begin with
no skills; acquire no skills on the job; have no health, maternity, or pension
benefits; and have no job security. They are constantly at a high risk of
losing their employment, and once they do, factors such as age, child care
responsibilities, or poor health limit their ability to find alternative
employment.<sup>9</sup><p>
<p>
Economists have proposed several explanations for the increase in women's
labour force participation and the simultaneous decrease in male participation.
Outward-oriented development strategies based on export-led industrialisation
have brought a rapid growth of low-wage female employment. A rise in the female
proportion of productive wage workers has been observed in all countries that
have pursued export-led industrialisation strategies, including the Dominican
Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea, Malaysia,
Mexico, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Indeed, no country has
successfully industrialised or pursued this development strategy without
relying on a massive expansion of female labour. In the export processing zones
of many newly industrialising countries, it is not uncommon for as many as
three quarters of all employees to be women.<sup>9</sup><p>
<p>
Another aspect of the structural adjustment strategy affecting women's
employment patterns is labour market deregulation. As of late 1990, 109
countries had ratified the Equal Remuneration Convention No. 100 of the
International Labour Organisation (ILO). In a disproportionate number of
countries with large export processing zones, including Hong Kong, Republic of
Korea, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, the Convention has not been ratified. Other
countries, such as India, have implemented gender-based minimum-wage
requirements in certain industries on the grounds that women perform less
arduous work. It is no coincidence that this shifting pattern is closely
related to the erosion of labour regulations.<sup>9</sup> <p>
<p>
Besides such explicit deregulation, in which formal regulations have been
eroded or abandoned by legislative actions, there exists an implicit
deregulation characterised by inadequate implementation or systematic bypassing
of existing regulations.<p>
<p>
In general, stabilisation and adjustment strategies have resulted in a decrease
in aggregate demand, leading to higher unemployment in the formal sectors and
among the poor widespread resort to informal survival strategies, particularly
in urban areas. Consequently, both men and women have increasingly turned to
self-generated employment in the informal sector, either as a supplement to
formal sector earnings or as their sole source of support.  Women have long
been concentrated in such informal activities, both as petty traders or
"pre-entrepreneurs" and as dependent wage workers in family enterprises. Very
little has been done to enhance the status and living standards of such
workers. <p>
<p>
The overall trend towards increased economic participation on the part of women
has occurred throughout the world and seems likely to continue, perhaps even at
an accelerated pace, given increasing numbers of export-led, market-oriented
national economies. However, as this brief review indicates, what might appear
to be economic gains for women in the changing labour market are offset by
pervasive and continuing job insecurity, often combined with a need to work
longer and more burdensome hours. As the next section makes clear, these trends
have posed painful dilemmas for women with child care responsibilities.<p>
<p>
<b>Importance of Early Childhood</b><p>
 <p>
Another line of reasoning in support of investing in early childhood activities
is a slowly growing consciousness of the social consequences (school drop-out,
juvenile delinquency, teenage pregnancies, drug addiction) of neglecting
development throughout childhood and the major qualitative improvements needed
in primary schooling and parental education. This perspective is strengthened
by an increasing recognition of the need to ensure the sustainability of recent
gains in child survival by empowering parents with knowledge and skills about
child survival and development.<p>
<p>
As will be discussed in chapter III, it is widely accepted that the first years
of a child's life are of critical importance. The first two years are
characterised by rapid growth and some of life's most significant learning
experiences, including walking and talking, encountering fear and pleasure, and
discovering one's self and others. Programmes for children in this age-group
must protect their physical integrity and provide them with the diet needed for
their growth. They must also promote their psychological, social and emotional
development and intellectual curiosity in a climate of affection and security.
During the first two years, in supportive physical, emotional, and social
environments, the development of critical brain structures continues to fuel
behavioural changes that enhance the child's abilities to learn from and shape
its interactions with caregivers and the environment.<p>
<p>
The period between the ages of three and six is also one of rapid physical and
mental development. Children gain confidence in their bodies, strive for
independence by doing things on their own, and experiment with objects in the
surrounding environment. They show a livelier curiosity at what is going on
about them, enjoy the company of other children, and seek to imitate adult
behaviour. They learn to assert themselves as individuals and begin to acquire
self-control and discipline. During this period children's intellectual and
social development proceeds apace, as illustrated by their acquiring
sophisticated language skills and adopting culturally acceptable behaviour
patterns. While the health needs of children in this age-group still require
constant attention, it is essential that they be provided with challenges that
respond to their enormous thirst for learning and prepared for symbolic and
logical thinking skills required in formal schooling. Such environments help to
create a child with a positive self concept who seeks, establishes and
maintains the kinds of supportive relationships that continue to produce
successful outcomes. The cycle of success can be as perpetuating as the cycle
of failure. Recourse to adequate environments that are capable of responding
and enhancing these basic universal needs is indeed the right of all
children.<p>
<p>
The scientific evidence accumulated during the past decade powerfully
demonstrates the long-term benefits associated with increased investments in
well-conceived and properly managed child development programmes. In the past,
concerned professionals have been forced to rely on data from the
industrialised world to justify their investments in early child development
activities. More recently, a growing body of data from developing countries
indicates the long-term benefits to children and their families as reflected in
increased primary school enrolments and enhanced school progress and
performance. These data not only reinforce the assumption that similarly
positive effects of early interventions are possible in the developing world,
but also suggest that the potential for bringing about improvements may be
greatest when social and economic conditions are more severe.<p>
<p>
It is clear that the developmental costs of inadequate child care are high. The
factors that influence the quality of child care include maternal health,
nutrition, and education; child development beliefs and values; social support
systems, quality of substitute caregivers; intra-familial status; and the
mother's decision-making power. The degree to which these maternal variables
are operative, is directly influenced by the characteristics and circumstances
of the mother's work, technical and material conditions of production, energy
expenditure, time allocation, absence from home, exposure to hazards and
control over and access to resources. Children with inadequate care are exposed
more frequently to a clustering of risk factors such as illness, poor
nutrition, family stress, and non-stimulating environments. The long-term costs
can be measured in terms of school drop-out, unemployment, delinquency, and the
inter-generational perpetuation of failure and poverty. The period of early
childhood offers a window of opportunity in which even small positive changes
in the young child's environment can generate long-term benefits.<p>
<p>
Women's increased vulnerability -- resulting from market deregulation, insecure
and poorly paid work environments, and the erosion of supportive social and
family networks -- combined with increased recognition of the critical
importance of early childhood, provide a powerful argument for governments,
employers, communities, and families to identify affordable solutions to the
provision of adequate child care. The need for supportive child care
initiatives is no longer questioned. The challenge confronting us all is how
and under what circumstances quality services can be implemented and sustained.
<p>
<p>
<b>B. INCREASED INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION</b><p>
<p>
In addition to a changing world environment, over the past two years
international donors have shifted their position with respect to programming
for early childhood care and development. This shift reflects in part dramatic
political changes at a global level, an apparent end to the cold war, a
reduction in military expenditures, and new proposals for relieving heavy debt
burdens. These changes have stimulated reflection and creative thought about
the shape of things to come. These new visions and fresh hopes for childhood in
the 21st century also reflect the continuing search among organisations for
something that is new, that relates to or is a natural outgrowth of previous
actions, and that helps to integrate existing programme activities. <p>
<p>
Considerable support and affirmation for these trends evolved from the
attention drawn by three international events, namely the Convention on the
Rights of the Child, the World Conference on Education for All, and the World
Summit for Children. The implications of these events for child development
programming are highlighted briefly below.<p>
<p>
<b>The Convention on the Rights of the Child</b><p>
<p>
The Convention on the Rights of the Child was adopted by the General Assembly
of the United Nations in November 1989.<sup>10</sup>  The Convention
establishes the right of all persons under 18 years of age to develop to their
full potential, free from hunger and want, neglect, exploitation or any other
form of abuse. The provisions of the Convention distinguish four main areas of
children's rights: survival, development, protection, and participation
(Article 6). <p>
<p>
More than 70 countries signed the Convention, which commits them to defending
the right of children to develop to their full potential. This Convention is
viewed by human rights advocates as a promising "newcomer" to the field of
international human rights laws and advocacy. A paper to the Executive Board of
the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), 1991, asserts that the Convention
may be the "most complete statement of children's rights ever made". In
addition, the Board paper goes on to assert that it may be "the most
comprehensive and, in many of its provisions, the most innovative human rights
instrument to be drafted by the international community." It marks "a turning
point away from the traditional distinction of human rights into civil and
political rights on one hand, and economic, social and cultural on the
other."<sup>11</sup><p>
<p>
The value base regarding the family and the relationship between the child, the
family and the State reflects the concept of joint and shared parental
responsibilities, as well as rights, in a context of gender equity. The
Convention consistently refers to "parents" and Article 18 provides that "both
parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of the
child." That same Article adds that the State "shall render appropriate
assistance to parents and legal guardians in the performance of their
child-rearing responsibilities and shall ensure the development of
institutions, facilities and services for the care of children." <p>
<p>
Finally, the last clause of Article 18 has potential for firm advocacy and
concerted action to address one of the major issues concerning women, work and
child care;<p>
<p>
<i>"States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that children
of working parents have the right to benefit from child care services and
facilities for which they are eligible."</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>The World Conference on Education for All</b><p>
<p>
In March 1990, the World Conference on Education for All, organised by UNICEF,
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO),
the World Bank, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), brought
together representatives from over 150 governments and more than 200
non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The Declaration approved at the
Conference<sup>12</sup> included the following statement:<p>
<p>
<i>"Learning begins at birth. This calls for early childhood care and initial
education. These can be provided through arrangements involving families,
communities, or institutional programmes, as appropriate."</i>  (Article 5)<p>
<p>
The Framework for Action<sup>12</sup> also set some objectives to be integrated
into programmes and initiatives over the present decade:<p>
<p>
<i>"Expansion of early childhood care and development activities, including
family and community interventions, especially for poor, disadvantaged, and
disabled children ..."</i>  (Paragraph 8)<p>
<p>
It is important to note that, in the early plans of the Conference, "basic
education" did not include attention to the early years. It was only as a
result of discussions at regional levels and pressures from NGOs that the
importance of early childhood care and development within the broader context
of basic learning needs was recognised. A working assumption  accepted by the
Conference is that children who participate in such programmes are better
prepared for schooling, and are more likely to enter school and to do well than
those who have not participated. The potential effects of early childhood
programmes on primary school enrolment rates have captured the attention of
policy makers and planners seeking ways to increase educational performance and
to reduce costs through reduced repetition and drop-out. Parents also now
expect these programmes to give their children a "head start", easing the
transition from the social world of the home to that of the school and the
larger society. <p>
<p>
However, it must be recognised that improved adjustment to and success in
primary school constitute one of positive effects for children who participate
in early childhood development programmes. Other important accompanying and
overlapping purposes include improving children's physical health, learning to
learn, providing child care that benefits children while parents work;
rehabilitating children who are disabled, inculcating particular moral,
political, or religious values; and generally improving the quality of life for
children. Even in programmes that focus on preparation for school, it should be
recognised that the benefits of investing in early childhood development will
be greater than the schooling benefits. Moreover, schools are only one of
several learning environments for a child. Learning occurs in the home and in
the community, and it is important not to lose sight of the broader question of
the effects of early childhood programmes on the general ability of children to
learn. <p>
<p>
<b>The World Summit for Children</b><p>
<p>
The first basic education goal endorsed and formulated at the World Summit for
Children held in September, 1990, called for the expansion of early childhood
development activities, including appropriate low-cost family and
community-based interventions. Moreover, the Summit Declaration and Plan of
Action highlighted<sup>13</sup> the urgent situation of the girl child and
called for support for her full and equitable development as an indispensable
step towards achieving equality for women:<p>
<p>
<i>"Strengthening the role of women in general and ensuring their equal rights
will be to the advantage of the world's children. Girls must be given equal
treatment and opportunities from the very beginning."</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>"Women in their various roles play a critical part in the well-being of
children. The enhancement of the status of women and their equal access to
education, training, credit and other extension services constitutes a valuable
contribution to a nation's social and economic development. Efforts for the
enhancement of women's status and their role in development must begin with the
girl child. Equal opportunity should be provided for the girl child to benefit
from the health, nutrition, education and other basic services to enable her to
grow to her full potential."</i><p>
<p>
Together, the Convention, the Education Conference, and the Summit have
provided an extraordinary opportunity for multilateral and bilateral donors to
review, reflect, and reconsider their strategies regarding the comprehensive
needs of young children and their caregivers.<p>
<p>
<b>An Opportunity</b><p>
<p>
The major challenge confronting the international donor community lies in
taking advantage of the opportunities provided by this changing world
environment. We must find ways to integrate the latest scientific insights into
ongoing programmes and to address in a more concerted manner the obstacles to
further progress. It will be especially important for us to determine how child
development components can be incorporated into existing programmes that are
currently narrowly oriented towards child health and nutrition. Given the
increased availability of information technology, there is considerable
potential in capturing the attention of the mass media as allies in promoting
child development. Religious institutions, governmental and non-governmental
organisations must also become more engaged in helping to provide programme
support. What the child experiences from birth onward influences the society of
the future. How we respond to the interrelated health, nutrition, and
developmental needs of today's young children affects the civilisation we are
building for generations to come.<p>
<p>
The following chapter highlights in more detail the growing body of scientific
evidence that powerfully demonstrates the significance of the early years.
Within this theoretical framework, a set of principles for action are put
forth.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>III  THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES ON CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND LEARNING</b>
<b>[*]</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<b>A.  FUNDAMENTALS OF DEVELOPMENT</b><p>
<p>
The goal of this section is to clarify the scientific basis in support of
increased investments in well-conceived and properly managed early child
development programmes. As defined earlier, child development encompasses the
unfolding of behaviours from immature to mature; from simple to complex; and
the evolution of a human being from dependency to autonomous adulthood. More
simply, child development is a process of change in which the child learns to
handle more complex levels of moving, thinking, feeling, and interacting with
people and objects in the environment. Early child development refers to the
formative early years of the life cycle -- the first six years of life. In this
section, the major developmental tasks and challenges confronting the newborn,
infant and preschool child are highlighted. Because development continues well
beyond the early years, development tasks of middle childhood and adolescence
are briefly mentioned. It is hoped that greater attention to the developmental
perspective will strengthen the analysis and refinement of programmes developed
for children throughout the life course.<p>
 <p>
<b>The Newborn's Capacities And Patterns Of Early Interaction</b><p>
<p>
Following nine months of growth and maturation <i>in utero</i>, chemical
changes initiate the birth process. The transition to life outside the mother
fundamentally changes the conditions required for continued development. Birth
constitutes the first of several major biological-behavioural shifts in
development. No longer able to receive maternal sources of oxygen and nutrients
to sustain life, the infant must rely on the biological capacities developed
during the prenatal period. This emphasises the process in which the biological
forces during conception interact with the culturally organised environment
that awaits the child at birth.<p>
<p>
Contrary to the common wisdom of earlier decades, modern research has
demonstrated the remarkable abilities of infants to seek out and process
information about their environment and to act on that information. It is
increasingly recognised that infant survival is directly dependent on the
social support of caregivers who respond to and structure, according to
prescribed patterns, the infant's interaction with the environment.  <p>
<p>
At birth, infants are equipped with a wide range of capacities that facilitate
both survival and healthy development. They have reflexes for the basic
biological functions as well as reflexes that lay the foundation for the more
complex, controlled behaviours that appear later on, such as grasping,
crawling, and walking. Their basic sensory capacities for hearing, touching,
smelling, and tasting are mature at birth, and the competence with which most
newborns use these capacities is dramatic. For example, neonates are able to
hear across the same frequency range as older children, and they display a
special sensitivity to the basic sound categories of human
language.<sup>14</sup> Although vision is not fully developed at birth, infants
are able to focus and follow the human face as well as attractive inanimate
objects.<sup>15</sup> By two months of age, the infant's attention span
increases, and more complex, shaded images are preferred. At birth, the dermal
or touch system is the most mature of all the sensory capacities. The skin, the
most extensive of all sensory systems, sends a multitude of sensory messages to
the brain through its receptors for temperature, contact, and pain. In addition
to body contact, taste and smell play an important role in the early
establishment of emotional ties. Within the first week, infants are capable of
distinguishing the mother's breast milk. Infants are attracted to what is
familiar and express this comfort through bodily movements and facial
expressions. A quiet infant is highly satisfying to the mother. The
mother-infant communication system, which is initially established through
touch and smell, occupies a critically important place in the development of
emotional ties.<sup>16</sup> These early expressions of emotional ties lay the
foundation for the emergence of more complex cognitive, social, and emotional
development.<sup>17</sup> In the absence of human contact, infants will begin
to withdraw from their environments.<p>
<p>
Young infants employ a repertoire of communication skills, including smiles,
gestures, and vocalisations, which enable them to participate in a complex
affective communication system. For example, an infant has several goals for
interacting with other objects and maintaining close proximity to the
caregiver.<sup>18</sup> To accomplish these goals, the infants process
information about their successes or failures and use that information to
accomplish their goals or to redirect their efforts to other goals. An infant
can effectively signal its interests for interaction through eye gaze and
smiles, and caregivers interpreting the infant's messages respond through
appropriate facilitation of the infant's objectives. Thus the infant is an
active, not a passive, participant. <p>
<p>
Social interaction in the newborn and in the early months of infancy appears to
be a rule-governed, goal-oriented system in which the infant and the caregiver
are active participants.  Disruptions of this system command powerful responses
from the newborn, as dramatically illustrated by years of laboratory
investigation of face-to-face interactions by Brazelton and his colleagues. In
a face-to-face laboratory play situation, mothers were asked to violate the
infant's expectations for interaction by remaining alert but
unresponsive.<sup>19</sup>  The still-faced mothers remained unresponsive for
only three minutes, yet their infants found this temporary violation greatly
disturbing. This suggests that reciprocity and mutual achievement of the goals
of social interaction form a necessary basis for the growth of affective
well-being in infancy. Some of the strategies that the infants employ to bring
their mothers out of immobility demonstrates their growing confidence as an
effective social partner. The seriousness of their reaction when the mother
remained unresponsive demonstrates the infant's critical need for maternal
responsiveness. When infants cannot pull their mothers into the interaction
finally withdraw, they are reminiscent of Harlow and Zimmerman's description of
the withdrawn behaviour and huddled posture of isolated monkeys, and of
Bowlby's description of the withdrawn behaviour of children separated from
their caretakers.<sup>20</sup> Sick, malnourished, or brain-impaired babies as
well as those infants expecting to fail will elicit less effective social
interaction.<sup>21</sup><p>
<p>
Decades of research on infant behaviour, combined with a sensitive appreciation
for the range of cross-cultural contexts in which the child's capacities
unfold, has led Brazelton and his colleagues to develop a model for
understanding the drama of child development during this early period. An
understanding of the forces that propel the child along the normal path of
development is critical to the prevention of failure. According to this model,
there are three sources of energy for development, including maturation of the
central nervous system (CNS), internal feedback system, and external feedback
system (Figure 1).<sup>22</sup><p>
<p>
The first source of energy is the maturation of the central nervous system,
which is at the same time the most powerful and most limiting force. The growth
and maturation of the central nervous system in early child development is
dramatic and drives infants from one level of development to another in
relentless fashion. Brain development is a process characterised by events that
occur in a complex, interrelated way, in a dynamic fashion, at specific,
predetermined times. The brain attains 90 per cent of its adult volume when a
child reaches six years of age, whereas the rest of the six-year-old's body
represents only 40 per cent of its adult volume.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Three Sources of Energy for Development</b><p>
<p>
There are two periods of rapid brain growth. The first begins during the first
three weeks of pregnancy, during the period of embryogenesis, when the nerves
and glial cells are formed.  The number of cells formed during this period,
approximately 10 billion, remains stable throughout the life cycle. The second
phase of rapid brain growth lasts from the 13th week of gestation until the
child reaches 2.5 years of age. During this period, many of the brain's
structures and biochemical routes are developed, and a whole system of
interconnections is established.<p>
<p>
The second important set of energies in early child development is the
<b>internal feedback system </b>that provides the growing infant with a sense
of inner competence. These internal programmes of development, reflecting both
genetic endowment and intrauterine shaping, provide the maturational stages
that are genetically programmed. For instance, when toddlers first learn to
walk their faces glow, they strut and their legs are driven to perform for
long, exhausting periods. The energy that has been mobilised to achieve the
developmental task of walking now fuels the realisation of mastery, and in
turn, the toddler is reinforced to move on to achieve the next developmental
stage.  <p>
<p>
The third source of energy propelling early child development is the
<b>external feedback system </b>provided by the parents and the outside
environment. For instance, as the infant achieves each new goal, he or she
looks for signs of reward and reinforcement from the outside world. Thus,
infants are programmed with the energy or drive to reach out for and
incorporate cues and reinforcing signals from the social world, providing a
second force for achieving an inner sense of competence. While the feedback
cycles necessary for normal affective growth are well documented, we have only
recently begun to understand the crucial role of environmental nurturance for
all of the infant's development. Environmental forces can work powerfully to
retard or enhance the infant's progress.  <p>
<p>
A normal infant has a sufficient amount of internal energy as well as
mechanisms for demanding responses from caregivers.  Malnourished infants,
however, are unable to elicit  appropriate responses from already
over-stressed, depleted caregivers. These infants' capacity for catch-up growth
is limited, and the stage has been set to fuel the cycle of
poverty.<sup>23</sup> In a malnourished infant, one with a premature central
nervous system and fewer brain cells, where are the sources of energy?  These
infants expect to fail and before they have reached their first birthday they
have already learned how to fail. How can one intervene early enough to
interfere with this expectation for failure? (See box: Malnutrition and the
Brain.)<p>
<p>
The design of early intervention initiatives for at-risk infants and their
families requires the identification of critical periods or opportunities.
These opportunities or "touch-points" refer to "windows" when the
infant-caregiver-environment system is particularly responsive and open to both
receive and provide appropriate information. The esteemed French psychologist
Jean Piaget first recognised that any developmental progression goes in a burst
of energy, followed by a levelling off and a consolidation, and then another
burst.<sup>24</sup> This period of disorganisation is what leaves the system
open allowing the child, caregiver, and the family receptive to establishing a
relationship, as well as to receive and pass on new information. <p>
<p>
Several early universal touch-points have been recognised by Brazelton in his
work with infants and families in both industrialised and non-industrialised
countries. The first touch-point occurs in the last trimestre of pregnancy,
when parents and families seem to be universally receptive to information. A
second touch-point appears to take place in the early months of life when the
universal language of the infant can be demonstrated to engage the caregiver's
heightened commitment and capture the sense of hope that surrounds the birth of
an infant. This hope, however fleeting, is available in even the most stressful
and at-risk systems.  <p>
<p>
Two ingredients seem to be critical if early intervention is to result in
improved developmental outcome. These include the timing of the intervention
and its quality.  Intervention must be of a kind that fosters the child's sense
of competence and fuels his own internal coping strategies, and it must involve
the appropriate response to recognise, nurture and reinforce the child's
development. Efforts at early intervention may prevent a compounding of
problems that occur when the environment cannot properly respond. For example,
premature infants are less able to compensate in disorganised, depriving
environments than are well-equipped infants. Quiet, undemanding malnourished
infants do not elicit necessary mothering from already over-stressed parents.<p>
<p>
It must be recognised, however, that in spite of desperate socioeconomic
conditions characterising the environments of many children in the developing
world, families are able to produce children who do not have to be rescued from
protein-energy malnutrition and other forms of abuse and neglect. Premature and
growth-retarded babies do make remarkable recoveries when placed in supportive
environments. Only through the careful appraisal of both the strengths and
weaknesses of infants and their environments can we come to appreciate the
mechanisms for failure and the sources of strength. Thus, practitioners and
programmers are offered the opportunity to identify critical periods when early
intervention strategies will be most effective. These touch-points, when
parents are ready to be empowered or children are about to conquer the next
developmental task, must be socially and culturally determined. With insights
grounded in the knowledge of child development as well as a realistic appraisal
of available resources, each community of families must identify the timing as
well as the content of the intervention.  <p>

The following section summarises the normal developmental process beginning
with a description of the infant from three months to two years of age and
concludes with a discussion of the early childhood period from 2.5&nbsp;to six
years of age. This discussion, with its attention to developmental stages,
attempts to provide the reader with a firmer foundation on which to build
programmes.   <p>

<b>Malnutrition and the Brain</b><sup>25</sup><br><br>In many countries of the
developing world, the environments confronting the young child are not able to
support the magical unfolding of his or her potential. One of the most critical
insults to early child development is inadequate nutrition. The functional and
structural effects of malnutrition on the developing nervous system are known
to impair cognition and behaviour and to magnify the adverse effects of
socio-environmental deprivation on development. At any age, undernutrition need
not be severe or prolonged to produce behavioural changes that may have
important implications for both parent-child interaction and the ability of the
child to explore and master the environment. In studies of infants and
toddlers, iron deficiency, even without associated protein energy deficits,
correlates with lowered scores on tests of mental and motor developments, as
well as with increased fearfulness, increased inattentiveness, and decreased
social responsiveness.  These developmental deficits may persist after the iron
deficiency has been treated. Protein-energy malnutrition reduces playful and
exploratory activity as well as motivation and arousal and increases apathy and
irritability, even before anthropometric deficits occur. The physiologic
mechanisms of these behavioural derangements are not fully understood but may
be related to alterations in neurotransmitter synthesis and
release.<br><br>While undernutrition produces alterations of behaviour at any
age, the brain is uniquely vulnerable to structural deficits during the
critical period of rapid brain growth which extends from mid-gestation through
the early preschool years. The growing brain utilises nutrients at very rapid
rates. Although it makes up only 2 to 3 per cent of the child's body weight, it
uses 60 per cent of the body's glucose utilisation. During this critical period
the brain has biosynthetic abilities which are inactive after early development
making it impossible to generate new neurons after this critical period.
<br><br>The effects of nutrient deprivation on brain size and structure depend
on the timing, duration, and severity of the nutritional deprivation in
relation to the development of the brain. When the brain is deprived of an
optimal supply of nutrients there are no discrete lesions. Rather, generalised
distortion occurs in those areas that were maturing at the time of nutrient
deficit.  In other areas of the brain where the cells have differentiated
during prenatal life, malnutrition in infancy reduces the formation of synapsis
and the branching of dendrites.<br><br>Nutritional intervention is a necessary
but not a sufficient mode of treatment for infants suffering from early
malnutrition. Data on children from both the developed and developing worlds
clearly demonstrate that medical and nutritional intervention may restore
physical growth but do not bring developmental functions back to normal.
However, several investigations from the developing world have indicated the
plasticity of the infant's central nervous system when exposed to interventions
that provide developmental stimulation in conjunction with nutritional and
medical care. Malnourished children who received focused and sustained centre-
or home-based developmental intervention beginning before two years of age and
lasting for at least three years showed significantly improved developmental
scores at follow-up when compared with untreated malnourished children.<br>
<br>In a study in Cali, Colombia, 180 chronically malnourished Colombian
preschool children were divided into three groups of 60 children each.
Children in Groups I, II and III received medical care, while Groups II and III
received nutritional intervention as well. Children in Group III, in addition
to receiving medical and nutritional interventions, were exposed to a
developmental component consisting of four hours of activities designed to
develop cognitive, language, and social abilities. The results of the study
indicate that adequate medical care alone produced no changes in physical
growth or intellectual development. Nutritional intervention was able to
increase physical growth. The group of children who received a multicomponent
set of services, including medical care, adequate food, and a stimulating
environment, exhibited rates of physical and cognitive development similar to a
well-nourished control group. Thus, while such studies often suffer from
methodological flaws of greater and lesser magnitude, the overall body of data
indicates that the malfunction and poor growth due to early malnutrition and
environmental deprivation are reversible with interventions of nutritional,
medical, and developmental components. The implications of this research for
the design of comprehensive programmes attending to a child's health,
nutrition, and development cannot be underestimated.<br><p>
<b>Developmental Achievements In The First Two Years</b><p>
<p>
The period from 3 months to 12 months of age is characterised by increases in
size and strength accompanied by increases in coordination and mobility.
Infants begin sitting at about five to six months; crawling, at about seven to
nine months; and walking, at about one year.  During this period both memory
and problem-solving abilities improve, providing infants with a firmer sense of
their environment and their ability to act on it. Sometimes between seven and
nine months the infant's increased physical ability and intellectual power
bring about changes in its social relations.  During the period between 3 and
12 months there is a steady growth of memory.  As a result of this cognitive
capacity, infants become upset when left alone and are likely to be wary of
strangers. Monitoring of caregiver's facial expressions helps them to evaluate
their environment. They also begin to make their first speech-like sounds,
which foreshadow the beginning of language.  <p>
<p>
Once infants have increased their motor capacity, they also show a greater
capacity to understand basic properties of objects and spatial relations; they
perceive different objects as members of the same category and compare present
experiences with memories of past events. According to Piaget, development
evolves from children's own efforts to master their environments. In this
perspective, infants actively seek to assimilate their environmental
experiences into their existing knowledge base, or schemes. When they are
unable to do so, they accommodate their existing schemes to the environmental
realities they encounter. Learning during infancy occurs by sensorimotor ways
of knowing. Between four and eight months infants pay more attention to
external objects and prolong actions that produce interesting changes in their
environment. Between eight and twelve months they are able to coordinate
separate actions to achieve goals.  <p>
<p>
The changes in children's self-concept between the ages of 18 and 30 months are
evidenced by their declined distress at separation from their caregivers and an
increased ability to engage in symbolic play, to imitate absent events, and to
express themselves in elementary words and phrases. The changes that converge
to create the transition from infancy to early childhood are summarised in
Table 1. As indicated in the table, these changes reflect what psychologists
refer to as a "bio-social-behavioural shift"<sup>26</sup>, a process by which
changes in separate domains converge to create a qualitative reorganisation in
the overall pattern of behaviour, signalling the beginning of a new
developmental stage. The accomplishments of this period remind us that social
and cognitive changes are accompanied by changes in physical development, such
as coordinated walking and bladder control, all of which are controlled by the
continued maturation of the central nervous system.  <p>
<p>
When both the environment and internal growth processes are sufficient, the
separate components of development undergo further modification, and a new
distinct stage characterises the child at three or four years. A new
configuration of cognitive abilities is manifested in many domains, including
problem solving, play, imitation, categorisation of objects, and communication.
Play evolves from a concentration on variations in patterns of movement to the
pretend use of objects in imaginary situations. Pretend play itself evolves,
and children can carry out a sequence of pretend actions in which objects are
used as agents. Late in the second year, children become capable of imitating
actions seen days earlier, a kind of behaviour known as deferred imitation.  <p>

The complexities and subtleties involved in accounting for how children develop
are well known to those struggling to characterise and define the process. As
confirmed by research, the contributions of biological and environmental
factors as well as cultural influences and the specific circumstances in which
infants and young children develop must all be considered. A child's behaviours
develop not in isolation but as components of an integrated system. The
requirement that developing systems must be studied as a whole is expressed
with particular clarity by the embryologist C.H.&nbsp;Waddington:<p>
<p>
<i>"A new level or organisation cannot be accounted for in terms of the
properties of its elementary units as they behave in isolation, but is
accounted for if we add to these certain other properties which the units only
exhibit in relation to each other".</i><sup>27</sup><p>
<p>
In summary, infancy as a distinct period in the life span is recognised by all
cultures.  While infancy begins as soon as the child starts to breathe
independently, the end of infancy is not so easily defined. According to the
ancient Romans, an infant is "one who does not speak." Developmental
psychologists, to establish that one stage has ended and another begun, look
for converging changes in development among several spheres of physical,
psychological, and social domains. For example, the acquisition of language is
not an isolated event but is associated with children's social relations,
self-concepts, modes of thought, and physical capacities. It is an ensemble of
integrated change that transforms the infant into a young child who, though
still dependent on adults, is on his or her way towards independence.  <p>
<p>
The behaviours that mark the end of infancy do not emerge all at once. Rather,
they reflect the interplay among the patterned sequence of change in
biological, behavioural, cultural, and social domains of development. As
described earlier, the first few months of life provide insights into the
processes of developmental change when the major task is to develop a
synchronous pattern of interaction between the infant, the caregiver, and the
environment. This system of mutual reciprocity is achieved through a wide range
of different cultural systems of child-rearing patterns and practices that
respect, respond to, and support the infant's intense drive to learn through
interactions with the environment. During the first two years of life, in
supportive physical and social environments, the development of critical brain
structures continues to fuel behavioural changes that enhance the children's
abilities to learn from and shape their interactions with caregivers and the
environment.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Paradoxes Of The Preschool Mind</b><p>
<p>
Developmental change evolves more slowly in early childhood -- the period from
2.5 to six years of age -- than in infancy. During this time, children lose
their baby fat, their legs grow longer and thinner, and they move around the
world with increasing dexterity. They present a bewildering patchwork of
vulnerability and ability, logic and magic, insight and ignorance.  Children at
this age can talk in endless sentences but are keen listeners when an
interesting story is being told. Their present desires can be curtailed with
promises of later rewards, but they may not necessarily accept the offered
terms, negotiating for an instant reward as well as for a delayed one. They
develop theories about everything, and constantly measure them against the
world. <p>
<p>
However, despite their developing independence, 3-
                                                                                      
year-olds
need assistance from adults and siblings. They cannot hold a pencil properly or
string a loom or tie a knot. They do not have the ability to concentrate for
long periods of time without a great deal of support, and they wander on
tangents in their games and conversations. Preschool children's thought
processes are characterised by great awareness; yet these islands of
sophistication exist in a sea of uncertainty. During this period, children
still understand relatively little about the world in which they live and have
little or no control over it. They are prone to fears and they combat their
growing self-awareness of being small by wishful, magical
thinking.<sup>26</sup><p>
<p>
A dramatic accomplishment during this period is the acquisition of language.
Despite intensive investigation, the process of language acquisition remains
elusive, and no one theory has sufficiently uncovered its mystery. What is
evident is that the growth of children's vocabulary, their increased ability to
use complex sentence structures, and a corresponding growth in their ability to
engage in conversation appropriately tailored to the listener's needs, require
both participation in responsive human interactions and exposure to a rich
language environment.<sup>28</sup>  <p>
<p>
The ways in which children think about the world, however, are still primitive
-- they must think that dreams come from street lamps, that they think with
their ears, that clouds are alive, and that the sun follows us as we move. The
language errors made by three-, four-, and five-
                                                                                      
year
old children reflect their inability to engage in true mental operations. A key
feature of preschool thinking is that children can focus their attention on
only one salient aspect at a time. This limitation is overcome at six or seven
years of age, when children are able to combine, separate, and transform
information mentally in a logical manner. They know that the sun does not
follow them and dreams do not come from street lamps. <p>
<p>
The preschool child is at the centre of his universe. Through active
interaction, exploration, and observation of the environment, children actively
create their own learning. During development, the child's ability to engage in
play undergoes important transformations reflecting and promoting levels of
cognitive, motor, and social capacities. For example, the infant requires adult
"scaffolding" of activities, the two- to four-year-old engages in solitary play
while four-to six-year-olds have tremendous capacities for socio-dramatic
make-believe games that involve other children and enactment of a variety of
social roles. Play facilitates the transition to higher levels of cognitive
development; the "as if" nature of play allows children to perform actions that
are more developmentally advanced than those they can realistically achieve.
Play fosters a sense of self-esteem and competence, supporting and reinforcing
the child's capacity for effective action. As a consequence, in play a child is
always above his daily behaviour; in play "it is as though he were a head
taller than himself." During this period, children's thinking varies
tremendously. For some experts, this unevenness can be explained by differences
in children's familiarity with specific task settings. Biologically oriented
theorists argue that changes in the brain's structure constitute the major
cause of unevenness in preschool thought. At the start of the preschool period,
the brain has achieved 50 per cent of its adult weight. By the age of six, the
brain will have grown to 90 per cent of its adult weight. Within this overall
process of growth, myelination -- the process by which neurons become covered
by myelin, is a sheath of fatty cells that stabilises the neurons -- appears to
play a particularly important role in preschoolers' cognitive development.<p>
<p>
This rapidly accumulating knowledge base into the workings of a young child's
mind is only relevant if it informs and guides the practice of teaching. The
artificial dichotomy between spontaneous constructed learning and
school-related learning is reflected in arguments over child-initiated versus
teacher-directed instruction. The fact is that children construct important
learning, particularly physical and logical-mathematical knowledge, through
child-initiated, spontaneous activity. But they also learn a great deal from
adults. As suggested by research and confirmed through practice, successful
early child development programmes must be organised around a set of learning
principles. A growing body of data supports a child-centred approach that
recognises children at various levels of development.<sup>29</sup> Activities
should be provided that encourage opportunities for independent problem
solving, meaningful child-initiated conversations with peers and adults, and
ample time for exploration of the environment. Within this general approach,
the specific content of activities must emerge from, support, and reinforce the
values of a given cultural setting. The activities must respond to the
strengths and limitations of a particular group of learners. The following
information summarises basic assumptions about interactive learning and
teaching that inform the perspective assumed within this document. These basic
principles include:<p>
<i>1. Children construct knowledge.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>2. Children learn through social interaction with adults and other
children.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>3. Children's learning reflects a recurring cycle that begins in awareness
and moves on to exploration, to inquiry, and finally to utilisation.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>4. Children learn through play.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>5. Children's interests and "need to know" motivate learning.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>6. Child development and learning are characterised by individual
variation.</i><p>
<p>
The period of early childhood ends at the age of six or seven years, when
children pass through the next bio-behavioural shift and assume the
accompanying social roles and demands. Generally by this age, children's brains
have achieved a level of complexity similar to adults. It is the age of formal
schooling, and children also gather with friends and peers beyond the family.
Developments in early childhood provide the essential preparation for the new
demands and opportunities to come. <p>
<b>Fundamentals of Early Learning: The Basic Building
Blocks</b><sup>29</sup><br><br><br><b>Children construct knowledge.</b> A
child's mind is not a miniature model of an adult's, nor is it an empty vessel
that gradually fills with information. From infancy, children are mentally and
physically active, struggling to make sense of the world. Children construct
their own knowledge through repeated experiences involving interaction with
people and materials. The child's active experimentation is analogous to
spontaneous research; in a sense, the child discovers knowledge. Central to
experimentation is making "constructive errors" that are necessary to mental
development. We know that children construct knowledge because they possess so
many ideas that adults do not teach them. Children need to form their own
hypotheses and keep trying them out through mental actions and physical
manipulations -- observing what happens, comparing their findings, asking
questions, and discovering answers. When objects and events resist the working
model that the child has mentally constructed, he or she is forced to adjust
the model or alter the mental structures to account for the new information.
Throughout childhood, these mental structures are continually reshaped,
expanded, and reorganised by new experiences.<br><br><b>Children learn through
social interaction with adults and other children.</b> The healthy development
of young children begins in a relationship with another human being, the
parent-child relationship being the primary example of social interaction
through which very young children develop and learn. It is well recognised that
disruptions in early attachments often lead to general social and emotional
difficulties. However, the importance of social relationships to cognitive
development should not be underestimated. For example, language development is
fundamental to learning and language development requires social interaction.
The development of higher order mental functions, such as conceptualisation,
begins in social interaction and then is internalised psychologically. Most
adults can think of situations where they did not really understand something
until after they had discussed it with several people. At other times, we find
that we really do not own a concept until we have articulated it to someone
else. This kind of learning through social interaction is important throughout
life, but essential for children who need to test the mental hypotheses they
construct against the thinking of other people. The role of adults is vital to
support children's development, both in terms of their actual development and
their potential. The principle of learning is that children can do things first
in a supportive context and then later independently and in a variety of
contexts. The support of adults and more competent peers provides the necessary
assistance or "scaffold" that enables the child to move to the next level of
independent functioning. The caregivers' role is one of supporting, guiding,
and facilitating development and learning, as opposed to the traditional view
of teaching as transmission of knowledge. Social interaction is necessary for
intellectual development, but it is also necessary for children to develop
social competence and self-esteem. Social interactions calls for reciprocity,
mutual respect, and cooperation; that is, the adjustment of individual
differences in beliefs, ideas, perspective and intentions to create mutually
acceptable rules and conventions. All these capabilities are related to primary
school success.<br><br><b>Children's learning reflects a recurring cycle that
begins in awareness, and moves to exploration, to inquiry, and finally, to
utilisation.</b> Any new learning by children follows a relatively predictable
pattern or cycle. To learn anything new, we must first become aware of the
phenomenon. Awareness is generated from experience. Children can only become
interested in objects, events, or people if they are aware that they exist and
have had some experience with them. The next step in the cycle of learning is
exploration. If children are really to know about and understand something,
they must explore it. Exploration is the process of figuring out the components
of what is being learned, by whatever means possible, usually employing the
various senses (seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, and tasting). Children
must have direct, hands-on experience with the content in order to make it
personally meaningful. This meaning will be governed by their own rules and
views of the world, but it is an important step toward true understanding.
Awareness and exploration are essential to the learning process, but more is
needed for complete understanding. Children's own rule systems must eventually
be adapted to conform to the conventional rule systems of society. <br><p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Fundamentals of Early Learning</b> <i>(continued)</i><br><br>Inquiry is the
process whereby children analyse and compare their own behaviors or concepts to
what is observed in society and make closer approximations to the conventional
patterns of the culture. The final aspect of the cycle of learning is
utilisation, where children are able to use what they have learnt for multiple
purposes and apply their learning to new situations. When children have
opportunities to become aware and develop interest, explore and inquire,
learning becomes functional. The cycle of learning from awareness, to
exploration, to inquiry, to utilisation is not linear. For example, children
may explore and inquire simultaneously. Furthermore, this cycle recurs as
children's learning becomes more elaborated and refined. Children learn by
doing, touching, experimenting, choosing, talking and negotiating. Active
manipulation of the environment is essential for children to construct
knowledge. Children's actions relate to objects, events, and people, and their
thinking about the consequences of their knowledge, reasoning, and
understanding about their experiences. In learning, there is inevitably an
interaction, and what a child learns is always a product of experience that is
itself conditioned by his or her level of cognitive
development.<br><br><b>Children learn through play.</b> The various kinds of
play by young children are effective vehicles for promoting learning.
Children's spontaneous play provides opportunities for exploration,
experimentation, and manipulation that are essential for constructing
knowledge. Play contributes to the development of representational thought. A
child expresses and represents his or her ideas, thoughts, and feelings when
engaged in symbolic play. During play a child learns to deal with feelings, to
interact with others, to resolve conflicts, and to gain a sense of competence.
Perhaps most important, it is through play that children develop their
imaginations and creativity. Children's play also provides opportunities for
children to practise spontaneously in a variety of situations the newly
acquired skill or knowledge. This self-initiated practice is part of the
process of inquiry; during play, children examine and refine their learning in
light of the feedback they receive from the environment and other people.
Children are naturally interested in participating in activities that
strengthen their skills and deepen their understanding of
concepts.<br><br><b>Children's interests and "need to know" motivate
learning.</b> Children have an inherent need or "inner push" to exercise their
emerging mental abilities and to make sense of their experiences. Parents and
teachers need to identify content that intrigues children and arouses in them a
need and desire to figure something out. In short, caregivers and teachers
create awareness and foster interest in children by planning the environments
and introducing new and stimulating objects, people, and experiences.
Activities that are based on children's interests provide intrinsic motivation
for learning. Children then demonstrate initiative, the quality of undertaking,
planning and attacking a task. Activities that are based on children's
interests and internal motivation to understand fosters desirable dispositions
and feelings, such as initiative, curiosity, attention, self-direction,
industry, competence, and love of learning.<br><br><b>Child development and
learning are characterised by individual variation.</b> Each of the foregoing
principles about learning begins with the word children, as though
generalisations about children apply equally to all. No discussion, however
brief, of human development and learning is complete without attention to the
principle of human variation. The fact is that every generalisation about
development and leaning carries a caveat: A wide range of individual variation
is normal and to be expected. Each human being has an individual pattern and
timing of growth and development as well as individual styles of learning.
Personal family experiences and cultural backgrounds also vary. Recognition
that individual variation is not only normal but valuable requires that
decisions about programmes and assessment be as individualised as possible.

<b>The Forgotten Period: Middle Childhood And Adolescence</b><p>
<p>
The middle childhood period, once thought to be relatively unimportant compared
to early childhood and adolescence, is now recognised as a time of significant
intellectual, social, emotional, and moral growth. Between the ages of six and
twelve, children develop logical and sophisticated thinking, problem-solving,
and communication skills. They become less self-centred and more interested in
forming and maintaining friendships with other children. They further develop
the ability to empathise and take another person's perspective, and they are
increasingly sensitive to other people's views. Their widening social contacts
and experiences provide them with opportunities to compare themselves to
others, and they begin to establish their own identity and to develop their own
ways of presenting themselves and relating to others.<sup>30</sup><p>
<p>
During middle childhood, children acquire a greater capacity for self-control
and exhibit more independence. They begin to internalise moral rules of
behaviour, show signs of having a conscience, and feel guilt when they
disappoint or adversely affect others.<sup>31</sup> They also develop personal
attitudes and behaviours that can significantly influence their later health
and well-being.<sup>32</sup>  Although the rate of physical growth is not as
rapid in middle childhood as in early childhood, it is during this period that
many children enter puberty.<p>
<p>
Children's worlds expand beyond their families during this period, as they
participate actively in school, in their neighbourhood, and in the larger
community. Parents remain their first and most important teachers, yet parents'
interactions with children tend to decline markedly in the middle childhood
years. School experiences are especially important. In school, children acquire
basic reading, writing, and mathematics skills; they interact with classmates,
and they learn how to be responsible members of a group. Success or failure in
school and relationships with peers influence children's attitudes toward
education and learning as well as how they view themselves.<p>
<p>
Adolescence, covering the period between 13 and 18 years of age, marks the
critical passage from childhood to adulthood. During the teenage years, young
people begin to separate from their families, align themselves with peers, make
decisions on their own, develop intimate relationships, and experience feelings
of sexuality. As young people learn to connect future consequences with present
action, most experiment with behaviours they believe are part of adulthood. As
they strive to become adults, many feel as if they are invincible or immune
from harm. Feelings of invulnerability and a propensity for risk taking are
healthy and normal for most adolescents. Yet without consistent and caring
adult guidance and monitoring, some young people are vulnerable to excessive
behaviour and mistakes that can harm their own health and development, their
families, and their communities.<p>
<p>
Adolescence is also marked by a desire for competence and achievement. Young
people naturally seek ways to establish their own identities, often through
strong commitments to others, to ideas and social causes, and to work or
desired vocations. They need positive adult role models and adult guidance and
encouragement. They also need opportunities to achieve and excel in school, in
extracurricular activities, in their homes and communities and in employment
and training. Without positive relationships with caring adults and
opportunities for constructive, enjoyable, and fulfilling activities, many
adolescents are vulnerable to negative influences.<p>
<p>
Adolescents rely less on their parents for information and protection, but
continue to seek their parents' guidance on matters related to moral and social
values, vocational choices, and educational plans. The nature of parents'
interactions with adolescents, the extent of parental monitoring, and the way
decisions affecting adolescents are made within families have enormous impact
on adolescents' attitudes and behaviours as well as on their performance in
school. Adolescence are more likely to succeed in school and avoid delinquent
or deviant behaviour, to act more responsibly, and to have higher self-esteem
when their parents are warm and accepting, establish and maintain clear rules
and standards of behaviour and are willing to discuss or negotiate family rules
and their enforcement. When parents are overly permissive and willing to grant
them too much autonomy, adolescents are more likely to perform poorly in school
and to become involved in high-risk behaviours. Conversely, when parents fail
to temper strictness with warmth and a willingness to discuss and negotiate
rules, their adolescent children are more likely to have lower self-esteem and
lower levels of school performance.<p>
<p>
In deprived environments, particularly characteristic of the urban poor,
adolescence represents a critical period as many young people are in jeopardy
of serious, long-term consequences stemming from risk-taking behaviour. More
often than not at-risk young people are isolated from families, schools and
communities. They may have dropped out of school, they may have committed
delinquent offenses, they may use drugs and alcohol, or they may engage in
early, unprotected sexual activity. Some have already experienced pregnancies
or contracted sexually transmitted diseases. Most of these at-risk young people
are engaged in several high-risk behaviours that threaten their health and
development. These behaviours and the corresponding problems are often
considered separately from one another. Social programmes to prevent and remedy
them are frequently unrelated. In reality, however, they are mutually
interactive and reinforcing. Without comprehensive programmes that
simultaneously address the interacting behaviours, many of these at risk
adolescents will become helpless, homeless, and hungry adults; contributing
only to the continuing cycle of misery and despair.<sup>33</sup><p>
<p>
<p>
<b>B.  VULNERABILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES</b><p>
<p>
<b>Interactive Model Of Development</b><p>
<p>
Years of scientific research and programmatic experience confirm what may seem
self-evident: that there are clearly identified factors that encourage and
support healthy development and equally clear factors that place children at
immediate or long-term risk. Over the past 20 years, scientific knowledge about
how vulnerability and resiliency in childhood are related to adult outcomes has
expanded rapidly. Research confirms that with the exception of severe damage in
the central nervous system, no single risk factor leads irrevocably to adverse
outcomes. Moreover, equally clear is the recognition that a chain of protective
factors, linked across time, can afford vulnerable children an escape from
adversity.<sup>34</sup><p>
<p>
This perspective underscores the need for <i>interactive models</i> of
development. In these models, the context-specific organisation of the child's
environment is constantly interacting with the biological properties of the
child. Appreciating the immense variation of these two diverse sources, one
from the social world of human existence and one from biology, we can begin to
understand the range and variability in behaviour. In this ecological view of
development, the child's environment consists of four interrelated layers: the
nuclear and extended family; the immediate community of peers and neighbours;
the institutional community of schools and other social service facilities; and
a cultural ethos consisting of values, beliefs, and rituals. Development is
conditioned by the frequency and complexity of interactions within each one of
these systems.<sup>35</sup>  For example, cognitive and social development seem
to be most affected by factors of the home environment, including the
caregivers' self-image, self-esteem, confidence and emotional responsiveness;
the restrictions and types of discipline imposed on the child; and the child's
opportunities for exploratory play and appropriate play materials. Factors in
the immediate community impacting on the child's development may consist of
community attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions regarding the ideal child and
child-rearing patterns that foster such development.<p>
<p>
<b>Protective Factors</b><p>
<p>
Until recently, emphasis was placed on identifying and overcoming deficiencies
of the "deprived" environments that characterised the rural and urban poor.
Disadvantaged environments have been thought to lack the necessary variety and
quality of human interactions as well as the necessary objects and events. For
example, in early childhood, poor verbal interaction and the absence of toys
were frequently cited as detrimental to a child's language abilities and visual
discrimination. More recently, however, the features  of environments of
children living in poverty which are capable of fostering and promoting early
development have been appreciated. Such strengths include, for instance:<p>
<p>
<i>&#149; Opportunities for play with peers and older children with minimal
adult interference enhancing the development of self-reliance, self-control,
cooperation, empathy and sense of belonging;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>&#149; Exposure to multiple teaching styles, with emphasis on modelling,
observation and imitation;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>&#149; Presence of a rich cultural tradition of games, toys, songs, and
stories that provide a culture-specific context for language acquisition.</i><p>
<p>
It is increasingly recognised that within the so-called "deprived
environments", children learn a different set of skills that are functional in
their home environments but that may not be valued by formal institutions such
as the school system. In the design of culturally appropriate, community-based
early intervention programmes, it is critical, therefore, to explore, mobilise,
and build on these inherent strengths. Recognising the  strengths within
"deprived environments", sheds light on the factors giving rise to
"invulnerable" or stress-resistant children.<sup>36</sup>  Researchers
attempting to understand "invulnerable" children have proposed three categories
of protective factors, which include (1) personality characteristics of the
child; (2) a supportive, stable, and cohesive family unit; and (3) external
support systems that enhance coping skills and project positive
values.<sup>37</sup><p>
<p>
Recently, investigators have identified the child's sense of self as a key
determinant of successful outcomes.<sup>38, 39</sup>  It is suggested that
children with positive feelings of self-esteem, mastery, and control can more
easily negotiate stressful experiences. These children in turn elicit more
positive experiences from their environment. They show initiative in task
accomplishment and relationship formation. Even in stressed families, the
presence of one good relationship with a parent reduces psychological risk for
children. For older children, the presence of a close, enduring relationship
with an external support figure may likewise provide a protective function. A
child with a positive self-concept seeks, establishes, and maintains the kinds
of supportive relationships and experiences that promote successful outcomes.
These successes enhance the child's self-esteem and sense of mastery, which
leads to further positive experiences and relationships. The cycle of success
can be as self-perpetuating as the cycle of failure.<p>
<p>
In spite of these strengths, it is clear that the developmental costs of
poverty are high and that poverty is a risk factor for negative developmental
outcomes. Children in poverty are exposed more frequently to a clustering of
risk factors such as; illnesses, poor nutrition, family stress, low education
levels, inadequate social-service support, and non-stimulating social
environments. The costs can be measured in terms of school drop-out,
unemployment, delinquency, and the inter-generational perpetuation of failure
and poverty.<p>
<p>
These stress factors additionally or "synergistically" interact with the
child's inherent strengths and vulnerabilities to shape outcomes. A
transactional model developed by Sameroff and Chandler has become widely used
to help define developmental outcomes.<sup>40</sup> According to this
interactive model of development, outcomes can only be interpreted by
considering the transaction between the content of the child's behaviour and
the context in which the behaviours are manifested. Characteristics of the
child shape his or her response to the environment. These interactions in turn
transform environmental responsiveness. Just as the child is shaped by the
environment, so is the environment modified by the child. The child brings a
host of attributes to the interaction, including health and nutritional status;
temperament; and cognitive, language, and social skills. The environment in
turn brings specific attributes. In an environment of poverty, more risk
factors are likely to be present. While adding considerable complexity to the
factors affecting developmental outcomes, such a model also suggests an
opportunity for practical interventions. Change in any aspect of one of the
child's differing environments can create positive transformations in
another.<p>
<p>
In summary, development is a cumulative process of growth and change that
begins before birth and continues into adulthood. Through the complex
interaction of biological characteristics and experience, children become
adults. At each stage of development there are opportunities to improve the
chances that children will grow into healthy, literate, secure, and productive
adults. There are also vulnerabilities that, left unaddressed, will almost
surely have lasting negative effects. Researchers and practitioners from
different disciplines and parts of the world have learned that there are many
avenues for overcoming the risks that threaten children's development. Reducing
the likelihood of biological impairment, which is often the result of problems
in pregnancy and poor birth outcomes, will make a substantial difference, as
will helping disadvantaged, isolated, and highly stressed parents manage their
daily lives and learn how to nurture and care for their children. Taking steps
to ensure that young children come to school ready to learn and that they and
their families have access to quality schooling, health care, and social
services will further improve the life chances of many vulnerable children.
Creating a social context in which all children have meaningful opportunities
and can develop a sense of hope for their futures is perhaps the most essential
factor.  <p>
<p>
The challenge is not simply to reduce the risk factors that threaten children's
futures but to overcome them by identifying and building on the protective
factors that exist naturally in children's environment and by providing support
when they are absent. Because children, parents, families, and communities
differ, some children will inevitably need more intensive help than others.
Groups requiring focused energies and interventions include children,
particularly the girl child, growing up in environments of extreme poverty;
children raised in isolated single-parent families; children of adolescent
mothers whose own developmental needs are largely unaddressed; children whose
disabilities and behavioural problems make it difficult for them to relate to
others and perform in school; and children whose development is severely
threatened by the ravages of war, political conflict, and rapidly changing
social and economic conditions.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The children who manage to thrive in spite of the harshness of the environment
that surrounds them have much to teach. From them the essence of life's
fundamental ingredients are brought to light. They remind us that competence,
confidence, and caring can flourish even under adversity, if children develop
secure bonds with caring adults, if their basic needs are met, and if they have
opportunities to develop essential knowledge, skills, and values. They also
teach that while missed opportunities early in life are more difficult to
recapture, it is never too late to try. <p>
<p>
Thus, in bringing this theoretical discussion to a close, it is perhaps useful
to conclude with the insight of a proverb, "As the twig is bent, so grows the
tree." If forces in the environment bend a sapling long enough, the tree may
become so bent that its leaves cannot receive the sun's light, and it will not
flower and reproduce. Yet if the forces bending the tree cease or if a gardener
stakes the tree upright, the only lasting effect may be a slight bend in the
trunk. The tree will prosper and make a genuine contribution to its
environment.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>C.  PRINCIPLES FOR ACTION</b><p>
<p>
Policy must be based on a set of guiding principles regarding children's basic
needs, parents' roles and responsibilities and society's obligations. Failure
to articulate values conveys mixed messages and results in negative practices
with the potential to harm children and weaken families. An absence of
principles for action constrains one's ability to measure success and
understand failures. Accordingly, the following principles, which support and
complement those put forth in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, must
form the foundation for continued action to improve the lives of children and
their families.<sup>41</sup> <p>

<b><i>1.  Every child should have the opportunity to develop to his or her full potential. </i></b> 

<p>
The art of living is learned in childhood. Child development is a cumulative
process of physical, social, emotional, intellectual and moral growth that
begins before birth and continues into adulthood. Through a sequence of
progressively more complex interactions, children develop the capacity to
explore, understand, and influence their world. They develop competence and
character through trusting personal relationships first with parents and later
with siblings, other adults and peers. For children to develop, their
fundamental needs must be met, including care and attention from a consistent
loving caregiver, good nutrition, basic health care, a quality education,
adequate housing, and a safe community. When these essential needs are not
fulfilled, children are denied a solid foundation for achieving their
potential. Children who experience poverty, discrimination, neglect, or abuse
often fail to receive the care and nurturing that support healthy development.
The girl child is particularly vulnerable, as gender-related disparities in the
early years work against girls' development and educational opportunities. When
children, both boys and girls, are deprived of their health and safety and of
the opportunity to acquire critical knowledge and skills, cultivate values, and
nurture bold aspirations, their futures are unjustly placed in jeopardy.<p>


<b><i>
2.  Parents bear the primary responsibility for meeting their children's physical,    
emotional, and intellectual needs and for providing moral guidance and direction.     
Parents must be supported in their child-rearing roles, to enable them to fulfill     
their obligation, and to hold them responsible for the care and support of their      
children.                                                                             

</i></b>
<p>
Parents are the children's first and most important caregivers, teachers, and
providers. Parenthood, while deeply rewarding, is at the same time a serious
responsibility. Those who bear children must be prepared to support them and
care for them until they reach adulthood. However, parents do not stand alone.
Parents are increasingly vulnerable to social, economic, and technological
pressures. As a result, they have little control over factors that directly and
indirectly affect the health and well-being of their children. Parents who feel
secure, supported, and valued, are more effective than those who feel helpless
and insignificant. <p>
<p>
Policies and programmes must help eliminate the barriers that impede parents'
ability to function effectively. Parenting is not solely a women's issue. Over
the past generation, women's rate of participation in formal sector activities
has and will continue to increase. Efforts to strengthen families and improve
the lives of children must recognise these recent socio-culturally shifts.
Opportunities for personal growth and development should be equally available
to men and women, and privileges and responsibilities of parenthood should be
equally distributed. <p>
<p>


<b><i>
3.  The family is and should remain the primary institution for supporting the        
growth and development of children.                                                   
</i></b>
<p>
The dramatic social, economic, and demographic changes of the past two decades
have revolutionised the forms and functions of families. While many values
related to family life are called into question, the family remains the supreme
institution for providing children with a sense of identity. The family in all
its various forms and functions is mankind's basic social unit. Societies are
in jeopardy when their families are weak and ineffective. A renewed commitment
to the family must recognise the changes that have taken place in individual
lives, in families, and in the communities. Change has been so rapid in the
last several decades, many laws and policies have failed to keep apace. If the
goal of a renewed commitment to children and families is to be realised,
national policies and legislation must accommodate and support changing family
structures and patterns. <p>
<p>
<b><i>
4.  Cultural diversity is a great resource that must be respected and preserved,      
while at the same time it must ensure that all children have an equal opportunity     
to enter the social and economic mainstream.                                          
</i></b>
<p>
Children need a cultural identity, a sense of who they are, and a sense of
pride in their cultural heritage. Social institutions must recognise and
respect parents' and children's cultural differences, Without such respect,
children and families are denigrated and expected to fail. The doors of
opportunity must be open to all.<p>
<p>


<b><i>5.  Community institutions, schools, religious organisations, health and service      
organisations, NGOs and employers have an important role in creating an environment   
that is supportive of parents and children. </i></b>                                          

<p>
While raising children is a personal responsibility, it is also a social
imperative. Responsible child-rearing should be actively supported by community
institutions, by employers, and by social and family laws and policy. Families
are not self-contained and self-sufficient units. They all need help in the
form of employment, health services, social support, and education. Community
institutions can contribute to the quality of family life by supporting parents
in their child-rearing roles. When teachers work together with parents,
children's school performance is enhanced. When employers adopt family-oriented
policies, employed parents are more effective at home and work. Traditionally,
communities have been a source of informal support. For many families,
community cohesion has been displaced by isolation and anonymity. Social
isolation cuts across class lines, but is often most pronounced in
overstressed, poor communities with depleted financial and human resources.
Rekindling a sense of community and reinvigorating informal systems of support
should figure prominently in the design of social policies and programmes. <p>
<p>
<b><i>
6.  Communities have a responsibility to provide safe, secure environments for        
families with children.                                                               
</i></b>
<p>
To grow and develop, children need order. They need safe homes and communities
free of war, violence, and poverty. They need to feel confident that the adults
in their families and their communities will protect them. Physical safety and
psychological security are essential to children's health, education, and
overall development. When experiences teach them that they cannot depend on the
adults in their lives, children often grow hostile, distrustful, and angry. In
failing to insulate them from crime and violence, the futures of millions of
young children are jeopardised.<p>
<b><i>
7.  Society has a legitimate and moral obligation to intervene whenever parents who   
fail to meet their responsibilities place their children at risk.                     

</i></b>
<p>
Society's primary goal is to support and strengthen families. Thus, laws and
policies should be designed to maintain family authority and integrity. When
families are so damaged that children's health and safety are in danger,
society must intervene. Through both individual and collective efforts, society
must ensure that children's basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter and
affection are met when families are unable to do so. Societies must protect
children who are at serious risk of physical or psychological harm from factors
both within and outside the family unit. Children in the care of institutions
are no less in need of consistent care and one-to-one attention than children
living in families. <p>
<p>
<b><i>
8.  Prevention is the most effective and cost-effective way to address the needs of   
troubled families and vulnerable children.                                            
</i></b>
<p>
Nations cannot afford the staggering human and financial costs of children and
families in crisis. The warning signs are all too familiar -- poverty,
single-parent families, poor health, lack of education, inadequate housing,
unsafe neighbourhoods, and lack of social support. These problems must be
addressed before they cripple families and irreparably damage children. It is
increasingly evident that early intervention is both more economical and
effective. Early interventions present the problem common to all investments,
namely, that the dividends are not visible until years or even decades later.
However, as more preventive supports become available, fewer children will
reach adulthood unhealthy, lacking basic literacy and job skills, committing
violent crimes, and bearing children before they are ready and able to care for
them. More of today's children will become reasonable and productive adults,
able to form strong, stable families and contribute to their communities.<p>
<p>
In preventive interventions, symptoms must be clearly distinguished from
causes. Most conceptual frameworks have focused on symptoms and in many cases
not very early or very well. Programmes ameliorating the problems of troubled
families and children are critical in the short run. Yet, we can no longer
continue our present strategy, confronting problems only when they are too
mammoth to ignore. This causes needless pain and suffering for too many
children and families and uses scarce resources inefficiently. Left as it is,
the present system will continue to produce victims faster than they can be
saved. The wave of seriously troubled families must be reversed by redressing
the imbalance between the amount of energy and financial resources directed to
treatment and the amount that goes to prevention. Nations are being challenged
to discover ways to prevent harm before it occurs while at the same time
dealing humanely with current pain and suffering.<p>
<p>
<b><i>
9.  To address the needs of children and families, a significant and sustained        
commitment of time, leadership, and financial resources is required.                  
</i></b>

<p>
There are no quick and simple solutions. Success will depend on the vision, the
sustained effort, and a determination to commit the necessary resources.
Leaders from both the public and the private sectors cannot be comforted by
short-term solutions. Rather, members of business, labour, and the volunteer
associations must use their influence and authority to establish new
directions, to communicate the need to act, and to create positive but
realistic expectations. <p>
<p>
Reviewing the insights gained from past efforts, the following section presents
an expanded framework for action in the design, development, and implementation
of a range of interventions focused specifically on the needs of families with
young children. The foregone discussion of basic principles forms the
cornerstone of this proposed strategy.<p>
<b>IV  A PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>A.  A RANGE OF PROGRAMMING APPROACHES</b><p>
<p>
Programme experience has grown appreciably in recent years, providing a wide
range of examples and insights to be drawn upon in future programming efforts.
In an attempt to counter the narrow, "institutional", often expensive, and
age-restricted image associated with preschool programmes, a typology of seven
complementary programme approaches to early childhood development has been
developed. These include the following;<p>
<p>
<b>1. Educating caregivers.</b> This approach is intended to educate and
empower parents and alternative caregivers in ways that improve their care and
interaction with the child and enrich the immediate environment.<p>
<p>
<b>2. Promoting community development.</b> This strategy stresses community
initiatives, organisations, and participation in a range of interrelated
activities to improve the physical environment, the knowledge and practices of
community members, and the organisational base. It allows common action and
improves the base for political and social negotiations. Although not
necessarily focused on the needs of children, this approach has proven to be a
useful strategy to which early childhood development initiatives can be
linked.<p>
<p>
<b>3. Delivering a service.</b> The overall goal of this direct approach is to
enhance child development by attending to the immediate needs of children in
centres organised outside the home. These are, in a sense, <i>substitute</i> or
<i>alternative</i> environments to the home.<p>
<p>
<b>4. Strengthening national resources and capacities.</b> The institutions
responsible for implementing programmes require financial, material, and human
resources with a capacity for the planning, organisation, and implementation of
innovative techniques and models.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>5. Strengthening demand and awareness.</b> This programme approach
concentrates on the production and distribution of knowledge in order to create
awareness and demand. It may function at the level of policy makers and
planners, or it can directed to the general public by changing the cultural
environment that affects children's development.<p>
<p>
<b>6. Developing national child care and family policies.</b> Family policies
supportive of women and children can include providing parents with increased
time to meet their child-rearing and child-care responsibilities, taking
measures to encourage increased possibilities for child care by grandparents or
other adult family members, and providing parents with cash benefits or tax
credits to assist them in meeting the costs of child-rearing and child care.
Private sector or cooperative initiatives, and innovative joint
public/private-sector arrangements can be explored as potential means of
financing these alternatives. Tax or other incentives can also help to
encourage family-sensitive employment practices among the rapidly growing
formal or quasi-formal private-sector enterprises and export-oriented
industries. <p>
<p>
<b>7. Develop supportive legal and regulatory frameworks.</b> A potentially
critical strategy is to develop supportive legal frameworks to increase
awareness of rights and legal resources among both women and children and to
move towards more effective use of legislation and improved compliance. This
includes better monitoring and enforcement of labour legislation and
regulations to protect both working children and working women with infants and
young children; policy and legislative or regulatory reform to encourage, where
appropriate, suitable day-care facilities at or near women's workplaces; and
utilisation of regulatory controls provided in ILO conventions and of
recommended mechanisms to extend the scope and raise the standards of
protective measures that favour working mothers with young children. These
include, for example, maternity protection, maternal leave and benefits, and
appropriate support to breastfeeding mothers during the first four to six
months following birth.<p>
<p>
<p>
Although all of these seven approaches are intended to enhance early child
development, each has different immediate objectives and is directed towards a
different audience or group of participants. The table below summarises the
beneficiaries, objectives, and illustrative models for each approach.<p>

Any comprehensive plan for enhancing child development must pay attention to
all seven of the approaches set out in this table. The emphasis given to any
single approach within the overall strategy will, of course, vary considerably
depending on the conditions of the setting in which the programme is being
developed. In spite of various approaches, the main goal of early childhood
education and development programmes is to enhance the competence of children
to adjust to, perform in, and transform their own surroundings. In some
cultures, this means greater emphasis on group solidarity. The ultimate outcome
for all programmes, however, is to enhance the child's physical, intellectual
and social development.<p>
<p>
Three sets of considerations are helpful in overcoming the piecemeal approach
that has unfortunately dominated policy in the past. The first set of
considerations has just been described: the complementary approaches outlined
in the table above. A second set of considerations consists of guidelines
indicating that programmes should be comprehensive (able to deal with a full
range of health and developmental needs); participatory and community-based;
flexible and adjusted to different socio-cultural contexts; supportive of and
built upon local ways that have been devised to cope effectively with problems
of child care and development; financially feasible and cost-effective; and
capable of reaching the largest possible number of at-risk children. The third
set of considerations relates to a programme's ability to target specific
age-groups with developmentally appropriate interventions. Thus, the tendency
to restrict programming for child development to a particular age-group is
counteracted by the need for programmes to cover the prenatal period and the
early childhood period, which extends from approximately age three to age six
and includes the critical transition from home to school.<sup>**</sup><p>
<p>
<b>B.  THE CHALLENGE OF PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION</b><p>
<p>
Programming success in early child development activities is consistently
characterised by a well-defined set of variables that recognise the
simultaneous nature of survival and development, and the interaction among the
child's physical, mental, social, and emotional capabilities. Another
characteristic defining success is the emphasis placed upon empowering
caregivers and communities with the knowledge and skills needed to provide for
the health, nutrition, and developmental needs for their children. Successful
programmes recognise that the primary responsibility for the child rests within
the home and all efforts to foster development must support, complement, and
reinforce the child-rearing responsibilities of the family. Sustainable
programmes are able to identify local patterns and practices of child-rearing
that for generations have provided culturally appropriate solutions. Once
identified, this knowledge is used to inform the design of locally appropriate
programmes, integrating, when appropriate, new information and innovative
solutions. Successful programmes encourage a level of participation beyond the
formal definitions of community participation and include children as active
participants in the creation of their own knowledge. Moreover, the child's only
learning skills are not dependent on the utilisation of expensive equipment and
learning tools, but can be developed through the application of low-cost
materials combined with a caregiver exposed to a creative training curriculum
and motivated by an ongoing system of rewards and incentives. <p>
<p>
Case studies from China, Colombia, India, Kenya, Morocco, Nepal, and Venezuela
exemplify some of these principles. Based on past insights, the ongoing
challenges inherent in the design, implementation, and evaluation of early
childhood development initiatives are discussed in the following section. The
challenges of providing direct services to young children in formal or informal
centre-based programmes have been more thoroughly examined than many of the
other alternatives. The following discussion, therefore, reflects the bias
inherent in our knowledge base. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Increasing Programme Coverage</b><p>
<p>
One of the major issues challenging the implementation of early childhood
development programmes is the need to respond to the rapidly growing interest
in high-quality and affordable programmes that can reach a significant number
of children and families. As planners and practitioners become increasingly
frustrated with small-scale or pilot projects that have failed to have an
impact on policy and programming despite successful outcomes, the need to
understand the underlying mechanisms for mounting large-scale efforts is
critical.<p>
<p>
While the problems associated with the process of programme expansion are
varied and complex, they can be classified into five general categories: (1)
lack of adequate resources; (2) absence of political will; (3) weak demand for
services; (4) inefficient organisation, implementation, and management systems;
and (5) failure to adjust to varying local conditions. Child development
activities often suffer from unusually difficult constraints. For example,
child development projects and programmes vary widely, depending on social and
economic conditions, the mix of programme components, the age-group involved,
the institutional structure for planning and implementation, the degree of
community involvement, and the methods used to deliver the programme.  <p>
<p>
Programme expansion will be vastly different if a programme focuses on physical
development and on immunisation in a small country with a relatively high
literacy rate than if it attempts to build a sustained, community-based service
including health, nutrition, and psychosocial components in a large country
with a relatively low literacy rate. Thus, there is no one formula for
programming that is equally applicable in all locations. An additional set of
constraints in programme expansion stems from the fact that early childhood
education and development programmes, particularly those focusing on the child
under two years of age, do not require large investments in institutionalised
structures and are therefore less attractive to politicians than building
large-scale social service institutions.  <p>
<p>
Moreover, attention to the integrated needs of children crosses bureaucratic
lines rendering no one institution with specific programmatic responsibility or
commitment. More challenging than citing reasons for failure however, is the
systematic identification of components that account for a programme's
successful efforts to move to scale. Far too little energy has been devoted to
documenting solutions to the organisational, administrative, financial, and
management problems projects face as coverage rates are increased. Insights
into the process of programme expansion, nevertheless, are accumulating. Three
strategies for achieving scale have been distinguished: expansion, explosion,
and association. Scale through expansion begins with one model being tested,
adjusted, and then extended to other locations until the desired coverage has
been achieved.  <p>

MOROCCO: A Cr&egrave;che for Women Workers in Casablanca   Casablanca is the largest city    
in Morocco and the most powerful economic centre in the country.  Due to modern       
communication and transportation systems, Casablanca has developed rapidly and        
attracted new industries, commercial activities and investment. However, while        
Casablanca has succeeded in attracting profitable business, it has also attracted     
large numbers of migrants from the rural areas. Initially, this influx of             
population filled the huge demand for labour that had developed with the rapid        
growth of the city. Eventually, however, the demand for labour diminished, and        
unemployment brought increasing poverty and deprivation. While people coming from     
rural areas may have been equipped to provide for their basic needs, in the big       
city they found themselves virtually defenceless. Because of its size and             
anonymity, Casablanca has also attracted unwed mothers seeking to avoid the censure   
of cultural and religious traditions. In Morocco, as in the other nations of the      
Maghreb region, Islam is the religion of the State, and family law is regulated       
according to its principles. Marriage is the social institution that guarantees the   
continuity and order of the society. Therefore, according to Moroccan law,            
unmarried mothers and their children have no legal rights. Children of unwed          
mothers are not entitled to a father's surname, and if their mother is unknown they   
may carry no last name at all.   Terre des Hommes, a non-governmental organisation    
which has operated in Casablanca since 1983, has established some day-care            
centres/cr&egrave;ches for single or divorced mothers and widows with young children. The    
main objectives of the project are: (1) to prevent child abandonment;  (2) to allow   
children to benefit from appropriate care until reaching school age;  and (3) to      
allow mothers to work and improve their social and economic position. Admission to    
the centre is open to single mothers who receive no support from their families or    
who do not have sufficient income or material resources to support their children;    
mothers who have a permanent home;  working mothers who have a regular                
income-generating activity; and women willing to use appropriate contraceptive        
methods.  It is obvious that most mothers who go to the centre for the first time     
do not comply with all the above requirements. The first visit to the centre is       
meant to help the mothers regain their self-confidence and encourage the belief       
that, in spite of their difficult position, they can keep their children and care     
for them. Women are encouraged and supported in their search for a safe place to      
live in the city and a stable job. Their children, in turn, are admitted to one of    
the sections of the centre according to their age and level of psychomotor            
development. The day-care centre in Casablanca serves children from birth to seven    
years of age. The centre includes a baby ward (0-18 months) for 15 children, an       
infant ward (18 months to three years) for 20 children, and two children's wards      
(three to five and six to seven years) for 50 children. Activities at the centre      
are aimed at enhancing the psycho-social and motor development of children. They      
are observed closely and games are adapted to their age. For children over six        
years, most activities are especially designed to give them the necessary tools to    
start primary school. Three meals are given to children daily. Since the majority     
of the mothers lack sufficient means and time to prepare meals, children's            
essential nutritional needs are mostly met at the centre. The centre also offers      
some services to the 70 mothers whose children attend the cr&egrave;che. For most of these   
women, the centre represents a quick stop on their daily way between work and home.   
However, all too often these women lead isolated lives both at home and at work. As   
a result, they express an enormous need to confide in someone, to talk about their    
problems, and to receive some support. Groups have been organised at the centre to    
provide support and basic training which may help women get better-paid jobs.   <p>      

INDIA: Integrated Child Development Services  The Integrated Child Development        
Services (ICDS), the largest programme of its kind, underscores the power of          
political commitment to achieve significant rates of coverage for children in need    
for services. Beginning in 1975 with 33 experimental projects, the programme has      
grown to over 2,063 projects reaching approximately 11.2 million children under six   
years of age. Creating, maintaining, and expanding the programme has been an          
extraordinary achievement.  The overall goals of the ICDS scheme are to provide a     
comprehensive range of basic services to children in an integrated manner; to         
create a mechanism at the village level through which the services can be             
delivered; and to give priority to India's low-income groups, including the           
under-privileged tribes and the scheduled castes. Specific beneficiaries include      
expectant and nursing mothers, other women aged 15-45 years, and children up to six   
years of age.  The specific objectives of the ICDS are to: &#149; Improve the              
nutritional and health status of children six years of age. &#149; Lay the foundations     
for the psychological, physical, and social development of the child. &#149; Reduce the    
incidence of mortality, morbidity, malnutrition, and school drop-out. &#149; Achieve       
effective coordination of policy and implementation among the various agencies and    
departments involved in child development. &#149; Enhance the capability of mothers to     
look after the health and nutritional needs of the child.  The ICDS package is        
provided through a network of anganwadi centres. Each centre is run by an anganwadi   
worker (AW) and a helper. The responsibilities of the AW include informal preschool   
education, supplementary feeding, health and nutrition education, parenting           
education through home visiting, community support and participation, and primary     
maternal and child health care. Supportive supervision and guidance is provided to    
the anganwadi worker by a supervisor, and a full-time child development project       
officer is directly responsible for the implementation and management of each ICDS    
project. The ICDS programme is a multidepartmental and intersectoral endeavour, and   
as such, utilises the existing services of governmental department and voluntary      
organisations. The overall financial administration of the programme lies with the    
Department of Women and Child Development, Ministry of Human Resource Development.    
Recognising the importance of training, the ministry has developed training           
protocols for the successful delivery of the ICDS package of services. The            
anganwadi is selected from the local village and undergoes a three-month intensive    
residential training course.   After more than a decade of experience characterised   
by the rapid expansion of services, the constraints inhibiting the programme's        
optimal functioning are fully recognised. The major areas requiring further           
attention include innovative strategies to reach mothers and children under age of    
three, enhanced programme integration at the operational level, increased community   
and parent participation, and the need to maintain quality in spite of rapid growth   
and inadequate financial resources. There is every reason to expect that the ICDS     
programme will continue to expand at a rapid rate, eventually achieving full, or      
nearly full, coverage of its target groups by the end of the century. Given the       
demands of this pace, however, there is also every reason to expect that challenges   
regarding integration, management, quality, community participation and coverage      
will persist. These constraints are fully recognised, and improvements are both       
feasible and likely to occur.

<p>
Expansion entails a "learning process approach" in which programme development
proceeds through three distinct stages. In the first stage, the major concern
is learning to be effective, while in the second stage, energy is focused on
learning to be efficient. The third stage is concerned with expanding the
organisational infrastructure needed to carry out the programme objectives. In
this model, the rate of expansion is governed largely by the availability of
organisational and institutional support. India's Integrated Child Development
Services (ICDS) school is an example of a programme that has achieved scale by
expansion. By way of contrast, increasing coverage through "explosion"
circumvents the pilot stage and implementation starts on a large scale usually
with one model serving many distinct geographic and cultural groups. This
approach is usually the outcome of a national political decision that is often
motivated by politicians' desire to attract broad political support. An example
of the "explosion" approach is the Bienestar programme in Colombia, in which
the same model is applied to all parts of the country, and maximum coverage in
the shortest period of time is the primary objective. <p>
<p>
In an association model, programme coverage is accomplished through
independently initiated or coordinated but distinct small-scale projects, each
of which responds to the needs of a given target population. In countries
characterised by a loose confederation of distinct cultural groups, achieving a
large-scale programme by association may be desirable, since it allows each
programme to respond and adjust to the particular needs of a homogeneous target
group. In this regard, scale, as suggested by Myers, can be thought of with a
puzzle image, in which various programme models, applied in different
locations, can add up to scale. Each piece may be a different shape depending
on the particular place it occupies within the larger puzzle. When all the
pieces are in place, a complete and integral picture will appear, and scale
will have been achieved.<p>
<p>
While such conceptual distinctions may blur in practice, analysing these three
approaches is useful because it forces planners to consider the various
elements and preconditions involved in the complex process of expanding
programme coverage. Interest in child development programmes is growing, simple
technologies are under way, and a wide range of alternative delivery systems
are being implemented. The systematic appraisal of present initiatives provides
a critical opportunity to plan for expansion, and in the process, it raises the
consciousness of both national governments and international organisations. Any
discussion of expanding the coverage of early childhood education and
development programmes necessarily raises a number of related issues, including
analysing costs and financing, creating political will, utilising the media,
achieving quality control, training personnel, and programme monitoring and
evaluation. The following discussion attempts to highlight some of the major
issues in each of these topics.<p>
<p>
<b>Analysing Costs </b><p>
<p>
The prospects for expanding the coverage of early childhood education and
development programmes are determined to a large degree by the availability of
financial resources.  This brief discussion, while not attempting to unravel
the complex web of issues, underscores the need to focus on the costs involved
in the provision of early child development services.  Cost analysis is often a
particularly weak element of the Early Child Development (ECD) policy analyses
and programme evaluations.<p>
<p>
It is no surprise that in these economically volatile times there is no easy
answer to how to mobilise resources for early child development activities. The
field of early child development is particularly vulnerable to the economic and
political forces at play, since children do not wield any political power.
Moreover, the services included in early childhood education and development
programmes cross many bureaucratic lines, and no one sector is held
responsible, which diffuses prospects for both financial and political support.
The processes by which financial decisions are reached by donors, governments,
and NGOs must be more deeply understood.  <p>
<p>
Unfortunately, by most economic forecasts, magical sources of revenue are not
likely to be discovered, and it is incumbent upon us all to look widely for
alternative sources.  At the level of the family, for example, there exists the
need to consider not only economic contributions but also time contributions by
mothers, fathers, and other caregivers in the provision of children's health,
nutrition, and education services. At the level of the community, potential
sources of revenue include the contribution of space, facilities, and provision
for safety and maintenance. Often untapped is the potential energy behind
community solidarity efforts, including family support networking and promotion
of traditional child-rearing patterns and practices. These less formal
variables, while difficult to measure, need to be considered simultaneously
with real resources at the household level. One must consider, however, the
degree to which these cost-sharing mechanisms are feasible, given the growing
demand for early preventive approaches and the need to increase the quality of
services.  <p>

CHINA: A Parental Education Initiative  A parental education initiative in the        
People's Republic of China places new emphasis on the family as an agency of          
socialisation and on the skills of parenting. Parents' schools have grown rapidly     
in China, at least in part because of concerns about how to deal with children in     
the one-child family. Most of the parent schools are attached to kindergarterns,      
primary or middle schools or hospitals. In addition, neighbourhood committees         
provide programmes for newlyweds or potential parents.  Existing service              
institutions collaborate in organising the parenting programmes, in part as a way     
of strengthening their own relationship with the parents. However, they are helped    
in their task by the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF), which takes a lead in       
mobilising communities to establish the parent programmes. Specialists or staff       
from the local institutions provide the lectures in a curriculum, which usually       
consists of between four and six classes spread over a term. Topics treated are       
determined by the findings of intersectoral groups brought together by the ACWF       
examine existing research, identify local resources, and define needs of parents      
and children. Thus, each curriculum is different, based on a local determination of   
needs. General materials are provided by the ACWF in support of these localised       
initiatives. In some cases, parent libraries have been set up in a special room       
within the primary school, in which parents can come to read and study between        
meetings. Participants are given a parenting education certificate if they have       
participated in all or most of the meetings.

<p>
In creating resources committed to financing early childhood education and
development programmes, NGOs are critical players and sometimes potential
funders of recurrent costs. The role of international donors also needs to be
reoriented towards a more flexible, sustained, action-based capacity-building
style of assistance, which most donors are ill-equipped to provide.
Collaboration among NGOs and international assistance agencies is required in
response to different financial requirements at different levels of project
development. For example, NGOS might play an important role in defining
effective implementation strategies, larger funders such as UNICEF could
support programmes in the process of learning to expand and become more
efficient, and the World Bank and other large donors might enter the process as
programmes struggle to expand. Such collaboration among agencies at different
stages of programme development could allow the various organisations to
contribute in a cumulative fashion to the process.<p>
<p>
Regarding the financing of a range of family support activities particularly
those for working parents with young children, it should not be assumed that
developing countries need to follow the predominant model adopted in
industrialised countries in which family-support measures are financed through
regular governmental programmes. The developing world is full of examples of
successful non-governmental initiatives in areas such as self-help housing,
rural credit, non-formal education, marketing cooperatives and micro-enterprise
development. There is no reason why these private-sector or cooperative
initiatives could not be better utilised to help meet the child care needs of
working parents through much the same combination of time allotments, financial
benefits, and service provision that characterises large public-sector
programmes in most industrialised countries. Innovative joint public/private
sector arrangements also need to be explored. The primary requirement is a
change of mentality to bring about greater recognition that supporting
parenting and child-rearing is decidedly good business, whether the "business"
is small-scale and informal or part of the larger, formal sectors of the
economy.<p>
<p>
Although public-sector budgets and enterprises are often hard-pressed to
provide family or employment-related benefits, there is an increasingly dynamic
formal or quasi-formal private sector emerging in those developing countries
that have been seeking to encourage private enterprise and export-oriented
industries. More concerted action on the part of political and labour
organisations, can help to prevent these enterprises from unduly profiting from
the relatively weak bargaining position of workers in these new industries,
many of whom are young women and sometimes children. As differences in
standards of labour practices exist in all sectors, sustained pressure, through
the mass media where possible, needs to be brought on those employers whose
practices do not meet minimum standards. Tax or other incentives can also help
to encourage better and more family-sensitive employment practices. <p>
<p>
In the search for financial partners, the need for clear and understandable
cost analysis becomes ever more critical. Initial assumptions about costs are
often overly optimistic and underestimate costs associated with the provision
of integrated child development services.  Very rarely are attempts made to
measure any benefits beyond a "head count" of beneficiaries. Awareness of costs
and benefits should be increased at every level of programme planning. The main
objectives of the proposed cost analysis are to determine:<p>
<p>
<i>&#149;  Costs associated with expansion and sustainability;</i><p>
<i>&#149;  Cost-benefit relationship, as compared with other possibilities for
resource allocation;</i><p>
<i>&#149;  Potential opportunities for cost reduction;</i><p>
<i>&#149;  Ways to enhance programme efficiency;</i><p>
<i>&#149;  Possibilities for alternative sources of revenue.</i><p>
<p>
<p>
Effective cost analysis must determine various programming costs, with due
consideration of national or sub-national, community, and external cooperation.
Additionally, important funding decisions are based on a clear distinction
between capital and recurrent costs.  External cooperation is more available
for capital costs, while recurrent costs are most often met by parents,
communities, governments and NGOs. The effective application of cost analysis
may help to de-mystify the unknown costs associated with early childhood
education and development programmes.<p>
<p>
Any discussion of the costs associated with early childhood development
programmes must consider the cost of not providing additional support to
families, particularly the high-risk and often female-headed households. One of
the negative consequences of neglecting the child-rearing support needs of
at-risk families is poor school performance and high rates of repetition and
drop-out -- costly both to families and to society. Other costs result from the
various forms of social marginalisation affecting children, including alcohol
and drug addiction, teenage pregnancy, and juvenile delinquency, which are
often associated with neglectful or abusive family settings.<p>
<p>
<b>Creating Political Will</b><p>
<p>
An overall strategy for early child development must include attention to the
political and social commitment needed to create demand and sustain services.
Support must be obtained from politicians and policy makers, since they have
the power to make budgetary decisions affecting the rate and process of
programme expansion; from bureaucrats, who must be convinced of the value of
child development strategies to ensure sustainability; and from professionals,
who must be encouraged to improve quality through the application of innovative
techniques. In addition, if the programme delivered is to be accepted and
sustained, it is important to capture the popular will of the community. To
create demand and achieve the support of these groups, a comprehensive and
convincing rationale for investing in early childhood education and development
programmes, tailored specifically to the information needs, must be
established. Government officials must be convinced by a strong database that
documents the positive long-term benefits to programme participants and the
resulting cost savings from preventive programmes. In addition, advocacy
campaigns must be firmly grounded within an overall strategic plan that
includes a clear sense of objectives, implementation strategies, and expected
outcomes.<p>
<p>
Successful advocacy campaigns require a careful analysis of the recipient
audience.  They must be based on a sensitive understanding of traditional
beliefs and modern desires and of the social and economic realities determining
the feasibility of these aspirations.  Identifying effective advocacy
strategies involves using an array of qualitative data collection techniques,
assessing social organisations and the formal and informal decision-making
processes and understanding national, regional, and community administrative
structures responsible for programme implementation.<p>
<p>
The particular mode of communication, the choice of content, and the form of
presentation are dependent on the perceptions and perspectives of potential
communicators and their audiences, including political leaders; civil servants;
university and professional groups; community organisations and movements;
NGOs; newspapers, radio, and television editors; teachers; religious groups;
and artists and intellectuals. Such an assessment identifies potential allies
and collaborators as well as those whose collaboration may be detrimental to
the achievement of the programme objectives.  <p>
<p>
A particularly disturbing outcome of successful advocacy campaigns occurs when
the "supply side" is unable to meet the expectations or deliver the services
created by the demand. Government promises made in part to stir enthusiasm,
mobilise demand, and spur action bring with them a responsibility to mount the
sustained operations necessary to accomplish the proposed objectives. If that
does not occur, successful and inspiring communication efforts can be
interpreted as hollow public relations ploys -- a situation all too familiar to
expectant recipients. <p>

COLOMBIA: Hogares de Bienestar, A Home-Based Approach  According to the latest        
national census, 17 per cent of the Colombian population consists of children under   
seven years of age. Of these five million children, many suffer from malnutrition     
and are without the minimum requirements for adequate growth and development. In      
responding to the needs of this vulnerable group, the Government developed a system   
of Hogares Bienestar, literally "Homes of Well-Being", under the coordination of      
the Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar. (ICBF). The programme promises to     
go to scale to reach Colombia's 1.5 million malnourished children from birth to the   
age seven by 1992. In 1990, approximately 394,000 children, 27 per cent of the 1992   
goal, were receiving service.  Unlike many existing services, the programme is        
based in the community, which is responsible for the local organisation and           
management of the project. The objective of this initiative is to provide care for    
children in homes located within their own neighbourhoods. The community determines   
the number of homes necessary to meet the needs of the children under the age of      
seven. Through government and private financing, funds are provided to upgrade        
neighbourhood homes and provide training for mothers. The programme includes a        
balanced diet as well as attention to the conditions necessary to foster children's   
physical, psychological, and social development. In addition, the programme gives     
the community a sense of control over social and economic development.  The           
programme begins with an analysis of the community's needs for services, taking       
into account children's age, family income, maternal occupation, and physical and     
environmental variables. Once the children are identified, the community appoints     
mothers to implement the programme. The appointed mothers are instructed in the       
care and development of children as well as family and community relationships,       
nutrition, and health. Once trained, each of the community mothers cares for          
approximately 15 children between the ages of two and seven years in her own home.    
Each child is given a "scholarship" by the Government, which constitutes the income   
for the community mother.  The programme is managed by the community through a        
board of parents, who are responsible for purchases and payments to the community     
mothers. Through the applications of modern management systems, the programme is      
coordinated by the ICBF with additional responsibilities shared by the Ministry of    
Public Health, the national service for vocational training, and other governmental   
and private organisations.

<b>Role Of Media In Promoting Early Childhood Development</b><p>
<p>
The international expertise to focus national and international attention on
children's survival needs must be transferred to the area of child development.
Important to consider are the ways in which survival and development efforts
could be mutually and simultaneously strengthened through selected media
channels. In using media to create political will, one could consider, for
example, developing a "documentary series" that features child development as a
global issue and includes such topics as these:<p>
<p>
<i>&#149;  Country-specific rationale for child development policies and
programmes.</i><p>
<i>&#149;  Forms of developmental stimulation techniques easily provided by
parents and other caregivers, with emphases on both the societal need for such
activities and the possible benefits to children.</i><p>
<i></i>&#149;  Effective innovative service delivery models that could focus on
either organisational models or the work of individuals, including local or
national advocates.<p>
<i>&#149;  Traditional child-rearing practices and patterns known to foster
development, as well as those considered to have a negative impact on the
developmental process.</i><p>
<p>
In addition to political will and national awareness created through the media,
caregiver education can also be enhanced through the careful selection and use
of appropriate media channels as well as content and format. Attributes of
successful media applications with caregivers as the primary audience include a
focus on local needs and the presentation of appropriate and available
solutions in a compelling, practical, and demystifying fashion. For example, an
audience self-test for radio or television could incorporate brief features on
child development, expanding on or explaining issues raised by a set of
questions. A series of radio or television vignettes could be developed,
illustrating children's developmental progress. Each vignette could focus on
the range of normal development, the identification of potential problems, and
a presentation of activities designed to foster development. An alternative
strategy could be to design TV or radio programmes encouraging the use of
traditional as well as modern patterns of child-rearing. It is firmly
established, however, that applications of media techniques to educate
caregivers will be successful only if audience involvement is maximised through
both on-air techniques and related follow-up activities. Creative
experimentation and field trials are required in the design of effective
interactive media that encourages active viewer or listener involvement.<p>
<p>
Programme developers must also be aware of the increasing potential of media
techniques designed to directly enhance children's development. Using
television as a medium, <i>Sesame Street</i>, developed by the Children's
Television Workshop in the United States, is one example of a technique whose
successful adaptation to countries in the developing world is dependent in part
on the application of a carefully conceived curriculum that is not only
respected by parents but is able to attract and sustain the active attention of
the preschool child. Ideally, programmes should be flexibly designed in order
to respond to the developmental needs of performing at a range of developmental
levels.<p>

<b>
VENEZUELA: Proyecto Familia  One of the most noted examples in recent years of the    
use of mass media for family education comes from Venezuela. Proyecto Familia,        
begun in 1980, was intended to promote the intellectual development of children       
from birth to six years of age by providing informal education to mothers, both       
through direct contact and through the mass media. In urban Venezuela, television     
is said to reach 96 per cent of the population; in most rural areas, radio reaches    
more than 80 per cent. To take advantage of this coverage and the existing            
communication infrastructure, Proyecto Familia produced an impressive number of       
television and radio programmes and spots as well as slide presentations and films.   
This creative effort was put into effect with strong political backing and produced   
some excellent materials, but an evaluation in 1984 concluded that, overall, the      
effort constituted a promise yet to be fulfilled.   Fulfillment was limited in part   
by the fact that the mass media were not linked to a system of interpersonal          
contacts. In urban areas, television viewers were able to identify the name           
Proyecto Familia but there was no evidence that the approach had changed practices.   
After an initial run, it became difficult to convince commercial television           
stations that the messages should continue to be shown. In rural areas, there         
seemed to be somewhat better success. Radio messages were better accepted by local    
stations in search of programme material and were broadcast more often. The           
messages were also partially linked to a system of interpersonal communication        
involving both rural extension workers and health personnel in primary health care    
centres.

<b>Achieving Quality Control</b><p>
<p>
While it is accepted that quality child care programmes do positively affect
development, a more complex concern is the potential for negative impacts of
poor quality programmes on a child's development. Without information about the
quality of early childhood education and development programmes, claims of high
coverage rates are uninformative. It is particularly important to raise
questions of quality in conjunction with the increased demand for services.
While quality is a complex, culturally defined, and relative concept, programme
planners and policy makers must begin to generate standard categories and
components of quality against which programmes can be measured. Without some
grasp of quality and its associated costs, efforts to move forward on issues of
regulation and standard setting will be curtailed. In the past, issues of
quality in early childhood education and development programmes have been
assessed according to three lines of investigation. First, global assessments
of a programme's overall climate have been made. Second, specific dimensions of
an early childhood education and development programme have been assessed: (1)
structural programme aspects, such as group composition and staff
qualifications; (2) dynamic programme aspects that capture children's
experiences; and (3) contextual programme aspects, such as type of setting and
staff stability. A third and relatively new line of investigation assesses a
programme's interactive effects -- the relation between child care quality and
children's family environments.<p>
<p>
Global assessments of quality have relied on overall rating scales, judging
such factors as personal care, language reasoning, materials, and social
development. Global assessments of quality, however, are of little use to
practitioners and policy makers seeking to influence specific programme
features that are predictive of positive outcomes. Assessments of the
structural dimensions of child care, including adult-child ratio, group size,
and caregiver training and experience, have generated greater insights into the
relative impact of different programme components. Contextual features of child
care, such as staff stability, provide a measure of the quality important for
such a developmental issue as attachment to primary caregivers. More recently,
quality of child care has been assessed in terms of the joint effects on the
child of care received in a programme and care received in the home.  In
applying various assessment models, one is reminded that children's development
is positively affected by exposure to high-quality programmes.<p>
<p>
In reviewing the essential components of high-quality care generated by the
large body of existing data, several components have been consistently
indicated and are listed as follows:<sup>49</sup><p>
<p>
<i>&#149;  Developmentally appropriate curriculum that features child-initiated
learning activities within a supportive environment.</i><p>
<i>&#149;  Careful selection of staff, with an ongoing strategy for in-service
and on-site training. Research has established that compared with formal
education, child-related training or experience is a stronger predictor of
caregivers' effectiveness.</i><p>
<i>&#149;  Attention to appropriate staff/child ratios.</i><p>
<i>&#149;  Ability of programmes to engage and establish a partnership with
parents and the community, empowering them with access to information and an
opportunity to internalise positive child-rearing practices.</i><p>
<i>&#149;  Strong administrative support, with direct provision of or linkages
to comprehensive services such as health and nutrition.</i><p>
<i>&#149;  Effective evaluation and monitoring procedures allowing staff to
monitor and observe children's progress. Evaluation data should also be
available, providing feedback to strengthen operations, understand constraints,
and foster the development of effective solutions.</i><p>

KENYA: Centres for Early Childhood  A major expansion of Kenya's preschool centres,   
which began in the 1960s, has generated a current infrastructure of 13,000            
preschools providing services for a total of 80.1,000 children between the ages of    
three and six, reaching approximately one-quarter of Kenya's 2.6 million children     
in this age-group. Much of this growth is attributed to socio-economic forces,        
including increased female employment rates, expanded formal education                
opportunities, rapid urbanisation, and disruption of the extended family system.      
Capitalising on the Government's focus on rural development, the system is highly     
decentralised, giving management responsibility shared by the Ministry of             
Education, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Housing and Social Services.   
The programme gained momentum in 1972, when the Kenya Government joined forces with   
the Bernard van Leer Foundation to develop an innovative training and curriculum      
development strategy. Elements of this model include participatory training           
methods; in-service training and follow-up; partnerships involving parents, local     
communities, and external assistance agencies; and ongoing research and evaluation.   
The success of the efforts has resulted in the launching of a National Centre for     
Early Childhood Education (NACECE) within the Kenya Institute for Education. The      
NACECE, jointly sponsored by the Bernard van Leer Foundation and the Ministry of      
Education, plays a major role in the design, development, and dissemination of        
materials and services including training, curriculum development, research, and      
programme evaluation. In addition, the NACECE coordinates and disseminates the work   
of the District Centres, which facilitate the decentralised training of preschool     
personnel. District Centres for Early Childhood Education (DICECEs) annually train    
750 preschool teachers. The teachers undergo a two-year in-service programme. Apart   
from training, DICECEs are also involved in community mobilisation to improve the     
quality of life for preschool children. This is accomplished by ensuring enriched     
educational opportunities, improved health services, and better nutrition.  The       
activities of the NACECE and the DICECEs have had far-reaching effects on early       
childhood education in the country. There is an increased awareness of a concern      
for the young child among local leaders, parents, and the community. Currently the    
Kenyan Government and the Bernard van Leer Foundation are supporting the              
development of a Regional Training and Research Centre at the Kenya Institute for     
Education. This facility will house the NACECE and coordinate regional early          
childhood education activities.                                                       
</b>
<p>
In summary, the data suggest that quality is best understood as a blending of
specific ingredients. For example, a favorable staff-child ratio, in the
absence of parent participation, may ultimately have little impact on
children's development outcomes. It is also important to assess the work
environment of the child-care setting. Child-care environments have been
largely studied as a developmental environment for young children, while the
quality of the work environment for caregivers has been largely ignored --
despite well-known high staff turnover rates. Efforts to understand the factors
that affect staff turnover rates and the resulting negative consequences for
children must also be undertaken. <p>
<p>
Presently, child care in both the developed and developing worlds consists
largely of unregulated environments. The growing pressure to expand supply
exists without attention to regulation of quality. The unrelenting demand for
relatively scarce forms of care implies that more children will be placed in
low-quality programmes. Concluding that high-quality child care is beneficial
is insignificant in light of the questions raised about the negative effects of
poor-quality care. Without attention to the quality of care, enrolment
statistics are of little significance. Policy analysis must provide insights
into both the range of possibilities for as well as the essential
characteristics of high-quality child care, and it must determine what these
essential characteristics will cost.<p>
<p>
<b>Training Child Development Personnel</b><p>
<b></b><p>
As indicated by research, and validated by providers and planners of early
childhood education and development programmes, the training component is
perhaps the most important factor associated with implementing and sustaining
high-quality programmes.  In spite of its importance, training is often the
first to be cut as administrators struggle with decreasing resources;
ineffective learning materials; didactic and sterile methodologies; lack of
adequately trained trainers; and an infrastructure incapable of providing
needed in-service training, follow-up, and supervision. The following
discussion highlights several conceptual underpinnings of high-quality training
for early child care personnel. Effective training strategies for providers of
early childhood education and development programmes must be characterised by a
process that enables learners to acquire skills and knowledge transferable to
their particular tasks and roles.  <p>
<p>
It is not a self-contained package easily dispersed, but a process concerned
with the growth of knowledge and awareness, the awakening of understanding, and
the acquisition of skills and competencies. Successful training programmes are
those that recognise what people know and that begin by integrating the
required new skills and knowledge into an existing knowledge-base. The
acquisition of new knowledge and skills is followed by opportunities for
continued reflection and recognition of relevance for the learner's particular
needs.  Information must be internalised within the learner before it is
capable of being translated into action.<p>
<b>
NEPAL: The Home-Based "Entry Point" Programme  The population of Nepal is close to    
18 million, including eight million children under the age of 15. Large families,     
averaging six children or more, are the norm. The significance and resilience of      
the family constitutes a point of cultural convergence across the various ethnic      
groups. In all cases, however, pressure is now being felt by these large extended     
families as land holdings, which have been divided and redivided for generations,     
become too small to support so many people. Throughout Nepal the vast majority of     
the population are subsistence farmers. The family farm produces 80 per cent of the   
average annual household income. In the division of labour, the major workload        
falls upon women, and it is assumed that she will fulfill multiple roles. According   
to some studies, a Nepalese woman must spend almost 11 hours a day to maintain the    
family's subsistence level. As mothers, women play a critical role in their           
children's development, but they are often limited in their ability to nurture and    
stimulate them adequately because of difficult social and economic conditions. They   
simply have very little time to spend with their children. The challenge,             
therefore, is to develop effective programmes which simultaneously address women's    
and children's intersecting needs. It must be taken into account that the demands     
accompanying women's multiple roles as mothers, workers, and housekeepers can         
become overwhelming.  In this sense, the UNICEF-supported Production Credit for       
Rural Women (PCRW) project provides support for a range of linked credit and          
community development activities carried out by village women. This project assists   
low-income rural women to take advantage of credit schemes through national banking   
institutions for agricultural production, cottage industries and services. In the     
original design, child-care arrangements were envisaged as one small component of     
the PCRW's community development approach. The main concern was to free up women's    
time so that they would be better able to engage in income-generation activities.     
But more and more frequently, field workers identified child care as a priority.      
Referred to in Nepali as praveshdwar, which means first door into an important        
place, the entry point programme is by far the most innovative component of the       
PCRW activities. The programme concentrates on the woman's role within the family     
both as mother and worker. A second component of the programme includes general       
themes on child development and care. Recognition of the interactive effect between   
health, nutrition, and stimulation is implicit in the design of the curriculum and    
this integrated approach is evident throughout all the aspects of the programme.      
Mothers who want to participate form a group that becomes the focal point for         
action. Sometimes, the community arranges a site for the programme, which includes    
a latrine and a kitchen. More often, however, the mothers run the programme in        
their own homes on a rotational basis. The groups meet weekly to ensure that the      
programme is running smoothly and to establish a schedule according to their own      
needs. Training activities take place on-site. While mothers attend the training      
sessions, fathers are shown how to make the toys that will be used in the             
programme. Neighbouring groups exchange materials periodically so that children can   
be exposed to a wide variety of toys and play materials. As almost all the mothers    
are illiterate, a pictorial chart is used to indicate the daily schedule of           
activities.   Most importantly, the training emphasises the importance of mothers     
as caregivers and teachers, and aims at building up women's confidence in their       
ability to manage and run the programme regularly. The quality of the mother-child    
interaction changes due to increased knowledge and confidence between them.           
However, the benefits of the programme are not limited to participating children.     
Women and mothers learn basic individual and group management skills by working       
cooperatively over an extended period of time. Thus, the skills and confidence they   
gain are carried over into other community development and income-generation          
activities. Recognition of the crucial importance of the group dynamics of the        
programme is a key element of the PCRW project.                                       

</b><p>
A
successful training strategy for early child development personnel is one that
emphasises the learners' strengths rather than weaknesses; applies active and
participatory training methods; perceives the trainer as a facilitator rather
than a director; and fosters a cooperative rather than a competitive training
environment. Training programmes that incorporate these components have greater
likelihood of developing persons capable of self-direction and confident in
their problem-solving abilities. Though training is moving away from an
information-centred approach towards an interactive method of experiential
learning, training methods must nevertheless be sensitive to the cultural
context. Finally, it is essential that the training offered be a continual
process providing a balanced mix of structured sessions with opportunities for
follow-up and individually tailored supervision that reinforces, supports, and
strengthens the learning process. This approach, which is both time- and
resource- intensive, is often neglected in the drive to increase coverage. If
the goal is to create sustainable, high-quality systems of care, then the
training approach described here is essential.<p>
<p>
As suggested by research and confirmed through the analysis of successful
curricula for training early child development personnel, the training content
must be organised around a specific early child development curriculum or set
of learning principles. A growing body of data supports a child-centred
approach that recognises children at various levels of development. The
curriculum should provide opportunities for independent problem solving,
meaningful child-initiated conversations with peers and adults, and ample time
for exploration of the environment. Within this general approach, the specific
content of activities must emerge from, support, and reinforce the values of a
given cultural setting.  <p>
<p>
The content of the training programme must respond to the strengths and
limitations of a particular group of learners. While difficult to achieve, the
training required by child development personnel requires a balance between
theory and practice. Theory should be incorporated into experience in a way
that fosters continuous, systematic analysis.  Opportunities for analysing
therefore need to be integrated into the training process.  The multiple goals
of early childhood education and development programmes are often reflected in
the multiplicity of learning objectives that can overburden personnel with a
conflicting set of priorities. With the implementation of continuous training
schemes, however, new information can be phased in over time, gradually
building on the learner's existing knowledge-base. The development of effective
curricula and training strategies based on techniques of experiential learning
is encouraging. Planners would benefit from reviewing existing materials and
identifying ways in which the available training materials can be adapted and
adjusted.<sup>53</sup>  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Programme Monitoring And Evaluation</b><p>
<p>
The monitoring and evaluation of early childhood education and development
programmes has been hampered by a plethora of factors. These factors include
lack of available expertise, lack of widely acceptable child development
instruments and measures, lack of clearly conceived programme objectives, and
lack of financial resources. The field of programme evaluation therefore is
wide open and calls for the concerned and committed attention of professionals
working in collaboration with programme providers and participants.<p>
<p>
The need for strong well-designed evaluations of early childhood education and
development programmes is underscored when one considers the potential
applications of these results. For example, documentation of success is a
powerful tool for eliciting the attention as well as sustaining the commitment
of policy-makers and planners. As indicated by the previous discussion of
programme expansion, evaluations can provide administrators the necessary
information about when and how programmes should increase scale. Furthermore,
programme evaluations can identify which factors are fundamental to achieving
programme objectives and therefore necessary components of standards for
quality control. In addition, systematic attention to evaluation needs
encourages comparisons both within and among countries of the relative
effectiveness of alternative programming strategies. The information obtained
from the application of effective monitoring systems can be used to guide the
adaptation and refinement of programme goals and objectives. <p>
<p>
Given the multiplicity of programming goals and strategies, innovative
data-collection techniques must be employed -- techniques capable of
documenting both anticipated and unanticipated benefits to participants,
families, communities, and institutions. As in all fields of scientific
inquiry, investigations must rely on both qualitative and quantitative
data-collection methods. The multifaceted nature of early childhood education
and development programmes provides a range of opportunities for the
simultaneous application of both qualitative and quantitative techniques,
including, for example, creating new variables as well as replicating old
measures, assessing process as well as outcome, and  generating as well as
testing hypotheses. Effective evaluations have always required graceful
movement between descriptive and quantitative analysis, induction and
deduction, and freely ranging exploration and highly structured investigation.
If an early childhood education and development programme is successful, it is
important to determine how and why; if it is not, a similar line of inquiry is
required.<p>
<p>
Qualitative evaluation methods include such techniques as direct observation,
structured and semi-structured interviews, open-ended questionnaires, focus
groups, and analysis of existing literature and documents. The application of
these techniques is critical to understanding the factors facilitating as well
as those inhibiting programme success.  Suggested applications of qualitative
techniques in early childhood education and development could include for
example an analysis of traditional child-rearing patterns and practices that
have both a positive and a negative impact on development; analysis of internal
and external variables associated with stress-resistant children and their
families; identification of culturally appropriate touch-points for early
intervention; identification of processes and mechanisms for enhancing
community participation; and the exploration of alternative models for training
child-care providers.  <p>
<p>
Any general discussion calling for increased programme monitoring and
evaluation must at some point confront the complex and culturally sensitive
issues regarding the identification and selection of indicators. Although the
need for indicators has been accepted, the importance of assuring their
adequate design and validity has not received as much attention. The failure to
use appropriate measures can cause considerable damage to children and
families, and it is critical to assure that instruments possess the
psychometric characteristics necessary to achieve the stated purpose. <p>
<p>
The results of considerable efforts to measure early child development have led
to the classification of four major categories of indicators: (1) description
or diagnosis of the child's developmental level, (2) detection or screening for
developmental disabilities, (3) periodic monitoring of a child's development,
and (4) programme evaluation.<sup>54</sup> If the need to develop instruments
to measure the child's development is taken seriously, criteria for developing
new or evaluating existing instruments must be proposed. <p>
<p>
<p>
The following discussion summarises some important issues in the selection and
application of child development instruments.<sup>***</sup> <p>
<p>
A fundamental problem is the confusion surrounding the purpose for which an
instrument has been originally developed. The major types of instruments useful
to early child development providers differ from each other in significant
ways. In reality, however, the distinction between screening, monitoring, and
diagnostic assessment is often unclear. Instruments are often used for purposes
other than those for which they were developed. In many cases, the lack of
specification of purpose or the ambitious combination of multiple purposes
creates instruments which do not satisfy the criteria of any given method. For
example, some screening tools are too complex while diagnostic tools are too
general to generate the necessary detail. A related problem is the absence of
clearly understood objectives. For instance, tests are often administered to
identify age-related problems that are beyond the scope of the instruments. In
other instances, traditional test items are not sensitive enough to detect a
child's strengths and weakness in the context of his or her environment.<p>
<p>
The majority of existing instruments assess the development of children between
three and six years of age. By contrast, tests or instruments to ascertain the
developmental status of children in the first two years of life are scarce.
Many of the formats are cumbersome and inappropriate given the circumstances
surrounding the majority of child development facilities in developing
countries. Moreover, such tests require users to be well-trained in test
administration and interpretation. In a large number of cases, tests are
administered by personnel with inadequate training and supervision. Given these
circumstances one can anticipate high rates of abuse and subsequent
mislabelling of children. A related problem stems from clinical judgements
based on a single administration of an instrument when, in fact, repetitive
administrations over time are required in order to monitor a child's progress
and detect change. If assessment measures in early childhood are to be accepted
at the field level, considerable efforts need to be placed on the development
of practical and simple techniques which are easy to administer and interpret
by para-professionals with limited training.<p>
<p>
<p>
Throughout the developing world instruments to assess the environmental factors
associated with the developmental outcome in early childhood are scarce.
Existing instruments are more likely to identify problems within the child
without understanding the role of environmental factors. Greater attention
needs to be focused on ways to capture environmental strengths and weaknesses,
including, but not limited to, aspects of the physical environment, family
environment, social support systems and patterns of child-caregiver
interaction. Relatively little attention has been placed on indicators of
environmental processes that increase or decrease a family's vulnerability to
stress and subsequent child-rearing deficiencies. Parents interpret the world
to their children. The extent to which stress on the family from any source
impinges on the young child is a function of the ability of adults to cope with
stress. In other words, to measure a child for psychosocial risk or disorder,
one must also consider the stress endured by the child's caregiver and the
supports available to buffer and alleviate that stress.<p>
<p>
The current state-of-the-art underscores the limitations related to
psychometric issues of test construction. Reliability and validity scores are
rarely available. In the absence of sensitivity and specificity data, the
ability of an instrument to correctly classify children as at-risk remains
unknown. A further difficulty relates to the problem of creating local norms. A
common solution is to target one particular group such as urban lower classes.
Creative and innovative solutions to the complex issues of norms and
standardisation must be identified. In the development of new indicators,
greater emphasis must be placed on the types and rigor of standardisation
required of a test, or procedure, and data collection methods.<p>
<p>
Awareness of the problems associated with cultural relevance has generated
instruments sensitive to the need to adjust and modify items for existing tests
in order to identify age-appropriate norms. However, still absent from these
instruments is the identification of new items that may be required in a given
cultural context. Extreme caution must be exercised in the use of Western
instruments in non-Western contexts. Valid and reliable instruments in one
cultural context may fail to measure a particular construct in another. In
addition, since standardised tests must use particular cultural material, they
may be inappropriate for assessing the skills, abilities, or aptitudes of
children whose primary culture differs from the mainstream.<p>
<p>
Finally, an important concern focuses on the underutilisation of measurement
tools within the programmes they intend to support. Test administration is
often an end in itself. In all areas of programme development, implementation,
and evaluation, the actual or potential use of existing instruments is rarely
acknowledged. For example, many existing instruments could be used to enhance
the caregiver's capacity to provide individualised responses to the learning
needs of children attending various early child development programmes. In
other instances, data obtained by the instrument could provide parents with an
important source of information regarding their child's development. Greater
attention needs to focus on the use of various tools to assess and monitor the
ability of programmes to address issues of health, safety, and nutrition as
well as the quality of the care provided. Instruments carefully selected and
designed to match specific programme objectives can play a vital role in
determining the direct and indirect benefits to children and families as a
result of various types of programme alternatives. Finally, efforts should
focus on the identification of instruments to be used in selected longitudinal
follow-up studies of children and families exposed to high-quality child
development programmes. <p>
<p>
Given the relative confusion surrounding the measurement of early child
development and the serious consequences which result when screening and
assessment activities are not part of the overall intervention programme
activities, guidelines for the developmentally appropriate assessment of young
children need to be developed. Testing is not an end in itself but the first
step to the provision of follow-up services. Until such services are in place,
the time and resources devoted to the development of formal testing procedures
should be curtailed. Understanding the limitations of formal testing, however,
should encourage the development of creative alternatives to the more rigorous
requirements of formal standardised testing. Thus, the need to develop a range
of both standardised and non-standardised techniques to obtain information
useful in the design, implementation, and evaluation of early child development
programmes is emphasised.<p>
<p>
In an effort to design a strategy that addresses the comprehensive needs of the
young child, the following chapter suggests ways a child development component
could be incorporated into existing, more narrowly defined sectoral programmes.
<p>
<p>
<b>V  CREATING LINKAGES: </b><p>
<b>CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND INTERSECTORAL COLLABORATION</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Those concerned with the survival and development of children in developing
countries face the difficult but challenging task of recovering the holistic
and comprehensive view of development that has been eroded by technological
specialisation. This broad and integrative view is essential, not only in
concept, but in the design and implementation of programmes. Respecting the
holistic nature of the child, collaboration between existing bureaucratic
structures, each established for a specified purpose, is not an easy task.
Organisational models such as placing coordination outside specialised
agencies, creating inter-organisational activities, and building networks will
help to foster and sustain integrated programming approaches. This chapter
briefly highlights some specific opportunities for programmatic linkages
between child development initiatives and health and nutrition;
women-in-development; the girl child; primary education; childhood disability
prevention and rehabilitation; and children in especially difficult
circumstances.<p>
<p>
<b>A.  HEALTH AND NUTRITION</b><p>
<p>
A large and relatively untapped potential exists for integrating a child
development component into ongoing health and nutrition strategies. A simple
and rather direct strategy would be to include child development information
into the training of medical professionals and paraprofessionals including
doctors, nurses, traditional birth attendants, nutritionists, and ancillary
health care workers. Several efforts have been made to integrate child
development milestones and assessments of the child-rearing environment into
existing growth monitoring activities. Such activities provide an opportunity
for parents to be educated in the normal stages of development as well as the
factors that influence it.<sup>54</sup><p>
<p>
A second readily available strategy is to introduce child development
information into health education initiatives implemented in hospitals, primary
health care centres, schools, adult education programmes, and mass media
channels. Recognising the value of the media as a partner in the transmission
of information, essential child health knowledge was synthesised into a series
of over 50 basic messages. Published jointly by UNICEF, the World Health
Organisation, and UNESCO, in partnership with over 140 of the world's
best-known voluntary organisations, this booklet, entitled <i>Facts for
Life</i>, contains the most authoritative expression, in plain language, of
today's scientific consensus on practical, low-cost, family-based ways of
protecting the lives and the normal growth of millions of the world's children.
In the chapters on safe motherhood, birth-spacing, breastfeeding, child growth,
oral rehydration, immunisation, respiratory infection, home hygiene, AIDS, and
child development. The seven prime messages contained within this chapter open
up a wide range of opportunities for partnerships with communicators of all
kinds -- politicians, educators, religious leaders, health professional,
business leaders, trade union activitists,  leaders and other members voluntary
organisations, and journalists. <p>
<p>
The development of the child and the ability of the caregiver to provide
adequate care have been an unrecognised component in the majority of nutrition
programmes. In addition to making an assessment of household food security and
the families' ability to provide a healthy environment for children, nutrition
programmes must also consider the existing patterns of child-rearing that may
either support or constrain the ability of the caregiver to provide adequate
care. The demand for care, or the perception of the importance of an early and
intense investment in the child, will vary from culture to culture and between
individuals. Given the importance of the child-caregiver interaction, it is
essential that nutrition interventions take into account traditional
child-rearing patterns and beliefs. <p>
<p>
Although there are many barriers to combining nutrition and child development,
there are also a variety of ways to circumvent these barriers in the design,
implementation, and evaluation of interventions. Food supplementation
programmes and nutrition recuperation centres, breastfeeding and proper weaning
promotion, and nutrition education initiatives all offer exciting potential
opportunities to address the need for enhanced collaboration. For example,
nutrition efforts have focused largely on the provision of food supplements to
groups defined by either geographic area or community, or by population
characteristics such as pregnant or lactating women, infants, or preschoolers.
In these programmes, the food is provided and consumed either in the nutrition
centre or distributed for home consumption. The amount and kind of food
provided varies considerably -- food may be imported or locally produced. The
effectiveness of food supplementation programmes, particularly those involving
the distribution of imported food, is still a controversial issue and examples
of both successful and unsuccessful initiatives can be documented. It is rather
curious that in spite of the increased recognition of the interrelations
between health, psychosocial, and nutritional status, few food distribution
initiatives attempt to address these related issues. The food is often
distributed without any effort to discuss health or related nutritional issues
with parents and caregivers. Too frequently the children, gathered for feeding,
sit listlessly, propped against walls of the nutrition centre. Opportunities
for children to participate in stimulating activities, that would in turn
increase their nutritional status, are rarely provided. <p>
<p>
In contrast to food distribution centres, nutrition recuperation centres treat
children with severe malnutrition. Evidence claims that the addition of child
development activities in such settings, increases weight gain while providing
psychosocial benefits. Still, many recuperation programmes fail to incorporate
activities that respond to children's psychosocial needs. The demonstrated
benefits, at relatively low costs, of incorporating developmental activities in
the recuperation of malnourished children underscores the urgency of the call
for integrative programming. <p>
<p>
Integrative nutrition education does not require the integration of
bureaucratic structures. Rather, integration occurs by combining content of the
material prior to its dissemination. In this way, the intended audience
receives related information rather than information limited to one single
issues. It is in such an isolated fashion that much of existing nutrition
education efforts. Unfortunately the failure to consider feeding as a social
and developmental process as well as a nutritional has led to the neglect of
children's psychosocial aspect. It is hoped that the convergence of interests
would stimulate the cooperative production of health, nutrition, and child
development materials that simultaneously address the integrated needs of the
developing child.<sup>45</sup><p>
<p>
<b>B.  WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT</b><p>
<p>
The benefits of the collaboration between those concerned with the healthy
growth and development of children and those interested in the social and
economic roles of women have tremendous policy implications for planners in
these respective fields.<sup>56</sup>  For those concerned with women's issues,
collaboration provides a more complete grasp of women's multiple
responsibilities and multifaceted contribution to families, communities, and
societies. Collaboration also generates a broad-based, critical perspective for
monitoring the progress of policy and project interventions targeted to women.
By challenging the simplistic notions of women as mothers or as workers, this
perspective provides a more accurate basis for understanding women's as well as
families' coping and survival strategies. In addition, this perspective, with
its focus on child care and health, provides additional insights into the
pattern of distribution of resources within households. Most importantly, it
recognises that women's work choices are almost always influenced by their need
to care for and nurture their children.<p>
<p>
For those who focus their professional energies on enhancing the healthy growth
and development of children, collaboration provides additional insights into
the lives of mothers of young children. First, it enlarges the range of
available strategies to integrate efforts to enhance women's own economic,
educational, and social well-being. Second, it requires that a broad set of
factors be considered in the design, implementation, and evaluation of early
child development programmes. Third, better recognition of women's multiple
roles and responsibilities provides a more realistic appreciation of the
various constraints women face in adopting new practices and utilising existing
services. Finally, an appreciation of the variability in women's work patterns
makes it clear that childhood development programmes must be developed with
sensitivity and the capacity to adapt to women's work environments.<p>
<p>
Capitalising on the collective energies and common goals of these two groups,
several strategic policy and programme implications for women, their work, and
their need for child care can be put forth. Perhaps the most encouraging
opportunities are those that incorporate a child development component into
existing interventions designed to improve the overall status of women. For
example, women-in-development initiatives designed to increase earning
capacities have included a range of strategies such as the application of
appropriate technology to help decrease the time spent in domestic activities,
development of credit schemes, implementation of training and education
programmes, and provision of organisational assistance to women engaged in
market activities. Both the scale and the success of these initiatives could be
enhanced by incorporating components to address the child care needs of parents
with young children.<p>
<p>
<b>
Integrating Women's Work and Child Care: Lessons Learnt57  &#149;Working women's needs     
for adequate child care are not being met. Informal care in the home, although        
preferred, is not sufficient to meet the demands of working women. A range of         
programming options that can provide adequate care at a reasonable cost needs to be   
explored.  &#149;No one programme solution exists. Given the wide range of variation in    
women's work patterns and conditions, no one model can be sufficient. Therefore,      
the provision of child care on a large scale must be conceived of as the sum of       
diverse, small-scale programmes that are able to respond to particular needs and      
circumstances.  &#149;  Strengthening traditional patterns of child care is a viable       
option. The care provided by extended family members or neighbours can be             
strengthened by providing caregivers with education, training, and access to          
existing supportive services. The flexibility, accountability, and affordability of   
supporting these informal strategies must not be underestimated. However,             
traditional strategies that remove older siblings, most notably girls, from school    
need to be replaced, so these youngsters are not deprived of the chance of an         
education.  &#149;Policies to support mothers' direct care of the infant in the first      
year of life must be strengthened. The importance of breastfeeding for the health     
and development of the infant, as well as the infant's need to be attached to a       
consistent primary caregiver, is well known. Thus, social policies facilitating       
maternal care in the first year of life must be supported.  &#149;Child-care programmes    
must address simultaneously the care and the developmental needs of the young         
child. Programmes focusing on young children's learning potential must also respond   
to the need for child care. In addition, existing child-care programmes must move     
beyond a custodial view and recognise the need to provide a developmentally           
appropriate environment for the children under their care.                            
</b>
<p>
In the first instance, alternative forms of child care can be conceived in an
"appropriate technology" framework. Recognising the need to relieve women from
the burden of domestic chores, many appropriate technology projects have been
supported. Of particular relevance are those initiatives that reduce the time
spent getting water, fetching firewood, and processing food. With the exception
of the introduction of bottle-feeding, which is rarely beneficial to the young
child and often dangerous, less consideration has been given to alternative
"technologies" or forms of child care. Such an approach might concentrate on
neighbourhood care in homes and the development of indigenous learning
materials for both children and parents. A second strategy is suggested by the
development of credit schemes to support alternative child care initiatives.
The home day-care programme in Colombia exemplified the opportunity for
collaboration between credit schemes and the provision of adequate child
care.<sup>47</sup>  In this programme, women are provided with credit, enabling
them to make improvements in their homes, which are then used as day-care
locations.<p>
<p>
In an effort to increase the quality of care provided through such programmes,
a third suggestion focuses on training programmes. A wide range of training
programmes designed to increase the income-earning capacity of women has been
implemented. While some effort has been made to upgrade traditional skills,
many programmes have resisted reinforcing traditional activities and their
accompanying low levels of prestige. As a result of this bias, child-care
training as a potential income-earning activity has been ignored. In addition,
when such training does exist, programmes have focused exclusively on
children's needs with little attention given to the needs of women. These
minimal short-term training schemes lead to jobs with "gratuities" well below
the minimum salary. Better training gradually leading to improved rates of pay
could have tremendous benefits for both women and children.<p>
<p>
Finally, because of the powerful impact of education on women's lives, the
benefits of women's literacy and education programmes must be recognised. For
example, higher levels of education are associated with decreased fertility
rates, increased birth-spacing, and improved health and nutritional care of
children. In the long term, improving women's educational opportunities may
provide the most promising of all available strategies.  Educational
discrimination begins for many girls as early as preschool age. Thus, efforts
to attack disproportionate rates of illiteracy among women must include
attention to the preparation of girls for primary school. It has been shown
that early care and development programmes provide one opportunity for
overcoming gender inequalities that are already in place at the time of school
entry. In addition, one of the barriers to young girls' education relates to
their care and nurturing of younger siblings. Innovative strategies, such as
locating preschools in close proximity to primary school, should be seriously
pursued.<p>
<p>
To maximise and ensure positive benefits to both women and their children, the
recommendations must be seen as complementary and reinforcing strategies. While
poverty and work have not prevented women from contributing to child survival
and development, clearly the quality of care from a child development
perspective will be affected by illiteracy, economic pressure, and the stress
of combining work with family responsibilities.  Women's lack of skills and
bargaining power clearly diminishes their capacity to provide the best quality
care for their children and encourages the exploitation of young girls within
and outside the home. <p>
<p>
Although different situations in distinct countries and cultures, which often
reflect varying degrees of discrimination against women and the girl child,
require careful analysis, the commonalities far outweigh the differences, and
there is much to be gained by pursuing this topic on an international level as
well as on national and subnational levels.       <p>
<p>
<b>The Girl Child</b><p>
<p>
The opportunities given today for children to reach their full human potential
will determine the quality of human development in the generation to come.
Gender equality needs to be a clearly stated and measurable objective of all
child development activities. The world community is urged to focus more
seriously on the human development of the girl child since she is the uneven
beneficiary of progress in the global fight against poverty and discrimination.
In most countries, girls have a lower status and enjoy fewer rights,
opportunities and benefits of childhood than boys, who claim first call on
family and community resources. The girl child experiences inequality at a very
young age and finds it increasingly difficult to overcome. The result is
dramatically illustrated by the social and economic condition of women at the
present time. Today's girl child is tomorrow's woman, and if tomorrow's woman
is to become an equal partner with man in social change and development, this
is the time to give the girl child her rightful share of human dignity and
opportunity. While gender-specific information about the girl child is sorely
lacking, several global indicators provide insight into her
status:<sup>58</sup> <p>
<p>
<i>&#149;  Some 60 million girls have no access to primary school, 20 million
more than boys. In most developing countries, fewer girls than boys enrol in
school, and far more drop out. In 68 out of 83 developing countries, girls'
primary school enrolment ratios are lower than boys'. For secondary school, 58
of 78 countries have lower enrolment ratios for girls than for boys.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>&#149;  In many households, the earning men and boys are generally fed
better than the women and girls.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>&#149;  In 30 developing countries, death rates for girls between the ages
of one and four have been found to be higher than or equal to the death rates
for boys. This contrasts with industrialised countries, where death rates of
boys are generally higher than those of girls. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>&#149;  Girls bear a heavier burden of both the household activities and the
care of siblings than the boy. In Africa and Asia, girls aged 10 to 14 put in
seven or more hours per day in household chores and domestic work.</i><p>
<p>
<p>
Reversing the uneven development of the girl child is a moral and political
priority of the highest level and one of the most productive investments a
country can make. With a view to eliminating gender disparities, priority focus
should be given to the girl child in all programmmes and strategies. The
complementary strategies outlined in Table 2 of this document should pay
particular attention to increasing the participation of the girl child. In
addition to these efforts, the following actions are suggested:<sup>58</sup><p>
<p>
<i>&#149;  Adopt political, legislative and development policies that eliminate
gender disparity and discrimination in childhood. At present, our understanding
of the problems and special needs of the young girl is limited.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>&#149;  Undertake specialised research and investigation into the status of
the girl child. Collect gender- and age-disaggregated data that demonstrates
the anthropological, religious, legislative and socioeconomic evidence of her
unequal status and living conditions. Disseminate the findings of such research
for advocacy, policy formulation, and programme interventions.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>&#149;  Launch effective public information and communication programmes to
create an awareness of the greater vulnerability of the girl child and her
special developmental needs.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>&#149;  Formulate specific legal and social provisions to counteract the
unacceptable negative image of the girl in traditional and non-traditional
media, education, religion and culture. Design adequate mechanisms to enforce
such provisions. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>&#149;  Mobilise political, religious, cultural, administrative and
community resources to create an ethos of care and value for the girl child.
Such an ethos should promote the elimination of gender disparities and
discrimination among children.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>&#149;  Advocate equal rights for girls in all national and international
forums. Multilateral, bilateral and non-governmental organisations must place
the girl child and women's issues high on their developmental agendas.</i><p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Primary Education</b><p>
<p>
Results from both developed and developing countries indicate that
participation in an ECD programme increases a child's enrolment, progress, and
performance in the early years of primary school. The mechanisms producing
improved enrolment, progress, and performance in primary school appear to
reflect some combination of earlier age of enrolment, improved school readiness
related to improved health and nutritional condition and improved cognitive
skills, and changes in parental expectations. Some data suggest gender
differences in programme effects -- helping girls to catch up to boys in
circumstances where their primary school entrance lags. Moreover, these
programmes relieve girls' child care responsibilities, thus increasing their
entry and retention in primary school.<sup>45</sup><p>
<p>
The readiness of schools for children must also be considered in any analysis
of school performance outcomes. School readiness is defined by the following
components; the availability of schools, quality and responsivity of teachers;
and the quality of facilities, materials, and teaching methods. The
responsiveness of schools to local needs and circumstances including the
adjustment of curricula, methods, and schedules to local values and situations,
and the provision of food and health attention where needed are also important
determinants of school readiness. School readiness characteristics are in turn
influenced by the actions and attitudes of families and communities, as well as
the prevailing economic and social conditions. <p>
<p>
To improve linkages between home, preschool and school, attention needs to be
given jointly to improving both girls' and boys' readiness for school and
schools' readiness for children. We need a combined approach to early childhood
and the early years of primary school education. To combine programmes requires
a rethinking of the programming process. It means bridging the artificial
separation that often exists between preschool and early primary school
children. It means getting primary school division of education ministries to
work with preschool divisions and pertinent parts of other ministries concerned
with health and nutrition. Combining programmes also requires a shift in
attitude. One must contemplate real changes in schools as part of their
improved readiness for children, rather than thinking only or even principally
that children must be adjusted to schools.<p>
<p>
<i>"... An integrated early childhood-primary school programme could serve as a
vehicle for linking family and community interests and strengths to the formal
school system, for example, fusing the values and content of the local culture
into the curriculum, first at the pre-primary then at the primary level;
serving as a focus of community development energies that, once organised,
could be focused on other issues; involving teachers in the solution of
community problems linked to child development but not obviously part of the
formal school system's mandate; and reaching parents and their children with
educational services before the perceived costs of children's participation in
a process with ill-defined returns becomes too high".</i><sup>59</sup><p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Childhood Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation</b><p>
<p>
Most of the world's disabled population do not receive rehabilitation and
treatment. According to World Health Organisation (WHO) statistics, less than 3
per cent of disabled persons in developing countries receive rehabilitation
services of any kind. Approximately 120 million disabled children live in the
developing countries. To reduce the impact of disability among children and to
assist them in the normal process of development, those involved in childhood
disability prevention and rehabilitation efforts place great emphasis on early
identification and timely intervention at the community level with active
involvement of family members. It is increasingly recognised that early
identification and intervention can change both the type and quality of the
child's disability. Three essential elements form the basis of an expanded
strategy on the prevention, early detection, and community-based
rehabilitation, including:<p>
<p>
<i>&#149; The need for more effective prevention of childhood impairments,
particularly due to four main causes -- inadequate nutrition, including
micronutrient deficiencies like vitamin A and iodine deficiency disorders,
infectious diseases, problems surrounding pregnancy, and accidents.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>&#149; The need to reduce the effects of disability through early detection
and intervention measures.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>&#149; The need to use the family and the community as a primary vehicle for
service delivery to those children who are already disabled.</i> <p>
<p>
Given the similarity between these objectives and those proposed for early
childhood development, all efforts to prevent and rehabilitate developmentally
delayed or disabled children should operate in close collaboration with early
child development activities. These children represent a specialised subset of
the child population whose particular needs must be addressed with the utmost
sensitivity through interaction with, rather than separation from, their peers,
families, and communities. In accomplishing this collaboration, existing child
care providers are ideally suited to contribute to the early identification and
detection of child delay and disability, thus increasing possibilities for
early intervention rather than the far more costly remediation efforts.
Moreover, specialised programmes for more severely handicapped children should
be closely linked to the community. Efforts to mainstream these children rather
than create parallel delivery systems should receive the highest
priority.<sup>60</sup> <p>

<p>
<b>F. CHILDREN IN ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES</b><p>
The category of children in especially difficult circumstances includes working
and street children, children in emergencies and armed conflict and abused and
neglected children. Recent global trends and events have brought national and
internal attention to need to protect children growing up in these harsh
realities. Since the end of the cold war, there has been a renewed
responsiveness to confront the problems of ethnic conflict. The Convention on
the Rights of the Child and the World Summit for Children provide a new
occasion for addressing the problem of children as principal victims of modern
wars. In carrying out the goals set forth by these international conventions,
the range of early child development programmmes described within this document
is particularly applicable. For abused, abandoned, displaced, and
psychologically traumatised children living in conflict-ridden environments,
comprehensive early child development programmes can help to remediate the
devastating long-term consequences resulting from early trauma and deprivation.
When available, ECD programmes can support and enhance families's child-care
efforts, thus preventing further disintegration. In more specific terms, the
following strategies are suggested in an effort to increase the collaboration
between early child development specialists and those whose energies are
focused on protecting children from the scourge of war and
devastation.<sup>61</sup> <p>
<p>
Children exposed to the trauma of war need opportunities to address these
experiences through programmes of psychological first aid. Teachers and parents
need to learn how to help children express and clarify their thoughts and
feelings. In accomplishing this task, doctors, teachers, nurses, counsellors,
and social workers should be trained to recognise and deal with childhood
trauma and loss. In addition, education material should be developed to help
parents understand children's normal responses to trauma and loss. Training
programmes are needed to help child-care providers to understand the effects of
stress upon children, whether chronic or acute, severe or mild, as well as
mechanisms of adaptive coping. <p>
<p>
Another strategy is to change what children are learning from the ethnic strife
around them namely, their perception that violence is an acceptable means for
settling conflict. Child development activities can help to strengthen the
young child's conflict resolution skills by creating environments which foster
socially constructive behavior. Two methods seems to be most effective in
increasing prosocial behavior among young children -- explicit modelling, in
which adults behave in ways they desire the child to imitate, and induction, or
giving explanations that appeal to children's pride, their desire to be
adult-like, and their concern for others. In such environments, children's
rules about proper behaviour are internalised and pave the way for increasing
levels of self-reflection and self-control. Successful techniques for teaching
self-control of aggression go beyond the mere suppression of aggressive
impulse. When children are given the opportunity to consider and understand the
value of other forms of aggressive behaviour is understood and not merely
suppressed.<sup>26</sup> Education for peace requires deeper thought and
longer-term action than it currently receives.<p>
<p>
Helping children recover from years of warfare between ethnic groups should
provide insights into the mechanisms that motivate people to kill those with
whom they live side by side. A warrior-like mentality is one attitude children
learn from war. We need to know more about how to create the opposite, an
attitude that seeks cooperation and conciliation rather than bellicosity and
super-patriotism. The solution is for all wars to end, and until they do, we
must ensure that the smallest children are not made the victims of adult
irresponsibility. Perhaps we should listen with greater sensitivity to the
language of the child.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>POSTSCRIPT: A CALL TO ACTION<sup>****</sup></b><p>
<p>
<p>
In this final decade of the 20th century, we are in a much better position to
make a major and sustained advance in our programming for improved early care
and development that we were in 1979 during the International Year of the
Child. We have sounder knowledge, experience, and technologies to draw upon.
Consciousness of the importance of child care and development has grown,
evident in a new willingness to look beyond survival. That consciousness is
indicated by the recent expansion of early childhood programmes, even in a time
of economic retrenchment and adjustment. There is indeed hope that "our
surviving children" will have an opportunity for healthy mental, social, and
emotional development.<p>
<p>
In spite of these advances, the level of investment by many national and
international organisations in early childhood is still low, and their stance
is lukewarm at best. If actions are not taken to change that position, an
important moment will have passed us by.<p>
<p>
If a new, conscious, broad-based initiative fails to materialise, we shall
continue to drift, slowly, towards greater, but not necessarily improved,
attention to the needs of the young child. Meanwhile, the measured and dilatory
pace of that drifting will deprive several generations of at-risk children of a
fair start in life.<p>
<p>
But more, failure to act could easily prejudice future generations as well by
allowing an outmoded, monolithic, socially biased, bureaucratic and
centralised, formal, and uncreative model of early childhood care and
development to expand, taking its cue from a problem-riddled primary school.
This trend must be arrested. Action must be taken to place much greater
emphasis on the earliest years, on social as well as mental development, on
family and community involvement, and on constructive rather than compensatory
programming. These shifts in focus and organisation will not happen by
themselves. And, if they do not begin to occur now, the time shall soon have
passed when we are early enough in the process to be able to make a real
difference in the organisational outcome.<p>
<p>
This, then, is a call to national governments and to the international
community to open themselves to new and worthy ventures and to proceed with all
due haste towards an enlightened programme of child survival <i>and
development</i>. It is a call also to communities and NGOs to make the child a
central part of their grassroots efforts as they take advantage of the present
opening towards civil initiatives and the growing movement towards a civil
society.<p>
<p>
The challenge we face in building strong programmes of child survival, care,
and development is at once immediate and long-term. In the remaining years of
this century, many pages will be written about preparation for the 21st
century. Many assessments will be made, accompanied by dreams for a better
future. In all of this it would be well to remember that the primary school
graduates of the year 2000 have already been born and are being prepared for
their future lives. They have already, for the most part, passed the critical
period from age nought to six. We are, then, already thinking well into the
21st century as we talk about the newborns who will be the dreamers, builders,
and leaders of tomorrow. They will be responsible for seeking economic and
social justice, for halting the devastation of our environment, and for
building a world in which neighbours and nations can live together in peace.<p>
<p>
What seems so far away is being influenced now. It is time to act if we wish to
bolster development of tomorrow's citizenry, with a vision of a more equitable,
humane, productive, and peaceful world. It is time to act not only with money,
but with personal commitment to seeking a fair start for "the twelve who
survive." And it is with urgency, then, that this call to action is made.<p>

                    <p>
               <fontsize="+2"><b>R<basefont></b>esearch over the last thirty years has amply demonstrated the 
          benefits derived from enriching the experience of very young 
          children. Children who take part in early childhood programs 
          are far more likely than their less fortunate peers to enter 
          and stay in school, to score better on aptitude tests, to 
          become more valued and better-paid workers, as well as productive members of 
          their community. Dollars spent on early childhood programs 
          further cut down on countries' expenses to alleviate poverty 
          and increase the value gained from dollars spent on later 
          education and training designed to enhance human capital.<br><p>

          education but whether these programs are cost-effective.  The 
          conference will introduce participants to the latest research

          context of various economic and social conditions.<br><p>

The World Bank&#146;s Agenda<br>
The World Bank and Early Childhood Development 
</center></h3>
<b></b>Health and education projects are central to the World Bank&#146;s
strategy of poverty alleviation.  The Bank is the largest single source of
external funding for health and education in developing countries.  And
increasingly, Bank investment has been directed toward young children&#151;the
human capital of the future.<b>[1]</b><p>
By the end of fiscal 1994, the Bank will have lent cumulatively over US$ 745
million for projects that integrate health, nutrition, and early child care
services for young children in developing countries.  These loans have been
made both through free-standing projects and as part of other social sector
projects.<p>

<a name="A_Toc310065684"></a><a name="A_Toc310065716"></a><a name="A_Toc310751023"></a><a name="A_Toc314284488"></a><a name="A_Toc315155749"></a><a name="A_Toc315155793"></a><p>
<b>Five Reasons for Investing in Early Childhood Development</b><p>
Problems faced by poor children in their earliest years&#151;such as stunted
mental development and unpreparedness for primary education&#151;lead later to
low achievement, high dropout rates, and functional illiteracy.  Programs that
can tackle these critical deficiencies are fundamental to a child&#146;s
learning and success in life; and research suggests that such programs can
indeed be effective.  <p>
Scientific support.  Scientific research demonstrates that the early years are
critical in the development of intelligence, personality, and social behavior.
50 percent of intelligence potential is developed by age four.  The impact of
early childhood development programs on personality and behavior is
long-lasting.<p>
<b>Socio-economic rationale</b>.  Early childhood education can increase the
return on primary and secondary school investments.  It can raise
participants&#146; productivity and income levels and reduce public
expenditures.  It can also reduce social costs in such areas as school
repetition, juvenile delinquency,
and drug use.<p>
<b>Social equity rationale</b>.  Investing in human capital, especially in
early development, attacks some of the most entrenched causes of poverty.
Providing a &#147;fair start&#148; can modify distressing socio-economic and
gender-related inequities.  Girls can  be particularly important beneficiaries.
Studies from diverse cultures show that girls who participate in early
childhood programs are more likely to attend and to continue in school.  They
are better prepared for school and parents change their expectations, allowing
girls to continue their education for longer periods.  Moreover, early
childhood development programs can help increase primary school attendance
where older siblings, generally girls,  have been forced to drop out of school
to help take care of their younger brothers and sisters. <p>
<b>Program efficacy rationale</b>.  The success of other programs (for example,
survival programs emphasizing health and nutrition or primary education, or
programs for women in development) can be enhanced by incorporating early
childhood interventions focused on healthy mental and social development.
Sound psycho-social development increases the chances of survival, makes
educational programs more efficient by reducing repetition.<p>
<b>Intersecting needs of women and children</b>.  Female participation in the
labor force throughout the developing world in both formal and informal sectors
is substantial and increasing.  And more and more households are headed by
women.  The need for safe child care has correspondingly grown.  Making child
care available can increase the productivity and earnings of both self-employed
women and those engaged in agriculture, as well as opening up opportunities for
women for addit
ional
learning and education.<b>  
</b><p>
<b>Freestanding Early Childhood Development Projects</b><p>
Projects on early childhood development have several different, though
complementary,  objectives; these in turn, call for different designs and are
directed towards different participants.  As well as delivering services to
children, projects are designed to educate caregivers, and to inform and
persuade the public of  the need for interventions.  Some projects concentrate
on one of these interventions, others combine them.<p>
<b><i>1.	Delivering Services to Children
</a></i></b>
<p>
<p>
<b>Colombia Community Child Care and Nutrition Project.
</a></b>
<p>
The Colombia program of &#147;Homes of Well-Being&#148; is a large-scale,
community-based response to malnutrition and delayed development that plagues
many of the country&#146;s five  million children under the age of six.
Children under six are cared for in groups of  fifteen  in homes in their own
neighborhoods. As well as meeting the care and development needs of the
children, the program improves the community&#146;s economic base by providing
paid employment to neighborhood caregivers, by freeing other women to seek (or
upgrade) employment, and by directing funds to local businesses for economic
activities related to the home day care (for example, improving homes,
supplying food).<p>
The program is firmly based in the community.  Community members participate in
an initial analysis of the needs for services, taking into account the
children&#146;s ages, family income and employment, and physical and
environmental variables.  If services are needed that the program cannot
provide,  connections are made with other organizations that can assist. The
community also decides how many homes are needed, and selects local women to
become home day care mothers.  A board of parents is responsible for local
management of  purchases and payments to the community mothers.<p>
This innovative program has responded to a substantial demand for home-based
child care centers in low-income neighborhoods in urban areas.  The program has
evolved from a pilot scale in 1987 to a national level,  reaching close to 0.8
million children by 1994.  It has become the flagship program of the Colombian
Institute of Family Welfare.  Funding comes from a payroll tax levied on all
Colombian businesses, with additional support, for project evaluation and for
nutritional supplementation through  a loan from the World Bank.<p>
The lessons learned in the Colombian project are being applied in Bolivia.
Bolivia&#146;s <b>Integrated Child</b> <b>Development Project</b>, which is
supported by the Bank, USAID, and public and private donors, targets poor
households in urban and semi-urban areas with populations over 10,000.   By the
end of its sixth year, 1999, the project is to have installed about 9,000
day-care centers to provide non-formal, home-based, integrated child
development services to over 200,000 children aged six months to six years
annually, or about 16 percent of all children living in urban areas.  An
estimated 16,000 pregnant women will be direct beneficiaries, either as
caregivers or as mothers of  children in day care centers. <p>
Special features of the Bolivian project are: <ul>
	a built-in system for evaluating impact through the Integrated Household
Survey, which will compare outcomes for participants and non-participants;
and<br>
	a high supervision ratio of one supervisor to 10 centers.<br>
</ul>
<b><i>2.	Educating caregivers 
</a></i></b>
<p>
<p>
<b>Mexico Initial Education Project.
</a></b>
<p>
This  project targets the most disadvantaged population groups in rural and
urban areas in ten states in Mexico.  It aims to improve quality and efficiency
of non-formal initial education through educating parents in home-based
childrearing practices.  The project centers on training about 900,000 parents
through periodic group meetings and home visits.  The training is done by
community educators, who are locally selected and paid a stipend; each works
with 20 families.  Teaching materials will include comprehensive illustrated
guidebooks and other educational materials to teach skills for caring and
stimulating children for cognitive, psychosocial, and social development, and
to provide basic education in health and nutrition.  Radio programs,
promotional and educational, are broadcast regularly by local stations to
advertise the project and motivate families to participate.  The project
finances training, design, and production of education and audiovisual
materials, and technical assistance to design an educational data and
evaluation system.  Even though children under three are the intended
beneficiaries,  they do not participate directly in the educational activities,
except during the home visits.  The parents are the direct participants in the
project.<p>
<p>
<b><i>3.	Creating Awareness and Demand
</a></i></b>
<p>
<p>
<b>Nigeria Development Communications Project.
</a></b>
<p>
Targeted to preschool children aged three to six in rural and urban areas, the
Nigeria Project pilots the use of mass media in early childhood development.
It will reach four million preschoolers of whom 36 percent already have access
to television.  For those who do not, access will be provided in child care
centers in fifteen local government authorities in ten states. <p>
The project supports:
<ul>
	the design, production, dissemination, and evaluation of instructional
materials to preschoolers and women; and <br>
	the development of institutions to produce materials and to manage and
evaluate educational television.<br>
</ul>
Instructional materials are disseminated by distributing videos through network
transmission, &#147;video on wheels,&#148;  and local viewing centers. The
newly established Educational Television Unit of the Nigerian Television
Authority will produce 130 episodes for preschool children with topics
including development of language expression and comprehension; skills to
observe, explore, and solve problems; prenumeracy, preliteracy, and social
behavior skills; and basic health and hygiene.<p>
<b><i>4.	Integrated Approach
</a></i></b>
<p>
<p>
<b>India&#146;s First and Second Integrated Child Development Projects</b>, the
largest program in the world,  illustrate the power of political commitment to
achieve significant rates of coverage for children under six.  These two
Bank-assisted projects are intended to reach about seventeen million preschool
children and seven million pregnant and nursing women in four States: Andhra
Pradesh, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, and Bihar.   The goals of the projects are to
provide a range of basic services to children, to expectant and nursing
mothers, and to other women aged fifteen to forty five; to create a mechanism
at the village level through which the services can be delivered; and to give
priority to India&#146;s low-income groups, including the scheduled tribes and
castes.  The two projects work through a network of Anganwadi
(&#147;Courtyard&#148;) Centers, each run by an Anganwadi Worker and helper,
usually selected from the local village. The Anganwadi workers provide
non-formal pre-school education, supplementary feeding, health and nutrition
education, parenting education through homevisiting, and maternal and child
health referrals.  The projects use existing services of diverse governmental
departments and of voluntary agencies, but overall administration
responsibilities lie with the Department of Women and Child Development within
the Ministry of Human Resources Development.  <p>
<b>India Second Tamil Nadu Integrated Project</b>.  This is one of the best
examples of  add-on programs which  not only enhance the development of young
children, but empower women.  It now reaches two million women and five million
children under three in 20,000 villages of this southern Indian State.  The
project objectives are to provide essential nutrition and health services to
pregnant women and young children, to educate caregivers, and to create
awareness and increase public demand for the services.  Community nutrition
workers were trained to provide services to children including monitoring child
growth, food and vitamin A supplementation, and deworming.   They teach mothers
and other caretakers on topics such as nutrition, breastfeeding and weaning,
diarrhea control and oral rehydration. The community nutrition workers are
carefully trained and supervised to help women in the community to form support
groups. These Women&#146;s Groups assist in spreading messages and encouraging
resistant mothers and caretakers to avail themselves of the services.  Many
groups also began food processing operations that not only provided
supplemental food for the nutrition program but gave women additional income
and employment opportunities as well.

<b>Early Childhood Development Work in Other Social Sector Projects</b><p>
Bank funding for early childhood development components in other social sector
projects has ranged from US$ 4.4 to 62.5 million.  The projects encompass a
broad range of activities, including revising preschool curriculum, expanding
preschools and day care centers,  and improving delivery of basic social
services such as water supply, sanitation, and food.  Some examples include:<p>
Brazil Innovations in Basic Education Project.  The early childhood component
of this project supports development of new curriculum for lower primary
schools, expansion of low cost pre-primary education provided by
municipalities, and reforms in the school health program to emphasize
screening, referral, and health education.  It also assists in developing a
six-year municipal preschool expansion plan.<p>
<b>Venezuela Social Development Project and Ecuador First Social Development
Project. </b>  Contributing to the general objective of establishing a social
safety net are projects to  support social programs including basic education
and health care services.  They finance rehabilitation of  basic health care
networks, expansion of pre-school education, community day care, school
feeding, and nutrition services for pregnant and nursing women and children
under six.<p>
<b>El Salvador Social Rehabilitation Project.  </b>As part of  its work on
poverty alleviation, the project expands coverage of primary health care
programs and pre-primary and primary education. The project is cofinanced with
USAID and UNICEF.<p>
<b>Guyana Health, Water, and Sanitation Project. </b> Designed to assist the
government in cushioning the social costs of the adjustment process,  the
project aims to improve  health and nutrition of women and children, through
financing food supplementation programs for children under five years and for
pregnant and lactating women.  It also finances the  rehabilitation and
equipping of health care centers and day care centers and the construction of
water supply and  sanitation drainage.  Over the medium term, the project as a
whole will assist the government to formulate a sustainable social sector
policy and program.<p>
<b>Chile Primary Education Improvement Project.  </b>In addition to improving
primary education, the project allocates funding to expand preschool education
for about 16,000 urban and 30,000 rural five-year-old children of low-income
urban and rural families.  It trains 23,400 rural parents in early child
stimulation; trains teachers and paraprofessionals;  and provides daily food
rations and learning materials. A study to ascertain the cost-effectiveness of
available preschool options for children&#146;s learning skills is also included.

<b>Working with NGOs </b><p>
Numerous nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have actively supported and
implemented early childhood development services in developing countries.
Nongovernmental  involvement has often been a key element in encouraging
community participation. The Bank&#146;s early childhood development projects
would be enriched by more NGO involvement; already,  NGOs have been useful in
assisting regional and local governments to develop the managerial capability
needed to move toward decentralized administration and management&#151;for
example, in several projects such as those in Colombia, Bolivia, and India.  By
making greater use of NGOs, the projects can reduce administration bottlenecks,
therefore reaching  more people more rapidly.  They can also assist in
implementing projects, for example in training of paraprofessionals,
caregivers, and in the monitoring of project progress.

<b>The World Bank Group</b><p>
<b></b>The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD),
frequently called the &#147;World Bank,&#148; was conceived in July 1944 at the
United Nations Monetary and Financial  Conference in Bretton Woods, New
Hampshire, USA.<p>
The World Bank operates under the authority of a Board of Governors.  Each of
the World Bank&#146;s 178 member countries is represented by one governor, who
is usually a ministerial-level government official.  The Board of Governors
delegates its authority to a small group of representatives, the Board of
Executive Directors, which is based in Washington.  The Board of Executive
Directors is responsible for decisions on policies affecting the World
Bank&#146;s operations and for the overall approval of all loans.  The World
Bank&#146;s president is the chairman of the Board of Executive Directors.<p>
The World Bank has three affiliated institutions:  the International
Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and
the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).  The headquarters of the
World Bank and its affiliates are in Washington, D. C.<p>
IBRD	The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has 178 member
countries as of July 1994.  The interest on World Bank loans to developing
countries changes every six months.  The current rate is 7.27 percent.  Loans
generally have a five-year grace period and must be prepaid during periods
ranging from 15 to 20 years.  In fiscal 1994, which ended on June 30, 1994, the
IBRD approved loans totaling US$14.2 billion for 124 economic development
projects and programs designed to restructure national economies in 44
countries.  Some of the money that the IBRD lends to developing countries comes
from contributions from the institution&#146;s member countries.  But the
majority comes from bonds issued in world financial markets.<p>
<p>
<b>IDA</b>	The International Development Association, established in 1960, has
157 member countries as of July 1994.  The World Bank affiliate provides
no-interest loans to the world&#146;s poorest countries.  Only countries with
annual per capita incomes of less than US$1,305 can borrow from IDA.  However,
most of IDA&#146;s loans are provided to countries with annual per capita
incomes of  US$805 or less.  IDA loans, which are known as &#147;credits,&#148;
have a 10-year grace period and must be repaid in 35 or 40 years (according to
the borrowing country&#146;s credit-worthiness).  In fiscal 1994, IDA approved
credits totaling US$6.6 billion for 104 development projects and economic
restructuring programs in 45 countries.  The money that IDA lends comes as
contributions from wealthier nations, an occasional contribution from the
profits made by the IBRD, and repayments of IDA credits.  Although legally
separate from the World Bank, IDA shares the World Bank&#146;s staff and
facilities.<p>
<p>
<b>IFC</b>	The International Finance Corporation, established in 1956, has 161
member countries as of March 1994.  It promotes economic growth through the
private sector.  Unlike the IBRD, it lends without government guarantees.  The
IFC may also take equity positions in companies to which it lends, play the
role of catalyst to other investors from the private sector, and work to
develop capital markets in developing countries.  In fiscal 1994, this World
Bank affiliate approved US$ 2.5 billion for financing for 231 projects and
other activities carried out by the private sector.<p>
<p>
<b>MIGA</b>	The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, established in 1988,
has 118 member countries as of March 1994.  This affiliate promotes private
investment in developing countries and provides investment guarantees to
protect investors from noncommercial risk.  In fiscal 1994, the total direct
investment associated with the 38 guaranteed projects amounted to  US$1.3
billion.<p>

<b><u>ADVOCACY IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT PROJECT</u></b> <br>
 <br>
<b>Project Field(s):</b>	Early childhood development <br>
<b>Products/Services:</b>	Promotional materials for AID 
<b>EDC Project Director:</b>	Andrea Bosch <br>
<b>Funder:</b>	USAID - Global Bureau <br>
<b>Duration:</b>	1995 <br>
<b>Location:</b>	Global - South Africa, Bolivia, India, Romania, Jamaica, and
Croatia <br>
 <br>
Early childhood development activities have been proven to have a positive
impact on children, families, communities and national policies.  While a few
activities have demonstrated how integrated, community-based services promote
sustainable development, there is little knowledge of their existence or
understanding of the basic principles that drive them.  This project introduces
holistic early childhood development concepts, including education, health,
nutrition and delivery systems to an audience of policy makers and implements
and facilitates dialogues around them. <br>
 <br>
A multi-media presentation on early childhood development highlights
USAID-supported activities in South Africa, Bolivia, Nepal, India, Romania,
Jamaica and Croatia.  The video presentations will be used to educate and
increase understanding of early childhood development.  A particular focus is
the intersecting needs between women and children. <br>

 <br>
The NEO project provides an integrated approach to improving the quality of
preschool and primary school education in Guatemala by focusing on child
health, environmental health, community empowerment, and social factors that
enhance and support education. <br>
 <br>
EDC responsibilities include designing the evaluation process, providing
technical assistance to support documentation of project activities, developing
and implementing nutrition-related interventions, and training local project
staff in nutrition and health-related issues.  The EDC evaluation of the NEO
project is based on an action research model which measures the change in
indicators and findings over time.  Some factors affecting the Active Learning
Capacity of children include nutritional levels, parasitation, general health,
the school environment, and parental attitudes. <br>
  <br>
The objectives for health-related interventions include reducing the incidence
of Vitamins A and C, iron and iodine deficiencies, parasitation, the number of
children who suffer from visual and auditory impairments and increasing the
knowledge and improving the practices of schoolchildren in the areas of
nutrition, hygiene and health. <br>

a joint venture of donor agencies, participating governments, and technical
institutions concerned with the relationship between health and school success.
The Partnership is carrying out research on a program that gives micronutrient
supplements to children, treats them for intestinal parasites with the drug
anthelmintic, and offers community-centered health education.  Colombia, Ghana,
Indonesia, Tanzania, Jamaica, and several other countries are expected to
participate in the program.  In each country, a pilot program will reach
between 50,000 and 100,000 children and will result in new information on how
health programs can contribute to learning outcomes for children in the
developing world. <br>

<b>Duration:</b>	1993 - 1994 
<b>Location:</b>	Bolivia <br>
 <br>
EDC is working with the Bolivian NGO, ONAMFA (Organismo Nacional del Menor
Mujer y Familia), to prepare early childhood materials to help caregivers learn
how to conduct developmentally appropriate activities.  A pilot project was
done to assess the effectiveness of audio-cassettes, games, stories and posters
in inspiring learning in children under the age of six and their caregivers.
EDC developed <i>Jugando en el Pidi</i>, an interactive radio program designed
for use with young children in child care centers serving children under the
age of six.  In Bolivia these are known as PIDIS (Programa Integrado por
Desarrollo Infantil).  The PIDI centers operate under ONAMFA through a World
Bank loan.  The interactive radio project was conceived of as a way to provide
appropriate learning for both the children and the teachers and to foster
interaction between them.  The curriculum has recently become integrated into
the national education curriculum for the PIDI project. <br>

<b><u>PRIMARY HEALTH CARE LEADERSHIP TRAINING PROJECT</u></b> <br>
 
<b>Project Field(s):</b>	Health Education, Leadership Development <br>
<b>Products/Services:</b>	Training, Materials Development 
<b>EDC Project Director:</b>	Charles Deutsch <br>

<b>Location:</b>	Global <br>
 <br>
In developing countries, and increasingly in industrialized nations as well,
health care and health education are conducted primarily by community health
workers.  villagers are given technical training in how to weigh and immunize
babies, teach family planning, demonstrate oral rehydration techniques, or
perform similar health care functions.  However, they are rarely trained in
human relations, communications, and leadership skills, which will enable them
to influence behavior changes in families and communities.  To build these
skills, EDC has developed a training manual for community health workers and a
second manual for their supervisors.  The materials are based on the assumption
that the ultimate success of the primary health care system depends on how each
health worker treats each client each day.  The manuals have been tested and
revised and used in a training workshop in Kenya.  The manuals are distributed
through the World Health Organization. <br>

Schools have the potential to reach a billion children worldwide.  Delivering
comprehensive school health education to these children must be a high
priority.  Yet, too few children have access to such programs and their
implementation remains a major challenge throughout the world.  EDC assisted
the WHO by developing background materials and conference documents for a
November 1991 consultation in Geneva, Switzerland.  The conference was attended
by 60 health and education specialists from Africa, Asia, Europe, and North
America and focused on the development of policies and action plans to make
comprehensive school health a priority for children throughout the world.  In
early 1992, EDC prepared a final document, including general principles to
guide action, as well as specific strategies.  It was widely disseminated as a
tool to advance comprehensive school health education on both the international
and individual country levels. <br>

The Weaning Project used a social marketing approach to improve infant feeding
practices in several villages in the Extreme North Province of Cameroon, which
is marked by great linguistic diversity.  Only 30% of households in the target
area own radios, and most village women have difficulty in understanding
broadcast Fulfulde, the only local language on the radio.  Further, literacy,
particularly among women, is quite low.  As a result, alternative channels of
communication had to be used.  EDC devised a strategy, with associated
&#147;Train the Trainer&#148; activities, that involved frequent and regularly
scheduled visits by community health workers for group discussion sessions,
combined with individual counseling, cooking demonstrations, and usable
pictorial materials. <br>

 <br>
This project had two major goals: (1) to assess the progress and impact of the
Modern Management Technology Component (MMTC) of the Village Development Family
Services Project, within the National Family Planning Agency (BKKBN); (2) to
test an interview and observation instrument as a means for revealing impacts
on decision-making within the BKKBN.  <br>
 <br>
The assignment involved interviewing staff of BKKBN, evaluating the design of
the MMTC, and examining hardware, software, training organizational structure,
communications system, and data management capabilities. The Final Report
provided conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the MMTC, the &#147;key
success factors&#148; contributing to that success, the areas in which the MMTC
required strengthening or redirection of effort, the future needs of the
program, and recommendations for future efforts and allocation of resources. <br>

 <br>
The goal of the Jamaica Primary School Nutrition Education Project was to
integrate nutrition education into the existing primary school curriculum,
specifically the language arts sector.  The project was carried out in
collaboration with the Jamaica Ministry of Education, UNESCO, and USAID.  The
project used social marketing techniques to provide formative research and a
planned approach to designing and testing the educational program.  A
community-based approach was also used to involve teachers and parents in the
actual development of innovative curriculum materials.  The reading manual and
support aids designed were as self-explanatory as possible and focused not only
on relevant nutritional concepts but also on realistic and appropriate actions
that students could take to improve their own health behaviors, thereby
becoming &#147;nutrition magicians.&#148; Evaluations showed gains in students'
nutritional knowledge, adoption of better eating habits and strengthened
reading skills. <br>

INCS collaborated with the Faculty of Public Health in Mahidol University on
the design and implementation of a hospital-based breastfeeding promotion
project.  The project resulted in improved breastfeeding support practices in
nine major hospitals where 78% of all births in Bangkok take place. <br>
 <br>
The project began with lactation management workshops for health professional
teams.  As part of their training, each team developed an action plan for
improving infant feeding practices in their hospital.  A series of targeted
infant feeding promotional materials for health professionals and mothers was
developed by a professional advertising agency; a set of infant feeding
guidelines for public health hospitals was issued by the Ministry of Health;
and hospital specific lactation management workshops were organized by those
who already had been trained by the project.   The results of this intensive
eighteen- month effort have been more supportive hospital policies for
breastfeeding mothers.   <br>

EDC has designed and developed a cultural learning program for the Laiwo Karen
living in the Thung Yai Wildlife Sanctuary of Western Thailand that would help
build Karen resolve to maintain cultural practices of sustainable forest
management.  The program would make use of interactive discussion groups led by
traditional elders and provide for a range of cultural reinforcement activities
for young people that would heighten cultural knowledge even as it was being
captured and transcribed.  It would make use of multi-channel language
instruction with Karen concepts of forest biology and resource management to
elevate traditional conservation values.  At the same time, the program would
provide multiple opportunities to strengthen the public's image of the Laiwo
Karen as responsible custodians of the Thung Yai forest. <br>

 <br>
In 1986, Radio Science Project and the National Department of Education began a
joint operation to develop and test a radio-based science course for grades 4 -
6 based on the PNG official national science curriculum.  The purpose of the
project was to improve science teaching in community (rural) schools, to
increase the children's knowledge of science and to make sure that information
was more interesting and relevant to the children of PNG.  The special
challenge of Radio Science Project was to adapt the interactive radio
methodology to a discipline that requires an inquiry approach.  Radio Science
Project was the first RI project to target student in the upper primary grades.
Since the completion of the Radio Science Project, EDC has maintained ties with
the PNG National Department of Education to assist in broadcasting the
lessons. <br>

This parenting/child development program teaches students about child
development and about themselves while they work closely and regularly with
young children.  Program goals include helping students become competent with
children, understanding how a child sees the world, gaining a sense of the
biological and social forces that influence child development, and exploring
their own identity.  Course materials, which include booklets, films, and
specific learning activities, are adaptable to the needs of learners of varied
cultural backgrounds.  Originally, developed for secondary school students, the
program was tested in over 500 classrooms around the country and has since been
used in over 7,000 school and non-school sites.  Materials developed for the
program such as films <i>Sarah Has Down's Syndrome</i>, filmstrip <i>Children
with Special Needs Go to School</i>, and booklet <i>No Two Alike:  Helping
Children with Special Needs</i> are currently used by Head Start programs,
social service agencies, church groups, parenting centers, hospitals, voluntary

Interactive technology offers exciting possibilities for expanding and
enriching young children's emerging literacy experiences in the preschool and
early primary years.  Multimedia systems can offer an environment rich with
moving and still images, sounds (speech, music, and sound effects), and written
text, in which children can play and experiment - constructing their own
meaning and maintaining control over what happens and what is created.  In
conjunction with American Interactive Media (a Philips/Polygram corporation),
EDC has designed a set of interactive video materials for early reading.  Aimed
at four-to-six-year-olds, the discs will run on a new interactive video system,
CDI (Compact Disc Interactive), developed by Philips, Sony and Matsushita for
the consumer market. <br>

Preschool, Head Start, and kindergarten teachers can help young children reduce
their aggressive behavior and develop alternative patterns of behavior that
will prevent involvement with violence in later life.  Young people who learn
non-violent ways of solving their social problems will be less likely to
experience harm from violence.  EDC prepared a book for teachers and caregivers
who work with children ages 3 to 7.  The book presents research findings on
effective classroom practices to reduce children&#146;s aggression, prevent
violence, and build skills in resolving conflict constructively.  It provides
teachers with numerous practical strategies for reducing aggressive behavior
and teaching children ways to prevent violence by examining how teachers select
materials, provide role models, respond to children&#146;s behavior, and teach
children the skills they need to solve problems effectively and non-violently.
The book is scheduled for publication in 1994 by the National Association for
the Education of Young Children. <br>

<h3><i>Latin America</i></h3> 
Within the Latin American region a large number of networks pertaining to the
young child have been developed over the past few years.  These can be
classified roughly as follows:<br>
<li>General child development communication networks:<br>
<ul>		<i>Red para la Infancia y la Familia de America Latina y el Caribe</i></ul>
<li>Thematic Networks:<br><ul>
<li>The Child Rights Network</i> <br>
		<i>Liga de Leche</i></ul>
<li>Sectoral or disciplinary networks (linked to health, psychology or
education)<br><ul>
<i>The International Society for the Study of Behavioral Development
(ISSBD)</i><br>
<i>		The Centro Latinoamericano de Perinatologia (CLAP)</i><br>
<i>The Latin American Network of Educational Information and Documentation
(REDUC)</i><br>
	</ul>
	An analysis of these networks is provided in the publication, <i>Hacia el

	The Early Childhood Development Network for Africa (ECDNA) is moving ahead.
As a result of a meeting in South Africa in February the proposal draft of
December 1994 was reviewed and changes made.  The new proposal was then shared
with donor agencies and the wider ECD community within Africa.  The proposal
was further refined at a meeting in Uganda, August 18-22, 1995.  The Uganda
meeting resulted in a revised proposal that focuses on the identification,
selection and description of 3-5 case studies of innovative ECCD programmes
(family-based, community-based and centre-based).  Results will be translated
into policy papers, videos, pamphlets, etc. for distribution to specific target
audiences.<br>
<p>
	The ECDNA proposal was shared at the Development for African Education (DAE)
Meeting held October 18-21 in Tours, France.  Included in the proposal is a
recommendation that the ECDNA be recognized as a Working Group within the DAE.

<b><i>Middle East and North Africa (MENA)</i></b><p>

Over the past few years the Arab Resource Collective has
organized a number of workshops/seminars designed to provide a networking
function in the region. <i> Dialogue 95 </i>was another seminar that is part of
the process.  It was held July 10-15 in Cyprus. The meeting brought together
practitioners and policymakers from different sectors who have specific
responsibility for ECCD and complementary programmes.  In addition to the
promotion of networking, objectives of the seminar included: to collaborate in
producing a conceptual framework consistent with the Convention on the Rights
of the Child; to guide programming; to set priorities for work in the region;
to organize subsequent training seminars; to promote networking; to establish a
newsletter; and to begin the compilation and assessment of existing Arabic
resources in ECCD.<br>

</head><title>The World Declaration on Education for All
</title><body><b>The World Declaration on Education for All</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
	In 1990 an important conference, titled the World Conference on Education for
All (WCEFA), was convened in Jomtien, Thailand by the World Bank, UNESCO,
UNICEF and UNDP.  The conference brought together some 1500 people representing
155 governments, 33 intergovernmental bodies, and 125 non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), institutes, and foundations.  Organized in response to
the widespread concern over the deterioration of education systems during the
1980s, the Conference concluded with the unanimous adoption of the "World
Declaration on Education for All" and endorsed a "Framework for Action to Meet
Basic Learning Needs."<b>[1]</b> Through these two
texts, the world community renewed its commitment to ensuring the rights of all
people to education and knowledge.<p>
<p>
	Two things were unique about this initiative:<p>
 <p>
	<b>1) <i>The breadth of its definitions of what is needed to make education
available to all</i></b>.  In addition to calling for universal access to
schooling for all children, the declaration reaffirms that "every person -
child, youth and adult - [should] be able to benefit from educational
opportunities designed to meet their basic learning needs."  These include
"both essential learning tools, such as literacy, oral expression, numeracy and
problem solving, and the basic learning content (knowledge, skills, values and
attitudes) required by human beings to be able to survive, to develop their
full capacities, to live and work in dignity, to participate fully in
development, to improve the quality of their lives, to make informed decisions,
and to continue learning."<p>
<p>
	The declaration reflects its grounding in the realities of people's diverse
needs by affirming that: "the scope of basic learning needs and how they should
be met varies with individual countries and cultures, and inevitably changes
with the passage of time." <p>
<p>
	The Declaration affirms the importance of early learning, by stating that
"learning begins at birth.  This calls for early childhood care and initial
education.  These can be provided through arrangements involving families,
communities, or institutional programs, as appropriate."<p>
 <p>
	<b>2) <i>Its focus on action</i></b>.  Countries were encouraged to formulate
specific plans and policies based on the Framework for Action.  To maintain the
momentum generated at the WCEFA, an International Consultative Forum on EFA was
established to promote and monitor the EFA goals and to facilitate
information-sharing among countries, agencies and NGOs.  The Forum Secretariat,
based at UNESCO headquarters, is charged with global monitoring and promotion
activities, and with organizing further meetings, publishing a bulletin, and
maintaining a database on EFA indicators and activities. (See Related Resources
for information on these). <p>
<p>
	As part of the action initiative, the Consultative Group Secretariat and most
of the CG sponsoring members have played an active role in promoting
EFA-inspired policies and projects supporting young children, and their
families and communities. <p><p>

<b>World Declaration on Education For All: </b><p>
<b>Meeting Basic Learning Needs</b><p>
<p>
<b>PREAMBLE</b><p>
<p>
	<b>More than 40 years ago, the nations of the world, speaking through the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, asserted that "everyone has a right to
education".</b>  Despite notable efforts by countries around the globe to
ensure the right to education for all, the following realities persist:<p>
<p>
	 	More than 100 million children including at least 60 million girls, have no
access to 		primary schooling;<p>
	 	More than 960 million adults, two-thirds of whom are women, are illiterate,
and 		functional illiteracy is a significant problem in all countries,
industrialized and developing; <p>
	 	More than one-third of the world's adults have no access to the printed
knowledge, 		new skills and technologies that could improve the quality of
their lives and help them shape, and adapt to, social and cultural change; and
<p>
	 	More than 100 million children and countless adults fail to complete basic
education programmes; millions more satisfy the attendance requirements but do
not acquire essential knowledge and skills;<p>
<p>
	At the same time, the world faces daunting problems, notably: mounting debt
burdens, the threat of economic stagnation and decline, rapid population
growth, widening economic disparities among and within nations, war,
occupation, civil strife, violent crime, the preventable deaths of millions of
children and widespread environmental degradation.  These problems constrain
efforts to meet basic learning needs, while the lack of basic education among a
significant proportion of the population prevents societies from addressing
such problems with strength and purpose.  <p>
<p>
	These problems have led to major setbacks in basic education in the 1980s in
many of the least developed countries.  In some other countries, economic
growth has been available to finance education expansion, but even so, many
millions remain in poverty and unschooled or illiterate.  In certain
industrialized countries, too, cutbacks in government expenditure over the
1980s have led to the deterioration of education.<p>
<p>
	Yet the world is also at the threshold of a new century, with all its promise
and possibilities.  Today, there is genuine progress toward peaceful detente
and greater cooperation among nations.  Today, the essential rights and
capacities of women are being realized.  Today, there are many useful
scientific and cultural developments.  Today, the sheer quantity of information
available in the world -- much of it relevant to survival and basic well-being
-- is exponentially greater than that available only a few years ago, and the
rate of its growth is accelerating.  This includes information about obtaining
more life-enhancing knowledge -- or learning how to learn.  A synergistic
effect occurs when important information is coupled with another modern advance
-- our new capacity to communicate.<p>
<p>
	These new forces, when combined with the cumulative experience of reform,
innovation, research and the remarkable educational progress of many countries,
make the goal of basic education for all -- for the first time in history -- an
attainable goal.<p>
<p>
	Therefore, we participants in the World Conference on Education for All,
assembled in Jomtien, Thailand, from 5 to 9 March, 1990:<p>
	<i>Recalling</i> that education is a fundamental right for all people, women
and men, of all ages, throughout the world;<p>
	<i>Understanding</i> that education can help ensure a safer, healthier, more
prosperous and environmentally sound world, while simultaneously contributing
to social, economic, and cultural progress, tolerance, and international
cooperation;<p>
	<i>Knowing</i> that education is an indispensable key to, though not a
sufficient condition for, personal and social improvement;<p>
	<i>Recognizing</i> that traditional knowledge and indigenous cultural heritage
have value and validity in their own right and a capacity to both define and
promote development;<p>
	<i>Acknowledging</i> that, overall, the current provision of education is
seriously deficient and that it must be made more relevant and qualitatively
improved, and made universally available;<p>
	<i>Recognizing</i> that sound basic education is fundamental to the
strengthening of higher levels of education and of scientific and technological
literacy and capacity and thus to self-reliant development; and<p>
	<i>Recognizing</i> the necessity to give to present and coming generations an
expanded vision of, and a renewed commitment to, basic education to address the
scale and complexity of the challenge;<p>
<p>
proclaim the following<p>
<p>
<b><i>World Declaration on education for All:</i></b><p>
<b><i>Meeting Basic Learning Needs</i></b><p>
<p>
<b><i>ARTICLE 1     MEETING BASIC LEARNING NEEDS</i></b><p>
<p>
<b>1.  Every person -- child, youth, and adult -- shall be able to benefit from
educational opportunities designed to meet their basic learning needs.</b>
These needs comprise both essential learning tools (such as literacy, oral
expression, numeracy, and problem solving) and the basic learning content (such
as knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes) required by human beings to be
able to survive, to develop their full capacities, to live and work in dignity,
to participate fully in development, to improve the quality of their lives, to
make informed decisions, and to continue learning.  The scope of basic learning
needs and how they should be met varies with individual countries and cultures,
and inevitably, changes with the passage of time.<p>
<p>
2.	The satisfaction of these needs empowers individuals in any society and
confers upon them a responsibility to respect and build upon their collective
cultural, linguistic, and spiritual heritage, to promote the education of
others, to further the cause of social justice, to achieve environmental
protection, to be tolerant towards social, political and religious systems
which differ from their own, ensuring that commonly accepted humanistic values
and human rights are upheld, and to work for international peace and solidarity
in an interdependent world.<p>
<p>
3.	Another and no less fundamental aim of educational development is the
transmission and enrichment of common cultural and moral values.  It is in
these values that the individual and society find their identity and worth.  <p>
<p>
4.	Basic education is more than an end in itself.  It is the foundation for
lifelong learning and human development on which countries may build,
systematically, further levels and types of education and training.<p>
<p>
<b>EDUCATION FOR ALL: AN EXPANDED VISION AND A RENEWED COMMITMENT</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b><i>ARTICLE 2     SHAPING THE VISION</i></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>1.  To serve the basic learning needs of all requires more than a
recommitment to basic education as it now exists.  What is needed is an
"expanded vision" that surpasses present resource levels, institutional
structures, curricula, and conventional delivery systems while building on the
best in current practices.</b> New possibilities exist today which result from
the convergence of the increase in information and the unprecedented capacity
to communicate.  We must seize them with creativity and a determination for
increased effectiveness.<p>
<p>
2.	As elaborated in Articles 3-7, the expanded vision encompasses:<p>
	 	Universalizing access and promoting equity;<p>
	 	Focussing on learning;<p>
	 	Broadening the means and scope of basic education;<p>
	 	Enhancing the environment for learning;<p>
	 	Strengthening partnerships.<p>
<p>
3.	The realization of an enormous potential for human progress and empowerment
is contingent upon whether people can be enabled to acquire the education and
the start needed to tap into the ever-expanding pool of relevant knowledge and
the new means for sharing this knowledge.<p>
<p>
<b><i>ARTICLE 3     UNIVERSALIZING ACCESS AND PROMOTING EQUITY</i></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>1.	Basic education should be provided to all children, youth and adults.</b>
To this end, basic education services of quality should be expanded, and
consistent measures must be taken to reduce disparities.<p>
<p>
2.	For basic education to be equitable, all children, youth and adults must be
given the opportunity to achieve and maintain an acceptable level of
learning.<p>
3.	The most urgent priority is to ensure access to, and improve the quality of,
education for girls and women, and to remove every obstacle that hampers their
active participation.  All gender stereotyping in education should be
eliminated.<p>
<p>
4.	An active commitment must be made to removing educational disparities.
Underserved groups -- the poor; street and working children; rural and remote
populations; nomads and migrant workers; indigenous people; ethnic, racial, and
linguistic minorities; refugees; those displaced by war; and people under
occupation -- should not suffer any discrimination in access to learning
opportunities.<p>
<p>
5.	The learning needs of the disabled demand special attention.  Steps need to
be taken to provide equal access to education to every category of disabled
persons as an integral part of the education system.<p>
<p>
<b><i>ARTICLE 4     FOCUSSING ON LEARNING ACQUISITION</i></b><p>
<p>
<b>	Whether or not expanded educational opportunities will translate into
meaningful development-- for an individual or for society -- depends ultimately
on whether people actually learn as a result of those opportunities, i.e.,
whether they incorporate useful knowledge, reasoning ability, skills, and
values.</b>  The focus of basic education must, therefore, be on actual
learning acquisition and outcome, rather than exclusively upon enrolment,
continued participation in organized programmes and completion of certification
requirements.  Active and participatory approaches are particularly valuable in
assuring learning acquisition and allowing learners to reach their fullest
potential.  It is, therefore, necessary to define acceptable levels of learning
acquisition for educational programmes and to improve and apply systems of
assessing learning achievement.<p>
<p>
<b><i>ARTICLE 5     BROADENING THE MEANS AND SCOPE OF BASIC EDUCATION</i></b>
<p>
<p>
<b>	The diversity, complexity, and changing nature of basic learning needs of
children, youth and adults necessitates broadening and constantly redefining
the scope of basic education to include the following components:</b><p>
<p>
   	<i>Learning begins at birth.</i>  This calls for early childhood care and
initial education.  These 	can be provided through arrangements involving
families, communities, or institutional programmes, as appropriate.<p>
<p>
   	<i>The main delivery system for the basic education of children outside the
family is primary schooling.</i>  Primary education must be universal, ensure
that the basic learning needs of all children are satisfied, and take into
account the culture, needs and opportunities of the community.  Supplementary
alternative programmes can help meet the basic learning needs of children with
limited or no access to formal schooling, provided that they share the same
standard of learning applied to schools, and are adequately supported.<p>
<p>
   	<i>The basic learning needs of youth and adults are diverse and should be
met through a variety of delivery systems.  </i>Literacy programmes are
indispensable because literacy is a necessary skill in itself and the
foundation of other life skills.  Literacy in the mother-tongue strengthens
cultural identity and heritage.  Other needs can be served by: skills training,
apprenticeships, and formal and non-formal education programmes in health,
nutrition, population, agricultural techniques, the environment, science,
technology, family life, including fertility awareness, and other societal
issues.<p>
<p>
   	<i>All available instruments and channels of information, communications
and social action could be used to help convey essential knowledge and inform
and educate people on social issues.</i>  In addition to the traditional means,
libraries, television, radio and other media can be mobilized to realize their
potential towards meeting basic education needs of all.<p>
<p>
These components should constitute an integrated system -- complementary,
mutually reinforcing, and of comparable standards, and they should contribute
to creating and developing possibilities for lifelong learning.<p>
<p>
<b><i>ARTICLE 6     ENHANCING THE ENVIRONMENT FOR LEARNING</i></b> <p>
<p>
	<b>Learning does not take place in isolation.  Societies, therefore, must
ensure that all learners receive the nutrition, health care, and general
physical and emotional support they need in order to participate actively in
and benefit from their education.</b>  Knowledge and skills that will enhance
the learning environment of children should be integrated into community
learning programmes for adults.  The education of children and their parents or
other caretakers is mutually supportive and this interaction should be used to
create, for all, a learning environment of vibrancy and warmth.<p>
<p>
<b><i>ARTICLE 7     STRENGTHENING PARTNERSHIPS</i></b>  <p>
<p>
	<b>National, regional, and local educational authorities have a unique
obligation to provide basic education for all, but they cannot be expected to
supply every human, financial or organizational requirement for this task.  New
and revitalized partnerships at all levels will be necessary: </b>partnerships
among all sub-sectors and forms of education, recognizing the special role of
teachers and that of administrators and other educational personnel;
partnerships between education and other government departments, including
planning, finance, labour, communications, and other social sectors;
partnerships between government and non-governmental organizations, the private
sector, local communities, religious groups, and families.   The recognition of
the vital role of both families and teachers is particularly important.  In
this context, the terms and conditions of service of teachers and their status,
which constitute a determining factor in the implementation of education for
all, must be urgently improved in all countries in line with the joint
ILO/UNESCO Recommendation Concerning the Status of Teachers (1966).  Genuine
partnerships contribute to the planning, implementing, managing and evaluating
of basic education programmes.  When we speak of "an expanded vision and a
renewed commitment," partnerships are at the heart of it.<p>
<b>EDUCATION FOR ALL: THE REQUIREMENTS</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b><i>ARTICLE 8     DEVELOPING A SUPPORTING POLICY CONTEXT</i></b><p>
<p>
<b>1. Supportive policies in the social, cultural, and economic sectors are
required in order to realize the full provision and utilization of basic
education for individual and societal improvement. </b> The provision of basic
education for all depends on political commitment and political will backed by
appropriate fiscal measures and reinforced by educational policy reforms and
institutional strengthening.  Suitable economic, trade, labour, employment and
health policies will enhance learners' incentives and contributions to societal
development. <p>
<p>
2. Societies should also insure a strong intellectual and scientific
environment for basic education.  This implies improving higher education and
developing scientific research.  Close contact with contemporary technological
and scientific knowledge should be possible at every level of education.<p>
<p>
<b><i>ARTICLE 9     MOBILIZING RESOURCES</i></b><p>
<p>
<b>1. If the basic learning needs of all are to be met through a much broader
scope of action than in the past, it will be essential to mobilize existing and
new financial and human resources, public, private and voluntary.</b>  All of
society has a contribution to make, recognizing that time, energy and funding
directed to basic education are perhaps the most profound investment in people
and in the future of a country which can be made.<p>
<p>
2. Enlarged public-sector support means drawing on the resources of all the
government agencies responsible for human development, through increased
absolute and proportional allocations to basic education services with the
clear recognition of competing claims on national resources of which education
is an important one, but not the only one.  Serious attention to improving the
efficiency of existing educational resources and programmes will not only
produce more, it can also be expected to attract new resources.  The urgent
task of meeting basic learning needs may require a reallocation between
sectors, as, for example, a transfer from military to educational expenditure.
Above all, special protection for basic education will be required in countries
undergoing structural adjustment and facing severe external debt burdens.
Today, more than ever, education must be seen as a fundamental dimension of any
social, cultural, and economic design.<p>
<p>
<b><i>ARTICLE 10     STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY</i></b><p>
<p>
<b>1.  Meeting basic learning needs constitutes a common and universal human
responsibility.  It requires international solidarity and equitable and fair
economic relations in order to redress existing economic disparities.  </b>All
nations have valuable knowledge and experiences to share for designing
effective educational policies and programmes.<p>
<p>
2. Substantial and long-term increases in resources for basic education will be
needed.  The world community, including intergovernmental agencies and
institutions, has an urgent responsibility to alleviate the constraints that
prevent some countries from achieving the goal of education for all.  It will
mean the adoption of measures that augment the national budgets of the poorest
countries or serve to relieve heavy debt burdens.  Creditors and debtors must
seek innovative and equitable formulae to resolve these burdens, since the
capacity of many developing countries to respond effectively to education and
other basic needs will be greatly helped by finding solutions to the debt
problem.<p>
<p>
3. Basic learning needs of adults and children must be addressed wherever they
exist.  Least developed and low-income countries have special needs which
require priority in international support for basic education in the 1990s.<p>
<p>
4. All nations must also work together to resolve conflicts and strife, to end
military occupations, and to settle displaced populations, or to facilitate
their return to their countries of origin, and ensure that their basic learning
needs are met.  Only a stable and peaceful environment can create the
conditions in which every human being, child and adult alike, may benefit from
the goals of this Declaration.<p>
<p>
     <p>
<p>
<b>	We, the participants in the World Conference on Education for All, reaffirm
the right of all people to education.</b>  This is the foundation of our
determination, singly and together, to ensure education for all.<p>
<p>
	We commit ourselves to act cooperatively through our own spheres of
responsibility, taking all necessary steps to achieve the goals of education
for all.  Together we call on governments, concerned organizations and
individuals to join in this urgent undertaking.<p>
<p>
	The basic learning needs of all can and must be met.  There can be no more
meaningful way to begin the International Literacy Year, to move forward the
goals of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons (1983-92) the World
Decade for Cultural Development (1988-97), the Fourth United Nations
Development Decade (1991-2000), of the convention on the Elimination of
Discrimination against women and the Forward Looking Strategies for the
Advancement of Women, and of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  There
has never been a more propitious time to commit ourselves to providing basic
learning opportunities for all the people of the world.<p>
<p>
	We adopt, therefore, this <b><i>World Declaration on Education for All:
Meeting Basic Learning Needs</i></b> and agree on the <b><i>Framework for
Action to Meet Basic Learning Needs,</i></b> to achieve the goals set forth in
this <i>Declaration.</i><p>

<title>Case Studies Presented at the New
Delhi Education For All Forum</title><body><b>Introduction to the Case Studies Presented at the New
Delhi Education For All Forum: Lessons Learned</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>by Judith L. Evans and Robert G. Myers<p>
<p>
	The three case studies presented at the EFA Meeting in New Delhi were
illustrative of ways in which government can be supportive of early childhood
programming.  Each case provides an example of a different programme approach.
In Venezuela a family/home day-care model has been developed.  The Kenya case
study shows a preschool programme for children from 3-6 years of age, and in
the Philippines the programme presented is one in which parent education is the
primary focus.  Each programme was developed in direct response to local need
and has expanded and evolved in line with available resources.  <p>
<p>
	For the Delhi EFA forum, each of the presenters was asked to include a brief
description of the country, its population and some characteristics of the
context within which the programme was developed. This was followed by a
history of the programme, a description of how the model works, what it has
meant to <i>go to scale</i> with the programme, and what lessons have been
learned in the process.  A summary of what was presented follows. Because there
are so any commonalities across the countries in terms of the lessons learned,
the following is a summary of these.<p>
<p>
<b>Lessons Learned</b><p>
<p>
While there are a number of lessons that have been learned by the three
projects that are specific to the kind of programme developed and the country
context, there are commonalities across the cases that are worth exploring.
They are as follows: <p>
<p>
1. First and foremost the cases illustrate the desirability of parent and
community participation in the process of developing the service.  They need to
be more than recipients of a service.  Programmes must designed in
collaboration with them and parents must be an integral part of its
implementation in order to assure sustainability.<p>
<p>
2.  Within the government there need to be policies, laws and structures that
provide support for the development of ECCD programmes.  Without political will
and commitment, localised ECCD programmes cannot hope to be expanded to a
significant degree or sustained over time.<p>
<p>
3.  Models for the collaboration of government and non-governmental agencies
and organizations are being developed.  Governments are unable to and should
not take on sole responsibility for the provision of early childhood
programmes.  Partnerships need to be developed which build on the strengths of
what both government and the nongovernmental agencies can provide. There is no
<i>right way</i> for this to happen.  The history, expertise and experience of
government and NGOs in each country will dictate the type of partnership that
it is possible to create.  These three cases represent different ways this can
happen.<p>
<p>
4.  To achieve an appropriate level of coverage, it takes time.  Massive
programmes cannot be implemented overnight.  The three cases illustrate the
importance of developing pilot programmes and evaluating them sufficiently so
that appropriate changes can be made as the programmes are expanded.<p>
<p>
5. The creation of supportive structures is crucial.  Those directly providing
the services need appropriate training and on-going supervision and support as
they work with children and families.<p>
<p>
The three cases presented at the New Delhi meeting represent different ways in
which governments can support the EFA goals of basic education for all. As
noted, no formula exists to guarantee success in every situation.  Programmes
need to be developed within the context of needs and resources, and with full
participation of all the stakeholders.

</head><title>PROGRAMA HOGARES DE CUIDADO DIARIO: PLAN DE EXTENSION MASIVA-Venezuela case study</title><body><p>
<b>Venezuela case study</b><p>
<p>
<b>PROGRAMA HOGARES DE CUIDADO DIARIO: PLAN DE EXTENSION MASIVA</b><p>
<b>		Family Day-care Homes Program: Massive Extension Plan</b><p>
<p>
Venezuela, a country located in the northern part of South America has a
population of more than 19 million (1991), 7 million (36%) of which are under
the age of 14; nearly 20% are under six years of age. <p>
<p>
	Venezuela is a country of contrasting realities.  On the one hand it is rich
in oil and has a well-developed technical sector.  Its per capita income is
more than $2,500.  On the other hand it has an extremely high urban growth rate
(90% of the population lives in urban areas) and high poverty rates (67% of the
population is rated as being in <i>total poverty</i>, 1991).  Further, the
majority of the population lacks sufficient economic resources, literacy rates
are low, and infant mortality rates are high.<p>
<p>
	In Venezuela the extended family has played a significant role in the
upbringing of children.  But the violent social and cultural changes occurring
during the last 15 years have affected the Venezuelan family, contributing to
its dismantling.  In many households the mother has a strong family presence
while the father is very often remote.  In the majority of families women need
to seek work outside the home.  To do that they need to find appropriate care
for their children.<p>
<p>
	In response to the needs of working women, and to promote children's growth
and development, the <i>Hogares de Cuidado Diario</i>, a home day-care
programme, was developed in 1974. It is designed to attend to the care,
nutrition, health, education and developmental needs of children up to six
years of age.  Home day-care was chosen as the model to be developed, because
it supports and enriches a natural form of day-care in which working women turn
to neighbours for help in caring for their children during working hours.<p>
<p>
	The Venezuelan home day-care programme was developed in two stages.  Phase I
was begun in 1974.  Within the basic model women in the community were selected
to receive training and provide care in their home for five children under the
age of six, two of whom could be their own. Mothers were provided with
appropriate equipment and educational materials to support their work. Every 20
day-care homes were supported by a technical assistance team consisting of a
social worker who was responsible for administrative and functional
supervision, a child care worker responsible for coordinating this programme
with public health organizations, and a teacher who guided the home day-care
mother in terms of educational activities to be carried out in the programme.
There was a Coordinator for every three technical teams. And for every eight
<i>barrios</i> there was a legal aid advisor, to be used as needed.<p>
<p>
	An exhaustive evaluation of the programme in 1978 showed that it had a
positive effect on children and families, but there were a number of changes
needed in order for the program to function more efficiently and effectively at
a lower cost.  But before it was possible to implement the recommendations,
there was a change in government and the day-care homes programme was put <i>on
hold</i>. In its initial version (Phase I), taking place between 1974 and 1988,
it attained a moderate coverage of approximately 10,000 children.  From 1979 to
1988 the government put more emphasis on developing more formal and
conventional preschool models.  Meanwhile, the home day-care model, with
appropriate adjustments, took hold successfully in other countries in Latin
America.<p>
<p>
	In addition to there being a change in government, the favorable economic
conditions that prevailed in Venezuela during the 1970s when the programme
began, deteriorated in the 1980s. Early on the government introduced an
economic adjustment programme to try to halt the economic decline.  This was
largely unsuccessful.  The marked increase in poverty rates during the 80s was
accompanied by a decrease in the percentage of the Gross Domestic Product that
the government assigned to social programmes, further exacerbating the
situation for poor families.  <p>
	In 1989, a major social protest which highlighted both the deteriorating
conditions of the 1980s and the potentially regressive effects of economic
adjustment forced the government to reassess its policies.  A social policy was
formulated focussed on alleviating the situation of the most vulnerable
sectors.  The social package was compensatory in nature and focussed on
providing direct subsidies to specific groups.  It incorporated more effective
management practices and promoted the involvement of non-governmental
organizations and the private sector in the delivery of social services.<p>
<p>
	An integral part of the new social policy was an expansion of the day-care
homes programme.  Phase II of the programme drew on previous experiences,
recommendations from the 1978 evaluation, established expertise and the new
political context. Phase II developments were guided by four objectives: 1) to
attend to the needs of young children up to six years of age belonging to the
lowest income levels; 2) to provide a direct subsidy to families at critical
poverty levels with children up to the age of six; 3) to strengthen the family
unit, particularly mothers (through education, improved income and increased
community participation) in the process of bringing up their children; and 4)
to strengthen the capacity of civil organizations to participate in actions
promoting the development and welfare of young children living in impoverished
conditions.<p>
<p>
	The Ministry of the Family administers and oversees the programme.  The
Children's Foundation, a private organization headed by the wife of the
President, sets guidelines, provides technical input and is responsible for
implementing the programme in about 75% of the locations. In 1993 almost 300
non-governmental organizations were also involved in implementation of the
programme.<p>
<p>
	The day-care homes programme continues to outfit homes with necessary
equipment and provide training for the home day-care mothers who now care for
up to 8 children for a period normally running from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M.  In
addition to the initial training workshop, mothers participate in periodic
<i>learning encounters</i> and in special workshops.  They are supported by a
supervisor who is responsible for overseeing 25 homes. In the selection of home
day-care mothers, preference is given to those who are: experienced in the care
of children; between the ages of 30 and 45; from a nuclear family unit; with
fewer than two children below the age of six; literate; and representative of
the average economic situation within their community.<p>
<p>
	In order to carry out her job, the home day-care mother receives monthly
allotments from the government for the care and feeding of each child and a
monthly allotment from the mother of each child.  In the poorest communities,
the mothers of participating children are not required to pay and the cost is
assumed by the government.<p>
<p>
	In Phase II a new variation on home day-care has been added: multi-home care
in which 30 children are tended by 3 home day-care mothers in a community
setting specifically selected or constructed for the purpose.  These are
designed to serve densely populated areas and have incorporated children with
special needs. <p>
<p>
	In 1992 and 1993 the Phase II programme was evaluated, using a representative
sample of day-care homes.  Information gathered was used to make adjustments in
the programme.  The programme is meeting the needs of women and children. The
experience has verified the viability of providing care in home-like settings
with community mothers in charge.  By 1993, after four years of the expansion
phase, the programme is reaching 236,000 children. The cost of the programme is
estimated at $39 per child per month.<p>

<b></b>	<p>
The nutritional part of the Venezuelan programme is the most costly component,
representing 59% of the monthly costs. Professional support for the home
day-care mother and administrative costs of the programme together represent
25% of costs, and the subsidization of the day-care home mother's salary is 23%
of costs.  The remaining 3% is for educational materials.  The programme
provides full-day care for the child.  While this is important in terms of
supporting the child's development, another major benefit of the programme is
that it is supportive of women's work outside the home. Thus the true
beneficiaries are not only the children but the families.<p>
<p>
	Venezuela provides an example of a full-day programme for children, which is
primarily home- rather than centre-based. In the Kenya case study the approach
has been to provide a half-day centre-based preschool programme for children
3-6 years of age.  While in Venezuela impetus for the programme came from an
understanding of the intersecting needs of women and children living in urban
areas, in Kenya the programme began out of concern for the educational needs of
the child, particularly those living in rural areas.  The Kenya programme has
since expanded into a more holistic view of what can be provided through a
preschool programme. But we will let the case speak for itself.<p>

</head><title>A CASE STUDY OF EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCATION IN KENYA</title><body><p>
<b>Kenya Case Study</b><p>
<p>
<b>A CASE STUDY OF EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCATION IN KENYA</b><p>
<p>
Kenya whose population in 1992 was 25 million, has one of the highest growth
rates in the world (3.8%).  59% of the population is under 20 years of age; 18%
are under the age of five, many of whom are in preschools because of the
commitment of parents and the community to providing a preschool experience for
the child. <p>
<p>
	There is a long tradition of preschool education in Kenya.  The first
preschools were started in the 1940s by and for the exclusive use of the
European and Asian communities.  Later preschools were developed in African
locations in urban areas and on coffee, tea and sugar plantations.  After
independence preschool education expanded throughout the country.  <p>
<p>
	An important variable in the widespread availability of preschools is the
<i>Harambee</i> or self-help spirit which the late President Kenyatta fostered.
In essence what this means is that when a community defines a need, it creates
a programme to meet that need. In many villages parents have wanted preschools
for their children and so they have created them. They find a location for the
class and choose a woman to care for children 3-6 years of age.  As a result
early childhood care and education programmes (ECCE) in Kenya serve the entire
cross-section of social, economic, cultural and geographic groups within the
society.<p>
<p>
	Prior to the 1970s there was no organized curriculum, nor other support
materials for use in the preschools, and many of those teaching in these
schools were untrained.  Because they lacked training, many of the teachers
used formal teaching methods equivalent to those used in the primary schools
with older children. To address the situation presented by the ever-increasing
numbers of preschools and the lack of appropriate support for them, in 1991 the
Kenya government, with assistance from the Bernard van Leer Foundation created
the Preschool Education Project, based at the Kenya Institute of Education
(KIE).  The objectives of the project were to improve the quality of preschool
education through the development of viable training systems, and the creation
of curriculum and other support materials for use by trainers, teachers and
children.<p>
<p>
	Several events during the 1980s shaped the way in which preschool services are
being offered nationally. In 1980 responsibility for preschools was shifted
from the Ministry of Culture and Social services to the Ministry of Education
(MOE) which is now responsible for the administration of preschools. The MOE
has an infrastructure that is able to provide support to preschools anywhere in
the country.<p>
	<p>
	Another important event was the move in 1983 to decentralize government.  The
focus of development was shifted to the district level. The result of this
shift is that district and local governments have taken on the main
responsibility for ongoing support of preschool education, while MOE is
involved in the formulation of policy guidelines for early childhood
programmes, registration of preschools, coordination of government grants and
funds from external donors, and provision of early childhood personnel at all
levels.<p>
<p>
	When the Preschool Education Project was evaluated in 1982, it was recommended
that the activities of the project be continued.  This was done through the
creation of a National Centre for Early Childhood Education (NACECE),
established in 1984.  This was followed in 1985 by implementation of District
Centres for Early Childhood Education (DICECE), to facilitate decentralization
of ECCE support. <p>
<p>
	NACECE is located within the Kenya Institute of Education and it is
responsible for: developing training systems for ECCE personnel; developing and
disseminating curricula for ECCE programmes; identifying, designing,
undertaking and coordinating ECCE research; facilitating interaction between
agencies and sponsors; coordinating and liaising with external partners; and
informing the public of needs and developments within the ECCE programme.<p>
<p>
	The functions of the DICECE are: training of preschool teachers and other
personnel at the district level; supervision and inspection of district
preschool programmes; mobilization of local communities to improve the care,
health, nutrition and education of young children; development of localized
preschool curricula; and evaluation and research related to the preschool
child. The DICECE are staffed by NACECE trained trainers, accountable to the
District Education Officers for their day-to-day operations.<p>
<p>
	Training has remained one of the most important functions of the NACECE/DICECE
programme because it equips teachers and trainers with knowledge and skills
which help them to provide quality services to children and to mobilize the
parents and local communities to improve the welfare of young children and
families.  Trainers are provided with a nine-month induction course that
includes a residential and a field component.  Teacher training involves a
two-year inservice course which has six residential sessions (during school
holidays) alternating with field sessions during term time.<p>
<p>
	In terms of the actual preschool programme, NACECE/DICECE has adopted a
holistic approach to the support of children's growth and development.  That
means that it seeks to include health, nutrition, growth monitoring and
promotion as well as educational activities within the programme. <p>
<p>
	One of the unique characteristics and strengths of the ECCE programme in Kenya
is its policy of encouraging partnerships, at all levels. <i>Parents and local
communities</i> are the most important partners.  They have started and
currently manage over 75% of the preschools in the country.  Parents and local
communities provide land and funds for the construction and maintenance of the
physical facilities.  They also provide furniture, materials and labour and
they pay the teacher's salary.  In some communities feeding programmes are also
a part of the preschool; parents provide the ingredients and prepare the food.
<p>
<p>
	Complementing the work of the community are <i>local authorities</i> who pick
up the costs (equipment, furnishings and teacher salary) of running preschools
in towns.  Fees are charged in these schools to help cover the costs.<p>
<p>
	From the beginning, <i>voluntary organizations, religious bodies and
companies</i> have been heavily involved in preschool provision.  Religious
groups have established their own preschools in the church/temple/mosque.
Firms, cooperatives, and plantations have also established preschools for
children of their employees.  The main support from these preschools is the
provision of physical facilities, materials, furniture, feeding programmes and
payment of teachers' salaries.<p>
<p>
	The <i>Ministries</i> involved in preschool provision include the Ministry of
Health and the Ministry of Culture and Social Services, in addition to the
Ministry of Education.  And as noted earlier, <i>external partners</i> have
been and continue to be important.  Over the years these have included the
Bernard van Leer Foundation, the Aga Khan Foundation, and UNICEF, who have
provided financial support for the training of teachers, the purchasing of
equipment and materials, curriculum development, and parental and community
education. NACECE has taken on the primary responsibility for coordinating the
actions of the various partners and involving them in a meaningful way. <p>
	Decentralization of the programme to the district level has provided
flexibility and variation in terms of facilities provided and activities
undertaken.  The preschool setting and curriculum materials, for example,
differ from place to place depending on the resources available, leadership
abilities and motivation of the communities. <p>
<p>
	Decentralization is a healthy feature of the programme. Communities are
allowed to develop appropriate, affordable and relevant services without
external pressure and competition, and at their own pace. The curriculum
guidelines developed by NACECE are just that, guidelines. Localized materials
in the form of stories, poems, riddles and children's games have been developed
which preserve and strengthen local culture and tradition. <p>
<p>
	The Kenya early childhood programme has grown because it is rooted in the
community.  Through workshops and seminars organized by the DICECE, parents and
community members have been encouraged and empowered to increase their
participation beyond provision of physical facilities. They provide the feeding
programme, they take part in collecting, telling and demonstrating stories,
songs and dances in the mother tongue.  The incorporation of tradition and
folklore into the curriculum make the community feel proud of their
contribution to the learning and development of their children. <b> The lesson
from Kenya is that the community is a very important resource for the
development of the ECCE programme and must continue to be tapped and
appreciated.</b><p>
	<p>
	Today the programme is serving more than 900,000 children.  This is
approximately 30% of the 3-6 age group.  Government expenditure on preschool
programmes is only one-tenth of one percent of the national education budget
(or $.61 per child per year).  This compares to 60% of the education budget
going to primary education, 15% for secondary and 22% for universities. The
great majority of the costs of the preschools are borne by the communities and
external donors. (Myers, 1992:23)  The current expenditure on ECCE activities
is extremely low.  If it were increased to even 1% of the budget it could
provide more comprehensive and higher quality services. <p>

[<b><i>comment</i>]</b><p>
<b></b><p>
In Kenya the programme has been able to go to scale because of its heavy
reliance on the community to sustain the programme, and the monies provided by
external donor agencies.  While this programme is not nearly as expensive to
the government as the Venezuelan programme, it would be a mistake to make
direct cost comparisons.  The Kenya model is structured differently and
designed to meet a different need.  In addition, while Kenya is experimenting
with growth monitoring and nutritional inputs, it has not yet built in some of
the costly health and nutrition supports that exist within the Venezuela model.
In addition, there is heavy reliance in Kenya on external support to maintain
the system.<p>

</head><title>PARENTS AS LEARNERS: TOWARD PARTNERSHIPS AND PARTICIPATION - Philippines Case Study</title><body><p>
<b>Philippines Case Study</b><p>
<p>
<b>PARENTS AS LEARNERS: TOWARD PARTNERSHIPS AND PARTICIPATION</b><p>
<p>
	The Philippines is the home of 11.5 million families, 62 million people
(1990).  Approximately 46% are below the age of 18, 14% are under the age of
five. The people are predominantly Malay, with Chinese, Spanish, Indian and
North American settlers forming the minority of the population.  There are 110
cultural and linguistic groups in the country; over 87 languages and dialects
are spoken. <p>
	<p>
	The Philippines is a land of contrasts.  The land is rich and blessed, but the
majority of the people live in abject poverty. There are wide disparities
between the life conditions of Filipino families across socioeconomic groups.
While the elite reside in well-guarded mansions, the plywood, plastic and
galvanized iron sheet 'homes' of the urban poor make up the biggest squatter
colonies in that part of Asia. Between 1985 and 1988 the top ten percent of all
families received more than one-third of all family income. 75% of Filipino
families live below the poverty line.<p>
<p>
	Beyond the physical and social contrasts, the clash of ideas between the
pervasive colonial mentality and the emerging fierce nationalism is evident in
the people's daily lives.   <p>
<p>
	The Filipino family is undergoing considerable change.  Rapid urbanization,
rural-urban migration, un- and underemployment, overseas employment, the
insurgency problems and continuing war in certain areas of the country are all
forces at work.  Also, the changing and emerging role of Filipino women at all
levels of society is a critical factor in the changing lifestyles and
structures of the Filipino family.<p>
<p>
	Traditionally, children have played a very important role in the Filipino
family. It is said that children give the Filipino family its form and
structure. Generally, parenting is considered a private, family affair.
Contemporary decision-making about parenting is a result of traditional wisdom
learned from parents and grandparents, blended with knowledge gained from
available literature. At best this results in a good balance between sound
indigenous practices that help to transmit the Filipino cultural heritage and
more progressive child-rearing practices.  Sometimes it can result in conflict
and confusion.  As families are faced with new challenges and traditional
supports are lacking, there is renewed interest in developing support systems
for parents to help them achieve a better balance.  <p>
<p>
	Parental support programmes have a long history in the Philippines. They were
begun originally in the 1930s by the then Department of Agriculture. Over time
parent programmes have been implemented by the Department of Health, Department
of Social Welfare and Development, the National Population Commission, the
Department of Education, and the Bureau of Agricultural Extension.  Government
efforts have been complemented by contributions from major donor agencies such
as UNICEF and WHO.  It is out of this history of parent support programmes that
the <b>Parent Effectiveness Services (PES)</b> came into being.<p>
<p>
	A basic premise of the PES is that by reaching parents it is possible to reach
the children.  PES was developed in 1978 by the Department of Social Welfare
and Development (DSWD).  To create the programme, groups of parents were
organized at the village (<i>barangay</i>) level to determine the type of
support they required.  To further understand the needs, parent congresses were
organized at the municipal, regional and national level with representatives
from the neighbourhood groups as participants.  A parent education programme
was then designed, based on what was learned through this consultative process.
A manual was developed which prescribes the content and methods for the parent
education programme. This manual is used by social workers as they work with
communities. <p>
		<p>
	PES, which currently resides in the Bureau of Family and Community Welfare
(BFCW) within the DSWD, is part of a much larger government-sponsored Early
Childhood Enrichment Programme (ECEP) that includes centre-based (day-care
centres, child-minding centers, supervised neighborhood playgroups) and
school-based programmes. The ECEP was developed in collaboration with UNICEF,
which funded the programme from 1981-1983. In 1984 the DSWD took over full
responsibility and now government funds cover salaries of programme
supervisors, training of day-care workers, and the purchase of teaching
materials for the home-based programme.  Since 1991, under the Local Government
Code, powers have been decentralized. Local government units are now directly
in charge of implementing the PES.<p>
<p>
	How does PES work?  The primary strategy within PES is to reach parents
through the Neighbourhood Parent Effectiveness Assembly (NPEA).  This is a
group of 10-20 parents who get together weekly to discuss common parenting
problems and their solutions. While families with children from birth to 6
years of age who might benefit from the programme are identified by the trained
ECCD worker from the local government unit, participation is voluntary and open
to all interested in attending. <p>
<p>
	A session generally consists of the following: <p>
1) Opening activities help bring the group together.<p>
2) There is a discussion of how the parents applied what they learned from the
previous session.<p>
3) The topic scheduled for the day is presented through an activity. This could
include such things as responsible parenthood, family relationships, health
care, child development, recognition and management of disabilities, nutrition,
etc.<p>
4) Specific activities are identified that parents can undertake in relation to
the topic.  <p>
5) The session ends with a summary of the major points and planning for the
next session.  Resource materials are available for parents to borrow and
purchase.<p>
<p>
	Home visiting is a complement to the NPEA.  Home visits are made when parents
join the assembly to orient them to the group.  The visit provides the social
worker with an opportunity to learn more about the family as well.  From then
on home visits are used on an as-needed basis.  When families require
additional support or when they have missed the group for a number of sessions,
or if parents request a home visit, these are made by the PES staff. A new
component of PES is a radio programme being developed in cooperation with the
Philippine Children's Television Foundation.<p>
	<p>
	There are two type of staff for the programme.  There are the professional
Social Workers, hired by local government. They receive a five-day training in
the implementation of PES.  Guided group discussion and role playing are an
important part of this training.  The social workers work side-by-side with PES
volunteers, who are parents from the community that have been trained to
facilitate the groups and conduct home visits.  Training for the volunteers
includes a 3-day orientation, followed by a one-month practicum.  This is
followed by another 2 days of training to consolidate what the volunteer has
learned and to plan future activities.  Annually there is a refresher
training.<p>
<p>
	In 1987-89 an evaluation was conducted.  It revealed strengths and weaknesses
of the programme, but by and large PES was deemed effective.  The issues
identified in the evaluation were addressed as an expanded version of the
programme was formulated. To strengthen the program, PES training was revised,
and in 1991 a new handbook was produced and additional materials were developed
for use by the PES volunteers.  <p>
<p>
	The evaluation revealed that the quality of PES depends greatly upon the
skills of the PES volunteer and the support mechanisms available to them
through the programme supervisors at the national, regional and municipal
levels.<p>
<p>
	UNICEF continues to be a partner in the implementation of PES. In the
programme of cooperation between UNICEF and the government of the Philippines
for 1994-1998 there are several proposed actions:<p>
<p>
	The <b>home-based programme will be strengthened</b> as this is seen as a
major strategy and a low-cost approach to providing ECCD services to children.
The expanded home-based component will be implemented in 7 depressed provinces
where there is a convergence of social services, in 13 provinces where the low
education levels indicate greatest need, and in 5 provinces affected by natural
and man-made disasters.<p>
<p>
	There will be <b>increased investment in training and supervision</b> and the
development of training materials.  The goal is to train 2,000 community
volunteers (parent leaders) as facilitators and 325 people to serve as
supervisors. 150,000 different sets of materials will be distributed to 3
million parents in 25 provinces.  Other materials will be developed to
facilitate training.<p>
<p>
	A core of trainers will train 900 (2 for each <i>barangay</i>) youth
volunteers on approaches and techniques in <b>mobilizing community
participation and support</b> for early childhood programmes.  Through the use
of theatre arts and indigenous folk media it is hoped to get the community more
involved in helping to sustain the programme.  One goal is to get a variety of
NGOs involved in the programme.<p>
<p>
	An additional goal will be to expand programme content in terms of:
<b>activities that promote gender equity; increasing the role of fathers in
child-rearing; and issues related to shared and single-parenting.</b><p>
<p>
	In 1978 when PES started it was being implemented at the municipal level by
120 social workers. In 1991, 143,000 parents were served. In 1992 this
increased to 160,000 parents (192,146 children) in 1,500 municipalities
throughout 14 regions of the country.  Working with these parents were 1,672
Early Childhood Care and Development workers in local government units and
1,452 PES Volunteers.  PES has also been implemented in centre-based programmes
by 18,633 day-care workers.<p>
<p>
	The costs of this programme were calculated, based on the government and
UNICEF input and the number of families and children served in 1992.  The cost
per parent was approximately $1.00/year.  The costs per child were $.81/year.
The time contributed by the parent volunteers was not taken into account in
these calculations.<p>
<p>
	In sum, all over the Philippines, through the PES and the many NGO programmes
for parents and families, lessons are being learned about children and parents
and how they grow, develop and learn. These teach us that an investment in
parents is a major investment in child growth and development. And while parent
education programmes will not be the major solution nor substitute for the
basic social services, they are part of a broader framework of community
development.<p>

Directions in Human Development and Family Studies: Research, Policy and
Programme Interfaces</title>
<b>New
Directions in Human Development and Family Studies: Research, Policy and
Programme Interfaces</b><br><p>
<body><a name="fn0">
<i>Those of us who are advocates of Early Childhood Development spend much of our energy promoting the concept of the </i>whole<i> child. We point out that children need more integrated attention than just nutritional help or cognitive stimulation. We ask decisionmakers, programme
providers, and parents to consider ways to support all dimensions of the
child's growth, and to pay attention to enriching the environment in which that child grows.  Applying that same kind of thinking to the field of ECCD the
Consultative Group promotes ways to link research, policy and programming, so
they can have beneficial synergistic impacts on each other.  Research is not
just an intellectual exercise; it is a process of refining our understanding of
young children and their needs so that we can be more responsive to them.
Quality programming is not just a curriculum exercise designed at a desk; it
arises from experiences, knowledge about the particular children being served,
and awareness of the specific social conditions for which it is being designed.
Similarly, as Judith Evans mentioned in </i><u>Creating a Shared Vision</u><i>, policy
does not exist in a vacuum.  It should be formulated with awareness of the
people it will affect, and should be based on experience, research and
programming.  As proponents of ECCD we are searching for ways to integrate
research, policy, and programming so that they can truly benefit each other.
In the following short excerpt adapted from his preface to the book, <b>Human
Development and Family Studies in India.  An Agenda for Research and Policy
</b>(Saraswathi and Kaur), Robert G. Myers suggests some possible ways of
viewing research, to take into account its interrelationships with programming
and policy.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
	<p>
<b>The Interconnections Between Child Development Research, Policy and
Programming</b><p>
<p>
Robert G. Myers<p>
	<p>
	The most frequent model used to connect research with policy and programming
is one in which research results are first created, then communicated from the
researcher to the potential user.  The communication may be face-to-face or may
occur in written or visual form.  Or, the research results may be<i>
brokered</i> by an intermediary acting on behalf of the researcher, such as a
policy institute or a professional association engaged in lobbying.  It may be,
also, that <i>basic</i> research findings are first transformed into an
application or technology and that application is then passed on to
practitioners.<p>
<p>
	This traditional way of thinking about research and its practical consequences
has several characteristics.  First, in this conception, the researcher and the
user are always separate.  Second, and following from the first, knowledge is
always transferred from one person to another.  Third, research results are
first produced, then disseminated (perhaps after being repackaged or turned
into a curriculum, technology or application).<p>
<p>
	When judging the success of the transfer of knowledge to action, there is also
a tendency to associate specific pieces of research or specific outcomes of
research with specific policies or actions in the world of policy and
practice.<p>
<p>
	This way of approaching the relationship between research and its use in
practice is not wrong.  Such interfaces occur and they can and should be
fostered.  However, this view of how to use research is limiting and, in my
opinion, probably does not represent the principal way in which research gets
converted to action.  What are alternative conceptions and what do they
imply?<p>
<p>
	One alternative model is that researchers might seek ways of informing a broad
public.  This is important for two reasons.  First, it gets away from the
assumption that all actions occur through governments.  Research can be used
directly by the public and can be <i>empowering</i>.  For example, the
successes of the Dr. Spock baby book in the United States, the best selling
book on early stimulation in Chile, and similar popular publications in other
countries testify to the potential efficacy of repackaging research results for
use directly by the public.  A second, less often recognized reason for using
the public as an audience is that, in democracies, citizens put pressure on
governments to change their policies.  While this change may occur over long
periods of time, such a use of research results can have an important impact on
policies.  In this case, the journalist, popular writer or even the television
actor may become important allies of the researcher who wants to contribute to
better practice.<p>
<p>
	Directing research results to the public barely breaks with the traditional
way of thinking about the research/practice nexus described above.  It goes
beyond the traditional tendency to associate specific research findings with
specific changes in policy.  It also opens up the timeframe, offering a
different way to influence policy, practice and those who set policy and plan
programmes.  However, the approach continues to separate researcher from user
and is linear in conception.<p>
<p>
	There is another, more radical way of thinking about the production and use of
knowledge.  In this view, the researcher and the practitioner come back
together; they are one and the same.  In this non-linear view, the
dissemination and use of knowledge begins to occur with the conceptualization
of a research project.  Knowledge is used and disseminated over the course of
the research process.  It is also embodied in the people who carry out the
research and who then use the knowledge, without having to transfer what was
learned to others.<p>
<p>
	We have a basis for this view in the literature on research utilization
showing that, "...for a study to exert a strong conceptual influence on
practitioners, interactions between researchers and practitioners must occur
not only on completion of the study, but also during and, ideally, before the
conduct of the study.  Also, many of these contacts must be face-to-face."
(Huberman, 1990, pg. 365)  What is still missing from this formulation is the
explicit notion of practitioner as researcher, and vice versa.  It is only then
that the possibility of a tie between research and use is maximized.<p>
<p>
	In this more radical view, we are led to think as much about <b>who</b>
carries out the research and about what they will do with the experience as
about the specific content of it.  We are led to the idea of participation in
research as a form of education. One common example is when graduate students
are involved in research (policy-oriented or not) with the idea that they will
embody the resulting awareness and move into positions as practitioners, using
what they have learned in the course of the research.  But it is far from being
the only case.  For instance, there are situations in which knowledge acquired
in research is put to policy and programme use because researchers themselves
move into policy or programme positions.  There are also instances when
practitioners are incorporated into research with the idea that the experience
will inform their own work.<p>
<p>
	In this view, attempts to incorporate practitioners directly into research
become as important as incorporating researchers into practice.	 One can
imagine, for instance, cases of classroom teachers who are involved in
continuing education or training that uses their own classroom as the
laboratory for research.  This is seldom done.  Given the proper atmosphere and
using methodologies that link action to reflection, such participatory research
can overcome the possible problems of bias in observation, can be done without
sacrificing rigor, and can lead to the immediate use of research results.<p>
<p>
	Incorporating policymakers into research is less common and more challenging,
but it may be possible to find ways to achieve it.  For example, exchanges can
be set up where not only do ECCD students carry out internships in government
offices where policies are made and programmes are directed, but also where
responsible individuals in government offices (or non governmental
organizations) can be provided with similar study opportunities.  These study
opportunities could revolve around projects directly related to their work and
around research that would inform their work.  <p>
<p>
	Participatory research can be designed to include parents, teachers,
supervisors, programme planners and policymakers.  Since each of these groups
has much to contribute to our understanding of young children and the
experiences which support their growth, it makes sense for ECCD researchers to
draw on them in their research projects.  Similarly, it makes sense for
researchers to reach out in a myriad of ways to (and to be sought out by) these
influential people, to make sure that the interconnections between research,
policy and programming are strong and vital.  <p>
<p>
	In the book for which this Preface was written, reporting on the results of a
Symposium<a href="bobpolic"fn.html#fn)">[1]</a> that explored the interface
between research and policy, several suggestions were made to facilitate that
interface.  The suggestions were based on the central notion that "the key to
effective linkages ... lies in better communication between researchers,
policymakers, programme planners and the public".  To communicate better it is
suggested that:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>	there is a need to communicate research results without using technical
jargon;<p>
<li>	research brokers be identified and a process of <i>lobbying</i> be
strengthened in which professional organizations and national research
institutes take on a more active advocacy role;<p>
<li>	use of the media should be increased, particularly in reaching the public;<p>
<li>	two-way channels be provided that include mechanisms for identifying gaps
and the kinds of questions that need to be addressed from time to time;<p>
<li>	an interdisciplinary task force be established by the government to evolve a
comprehensive framework for guiding research efforts, monitoring the
translation of research findings into implications for policy and programming,
and coordinating dissemination.<p></ul>
<p>
	Other specific suggestions for improving the linkages included:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>	encouraging policy-oriented research;<p>
<li>	building evaluation into programmes from the start and on a continuous
basis;<p>
<li>	sensitizing graduate students to the importance of policy-oriented research
and to the importance of making the linkages, by introducing appropriate
concepts in methods courses, by offering seminars for drawing policy relevance
from existing research, by encouraging research, and by establishing
internships in government bodies or advocacy groups;<p>
<li>	seeking a greater understanding of the policy and programme processes and
then selecting research topics with a <i>high impact potential</i>.  In general
these will be topics that are not only of current interest, but also ones that
must be treated in a culturally relevant way, in context;<p>
<li>	paying greater attention to research that delves into why some programmes
succeed and others fail.</ul><p>
<p>
	  For the most part, the above suggestions depend on some sort of interface by
researchers directly with policymakers and planners.  Major exceptions to this
are the suggestions concerning the use of the media to reach the public, the
incorporation of researchers into the evaluation of on-going programmes, and
the encouragement of students to become involved in research with a policy
orientation.  I would like to stress these exceptions precisely because they do
not depend on communicating research results directly or through brokers. <p>
<p>
	While it is often difficult to make these more direct connections and build
the desired partnerships  (It may require repeated invitations and personal
lobbying to get individuals from the policy or programming realm to participate
in research meetings, people from research and policy to participate in
programming meetings, etc.) it is well worth the effort.  <p>

<b>Childwatch International </b><p>
<p>
<i>Indicators for Children's Rights: a project to identify and develop
indicators for use in monitoring the implementation of the Convention on the
Rights of the Child (CRC).</i><p>
<p>
	To ensure effective implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the
Child, so that children really benefit from the protection it gives, practical
indicators, based on reliable statistical or other data-gathering methods, are
required.  These must be easy to collect, interpret and use, not only by the
Committee on the Rights of the Child, but also by UNICEF and specialised
agencies of the United Nations as well as national governments and the NGO
community.<p>
<p>
	The Committee on the Rights of the Child has called for indicators related to
the various articles of the Convention, that could meet some basic requirement
such as validity, objectivity, sensitivity, comparability, accuracy and
disaggregation, and has appealed to the UN system, NGOs and the research
community for assistance. In response, Childwatch International, in
collaboration with others, has designed a project to meet the needs expressed
by the Committee.  The project involves the development of indicators to
monitor the implementation of the CRC. Through a series of country case
studies, the project is developing a strategy for identification and
development of appropriate indicators. The project began in August 1994 and is
expected to be finalised by the end of 1996.<p>
<p>
	The results of the project will be presented in Country Case Reports, as well
as in a Summary Report that combines the results and experiences of the entire
study as a whole, with recommendations for future action and activities.  The
project will also produce manuals and other appropriate training materials on
the process of developing and using indicators based on easily available
quantitative and qualitative data.   <p>
<p>
	<i>Country Case Studies.</i>  A crucial feature of the project is the
sequential implementation of a series of country case studies.  Within each
country suitable indicators will be sought that can be reported on to the
Committee on the Rights of the Child. The process of conducting case studies
sequentially will allow for the testing of methods developed and provide the
experience from which conclusions can be drawn and recommendations formulated
for future studies. Through the involvement of national research teams in the
case studies, the project will contribute to capacity building within child
research and child welfare organisations in the participating countries.<p>
<p>
	In order to identify countries that could provide relevant experience for the
project and serve as a testing ground for various approaches, the following
four criteria are being applied:<p>
1.	Countries should have experience with the process of reporting to the
Committee on the Rights of the Child on their implementation of the Convention
and/or have prepared a comprehensive National Programme of Action for Children.
This is to ensure that the countries are either motivated to address the issue
of identifying indicators for children's rights, or have relevant experience
with seeking such indicators.<p>
2.	Countries should be in a situation that is comparable to and representative
of other countries in their region, and have socioeconomic and geographical
characteristics of sufficient complexity to produce a variety of living
conditions for children.<p>
3.	Countries should have research communities with the capacity to undertake
the case studies, an open and easily accessible government administration and
be easy to operate in.<p>
4.	Countries should have the presence of international development assistance
organisations (UNICEF, Save the Child, Plan International, YMCA) and local
NGOs, who have the potential to be brought into the project as cooperating
partners and supporters of the case study.<p>
<p>
	A pilot study in Senegal, concentrating on two articles of the Convention, was
completed in November 1994.  The report of this study was the subject of an
expert consultation process parallel to the European Conference on Monitoring
Children's Rights at the University of Gent, December 11-14, 1994.  The full
case study took place between January and April 1995. Depending on a number of
factors, including securing adequate funding, case studies of Vietnam,
Thailand, the Philippines, Zimbabwe and Nicaragua are likely to be carried out.
Future plans include possible studies in Armenia, Belgium and Chile.<p>
<p>
	<i>Preliminary Conclusions from the Pilot Study.</i>  The experience of the
case study in Senegal has led to the following conclusions:<p>
<p>
1.	It is not desirable to seek a single universal set of indicators, but rather
a core of universal indicators that are appropriate to identifiable
bio-physiological aspects of child development, together with a process and a
framework that can be used to develop indicators for children's rights that are
culturally and nationally appropriate.<p>
2.	It is important to work internationally towards the establishment of data
collection methods that are child-centred.  Current data sets depend more on
the needs of agencies than the needs of children.  Nevertheless, the regular
data collecting methods of both governments and non-governmental organisations
often provide raw data that can be recalculated to produce child-centred
information.  Moreover, there is potential for regular data collection systems
to be modified in the future, at little cost, to improve information on the
progressive achievement of children's rights.<p>
3.	Children's rights indicators require not only child-centred data but also
high degrees of disaggregation, for both baseline and monitoring indicators.
This could be achieved through recalculation of existing data.<p>
4.	An enormous amount of information about children, both qualitative and
quantitative already exists.  Much of this is good quality, but varies with
respect to accessibility, analysis and sheer physical condition.  One aim of
the country studies will be to establish modelling procedures by which existing
data sets can be reconciled in order to provide meaningful information.<p>
5.	Country case studies can act as catalysts for stimulating new levels of
debate, cooperation and capacity-building.<p>
6.	Fruitful lines for future development of monitoring indicators are evident.
Among these are the use of existing data collection points (schools, clinics,
NGO community projects, etc.) on a regular basis.<p>
<p>
	As the country case studies take place, meetings between country research
teams are planned, to achieve a standardisation of process and a framework for
the methodologies and methods developed for this project.  These gatherings
will serve as a contribution to national, regional, and international
capacity-building in child research and social indicators, as the participants
will be in contact with state-of-the-art methodology and have an opportunity to
apply their experiences in an international comparative study.<p>
<p>
	In this project there is close collaboration between Childwatch and other
agencies and organisations, international and national.  These include UNICEF,
Save The Children, Plan International, the Children's Rights Centre at the
University of Gent, the Conseil pour le Developement de la Recherche Economique
et Social en Afrique (CODESRIA), and Defense for Children International.<p>
<p>
	The primary target for the results of the study will be the Committee on the
Rights of the Child, which is seeking tools to assess the implementation of
children's rights in countries that have ratified the Convention.  The
information will also be of value to inter-governmental and non-governmental
organisations involved in facilitating implementation of the CRC.  Last, but
not least, the data will be made accessible to the general public through such
media efforts as the Childwatch TV Project which annually will provide an
update on the status of the world's children. <p>

<b>Participatory Development Communication and Basic Education. Needs and
Perspectives within the Context of West and Central Africa: A Consultative
meeting on IDRC's Programme in Development Communication,</b> February 10-11,
1995*<p>
<p>
	The International Development Research Centre (IDRC) supports research
projects for sustainable and equitable development in the world.  The IDRC
defines development communication as a process that brings together groups and
communities to identify problems, seek solutions and put them into action.
Real and lasting improvement can only be achieved when people take
responsibility for the process: participatory communication's ultimate goal is
to involve people in the development process.  <p>
<p>
	Research in Development Communication is a project, developed by IDRC, which
focuses on Sub-Saharan Africa.  Nine countries were selected as representing
regional diversity: Mali, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Benin, Guinea,
Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon.  The project will use participatory methodology
and include representatives from NGOs and community movements in the areas of
health, education, literacy, rural development and integration of women.
Participatory consultation conducted in the region, at a meeting in Ougadougou,
Burkina Faso, in November 1994, identified Participatory Communication for
Basic Education as a priority theme. <i> The participants decided that the
target group for the project should be women and young girls.</i><p>
<p>
	The meeting on February 10-11, 1995 brought together 60 participants from
Africa, Malaysia, USA and Canada to debate the best ways to develop, orient and
structure the programme.  Discussion groups focused on the role of
participatory development communication as a tool for nonformal basic
education; the potential of women and young girls as communicators (roles and
cultural barriers) and their specific needs in relation to nonformal basic
education; training needs in participatory development communication and
related research activities; and implementation of a regional Secretariat for
the Research Program in Development Communication.<p>
<p>
	In discussions on basic education, the group debated definitions of basic
education and participatory communication and examined the potential
contribution of participatory development communication.  The discussion on
women and young girls focused on the obstacles and barriers facing women in the
process as well as their role and potential.  Another group attempted to define
the training needed, its target participants, objectives and content, while a
fourth group came up with a concrete plan to establish a regional secretariat
for the project.<p>

<head></head><title>Children's Television Charter</title>
<body><b>Children's Television Charter, </b> presented at the <b>World Summit on
Television and Children</b>, Melbourne Australia, March 1995.<p>
Report submitted by Feny de los Angeles Bautista, Field Representative,
Consultative Group on ECCD<p>
<p>
	A Children's Television Charter was developed and presented at the World
Summit on Television and Children, held in Australia in March, 1995.  At the
Summit the Charter was discussed in depth by delegates from over 70 countries.
It was then revised by a representative group of Summit delegates.<p>
<p>
	The Charter is conceived as a worldwide television industry commitment to
principles embodied in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
which has been ratified by over 90% of the world's governments.<p>
<p>
	The Charter will be circulated for endorsement to children's television
industry leaders worldwide, including all 637 Summit delegates.  The Charter
will be made public to ensure that viewers have a standard against which to
judge provision for their children.  Telecasters and producers will be urged to
heed its seven points when making decisions concerning programme production,
acquisition and distribution.  Advocacy groups, researchers and festivals will
be encouraged to adopt the Charter as the standard for evaluating service to
young people.  <p>
<p>
	Governments, advertisers and funding organizations are called on to recognize
the need for stable, adequate support for domestic children's television. Those
companies that endorse the Charter will be asked to report annually on their
own performance vis-a-vis the Charter's standards.  "This report will be a
valuable strategic tool for those companies that take it seriously," said Anna
Home, President of the European Broadcasting Union Working Group on Children's
and Youth Programming, and the author of the first draft of the Charter.<p>
	<p>
The Children's Television Charter<p>
<p>
	As stated in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which
has been ratified by more than 170 countries, broadcasters should recognize
children's rights in the production of children's television programmes.  As
those responsible for the world's most powerful and widespread medium, and its
services to children, we accept our obligation to entertain, inform, engage and
enlighten young people in accord with these principles.  Specifically:<p>
<p>
1	Children should have programmes of high quality which are made specifically
for them, and which do not exploit them.  These programmes, in addition to
entertaining, should allow children to develop physically, mentally and
socially to their fullest potential.<p>
2.	Children should hear, see and express themselves, their culture, their
languages and their life experiences, through television programmes which
affirm their sense of self, community and place.<p>
3.	Children's programmes should promote an awareness and appreciation of other
cultures in parallel with the child's own cultural background.<p>
4.	Children's programmes should be wide-ranging in genre and content, but
should not include gratuitous scenes of violence and sex.<p>
5.	Children's programmes should be aired in regular slots at times when
children are available to view, and/or distributed via other widely accessible
media or technologies.<p>
6.	Sufficient funds must be made available to make these programmes to the
highest possible standards.<p>
7.	Governments and production, distribution and funding organisations should
recognize both the importance and vulnerability of indigenous children's
television, and take steps to support and protect it.<p>

<b>Dialogue 95, </b> <b> First Annual Consultative Days , </b>Cyprus 10-15
July, 1995.<p>
Report submitted by Indu Balagopal, Field Representative, Consultative Group on
ECCD.<p>
<p>
The Arab Resource Collective is promoting the idea of Early Childhood Care and
Development in Arab societies by bringing together the Regional Consultative
Resource Group (RCRG) and other people working with children.  The conceptual
framework was first developed in a workshop in May 1992, where workers in ECCD
identified the challenges and needs they face in their daily efforts.  Working
with parents and communities was adopted as the priority challenge, and a
series of local and regional activities were organized to develop human and
material resources responding to this challenge.<p>
<p>
	In December 1994, the regional workshop on Partnership for a Better Childhood
updated the challenges, while including more countries from the Arab region.
The various discussions held in December 1994 demonstrated that a serious
effort in systematizing and expanding the regional ECCD network was needed to
consolidate, enrich, evaluate and expand existing initiatives in the region.
One of the ARC's objectives at this stage of ECCD programmes in the Arab world
is to facilitate a collective ownership of such programmes, and to discuss the
strategy for a work plan to make them sustainable.<p>
<p>
	In July 1995, the ARC convened the <i>First Annual Consultative Days: Dialogue
95</i>, to bring together the RCRG and a group of partners to develop
collectively a five-year work plan for the region.  There were practitioners,
academics and other consultants who tried to find a balance between ECCD
principles and practices without compromising the regional culture and
traditions.<p>
<p>
	<i>Rationale. </i>During the last decade there has been an emergence of
interest, dialogue and action to raise awareness in the Arab society of the
importance of the early childhood period.  This has resulted in institutions,
NGOs, individuals and occasionally government organizations, moving from a
health-dominated focus towards a holistic, more child-centred approach.  This
includes health, education and the welfare of the child and involves
partnerships at every level.  There is now a global understanding of education
which fosters a more active, interactive, independent style of learning, as
opposed to acquisition of facts and knowledge through formal methods of
teaching.  This has a bearing on the attitudes, perception and priorities of
adults living and working with young children.  This change presents a
challenge requiring coordinated effort to facilitate the transition to ECCD.<p>
<p>
The Strategy to be undertaken includes the following:<p>
*	To facilitate the collective formulation of a philosophical framework for
ECCD relevant to the Arab world.<p>
*	To strengthen the interdisciplinary communications and partnerships for ECCD
within the region.<p>
*	To provide an opportunity for exchange of information on new initiatives in
ECCD which offer complementary and sustainable programmes, in order to reach an
increasing number of children, families and their communities.<p>
*	To further the development of a common professional language to facilitate
the understanding of concepts and to enable the practitioner to communicate,
exchange and develop skills, knowledge, values and attitudes within the ECCD
community.<p>
*	To identify, evaluate and encourage the development of relevant ECCD
resources in Arabic and to facilitate their access, exchange and use by all the
partners in ECCD.<p>
<p>
Toward achieving this, the objectives of the workshop were:<p>
*	To develop a conceptual framework, based on the values and culture of the
family and local community in Arab societies, integrating the principles of
ECCD and the provisions of the Rights of the Child.<p>
*	To agree on the priority challenges and themes to be the focus on ARC's ECCD
regional and local activities for the next three years.<p>
*	To recommend methods of networking among workers, plan the production of
country profiles, and develop a regional status report on ECCD.<p>
*	To establish the concept of a newsletter, to become one of the instruments of
communication and networking.<p>
*	to contribute to the process of compilation and assessment of existing Arabic
resources in ECCD.<p>
<p>
	<i>Outcome</i>. An overall framework based on the integrated approach to ECCD
relevant to the Arab world was taken as the reference for planning,
data-gathering and establishing local and regional networks to improve
communication and facilitate access to available human and material resources.
The framework combined Early Childhood principles with the Convention on the
Rights of the Child to provide the basis for ECCD programmes as well as for the
criteria to evaluate such programmes.<p>
<p>
	As the first step, the principles of ECCD as applicable to the Arab culture
and practices were analyzed and reworded to make them more explicit and
acceptable.  After extensive and intensive discussions, the principles were
agreed upon.  Every word and expression had to be carefully chosen in the
translation into Arabic, as it had to convey the exact meaning and one that
could be understood in all the Arab speaking countries.<p>
<p>
	One of the major concerns was the erosion of culture in the Arab world, with
the influence of outside cultures replacing existing beliefs, attitudes and
practices with modern ideas, thus disorienting the community.  This, combined
with the everchanging milieu of political unrest and displacements in crisis
and chaos, contributes to the loss of identity of the child and family, leading
to confused communities.  It was established that the tension between tradition
which is stable, and culture which is dynamic, was inevitable, and that it was
important to value culture and respect tradition.  The challenge was to move
from a purely traditional society to one which is open, without undermining its
integrity.<p>
<p>
	It was pointed out that ECCD should not dismiss the heritage accumulated by
society throughout its history, but reexamine this heritage in view of new
knowledge about child development.  These discussions were particularly
relevant for the Palestinians.  In the principles of ECCD a new dimension was
added in reference to the child's cultural identify and values, and
mothertongue, as being central to the child's healthy and integrated
development.<p>
<p>
	Another important point was that of valuing the role of parents, extended
family and community, as is mandated by local tradition, in the education and
development of the child.<p>
<p>
	Finally, it was agreed that every child had a right to happiness, and that
adults in the child's environment could not deny the child this right.<p>
<p>
	During the discussions it became clear that a common glossary of ECCD terms
needed to be developed in order to convey the field to practitioners.  The
conceptual diversity found in ECCD programmes could be used to enrich the
experiences.  ARC is in a position to encourage the development of a common
language by facilitating a regional orientation to ECCD through networking,
initiating regional workshops and conferences, establishing a newsletter,
enhancing ECCD resource materials, etc. <p>
<p>
	The proposed plan includes expanding the regional network and starting a
regional newsletter to share knowledge and experiences.  To achieve this, local
workshops will be organized, a regional data base will be established, and
resource materials will be reviewed and evaluated. As an outcome of this plan
there will be an ECCD status report developed from ECCD country profiles.
Through this process human and material resources for ECCD will be developed in
the region.<p>
<p>
	It is now planned to have a "Dialogue" every year to review progress and
update challenges.<p>

<title>Third Symposium on Programs of Integrated Child Development in Contexts
of Poverty </title>
<body>
<b>Organisation of American States - Costa Rica, September 25-29, 1995</b><p>
 
	The <i>Third Symposium on Programs of Integrated Child Development in Contexts
of Poverty </i>was held in San Jose Costa Rica from September 25th to 29th.
The meeting was organized by the Ministry of Education of Costa Rica and the
Organization of American States, with assistance from UNICEF, UNESCO and PAHO.
Approximately 670 people from 25 countries participated.  Highlights of the
meeting included:<p>
<p>
	- 	An opening session that included a meaty presentation by the Vice President
of Coast Rica, Rebecca Gryspan, who explored <i>The Concept of Poverty in Latin
America and Strategies for Overcoming It</i>, and an excellent speech by the
Minister of Education, Eduardo Doryan.<p>
	-	A panel dealing with <i>Criteria for the Formulation of Policies and
Programs Favoring Children,</i> with presentations by respected government
officials from Peru, El Salvador and Costa Rica.<p>
	-	A presentation by Ruben Katzman from the Economic Council of Latin America
who, within a description of economic and social trends in the Latin American
region, emphasized inequities in the distribution of services for children and
attention to young children and noted an important relationship between family
structure and poor performance in school.<p>
	-	Sessions dealing with the quality of ECCD programs, children&#146;s rights,
children in especially difficult circumstances, the psycho-social needs of
children and families, lessons learned from successful early childhood
programs, and the relationship between research and policy. Robert Myers
presented a paper on this topic.<p>
	-	A teleconference by way of the WORLDNET television system that permitted
interaction between selected participants in the symposium and Patricio Alwyn,
Chilean President, Cesar Gaviria, Secretary General of the OAS, and Helen
Taylor, from the office of Head Start in the USA.<p>
	-	A cameo appearance and message from the President of Costa Rica.<p>
-	Full-day visits to selected early childhood programs in different parts of
Coast Rica.<p>
<p>
	Included in the conclusions of the meeting was a proposal that the Minister of
Education and the President of Costa Rica agreed to present to the up-coming
meeting of the Latin American Presidents in Bariloche which is to focus on
educational policy in the region.  The proposal is that leaders subscribe to a
goal of reducing by 50% over the next 10 years, the percentage of children who
enter the first grade of primary school with delays or distortions in their
psycho-social development.  Also included in the conclusions was a<i>
decalogue</i> of basic actions to be taken by parents in order to favor the
integral development of children during the early years.<p>

<b>1.	 INTRODUCTION</b><p>
<p>
	In the initial phase of this Project many problems were revealed and a range
of opportunities have been identified which could contribute to child care in
Bulgaria.  In the numerous contacts established, a general desire to do
something constructive emerged among all those involved in this area, and it
was agreed to develop a research plan that will first, meet the goals of this
Project, and second, provide an opportunity to go beyond this study and promote
other activities which will lead to improved child care.<p>
<p>
	All our partners perceived this Project as an extremely valuable initiative
that may have important implications for the improvement of child care in
Bulgaria.<p>
<p>
	Our study focussed on three main practical goals which go beyond the scope of
this study. However, we hope to advance significantly on achieving each of
these goals within the current Project.<p>
<p>
<i>1.1	Collection of relevant information and making it accessible to
researchers and caregivers.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
	During the course of the study we found that considerable data already exist
in the country, both as statistics and as research results.  However, most of
the information is virtually unknown and inaccessible to the scientific
community and caregivers, either because there is no way to learn about those
studies unless you happen to know personally who did what or because some of
the information is in private hands and may be provided only under specific
conditions.<p>
<p>
	In essence, there is simply no information infrastructure to serve the
interested individuals and agencies. There is rarely any connection and
information exchange between research teams and agencies. And many interesting
results are buried in files which are not accessible to the public.<p>
<p>
	Therefore, a first goal for us was to use all our resources to gather as much
information as possible on the various sources and develop a reference data
base. <p>
<p>
<i>1.2.	Developing a framework for comparison of Bulgarian data with
international data.</i><p>
<p>
	Bulgarian national statistics will be harmonized within the next few years
with those of the international statistical bodies (a contract has already been
signed with Eurostat to this objective). Currently, there is some divergence
between the parameters and criteria used in the development of  local
statistics and research compared to the data collected in other countries so it
is difficult to make comparisons.  We believe that information and research in
the field of child care should be made compatible with studies in other
countries.<p>
<p>
	  Over the past few years, significant amounts of foreign aid have been
granted to Bulgaria.  Local private sponsors have also donated significant sums
of money to aid specific groups of disadvantaged children. We are certain that
the available resources can be used much more efficiently if a more precise
diagnosis of problems is made and if relevant experience gained in other
countries is used in devising strategies to improve child care in Bulgaria.<p>
<p>
	Thus our second goal has been to develop appropriate tools to ensure
compatibility of Bulgarian statistics and research results with those from
studies in other countries. Within this Project, we make available much of the
relevant information so that teams from the other participating countries from
Eastern Europe can compare the data and devise ways to improve the data
collection instruments and harmonize the analytical categories.<p>
<p>
<i>1.3.	Development of a medium-


and long-

term
strategy for specific action to improve child care.</i><p>
<p>
	The situation of young children has seriously deteriorated during the period
of transition, as evidenced by various types of data. It is, therefore,
essential to turn research results into tangible measures as fast as possible.
We expect that a major consequence of the results from this Project will be to
collect adequate information for devising specific actions that may lead to a
gradual increase in the efficiency of child care.<p>
<p>
	Therefore, our third goal has been to translate our research results, using
the relevant international experience, into a strategy for better utilization
of the financial and human resources for the improvement of child care.  Only
the first but very important step has been made within this Project in this
direction by identifying the core issues and formulating the problems to be
solved in further research.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>2. 	THE RESEARCH TEAM</b><p>
<p>
	The study has been organized and coordinated by the Counseling and
Psychotherapy Center (CPC) as lead agency within the Bulgarian part of the
Project.<p>
<p>
	Individual experts who have contributed to the main study have been employed
by CPC on a project basis. Throughout the research we have also relied on the
good will and contributions from top level officials and representatives of
relevant organizations.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>3. 	THE RESEARCH PLAN</b><p>
<p>
<i>3.1	An Overview of the Purpose and Scope of the Study from a Bulgarian
Perspective</i><p>
<p>
	The transition of our society to a new social and economic system has put
forward a range of problems related to the upbringing and education of
children.  The most significant features of the situation of children under the
current conditions in the country are:<p>
<p>
	*	The relative and absolute numbers of children are decreasing; there is an
increase in infant and child mortality; the rates of morbidity and handicaps
are growing, including serious illnesses caused by deterioration of the
environment, an inadequate health culture, and lack of an attitude to lead a
health-

conscious
way of life.<p>
<p>
	*	Some children suffer from malnutrition, and irrational nutrition practices
are found in homes, caregiving institutions, and schools.<p>
<p>
	*	There is no systematic policy to identify and develop the talents of gifted
children.<p>
<p>
	*	There are a growing number of families whose income is below the minimum
subsistence level; there are severe difficulties in meeting the material and
intellectual needs of the children; there is a growing social differentiation
caused by differences in the status of parents.<p>
<p>
	*	The deviancy and delinquency rates are on the increase, with a lowering of
the age of delinquent behaviors; there is a tendency towards organized crime
among children.<p>
<p>
	*	There is an increase in the crimes committed against children by adults
(physical and psychological maltreatment, sexual abuse and other forms of abuse
within and outside the family).<p>
<p>
	A range of other negative tendencies are observed which are described in
detail in the Results section of this report.<p>
<p>
	Children have emerged as the most vulnerable social group, and virtually all
children in the country are under conditions of actual or potential risk. What
is badly needed is adequate legislation to meet the challenges of the new
social conditions and new working programmes for the socialization of
children.<p>
<p>
	All of the above points justify the purpose and define the scope of our
research efforts in finding facts and formulating strategies for action.<p>
<p>
<i>3.2	Data Collection: Types of Data and Sources</i><p>
<p>
	Under the old regime, even demographic data were top secret and whatever was
made public was strongly manipulated. Therefore, it is sometimes difficult to
reconstruct the actual situation.  In order to obtain relevant comparative
data, we have placed special emphasis on our collaboration with government
bodies such as the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Justice where
such information is available under specific conditions.<p>
<p>
	At the other extreme, current data sources are not very reliable because of
the immense diversity of samples and the limited resources of the government
administration to collect data in a scientific way.  Therefore, in the
assessment of the situation of caregiving today we have relied on our critical
evaluation of existing data and on our own research and other sources of
information which provide evidence of the reliability of data.<p>
<p>
	<p>
	The National Statistical Institute is now improving continuously its
methodology and overall performance and has become a major source of reliable
information. A full census was made at the end of 1992.  This has been used as
baseline information to study the major demographic trends.<p>
<p>
	The Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of the
Interior were approached and appropriate contacts made to ensure that we
obtained the latest information available to those institutions.  Different
types of child care settings fall under their auspices and research in them is
still subject to top level approval.<p>
<p>
	Various international and national non-

governmental
organizations have done significant research over the past few years. A
difficult but useful venture has been to collect some information about their
activities and use their potential in contributing to the goals of this
Project. We have had very positive response from organizations such as UNICEF
and private research teams.<p>
<p>
	There is no central facility which provides researchers and caregivers access
to information stemming from the various sources.   Therefore	throughout the
Report, under each table, we have indicated the source of the data.  We have
included only information which comes from reliable sources but caution must be
exercised in interpreting the data since the pace of changes in Bulgarian
society is so fast that some of the information becomes obsolete very soon
after publication.<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>3.3	Gaps in Knowledge and Instrumentation</i><p>
<p>
	In our view, the following major gaps in knowledge should be considered:<p>
<p>
	*	Research has been done by individual research teams outside the structure of
the main governmental organizations. There is unique information gathered by
these experts which still needs further processing to make it publicly
available.<p>
<p>
	*	There is little if any systematic comparative research. Information on child
care would be much more useful if the studies used compatible methods,
parameters and criteria in all countries to effectively transfer experience
from one country to another.<p>
<p>
	*	No nation-

wide
study covering children in different settings has been conducted. . This type
of study is essential to provide an understanding of  the quality of caregiving
in the different settings and identify opportunities for the improvement of
child care.<p>
<p>
	*	No studies of private or other non-

governmental
establishments have been conducted.  Private child care establishments have
been allowed only in the past few years and they are increasing in number.  A
special study is needed on how they provide child care and how this fits into
the traditional practice of public and family care.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>3.4	A Strategy for Gathering Additional Information</i><p>
<i></i><p>
	We have relied mainly on our special private contacts with professionals in
the various government agencies, NGOs, research institutions and private
organizations to obtain relevant data.  The government administrative process
does not facilitate collaboration, even though individual officers understand
the worth and usefulness of the research. Therefore, private channels are an
indispensable way of receiving information that in most advanced countries
would be readily available.<p>
<p>
	Besides collecting the existing information from the various sources listed
above, we have done our own pilot research with parents and other caregivers.
Also, members of our team have visited selected caregiving establishments to
study the conditions on the spot and thus double-

check
what we know from other sources.<p>
	<p>
<p>
<i>3.5	The Specific Action Plan for This Research</i><p>
<p>
	*	Identification of sources.<p>
<p>
		An extensive list of potential sources and appropriate contacts were
established. <p>
<p>
	*	Literature review.<p>
<p>
		The information available from various sources was reviewed. A major task was
to ensure the reliability and compatibility of the available information. From
the data available we made inferences and developed the conclusions presented
in this report.  However, the original data are also presented.  These can be
used directly by other researchers who may draw further conclusions and/or make
appropriate recommendations in relation to subsequent research.<p>
<p>
	*	Core group formation and partner identification.<p>
<p>
		Our team of researchers identified potential collaborators who have
contributed substantially to the collection of appropriate information.<p>
<p>
	*	Own research.<p>
<p>
		A pilot study was conducted within this Project.  We developed ambitious
plans for subsequent research that will allow us to study in greater detail the
most salient child care problems.<p>
<p>
	*	The Final Report.<p>
<p>
		The Final Report presents our findings in two forms: (1) an analytical
description of  the background information on the various aspects of child care
in Bulgaria;  and (2) baseline data which have been collected and submitted for
the benefit of all future researchers who may use them for further analysis or
comparisons. <p>
<p>
		This Final Report offers first an Executive Summary where we have presented
some of our most interesting and unique findings. It is followed by various
chapters which discuss the general demographic situation of the Bulgarian
population with a special focus on the life conditions for children and the
various types of child care provision.   In the last section, we put forward
some ideas for further research and subsequent action to improve child care.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>4. 	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</b><p>
<p>
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED FROM OUR RESEARCH?<p>
<p>
	While working on this project we have collected an immense amount of data from
various sources: the National Statistical Institute, the records of different
governmental institutions, and research organizations.  In addition, to
supplement our knowledge and understanding of the situation of children in
Bulgaria today, we have undertaken our own research with parents and children.
Here is an outline of our main achievements:<p>
<p>
1.	We were able to identify the exact dimensions of the various problems which
Bulgarian children are facing. We have always known that child care is
inadequate and needs improvement, and we have observed how it has deteriorated
over the past few years, but now WE KNOW THE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS, WE CAN MEASURE
THEM AND EVALUATE THEIR SIGNIFICANCE.<p>
<p>
2.	We have been able to separate facts from assumptions and prejudice. For
instance, we know that the Government is not doing enough to make child rearing
easier for young families. But we have observed that some child care
institutions operate very well, that some staff are very motivated and
committed to giving their best to the children, even if staff are underpaid,
And we have also obtained evidence that sound mechanisms for provision of
adequate food have been developed, which do an excellent job.<p>
<p>
3.	We have identified some trends which seem paradoxical at first sight but
which prove to be extremely significant in identifying the roots of many
problems and the solutions that have been found under the current conditions.
The most striking example is the phenomenon that the dramatic social and
economic changes which have taken place in Bulgaria over the past five years
have, contrary to normal expectations, reinforced the traditional patterns of
child raising.<p>
<p>
	This finding may be unique to Bulgaria , even when contrasted to other
countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Traditionally, Bulgarians were fairly
attached to their families and in the prevailing rural population it was
customary to have several generations living together. It has been considered
quite normal that a young family should live in the house of the husband with
his parents.  In this way, the grandparents of the child would have an
extremely active and important role in the child's upbringing. This would
include providing financial support and an enormous amount of time spent with
the small children by their grandmother,  who used didactic approaches and
methods at least 20 years old. <p>
<p>
	During communist times, the continuous and pervasive shortage of housing
reinforced this tradition.  The fact that virtually all mothers went to work
after a considerable maternity leave meant that most children were brought up
by their grandmothers. There is an abundance of folklore and anecdotes on this
type of co-

existence
of the generations,  but hardly any research.  Nonetheless it is possible to
imagine the negative consequences for children and the psychological climate in
a house where the young family is compelled to obey the elderly on most issues.
When forced to live under the same roof, the generation gap can turn into an
abyss.<p>
<p>
	The transition to a market economy was expected to bring about new conditions
for family life, with a new understanding of personal independence, and
reinforcement of a commercial mentality that would ultimately loosen
traditional cross-

generation
family links. However, the economic crisis in the emerging market economy,
characterized by high inflation, has further strengthened the traditional
model.  The housing problem has become even more acute.   Only an extremely
limited minority of the population is able to buy a house, and rents continue
to increase.  There are very high unemployment rates.  In many families neither
parent is employed and thus there is no income other than meager social
benefits.  All of this has resulted in greater economic dependency on the
grandparents.  <p>
<p>
	The lack of  social service networks has been compensated for by the
traditional family support system.  Social mechanisms have a vital role in
saving the physical life of children by providing better subsistence.  The
psychological impact of traditional arrangements, as compared with social
service supports, are difficult to estimate.<p>
<p>
	A second very significant finding of our research has been that perhaps one of
the biggest issues is not the lack of money per se but inadequate financial
management. There are obviously more difficulties in providing adequate
financing for the various social care institutions since the Government itself
suffers from a severe shortage of money and subsidies are no longer possible.<p>
<p>
	A major aspect of the process of transition to a market economy and democracy
has been the decentralization of the Government budget. Most of the funds
allocated to social care such as health care, pension funds, and financing for
special establishments (such as the various types of homes for disadvantaged
and handicapped children), have been transferred to the local authorities. We
are not going to discuss the practical difficulties in municipal financing but
what has emerged as a result of our survey are two major issues:<p>
<p>
	(a)	First, even if the responsible people at the local authority have the best
will, most of them have no skills in financial management. In fact, even
private businessmen lack such skills as a result of  lack of experience with a
market economy.  The situation is even worse for underpaid Government
employees. <p>
<p>
	Whatever money is available could perhaps be used more efficiently if the
services are run more professionally, but this cannot happen when people do not
have the appropriate training and skills.<p>
<p>
	(b)	Second, decentralized financing may perhaps sound more democratic but in
specific areas it leads to inefficiency and potentially a much higher cost. A
typical example is the supply of medical products.  In many of the advanced
countries only a few companies have been authorized to distribute drugs and
they sell 'in bulk' to Government and health providers.  This is considered the
most efficient way to curb the costs of the Government and the health insurance
agencies.  In Bulgaria, most of the supplies are purchased by local authorities
which have no commercial experience, they cannot buy large quantities and they
are often perceived as unattractive customers by the suppliers because there
are delays in payment due to delays in the local authorities receiving funds
from the Ministry of Finance.<p>
<p>
4.	In our study, we were able to identify some key areas which need further
study and which offer very promising outcomes if specific action is taken.  In
this category we would include both research into the long-

lasting
effects of the current child raising patterns, and research and development
into specific strategies for solving the urgent problems of child care in
Bulgaria today.<p>
<p>
	A list of our suggestions for further research is given in the last section of
this Report.<p>
<p>
<i>5.2	Demography</i><p>
<p>
	  The social and economic conditions in the country over the past few years
have had a significant impact on the demography of Bulgaria.  The relative
stability of the previous government was upset and we have observed
deteriorating reproductive characteristics of the population: the birth rate
and the net and total fertility rates have decreased significantly and
mortality has increased substantially for all age groups above 30 years of age.
<p>
<p>
	This section provides basic data on the Bulgarian population on the basis of
the national census in December 1992 and the follow-

up
monitoring done by the National Statistical Institute. We have analyzed the
general demographic and migration processes and the major economic indicators
which provide a picture of the Bulgarian population today.  A range of
unfavorable demographic processes have been observed, especially trends such as
the very low birth rate and the negative growth of the population, the fairly
high infant mortality rate, significant emigration of young people, and hence a
relative ageing of the Bulgarian population. For the most part, the trends
identified in 1992 still prevail.<p>
<p>
	The last Bulgarian population and housing census was carried out in December
1992. A 2% sample of the population was processed in order to satisfy the most
urgent information needs of the policy makers and the public.  The population
of the Republic of Bulgaria on 4 December 1992 totalled 8,472,724 persons. The
urban population was 5,687,013 persons or 67.1 % of the total.<p>
<p>
	For the first time in the one-

hundred-
year
history of the census office, it was found that the population of the country
is decreasing.  It has decreased by 476,000 persons (or 5.3 %), compared to the
population identified in the previous full census in 1985.  The unfavourable
changes of fertility and mortality resulted in a sharp decrease in the natural
increase of the population -


from 55 thousand in 1975 to 11 thousand in 1985. Since 1990 the natural
increase is negative and for 1992 compared to 1991 the population has decreased
by 18,864 persons (2.2 per thousand). <p>
<p>
	By 31 December 1993, the permanent population of Bulgaria was 8,459,700 people
with an average density of  76.2 people per sq. km.  In comparison to 1992, the
1993 population showed a decrease of  25,140 people or 0.3 %.  In the towns the
population is 5,720,500 people and 2,739,200 in the villages,  i.e. 68% urban
and 32% rural. <p>
<p>
	<p>
Birth Rate<p>
<p>
	The birth rate which dropped to a critical level in the early nineties is
still low in 1993-- 10 per thousand or 0.4 points below 1992.  In 1993, 84,400
live births were recorded which means a decrease of 4,734 babies or 5.3 % less
than 1992. (The decrease over the period 1993-

1992
is smaller than the decrease over the period 1992-

1991
which amounted to 6,776 babies.)  The birth rate in the towns (10.2 per
thousand in 1993) is lower than the national average;  it is higher in the
villages.<p>
<p>
	<p>
Mortality Rate<p>
<p>
	Serious concern is caused by high infant mortality in Bulgaria. Since 1988,
when the lowest mortality rate was recorded (13.6 per thousand live births),
the value had been growing. It was 16.9 in 1991.  In the towns infant mortality
is generally lower than in the villages--14.9 per thousand live births in urban
areas as compared to 16.9 in the villages, except in the region around Plovdiv
and Sofia. <p>
<p>
The towns and villages of the Bourgas Region have recorded infant mortality of
18.7 and 20.5 per thousand live births. It is highest in the Bourgas Region
(19.3 per thousand live births), followed by the Rousse Region (17.9/1,000)<p>
<p>
The lowest rates are observed in the city of Sofia (14.1/1,000) and the
neighboring villages (9.6/1,000)., Plovdiv and Montana (16.4/1,000). Infant
mortality is lowest in Sofia (13.9 per thousand live births).  While an overall
decrease was observed in 1992 (15.9 per thousand live births) and 1993 (15.5
per thousand live births) it is still unacceptably high.  [See Table: Main
Demographic Indicators for 1993]<p>
<p>
	The general mortality rate is also of concern.  For example, in 1992, this
country had a comparatively high mortality rate--12.7 per thousand--while in
1965 mortality was 8.1;  in 1975, 10.3; and in 1985, 12.0 per thousand.  <p>
<p>
Migration<p>
<p>
	During recent years we have been  witnessing considerable external migration.
High emigration to Turkey in 1989 and after that to Western Europe have
resulted in a decrease of the population of this country.<p>
<p>
Therefore, the decrease of the population in 1992 compared to 1985 was caused
entirely by the negative balance of the external migration.<p>
<p>
	Internal migration of the population, unlike emigration, has a direct impact
only on the number of people in and the demographic composition of specific
locations within the country. For example,  346,000 thousand people or 4.1 % of
the population of Bulgaria, changed their permanent residence between 1985 and
1992. The intensity of internal migration over this seven-

year
period is 39.7 per thousand.  The rate of internal migration was twice this in
the period 1975-

1985
and four times this rate in the 1966-

1975
time period. <p>
<p>
	In addition to the general decrease of internal migration over the period 1985-

1992,
the direction has also changed: until the mid-

1980s
migration was predominantly from the villages to the towns whereas since then
there is some return to the rural areas. [See Table: Internal Migration in
Bulgaria by Period]<p>
<p>
<p>
Ageing population<p>
<p>
	The age of the population is shifting.  There is a decrease in the share of
the young population while the share of the older population increases. The
percentage of the young population (under the age of 20) was 37.8 % in 1946 and
fell to 28.2 % in 1985.  It reached 25.7 % in 1992. The percentage of the
elderly population (60 years and more) is increasing.  It has gone from 9.5 %
in 1946, to 17.8 % in 1985, reaching 21.1 % in 1992. Now Bulgaria is among the
countries with an old population.   Concomitantly there has been a shift in the
average age of the population.  In 1946, the average age in Bulgaria was 29.8
years and in 1993 it was 38.4. The percentage of people 0-

14
years is continuously decreasing.  In 1993, this age group comprised 18.6 % of
the total population. <p>
<p>
Education<p>
<p>
	There have been positive shifts in education.  The population is becoming
better educated. Today every tenth person of age 20 years or more has
university education. A little more than half of the population over 18 years
of age (54 %) has secondary and higher education.<p>
<p>
Marriage and Family<p>
	The population of the country is characterized by a  relatively high
percentage of persons in <i>de jure</i> marriage -


68 % of the population of 15 and more years of age.  Before 1980 the marriage
rate as a demographic phenomenon did not demonstrate significant variability
over time, with the exception of peaks at times of war and economic crisis.
Since 1980, the marriage rate in Bulgaria has decreased continuously,
especially since 1990.  In 1993 the number of marriages dropped by 4,784
compared to 1992.  We can assume that many weddings have been put off  in time
and also that a growing number of people live in a family without making it a
formal legal act. <p>
<p>
	The average number of persons in one household is decreasing constantly -


from 5.60 in 1900 to 3.95 in 1946, then to 2.94 in 1985, finally reaching 2.81
persons in 1992.<p>
<p>
Ethnic Composition<p>
<p>
	In terms of the ethnic composition of the population naturally the Bulgarian
ethnic group prevails. It comprises 7,272,000 persons or 85.8 % of the whole
population. Second but significantly smaller is the Turkish ethnic group
(822,000 persons or 9.4 %).Third is the Gypsy ethnic group comprising 288,000
persons or 3.7 %. The size of all the other ethnic groups is 91,000 persons or
1.1 % of the total population<p>
<p>
	In accordance with the ethnic composition of the population, the prevailing
part of it has Bulgarian as mother language (7,311 thousand persons or 86.3%).
Turkish is mother language to 9.8 % of the population and Gypsy is mother
language to 3 % of the population.<p>
<p>
	East Orthodox Christianity is the dominating religion comprising 86.2 % of the
population.  It is the official religion in this country. A small part of the
population are Catholics  (0.6 %) and Protestants  (0.2 %).  As a whole,
Christians account for 87 % of the population. Second, with a significantly
smaller share, is the Muslim religion with 12.7 % of the population. [See
Table: Census 04.12.1992]<p>
<p>
The forecast of the National Statistical Institute suggests further negative
development of demographic processes with slower deterioration rates. [See
Table: Forecast of Basic Demographic Indicators 1994-

2000]<p>
<p>
Economic Indicators<p>
<p>
	 The transition from centrally planned to market-

oriented
economy has been accompanied by dramatic changes in the economic activity of
people: from virtually full employment to severe unemployment. The number of
employed persons has been continuously decreasing from 4,365,000 in 1989 to
3,076,000 in 1993 (a drop of 30 %). Employment per 100 people has dropped from
49.1 in 1989 to 38.3 in 1992 and 36.2 in 1993. [See Figure: Level of Employment
1989-

1993]
 <p>
	According to an employment survey made by the National Statistical Institute
in October 1994, the number of employed persons was 2,869,000 or 41.7 % of
persons at 15 years or higher. The trend for absolute and relative decrease of
employment rates maintains the same direction. [See Table: Employment: October
1994]<p>
<p>
Compared to September 1993, the number of employed persons has decreased by
126,000 or 4.2 %, i.e. a drop of the employment rate by 1.8 points. It must be
noted that at the time of this survey some seasonal factors have had a
significant impact (for instance, agricultural activity was at a low point
during this period).<p>
<p>
Employment of persons over 15 years of age is much higher in the towns (46.9%)
than in the villages (31.1 %). If we consider the employment rates only for
persons within the basic employment age, the rate is somewhat higher but the
difference between urban and rural population is maintained: 62.2 % vs. 50.1 %,
respectively. <p>
<p>
The ratio between employed men and women is relatively stable over time, with
higher employment rates for men. Among all employed in October 1994, 53.4 % are
men and 46.6 % are women. In the towns, the figures are 52% men to 48% women,
whereas in the villages the difference is greater: 57% employed men to 43%
employed women. [See Figure: Unemployed by Place of Residence and Sex]<p>
<p>
In comparison to September 1993, a drop in employment is observed in October
1994 in all age groups but it is more substantial in the younger and more
elderly, whereas with the basic adult population the decrease is insignificant.
About 92,000 (ca. 3 % of all employed persons) are above the retirement age
(compared to 140,000 in September 1993). [See Table: Employment by Age: October
1994 and Figure Unemployed by Age and Sex: December 1992]<p>
<p>
The data of the October 1994 survey indicate that the level of education has a
positive impact on employment. The employment rate of people with university
education is 72.5 % whereas the employment rates of persons with elementary or
lower education are three times lower.<p>
<p>
At the same time, people with elementary education or lower account for about
one quarter of all employees (one fifth in the towns and nearly half in the
villages).<p>
<p>
The number of employees in private businesses is growing. In October 1994 it
amounted to 462,000 people or 16 % of all employees. In comparison to September
1993, their share increased by 5 %. Still, the number of employees in the
government sector is much larger (about 75 %).<p>
<p>
The private sector is preferred by men more than by women. Some 30 % of men
work in the private sector compared to about 20 % of women. The differences
between men and women are still greater on comparing employers and the self-

employed.<p>
<p>
<p>
The economic crisis characterized by high inflation and unemployment has a
significant impact on child care.<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>5.3		Public Child Care Provision</i><p>
<p>
5.3.1	Nurseries<p>
<p>
	Bulgaria's system of childcare establishments for preschool-

age
children has a long history. The country's first preschool was organized in
1882. Since 1989 the number of children attending these establishments has
decreased.   In 1992, this decline in enrollment is due both to the decline in
the number of children of that age range and to the economic hardships
currently experienced by the parents.<p>
<p>
	During the past decade a number of steps were taken that have both direct and
indirect implications for the upbringing and education of children of preschool
age. First among these was the option for either parent of a small child to
take a two-

year
paid leave (while retaining his/her job for a period of three years, thus
making possible a third year of unpaid leave) to take care of the child. During
the same period, preschool pedagogy became a university subject.  In 1992 four
university and institutional faculties were training personnel for the specific
needs of preschool education. An inspectorate was established to control the
practical implementation of the educational program. <p>
<p>
	Preschool child care has been severely affected by the social changes after
the fall of the communist Government in 1989. Many of the premises of preschool
establishments were old houses belonging to rich private persons whose property
was nationalized in the late 1940s. With the restoration of private property by
the new democratic system, a special Law on Restitution of Nationalized Urban
Real Estate was issued in 1992 (promulgated in the State Gazette No. 15 of 21
February 1992) which gave back such houses to their former owners. <p>
<p>
	Other preschool facilities were built illegally by the government or local
authorities on private land which is also bound to restitution under the new
law. To avoid full disruption of preschool education, the authorities have made
a provision that for several years houses used for educational purposes shall
not be returned to their owners but this is still a short-

term
solution. No other premises are available and new houses are too expensive to
build today. According to data of the National Statistical Institute, by the
end of 1993 restitution has been completed for 173 children's establishments
which is about 85 % of premises for which there are private claims. For
instance, 60 nurseries were under the authority of Sofia Municipality in 1990
and 7 of them have been given back to the former owners. For many others a
legal process of restitution is in progress.<p>
<p>
	No complete statistics are available about the extent of the problem
throughout the country. An additional difficulty is the difference in
administrative subordination of preschool establishments: nurseries are under
the authority of the Ministry of Health, whereas kindergartens are under the
authority of the Ministry of Education.<p>
	Nurseries have a range of functions, including health care and education,
which assist Bulgarian families with children below 3 years of age. Nurseries
are under the auspices of the Ministry of Health Care but the financing comes
through the municipal authorities. Normally, the local authorities are owners
of the premises and the land on which the facilities are built. In this way,
more than one authority is responsible for each nursery thereby making the
process of decision-

making
very cumbersome.<p>
<p>
	There have been cases when private owners of facilities now used for nurseries
have displayed a willingness to help the local authority in one way or another
after the restitution of their property. Bureaucracy, however, has made life
difficult for everybody and certainly the ultimate effect has been negative for
the children and the families which need these services. Even direct charity
has not been properly assisted to the benefit of everybody concerned.<p>
<p>
	Nurseries admit children between 1 and 3 years of age. The number of children
in a group varies between 8 and 16. There are special nurseries with health
care functions for children with chronic illnesses or who are handicapped. In
such facilities groups normally involve less than 10 children. In Sofia there
are 4 such specialized nurseries where special rooms for physical therapy have
been equipped and experts in physical therapy have been employed. In Sofia
there is one nursery for deaf &amp; mute children and one for children with
cerebral paralysis. [See Table: Number of Nurseries, Beds and Groups in
Sofia]<p>
<p>
	Normally, one group of children is taken care of by three medical nurses and
one general nurse. Payment is equal to that in medical establishments but there
are not many applicants for employees as medical personnel in Bulgaria are
badly underpaid. Retired nurses have been allowed to work in many nurseries but
still qualified staff is missing. General responsibility in a nursery is given
to a head medical nurse. A professional educator is also employed by each
nursery. Support personnel includes an accountant, a cook and a caretaker.<p>
<p>
	While all children within the age limits can apply to attend nurseries, a
medical examination is obligatory prior to admittance. <p>
<p>
	All nurseries in Bulgaria are Government-

controlled.
There is a minimum fee for single mothers, students, etc. which was equal to
150 leva at the time of writing of this Report and a maximum fee equal to 450
leva. No additional fees are paid for benefits such as language training and
many parents would pay the maximum fee rather than present documents every
month to demonstrate that they are eligible to pay lower fees. [See Table:
Regular Nurseries and Availability to Children  Below 3 Years]<p>
<p>
	Many factors have affected the number of nurseries and their use: the negative
natural population growth rate , the employment situation (when women are
unemployed they have less need for child care), migration, high inflation and
the changing expectations of parents to such establishments. Some nurseries are
not viable because they cannot collect even the minimum number of children to
justify their existence.  For instance, 8 of 60 nurseries under the Sofia
Municipality were closed down because they were underutilized. Others had to
change their premises because of problems of restitution of the houses to their
former owners, and structural changes became necessary for others. Between 1990
and 1992, 32 % of nurseries in Sofia were closed or changed their status. The
remaining nurseries are also facing serious problems mainly due to the shortage
of eligible children. Given the many advantages of public nurseries such as
cheap food, security of good care under professional surveillance and regular
contacts with other children of the same age, the main factor for fewer
children in nurseries is the reduced birth rate and the smaller average number
of children in a family (1.08 in 1965 down to 0.99 in 1992). [See Table:
Nurseries and Mother &amp; Child Homes in Bulgaria by 31.12.1993]<p>
<p>
5.3.2	Kindergartens<p>
<p>
Kindergartens in the Government sector include six types:<p>
<p>
1.	Day care kindergartens (with optional overnight groups and nursery
groups).<p>
2.	Sanatorial kindergartens for children with chronic illness.<p>
3.	Specialized kindergartens for handicapped children and mentally deficient
children.<p>
4.	Weekly kindergartens (Monday through Friday).<p>
5	Half-

day
kindergartens which operate between September 15 and May 31 and admit children
scheduled to start grade one at school the next year.<p>
6.	Seasonal kindergartens which operate like day care facilities in areas where
many parents are involved in seasonal employment. Such facilities operate
between 45 days and 10 months. <p>
<p>
	In 1993, the permanent kindergartens enrolled 247,300 children and 89.3 % of
them provided day care or weekly care. Half-

day
kindergartens enrolled 26,300 children and only 158 children were enrolled in
seasonal care. [See Table: Children in the Kindergartens by Age in 1993]<p>
<p>
	In 1993, 3,856 kindergartens operated in the country and the number of
children in them decreased by 15.5 thousand over 1992.  [See Table:
Kindergartens] The main reasons for this decrease are the reduced birth rate,
migration, and unemployment among young people who cannot afford the high fees.
There are some baseline fees which make life difficult for a family with two or
more children.  In order to be eligible to pay the minimum fees (equal to 150
leva per month at the time of writing of this Report) documents justifying this
low payment must be submitted to the authorities every month.  Otherwise if a
family has two children, the fee for the first child is 450 leva per month and
300 for the second. Fees for the other types of kindergartens range from 100-

600
leva for the weekly nurseries and 100-

300
for half-

day
care. Parents who are still students, single mothers and families with 3 or
more children pay 50% of the standard fee.<p>
<p>
<p>
	These fees do not include additional activities such swimming, language
training or musical training. These additional fees can sometimes be fairly
high and parents feel frustrated if they cannot provide for these for their
children when other children are participating in the extra activities. <p>
<p>
	Currently kindergartens are not fully enrolled (there are 100 children per 114
beds) except for Sanatorial kindergartens where the number of applicants is
bigger than the available facilities (three times more than available beds).<p>
<p>
	Kindergartens are under the authority of the Ministry of Education. However,
the local authority owns the facilities and acts as employer.  	Since 1989,
privately run kindergartens have been allowed, most of them offer half-

day
care. Their activities and programmes need authorization from the Ministry of
Education. [See Table: Private Kindergartens in 1993]<p>
<p>
	The data include only formally authorized kindergartens. There are a large
number of kindergartens which operate illegally in that they are not officially
authorized. In many of these schools the emphasis is on studying a foreign
language. The fees in these kindergartens are close to or higher than the
minimum monthly salary. Most of these establishments are not registered
anywhere. Some parents complain that in such kindergartens teaching ambitions
prevail over concern for personal growth of the children.<p>
<p>
	No special requirements exist for children willing to enroll in a kindergarten
except routine medical examination of the child and testing of the parents
(Wassermann and AIDS tests). A group normally includes 16 to 22 children who
are taken care of by 2 teachers and a nurse. Each kindergarten has some
administrative and service staff.  Data on kindergartens throughout the country
indicate that the average number of children is 64. However, in the towns this
number is much greater (112) and in the villages it is much smaller (30). The
average number of children in a group is 22 in the towns and 16 in the
villages. [See Table: Kindergartens in 1993]<p>
<p>
	In 1993, the kindergartens employed 25,600 teachers, of these 1,400 are head
teachers without responsibility for a specific group. Compared to 1992, the
educational staff was reduced by 1,800 people or 6.5 %.<p>
<p>
The data on educational staff in the kindergartens is presented in the
following tables:<p>
<p>
*	Educational Staff in the Kindergartens in 1993<p>
*	Educational Staff in the Kindergartens by Educational Degree in 1993<p>

<p>
<p>
5.3.3	Mother &amp; Child Homes<p>
<p>
	The mother &amp; child homes were created to provide support to mothers who
have extreme difficulty in taking care of their children and for foundlings.
Mother and child homes provide care for children under 3 and they are fully
sponsored by the state.  A survey of these homes provides an insight into the
problems faced by the children in terms of material conditions, staff attitudes
and specific skills. This section gives specific data about the children in
these homes and their distribution by different categories.  The report
includes recommendations on how to improve the operation of these homes and
make them more efficient in their functions.<p>
<p>
	The mother &amp; child homes are under the authority of the Ministry of Health
and are all government-

controlled.
Similar to nurseries, a dramatic decrease of children is observed in these
homes.  In 1980, there were 33 mother &amp; child homes in the country with
5,525 beds, whereas in 1985 there were 32 with 6,140 beds. Since then, the
number of these homes is the same but beds have decreased to 6,035 in 1992.
[See Table: Mother &amp; Child Homes in 1992]<p>
<p>
	For decades in the past, society had negative attitudes about extramarital
births and it was not a compliment to be called "a single mother", "a bastard",
or even "an adopted child". Today, the economic crisis is very severe and it is
difficult for single mothers, but the psychological barriers have changed and
many women who have extramarital babies prefer to keep them. This had led to a
decrease in the number of adoption.<p>
<p>
	In one of the major maternity institutions, The Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology
Institute in Sofia, the number of extramarital births has stayed constant over
the past few years: about 500-

600
cases per year. However, adoptions were 130-

140
babies per year in the past whereas now their number is below 100. In 1992,
births were 581 and adoptions were 110. In 1993, births were 637 and adoptions
were only 95.  One of the major reasons is that many of the births are very
young.   For instance, in 1989, the total number of extramarital births was
12,851. Of them, 444 babies were born of mothers below 15 and 6776 babies to
mothers between 15 and 19. (See Reference 30).<p>
<p>
	It is important to note that the mother &amp; child  homes are the main source
for adoptions.  There are very strict legal conditions for adoption to
guarantee the rights of children.  Adoptions are managed in compliance with
special Regulations issued in 1992 which harmonize Bulgarian legislation with
the international Convention on the Rights of the Child.  In general, the
conditions for adoption by a foreigner are more stringent than those for
adoption by a national. There are a number of rules that serve as a barrier to
the "export" of children. One of them is that only children at least one-

year
old can be adopted. Another conditions is that Bulgarians should have refused
several times to adopt the child and only then can the child be offered to
foreign applicants for adoption.<p>
<p>
	It is very good that some of the children left in the mother &amp; child homes
are later transferred to a family environment with parents. It is a pity,
however, that under the currently hard economic conditions there are no sources
for adequate financing of the basic needs of the children in these homes.<p>
<p>
	It is considered that the main mission of the mother &amp; child homes is to
secure healthy and normal child growth. The opportunity for a privileged
relationship with an adult is expected to reduce the negative effects of
emotional deprivation of these children. The role of such an adult is played by
the medical nurses who take care of the children.  As evidenced from the French
experience (G. Appell; E. Pickler), the issue is not only to provide good
living conditions, but to motivate the staff to work with the children and
employ people specifically qualified to work with infants. <p>
	<p>
	Various models have been experimented with to achieve maximum efficiency and
the Institute of Paediatrics has provided methodological support to staff in
the mother &amp; child homes. A major aspect of this support has been the
principle of voluntary collaboration and commitment by the staff of the
homes.<p>
<p>
	Staffing at the mother &amp; child homes is at 90 % of what it should be. In
1992, these homes employed 155 physicians (of them 89 were paediatric experts),
and 1585 medical nurses. The staff also included  obstetricians, physical
therapists, nutrition experts, clinical and X-

ray
laboratory personnel, etc.<p>
<p>
	Under current conditions of material and economic hardship it is not
surprising that there are high instances of illness and death in the mother
&amp; child homes. The total number of cases of illness in 1992 was 12,099
(including 6,641 children below 1 year).   There were 157 deaths, 118 of these
were of children below one year of age, out of the total 765 children who were
hospitalized during the year.  Of the death cases, 120 were due to congenital
malformations, there was 1 case of salmonellosis, 1 case of acute respiratory
infection, 6 cases of bronchopneumonia, and 29 other illnesses. Over 1992, 890
cases of congenital malformation were recorded.<p>
<p>
A survey was conducted which identified the following major problems:<p>
<p>
1.	Nurses rotate on a monthly basis in the different sections of the homes,
thus compromising the opportunity to set up a privileged relationship between a
child and an adult.<p>
<p>
2.	The interaction between the psychologists and/or educators and the nurses is
rather formal and there is no true sharing. The nurses are mainly concerned
with routine activities and refuse special care, such as doing massages or
playing exercises, which would be important forms of communication with the
child.<p>
<p>
3.	Physicians and nurses are not always aware of the psychological needs of the
children in terms of normal interaction with adults which is crucial for their
personal development.<p>
<p>
4.	A range of inadequate behaviors among children were in evidence, such as
retardation in psycho-

motor
development, avoidance of direct eye contact during interaction, etc.<p>
<p>
5.	There was a poor and badly organized material environment, especially for
young infants.<p>
<p>
After analysis of the situation, a team providing methodological support has
adopted two strategies for action:<p>
<p>
1.	Visits to particular homes by a team composed of a psychologist and a
physician to train the whole staff of the home.<p>
<p>
2.	Annual training courses to increase staff awareness of the specific problems
of young children.  These course use advanced visual aids and films to guide
the staff of the homes into adequate relationships with children.  <p>
<p>
	Pediatricians from the mother &amp; child homes of the whole country attend an
annual course on new developments in preventive paediatrics. A survey carried
out in 1993 indicates that paediatricians are interested in the problems of
psychic development in early infancy and are eager to learn more.<p>
<p>
	In 1994, the methodological team carried out a training course dedicated
entirely to the psychological problems of children in such homes and to
building up skills of adequate interaction and sharing of experiences among
staff members and the children. Both physicians and nurses attended the course,
as well as a number of directors of such homes from all over the country.
Further financing is required to continue with such initiatives.<p>
<p>
<p>
5.3.4	Homes for Children &amp; Adolescents<p>
<p>
	In this section, statistics are given about the homes for children and
adolescents and some trends in the demography of their residents are outlined.
These are homes for disadvantaged children from various categories and any
conclusions would be premature unless backed by specific studies of some
ethnic, regional and economic indicators. Data are also given on the staff in
these homes. It is important to observe that the needs are not only for more
staff but also for educators who have a better psychological background.<p>
<p>
	In 1993, in Bulgaria there are 142 homes for children and adolescents with
8694 residents aged between 3 and 18.  The largest number come from families
with many children (28.3 %) and neglected children (22.9%) . [See Table: Homes
for Children &amp; Adolescents in 1993 and Homes for Children &amp;
Adolescents: Inmates by Sex in 1993]<p>
<p>
	There are different patterns for homes in rural and urban areas.  In rural
homes there are  large numbers of neglected children, there are very few
children of single mothers.  For instance in the Varna area (37.4 % neglected
children and 6.82 % children of single mothers) and the Rousse area (30.2 %
neglected children and 11.11 % children of  single mothers). The reverse trend
is seen in urban settings.  In Sofia homes  the number of neglected children is
low (11.58 %) and the children of  single mothers are a considerably larger
group as compared to homes in the country (24.82 %).<p>
<p>
	It is likely that this is due to the higher tolerance for extramarital births
in urban areas like Sofia. However, to make fully grounded explanations,
further studies are needed to account for the ethnic and social characteristics
of people in the different regions and the trends in urban vs. rural areas. A
significant question is whether economic hardship is the main reason for
mothers to submit their children for rearing in the homes for children &amp;
adolescents.<p>
<p>
	Child-

rearing
staff in these homes consists of 1453 people. Of them, 57.3% are educators. The
number of educational psychologists is very low (12 people for the whole
country), although 4 additional educational psychologists were employed in
1993. The unfavourable social status of children in these homes demands higher
involvement of educators and psychologists.<p>
<p>
	In terms of regional distribution of child-

rearing
staff, the situation is best in Sofia (4.65 children per expert) and worst in
Plovdiv (7.32 children per expert). In the homes for children &amp; adolescents
in the Varna, Montana, Plovdiv and Haskovo regions, no qualified educators or
psychologists have been employed. This fact needs no comments. [See Table:
Educational Staff in the Homes for Children &amp; Adolescents in 1993]
According to data of the Ministry of Education, in 1990 there were 33 homes for
children below 6 with 1412 residents. Child-

rearing
staff in these homes includes qualified teachers.<p>
<p>
<p>
5.4		Child Care &amp; the Family<p>
<p>
	In the beginning of the century,  Bulgaria was dominated by the typical
patriarchal family consisting of several generations. The efforts mainly of the
men in the family provided the means of existence. The main function of the
women was to give birth and bring up many children. According to information
from the first census in Bulgaria, the average number of members of a family
was about 6. The economic crisis of the 20s and 30s ruined many families,
bringing down the average number of children. In 1926, the average number of
family members was 5, in 1934 -


4.7 and in 1946 -


3.9.  This was mainly the result of the almost double decrease of the birth
rate over this period. <p>
<p>
<p>
	A sociological survey carried out by the National Statistical Institute
(results were reported in Statistical Barometer of 27 July 1994) found that two
thirds of Bulgarians prefer a two-

children
family model and only 11.2 % are in favor of one child in the family.  Yet the
declared wishes for more children in the family diverge from the realities. The
average number of children whom a woman gives birth to during her fertile
period is about 1.5 and approaches the lowest level in  Western European
countries.<p>
<p>
	It is observed that those who declare a desire to have two children decrease
in number (72.1 in 1993, 70.1 % in 1991 and 69 % in 1992). At the same time,
1992 considerably differs also in the number of people who declared that they
wouldn't like to have children in their family (4.2%) against only 1.5 % in
1991 and 2.6 % in 1993.<p>
<p>
	As noted, since 1990 Bulgaria has had a negative population growth rate. Most
children are born to young mothers; almost 90 % of births are to women between
15 and 19 years of age, and the average age of mothers is 3-

4
years lower than that in the European countries with similar age structure.
Except for the under 17 population, there is a drop in fertility rates for all
other women.   Also, most of the pregnancies of the youngest mothers are
undesirable.<p>
<p>
	<p>
	Children are a traditional value in the Bulgarian ethnic culture. While the
care for the children is a task of the whole family, traditionally this is
primarily the responsibility of the mother or the grandmother. According to
data by the National Statistics Institute, in 1991 about 40 % of the Bulgarians
thought that "a woman should not work but look after the children and the
family" and according to almost half of those questioned, she must stay at home
until the child starts school. But in 1993 the bad economic situation of many
families changed their declared preferences -


only 1/4 of those questioned said that the child must be taken care of by a
member of the family. The remaining 3/4 support the idea of  breeding a child
in a public nursery.(Statistical Barometer, 12.08.94, p.4) <p>
<p>
	In the same survey, nearly 80 % of parents indicate that their income is
insufficient and 20 % make a statement that their income is extremely
insufficient. This statement refers mainly to being able to afford the basics
such as food and clothing [See Table: Garment Price Increase].  Nonetheless,
according to a study made by NSI in 1993 among parents of older schoolchildren,
over 80 % of parents declared their readiness to pay for additional private
lessons, individual teaching for the development of artistic talents of the
child, or for learning foreign language and almost 60 % are inclined to pay for
pedagogical or psychological consultation on problems regarding their child or
to pay for its study at university (Statistical Barometer, 22.09.94, p.4). The
parents readiness to spend a significant part of their family budget to provide
paid pedagogical services for their children is not influenced significantly by
the educational level of the parent. <p>
<p>
	About 3/4 of the parents agree that it would be good if the children work
according to their abilities in order to support the family budget.  This
contradicts only at first sight with the Bulgarian value system which put the
the needs of the child first.<p>
<p>
	The answers of the question "What are you compelled to deprive your children
of because of financial difficulties?" were as follows:  toys -


38.2 %; trips -


29.0 %; summer holidays -


22.4 %; interests clubs -


19.0 %; clothes and shoes -


13.2 %; books -


9.7 ; food -


3.5 %(Statistical Barometer, 27.12.94, p.13)  (Note: the sum is more than 100 %
because every answer could be ticked as correct). <p>
<p>
	The impoverishment of the population has affected most strongly the families
with many children. For instance, in 1991, the average annual income per person
in an urban family with three or more children was 86% of the annual average
income of a family with two children and 75% of that in a family with one
child.  In villages, the situation was harder and the respective figures were
77% and 69%.<p>
<p>
	The average annual spending per person for clothing and shoes in families with
three or more children was equal to 70 % of that in a family with two children
and 62 % of spending in a family with one child. Spending for cultural
activities in the same context was 51 % and 37 %, respectively.<p>
<p>
	Neither before the changes, nor today, is there a clear-

cut
policy in Bulgaria on how to effectively support children and families.  An
example is the notorious Decree for Encouragement of Births (promulgated State
Gazette, issue 26 of 1958, last amendment in State Gazette issue 88 of 1993).
According to the decree, families were given additional monies for each
additional child.  Until October 1993, the following birth grants were in
effect: <p>
	for 1st child -


100 leva	<p>
	for second child -


250 leva<p>
	for third child -


500 leva<p>
	for fourth and subsequent -


100 leva.<p>
<p>
After the 1st of October 1993, the amounts become respectively:<p>
	for first child -


a minimum monthly salary,<p>
	for second child -


2 minimum monthly salary,<p>
	for third child -


2.5 minimum monthly salaries,<p>
	for fourth and subsequent -


1 minimum monthly salary.<p>
<p>
The following benefits are paid to one of the parents:<p>
	for first child -


15 leva,<p>
for second child -


30 leva, accompanied by an increase of 15 leva over the benefit for the
first child,<p>
	for third child -


55 leva,<p>
	for fourth and subsequent -


15 leva.<p>
<p>
Single mothers who take care of their children alone receive as follows:<p>
	for first child -


40 leva,<p>
	for second child -


 60 leva and an additional 20 leva for the first child,<p>
	for third child -


110 leva,<p>
	for fourth and subsequent -


30 leva.<p>
<p>
Since 1 October 1994, 357 leva more are granted as a compensation for
inflation.<p>
<p>
For children with physical and mental handicaps the monthly grants are
double.<p>
<p>
For the time when the husband is a conscript in the army and cannot provide for
his family, additional monthly grants are given as follows:<p>
	for first child -


10 leva,<p>
	for second child -


20 leva,<p>
	for third child -


30 leva.<p>
<p>
	To put into perspective what these amounts mean,  in January 1995 an egg  cost
6 leva and one liter of milk about 30 leva.  Thus these grants are token, at
best. <p>
<p>
	There are pressures from the International community to change social service
provision.  To meet the criteria of loan agreements, Bulgaria is being pressed
to limit women's leaves for looking after their sick children by changing it to
children under 10 rather than 16 years of age and making the first three days
of these leaves payable by the employers, not the state. Such changes in women
leave provisions have negative implications for womens employment.<p>
<p>
Pregnancy and delivery leave are granted by the law as follows:<p>
	for first child -


120 days,<p>
	for second child -


150 days,<p>
	for third child -


180 days.<p>
Of these, 45 days should be before delivery.<p>
<p>
	Over these 4-

6
months, the mother receives her full salary. She is also allowed  to take paid
leave until the child becomes 2 years of age, and during this period she
receives the minimum monthly salary. If she wishes to, she can then take
another year to take care of her child without being paid.  In recent years,
most companies sign employment contracts for a definite term only.  Generally
these are shorter for women so that the company does not have to pay maternity
benefits. After expiry of the contract the company is not responsible to the
employee. <p>
<p>
	Even when eligible, it is difficult for women to receive the child grants
because these are given through the local authorities which are not very
efficient.<p>
<p>
	Various changes have been discussed in relation to the birth and child rearing
grants, including a project to cut them down. It is assumed that the new
Socialist Government will introduce some changes in the existing legislation,
but there are strong doubts on what can be achieved within the limited
resources of the country.<p>
<p>
	According to data from the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare quoted in the
media, in 1992,  10 % of the people received 12 % of the total personal income
of the Bulgarian population. In 1994, this shifted dramatically.  10 % of the
people  take 24 % of the total income.  At the same time nearly 1 million
Bulgarians live below the poverty threshold and account for only 3.5 % of all
incomes.  <p>
<p>
	According to the National Employment Service, in more than 40,000 families
both parents are unemployed.  Unemployment benefits are granted through a
Decree of the Council of Ministers of 1989 (latest amendment on 1 December
1994). According to this Decree, the benefit amounts to 60 % of the average
monthly salary the person had been receiving over the past 6 months of
employment but not more than 140 % or less than 90 % of the minimum monthly
salary. Depending on prior length of service and age, the unemployed person
receives the benefits for 6 to 12 months after registration at the unemployment
office of the local authority.  There are, however, a number of cases when the
person cannot receive even these minimal grants. For instance, if he ever
registered as a sole proprietor, even if he never got any revenue through this,
he is not eligible for unemployment benefits.<p>
<p>
	Most families in the country over the past three decades consist of two
members. By the end of 1992, their number has increased by 197,000 compared to
1965 .   The second largest group of families are those with three members.
Their relative share has decreased constantly between 1965 and 1985 and only in
recent years is there an upward trend.  Four-

member
families remain constantly about 25 % of all families. Families with 5 or more
members decrease in both absolute figures (by 58,000 over the period 1965-

1992)
and in relative share (from 6.5. % to 3.9 % between 1965 and 1992).<p>
<p>
	Differentiation of family groups takes place faster in the villages than in
the towns. In villages, over the period 1965-

1992,
two-

member
families increased  by 10.2 points and now account for 55.6 % of all families.
In the towns, two-

member
families have increased by 8.1 points and now account for 39 % of all urban
families.  Over the same period, three-

member
families decreased by 8 points in the villages and 6.4 points in the towns.<p>
<p>
	According to data from the last census, the persons between 30 and 39 years of
age (an age range when a family is normally established) who live like one-

member
families, i.e., who have withdrawn from the traditional family relationships,
were 32,545 people or 2.8 % of persons in this age range.  If we add to them
the people between 20 and 29 years of age who live alone, we get a social group
of about 100,000 people who have -


for one reason or another -


avoided marriage  as the most appropriate form of existence. [See Table: Family
Structure, Stability and Reproductive Behavior]<p>
<p>
	The marriage rate in Bulgaria has decreased over the past few decades. In 1988
the rate was 7 per 1000 people compared to 4.7 per 1000 in 1993. The average
marriage age is also decreasing and is about 4-

5
years lower compared to Western European countries. [See Table: Marriage Rate,
Birth Rate, Mortality and Infant Mortality in 1992 by Region]<p>
<p>
	It is, of course, an open question whether those who have expressed their
willingness to set up a family are prepared for their roles as marriage
partners, parents and educators.<p>
<p>
	A major aspect of family life and child rearing is the feeling of general
welfare of the children [See Table: Changes in the Welfare of Children &amp;
Adolescents] and the affordability of basic foodstuffs.<p>
<p>
	Since the liberalization of prices in February 1991, increases in the prices
of goods in general, and of foodstuffs in particular, have made most of the
households restrict their food consumption. [See Table: Food Consumption
Reported by Mothers of Infants 0-

1
Year in 1991]<p>
<p>
	In May 1991, the Institute of Pediatrics conducted a survey and analysis of
the food consumption of mothers of infants and children in the 1-

10
years age group in various regions of the country.  The survey respondents were
98 mothers of infants ( 0 -


1 year) most of whom (92 per cent) resided in urban areas. In addition to the
selected data about food consumption, the survey also included questions and
answers about the course of pregnancy.<p>
<p>
	Analysis of the data on foods actually consumed revealed that a large number
of lactating mothers did not get sufficient amounts of proteins and vitamins.
The attached table shows that some 23 per cent did not consume enough milk, and
about 22 per cent did not get enough meat. The reasons for these poor
consumption patterns can be assumed to be shortages and, especially, high
prices. [See Table: A Price Index for 168 Products &amp; Services]<p>
<p>
	The unbalanced and inadequate diet of the mothers of newborns has had an
adverse impact on lactation and thus can be assumed to be a major contributing
factor to increased rates of bottle feeding.<p>
<p>
	Breast-

milk
substitutes are introduced at less than three months of age in the cases of 40
per cent of the infants, due to insufficient lactation. Not more than 45 per
cent of the infants were properly shifted to bottlefeeding.<p>
<p>
	High prices of many foodstuffs results in mainly carbohydrate meals for many
children. Thus 51 per cent of children aged 1-

3
years, 14 per cent of those aged 3-

5
years, and 23 per cent of those aged 6-

10
years breakfasted on predominantly carbohydrate foods, placing them at risk of
protein deficiency. The principal mid-

day
meal satisfied the age-

specific
requirements of no more than 59 per cent of children between 1 and 3 years of
age, 25 per cent of that of preschool children, and 38 per cent of young
schoolchildren. The respective rates for supper were 64%, 60%, and 77%.<p>
<p>
<p>
5.5		NGOs<p>
<p>
	In the National Directory of Bulgarian Foundations, 1993, out of 111 NGOs only
sixteen are involved in activities related to healthy children. However,
according to data from the Union of Bulgarian Foundations, by December 1994,
there were 49 Bulgarian NGOs committed to the problems of the children and the
family. This number also includes the NGOs whose aims involve the treatment or
prevention of childhood illnesses.<p>
<p>
	1994 was declared as "The Year of the Family" by the United Nations. This was
used as a trigger to bring together the efforts of Bulgarian NGOs whose
activities relate to children and the family. They made some steps towards
developing more efficient mechanisms of collaboration and a nation-

wide
information network. Some 38 projects were submitted, at a total value of about
4 million leva, and a search for sponsors has started to get them
implemented.<p>
<p>
I will mention some of these projects:<p>
<p>
	*	Resocialization of waifs.<p>
<p>
	*	Contribution of the psychologist to the treatment of children with tumors.<p>
<p>
	*	"Don't take away my childhood!" (a project to defend the rights of children
who have overambitious parents).<p>
<p>
	*	Drug addicts among children and adolescents and their families.<p>
<p>
	*	Sexual health and preparation of adolescents for family life.<p>
<p>
<p>
5.6		Summary of  Survey Research Project<p>
<p>
	A study was made conducted to better understand the real situation of children
in the city of Sophia.  A survey was conducted with the parents of 48 children
below 6.  The main objective of this study was to collect direct evidence from
the parents to double-

check
the statistical data as related to the situation in the city of Sofia in
December 1994. We were interested in getting personal impressions of the
conditions of children's lives and the time and money spent on them by their
parents. We also tried to identify the sources of information parents have
concerning child rearing and education.<p>
<p>
	A major finding, presumably specific of the Bulgarian situation, is that only
9 % of young families get no support from the grandparents of the children.
Thus, in the vast majority of families the grandparents provide support in
terms of money, goods and care of the children while parents are at work.   <p>
<p>
	<p>
	<p>
	The data indicate that young families are very dependent on the grandparents.
Normally, young families cannot afford to rent and are compelled to live
together with their parents. (Of the families we surveyed 41% share flats with
the grandparents, 31 % have their own housing, 6 % share flats with other
relatives, and 18 % rent housing.)  It is very common for at least three
generations to co-exist under the same roof.  Co-habitation combined with the
economic crisis in the country, leads to conflicts which are less likely to
arise if the young could afford to live separately. A common topic of
contention is how to raise the children.<p>
<p>
	In terms of how young parents find information on child rearing, 53 % report
that they take advantage of the experience of the grandmothers and 66 % rely on
books. It is interesting to note that hardly anyone mentions specific magazines
or newspapers. (For the general newspaper market, see Table: Newspapers by
Subject.)<p>

<p>
5.7		The Legal Framework for Child Care<p>
<p>
I. Aim.	<p>
	<p>
	The aim of this section is to point out some of the main issues relevant to
the Legislation and Policies in the area of children's care and protection in
Bulgaria.<p>
<p>
II. Legislation.	<p>
<p>
1. Domestic Law.<p>
<p>
1.1. 	The body of domestic laws applicable to the field of children's care and
rights contains two groups of  laws /normative acts.  The first one, comprises
laws from the time of the communist rule in Bulgaria, and the second one
includes laws from the post-communist period or the period of transition that
Bulgaria undergoes at present. <p>
	<p>
1.1.1. Laws from the time of the communist rule.<p>
<p>
This group of laws represents the main cluster of  laws in the area of
children's care and protection.  The major laws of this group are, as
follows:<p>
<p>
#	Law on the persons and family, promulgated State Gazette, issue 182 of 1949,
last amendment in State Gazette, issue 20 of 1990;<p>
#	Civil procedural code, promulgated State Gazette, issue 12 of 1952, last
amendment in State Gazette, issue 93 of 1993;<p>
#	Family code, promulgated State Gazette, issue 41 of 1985, last amendment in
State Gazette, issue 11 of 1992;<p>
#	Law on the struggle against anti-

social
acts of the juveniles and minors, promulgated State Gazette, issue 13 of 1985,
last amendment in State Gazette, issue 11 of 1992;<p>
#	Ukase for encouragement of the births, promulgated State Gazette, issue 26 of
1958, last amendment in State Gazette, issue 88 of 1993;<p>
#	Law on the Bulgarian citizenship, promulgated State Gazette, issue 79 of
1968, last amendment in State Gazette, issue 38 of 1989;<p>
#	Labor code of 1951 /in force in part/, promulgated State Gazette, issue 91 of
1951, last amendment in State Gazette, issue 100 of 1992;<p>
#	Regulations on the employment of children under the age of 15 years,
promulgated State Gazette, issue 8 of 1987.<p>
<p>
1.1.2.  Main laws from the period of transition.<p>
<p>
#	Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria, promulgated State Gazette, issue 56
of 1991;<p>
#	Labor code, promulgated State Gazette, issue 26 of 1986, last amendment in
State Gazette, issue 100 of 1992;  <p>
<p>
	In addition to the above-

mentioned
laws in the two groups, there are some laws in the areas of education, social
and health care, which are of importance for the matter, as well.<p>
<p>
1.2.  	There are several characteristic features of the body of domestic laws
in the area of children's care and protection in Bulgaria.  First, there is no
separate act or acts, regulating the matter of children's rights and care.
Second, the legal provision concerning children's care and protection contains
obsolete and antinomies laws. Third, the legal provision which exists is
undergoing a difficult period of transition and formation.  <p>
<p>
2. International law.	<p>
<p>
2.1.  	The UN Convention on the Rights of Child.   The Convention on the Rights
of Child has been ratified by the Bulgarian Parliament on 11/04/1991.   The
text of the Convention has been promulgated in the State Gazette of Bulgaria,
issue N 55 of 1991.    Thus currently the Convention is a part of the Bulgarian
law, and as such it supersedes any provisions of the Bulgarian (domestic) law
that contradict its regulations. (Article 5, paragraph 4 of the Bulgarian
Constitution)<p>
<p>
	The Constitutional Court of Bulgaria is empowered to: "rule on the
compatibility between the Constitution and the international instruments
concluded by the Republic of Bulgaria prior to their ratification, and on the
compatibility of domestic laws with the universally recognized norms of
international law and the international instruments to which Bulgaria is a
party" (Article 149, paragraph 1, section 4 ), which, in fact, is the main
legal and Constitutional guarantee for the incorporation of the provisions of
the Convention into the Bulgarian law.  Therefore, we may draw the conclusion,
that, presently, the Convention on the Rights of Child is a part of the
Bulgarian law.<p>
<p>
2.2.	The application of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in Bulgaria -


some "sensitive issues".<p>
<p>
2.2.1.	Bulgaria has no Bill of Rights in its Legislation. Therefore, the
Fundamental Human Rights are provided in the Constitution of Bulgaria, Chapter
Two,  Fundamental Rights and Obligations of the Citizens.   Only a few of the
Children's Rights, recognized by the Convention, are explicitly proclaimed
within this Chapter of the Bulgarian Constitution. These include:<p>
<p>
Article 47 of the Bulgarian Constitution:<p>
	(1)	The raising and upbringing of children until they come of legal age shall
be a right and obligation of their parents and shall be assisted by the
state.<p>
	(2)	Mothers shall be the object of special protection on the part of the state
and shall be guaranteed prenatal and postnatal leave, free obstetric care,
alleviated working conditions and other social assistance.<p>
	(3)	Children born out of wedlock shall enjoy equal rights with those born in
wedlock.<p>
	(4)	Abandoned children shall enjoy the protection of the state and society.<p>
	(5)	The conditions and procedures for the restriction or suspension of
parental rights shall be established by law.<p>
<p>
   Article 53 of the Bulgarian Constitution (excerpt):<p>
	(1)	Everyone shall have the right to education.<p>
	(2)	School attendance up to age of 16 shall be compulsory.<p>
	(3)	Primary and secondary education in state and municipal schools shall be
free. ....<p>
<p>
	Two Bills, namely the Bill on the Child and the Bill on the Family, whose
regulations are in harmony with the Convention on the Rights of Child, which
were passed successfully through the Legislative Commission of the Bulgarian
Parliament, have been waiting on the Parliamentary agenda since the end of
1992, to be passed by the Bulgarian Parliament.  <p>
<p>
	These bills have not been given priority because currently, as Bulgaria is
undergoing a very difficult period of transition from communist centrally-

planed
economy to a market economy and democratic society. Therefore, the priorities
of the Bulgarian Legislator are neither laws in the area of the Human Rights,
especially the Rights of Children, nor laws in the social welfare area, but
laws in the field of economy.<p>
<p>
	In our opinion, it is necessary for the above two laws to be passed very soon
by the Bulgarian Parliament, to provide a better legal framework for children's
rights and policies in Bulgaria.<p>
<p>
2.2.2.	The second "sensitive issue", is that Bulgaria is undergoing an
institutional reform, at the same time.  The result is a lack of  appropriate
domestic institutions capable of implementing effectively the norms of the
Convention in Bulgaria.  <p>
<p>
	In our view, without assistance from the international community,  for
Bulgaria and for the rest of the countries in transition, in terms of financial
sources and technical assistance in the building of the institutional framework
for the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Child, on the one
hand, and, on the other hand, for formation and application of a coherent body
of domestic laws in the area of children's care and protection, the process of
legislative reform in this particular field in Bulgaria, as well as in the rest
of the countries in transition, will not be  successful.   Implementation of
the Laws in the field of Human Rights can be a successful process only in
welfare states, not in the states in transition, facing economic, social and
moral crises.  <p>
<p>
3. 	Basic conclusions.<p>
<p>
3.1. 	The Convention on the Rights of Child is a part of the Bulgarian law.<p>
<p>
3.2. 	Legislative, administrative and institutional measures have to be taken
by the Bulgarian authorities for the effective implementation of the Convention
on the Rights of Child and the rest of the relevant Bulgarian law in the field
of children's care and protection in Bulgaria.<p>
<p>
3.3. 	The International Community has to provide assistance to the countries in
transition for the efficient implementation of the Convention on the Rights of
Child and the relevant domestic laws in the area of children's care and
protection in their jurisdictions.<p>
<p>
III. Policies.<p>
<p>
1.	 We have to assume that neither before the changes, nor now, there is a clear-

cut
policy in Bulgaria effectively supporting children and families.  This is due,
on the one hand, to the fact that during the communist period the entire
economic and social environment in Bulgaria was not founded on a market basis,
which implies that they both have been to a certain extent artificial ones.<p>
<p>
	On the other hand, during the period of transition, in an environment,
characterized by a lack of working institutional framework in nearly each
sphere of  societal life, economic hardship and rapid changes in power, it is
not been possible for a separate, complex and coherent policy in the field of
children's rights and protection to be formulated, nor implemented in Bulgaria
at the present time.<p>
2. 	The government in place prior to the last government adopted a Complex
Programme for Children,  containing measures for implementation of the above-

mentioned
Convention on the Rights of Child.  This Programme has not been implemented at
all because of the current changes in the political situation in Bulgaria.<p>
<p>
For the moment, one cannot predict, whether the new Bulgarian government,
composed of the former communist, is going to take any steps in implementing
the Programme, or to adopt a new Programme in this regard.<p>
<p>
3.	 Conclusions:<p>
<p>
3.1. 	There is neither a clear-

cut
concept, nor policy in the field in Children's protection and care in Bulgaria
for the moment.<p>
<p>
3.2. 	There are not adequate  financial resources in Bulgaria for implementing
such policy, if it  existed.<p>
<p>
3.3. 	At present, the only institutions, working efficiently in this sphere,
are some International and Domestic Non-

Governmental
Institutions, whose efforts have to be supported by the International
Communities concerned.   <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
6. 	SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDIES<p>
<p>
We believe the following topics are worthy of further investigation:<p>
<p>
*	The psychological effects of traditional child raising models such as the
actual upbringing of children by their grandparents.<p>
<p>
*	The effect of the emerging social inequality and the development of
strategies to overcome the egalitarian mentality which is an impediment to
social progress.<p>
<p>
*	The economic dimensions of the problems of child care at the level of the
Government, the local authorities and the individual families. We assume that
the local authorities need special expertise in managing social funds and we
also believe that most Bulgarian families may benefit today from training in
managing the family budget in a more rational way.<p>
<p>
	We hope that the outcome of our work in this project should not only have a
scientific dimension. It was conceived in a way that specific recommendations
could be given as a result of our findings.  However, we believe that we can go
a step further.  By identifying the most poignant issues and the specific needs
of each country this project could be of use to the experts who assist Central
and Eastern Europe in our transition to democracy and market economy through
programmes financed by the World Bank which develop specific strategies,
methods and tools to solve the problems of child care facing our governments
and families today.<p>

<title>WHO IS CARING FOR THE CHILDREN</title><body>
<center><b>WHO IS CARING FOR THE CHILDREN?</b><p>
<b>AN EXPLORATORY SURVEY</b><p>
<b>conducted in </b><p>
<b>Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria and Romania</b><p>
</center><p>
<b>Executive Summary</b><p>
<p>
	As a result of changes in economic policy within Central and Eastern Europe
there have been changes in the quality of people&#146;s lives, including the
lives of children. Because of the long-term impact of early experiences,
children's needs in the changing economy cannot be overlooked.  This report is
about the changes in the lives of young children and their families that have
come about as a result of economic reforms.  The report, based on a study begun
in 1994, provides a description of the context within which children live in
Poland, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.  It attempts to answer the specific
question: In the shift to a market economy, <b>who is caring for the
children?</b><p>
<p>
	The specific objectives of this study were to: (a) provide a systematic
assessment of the changing child care situation for young children, in terms of
who is caring for the children and the quality of that care;  and (b) make
recommendations regarding future programming for children and their families,
given shifts to a market economy.<p>
<p>
	Those involved in the countries studies were: the National Institute for
Day-care Centres in Hungary, the Institute for Educational Research in Poland,
the Institute for Education Studies in Romania, and the Counseling and
Psychotherapy Centre in Bulgaria.  The organizations in Hungary, Poland and
Romania are all State-supported.  In Bulgaria the lead institution is a
non-governmental organization.<p>
<p>
<i>A Summary of Results</i><p>
<i></i><p>
	Prior to reforms in the early 1990s, within Eastern and Central European
countries resources were devoted to providing appropriate care and stimulation
for children in center-based programs, from the earliest months of life until
they entered primary school,.  The provision of formalized childcare had two
purposes.  First, it allowed women to participate fully in the workforce.
Second, it provided a way for the State to assure that all children were being
cared for according to the standard set by the State.  In some countries this
standard was high and the quality of care provided a model for others to follow
in terms of caring for children.  In other countries, however, childcare
centers were places where children were kept but not cared for nor
stimulated.<p>
<p>
	As social policies began to change as a result of economic reforms there was a
fear that there would be a decrease in children's opportunities to participate
in quality early childhood programs, and that this would have a negative impact
on children's development, particularly if these programs were not replaced by
adequate parenting support and alternative forms of care and stimulation.  Thus
there was an interest in understanding more fully the impact of the changes on
children&#146;s lives.<p>
	The four countries in the study are all experiencing a rapid rise in poverty,
and at the present time families are under great stress.  They are being forced
to move from what was a secure world to one that presents challenges and
unknowns never before imagined. They are struggling to survive with unreliable
and insufficient incomes; housing is inadequate; food supplies are
unpredictable; and families are faced with the issue of how to provide for
their children. There has been a shift in ideology away from the State taking
responsibility for the children to a focus on the importance of the
<i>family,</i> and an emphasis on the role of the mother, in particular, in
providing appropriate support for the child&#146;s growth and development.<p>
<p>
	While it is easy to be cynical and say that the focus on the family is just
the State&#146;s way to justify limiting women&#146;s participation in the
workforce, to keep people from being distressed about high unemployment rates,
and to justify the decreasing State support for childcare facilities, the
reality is that responsibility for the care of young children has been shifted
to families. Thus a critical question is, what supports are available to
families in their parenting role?  <p>
<p>
	To put the supports available to families today into context, it is important
to have an understanding of the situation prior to the shift to a market
economy.  An extensive system of allowances, benefits and leaves was created
that provided both appropriate care and stimulation for young children and
opportunities for women who were already in the work force to maintain their
employment and income during the early years of a child's life.  Support for
families and children took several forms.  While these differed somewhat from
country to country, the basic supports available in the countries included in
the study consisted of:  <p>
<i></i><p>
<i>mmaternity and child health services</i>- health services were available
free of charge as part of a comprehensive social service system to those
employed full-time by the State and cooperative sector or through membership in
State-controlled associations.  Coverage was high: close to 100% of deliveries
were attended by trained personnel; immunization rates were high; and nearly
all women had access to prenatal health care.<p>
   <p>
<i>childbirth grants/maternity aid</i> - a one-time payment was given to
families on the birth of a child.<p>
<p>
<i>child/family allowance</i> - a monthly allowance was provided to families
from birth until the child was 16-21 years of age, depending on the country and
whether or not the child was still in school.  This was meant to compensate
families for the additional expenses incurred as a result of having children.<p>
<p>
<i>maternity leave</i>  - a paid leave was provided to employed mothers before
and after delivery of the child.  It was paid from social security funds for a
period of 4 to 7 months.  The amount was between 50 and 100% of the
mother&#146;s salary, depending on how long she had been employed and where the
new baby was in the birth order. (For each subsequent child the time available
and/or the amount she was paid was greater.)<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>parental leave</i> - an extended leave, sometimes available to either
parent, paid or unpaid, was granted until the child was at least 2 and
sometimes until the child was 3.  Eligibility for this leave was based on
employment history, with the amount of the benefit based on a variety of
formulas.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Sick child allowance</i> - paid leave was provided for employed parents to
care for a sick child at home.  Eligibility in terms of number of days that
could be used each year and the age of the child difference from country to
country.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Housing -</i> subsidies, payments and/or preferences were given to families
with children.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>childcare:</i><p>
<i>nurseries/creches </i>- center-based programs were provided for children
from a few months after birth to three (four) years of age.  These were
generally operated by the Ministry of Health, thus staff were health-care
providers.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>preschools/kindergartens</i> - center-based programs were provided for
children from three (four) to six (seven) years of age. This were operated by
the Ministry of Education and had a much greater focus on educational
activities.  <p>
<p>
	When quality provision existed, children attending the programs benefitted.
Within the center-based programs provided for the children they received health
care, 3-5 meals a day and, in the best situations, an educational program. <p>
<p>
	Enrollment in nurseries/creches (for children from several months after birth
to 3 years of age) and preschools/kindergartens for 3-6 year olds) was
voluntary, and for the most part it was provided by the State. Attendance in
creches/nurseries was low due to the childcare allowance provided by
government, which made it possible for women to stay home with their children
for the first two to three years of the child's life.  Many women took
advantage of this. Thus there was not a great demand for creches/nurseries.
For example, childcare attendance was highest in Bulgaria where in 1992 it was
serving 14% of the 0-2 population.  In the other countries in the study it was
lower.  With the exception of some rural areas where there was inadequate
coverage, this level of provision appears to have been meeting the need.<p>
<p>
	On the other hand, center-based programs for the 3-6 year olds (preschool and
kindergartens) began in the early 1800s.  They were widely used and increased
in popularity and coverage until 1980. Historically a large percentage of the
population took advantage of preschools/kindergartens, although they were never
mandatory.  <p>
	<p>
	As a result of the movement to a market economy, the social support systems
are changing.  In all the countries included in the study the State employs
fewer people, social services have been decentralized (with the exception of
Romania) and privatization is underway, leading to the restructuring of
enterprises and changes in the provision of social supports.  During the early
years of the transition governments did not make changes in the social support
policies in relation to the health, education, and social services.
Nonetheless, overall fiscal austerity and the shift of responsibility from the
State to local authorities has affected all social sectors, including what is
provided for children.   In 1994, governments began to put forward changes in
family support policies, and in 1995 we are seeing the first implementation of
some of these changes.<p>
<p>
<i>Conclusions</i><p>
<p>
	One of the initial motivations for the study came out of data that indicated
that unemployment rates are higher for women than for men, particularly for
women in the early childbearing years.  Data also indicated that childcare
places were being closed.  Putting these data together the question was asked:
&#147;Are women, for whom the ethos has been to work full-time, now choosing to
stay home and raise their children, thus leading to their unemployment and a
decreased need for childcare?&#148;  Looking at the reality of a family&#146;s
life through this study has made it abundantly clear that families in most of
the Central and Eastern European countries cannot survive on only one wage.
Both parents have to work to meet even the most basic of needs.<p>
<p>
	Women&#146;s higher unemployment rates are not because women want to stay home
and raise a family, they are the result of economic policies which make women
of childbearing age less desirable to hire.  For example, companies that employ
women full time are then responsible for paying maternity benefits.  In order
to avoid this, companies put women on short-term contracts that don&#146;t
include maternity benefits, or they hire men instead.  An indication of the
reality of the situation is that in Bulgaria women under the age of 30 (prime
childbearing years) constitute 70% of the group of unemployed women. (UNICEF,
1994, pg. 46)<p>
<p>
	So, if women need to work, and do so when they can find employment, why are
childcare places closing?  There are several reasons:<p>
<p>
1.	<i>A decentralization of responsibility for child care</i>.  In Poland,
Hungary and Bulgaria responsibility for funding and supporting child care has
been shifted from central government to local authorities/municipalities.  In
Romania these functions remain centralized.   One of the problems with
decentralization is that local authorities are unable to finance and/or manage
child care and kindergartens at the level previously provided by the State.
Thus while some local authorities have maintained childcare services, others
have given higher priority to other social services that they are required to
provide.  A strategy that local governments have adopted to compensate for the
loss of State support is to introduce substantial user fees.<p>
<p>
2	<i>The introduction of user fees</i>.  In most countries prior to the shift,
childcare (nurseries and creches for children 0-3) and preschools/kindergartens
(for children 3-6 years of age) were free.  (The exception was Poland where a
minimal fee was charged, and even this could be waived if the family was unable
to pay it).  Today user fees can be disproportionally high because of changes
in income.<p>
<p>
3.  	<i>The deterioration of real income</i>.  Money earned is buying much
less.  This coupled with the fact that families are now required to pay fees
for a variety of services previously provided by the State, is forcing families
to make choices among the services they need. The impact of these choices has
already been seen in relation to child care.   Growing numbers of parents are
not able to pay the fees being charged and are withdrawing their children from
child care and kindergartens. Families where only one parent is working cannot
afford these fees; even in two-worker families the fees constitute a
significant portion of family income.  When parents cannot pay the fees,
children cannot attend childcare programs.<p>
<p>
4.	<i>A decrease in the birthrate</i>.  Fewer and fewer children are being
born.  The age cohort that would be eligible to receive these services has been
shrinking.  Thus, even though facilities are being closed, in many places the
relative percentage of children within a given age group that is being served
has remained more or less the same.<p>
<p>
5.  	<i>Privatization.</i>  Emerging small-scale businesses and private
industry are not offering the child care supports previously available to
families.  They can neither support long-term leaves nor provide subsidized
daycare at the work place.  Thus women working in these businesses do not have
access to organized child care.<p>
<p>
6.   	<i>Current forms of childcare are not meeting the need</i>.  Center-based
childcare, as currently structured, does not meet women&#146;s needs.  Even if
they could afford it, many families are not eligible for childcare provided by
local authorities, given the criteria that must be met in order to make use of
these services.  Thus women seek childcare elsewhere.  In some instances this
is provided through the extended family, and/or within the neighborhood.<p>
<p>
	In terms of the quality of care being provided, across all the countries there
is a sense that standards are slipping.   When central government was
responsible for the provision of funding and support, standards could be
maintained.  As control for the delivery of services has shifted to local
governments, where the investment in the provision of child care in fiscal and
human terms is decreasing, there is a belief that the quality of care will be
affected negatively.   In some countries it is already possible to see a
deterioration in services.<p>
<p>
	The preservation and improvement of the institution of parental leave has
contributed considerably to lessening tensions between work and early child
care in most countries in transition. (ICDC, 1993, pg. 59)  But these leaves
are only of value <b><i>if</i></b> women are guaranteed employment upon return
from leave, and <b><i>if </i></b>professional women are not penalized in terms
of career opportunities by being out of the workforce for three years.  An
indication that these guarantees are not yet in place is the fact that in
Bulgaria only 32% of parents of children ages 0-2 are on parental leave.  This
has been the rate since 1989.  In Hungary in 1989, 69% of the parents took
parental leave.  This has been decreasing steadily, with it being 53% in 1991
and only 43% in 1992. (ICDC, 1993, pg 60) In Poland there is an increase in
demand for creches/nurseries. <p>
<p>
	Thus families continue to seek childcare alternatives.  With the introduction
of privatization and self-employment opportunities there is the possibility of
more flexibility in terms of schedules.  Theoretically this would allow parents
more time for childcare.  But with the need for a minimum of two incomes for
families to survive, parents are not able to take advantage of this
flexibility.  Rather, parents are more likely to be seeking alternative, more
flexible forms of childcare as they try to mesh family responsibilities with
unpredictable work schedules. <p>
<p>
	One option is privatized child care, particularly at the
preschool/kindergarten level, but this is costly and not accessible to poor or
middle-income families.  Nonetheless, there are an increasing number of private
childcare programs and kindergartens, but at present they are unregulated.<p>
<p>
	Family or neighborhood-based child care is another option being explored by
some.  But at this point there is little experience with this alternative, and
there is no legal framework which would support the development of this
alternative.  However, it should be explored as it would create an employment
opportunity for the woman providing the care and offer a necessary service for
women who are employed outside the home.<p>
<p>
	The relative importance and impact of the variables that have affected both
the quantity and quality of child care listed above differs among the countries
included in the study.  The reports of the individual country studies which
follow provide a picture of what is occurring specifically in Poland, Hungary,
Romania and Bulgaria.<p>
<p>
	In sum, from the data available it can be concluded that:<p>
<p>
 The majority of children 0-3 years of age are still being cared for within the
family -- whether or not women are on paid leave, on unpaid leave, or
unemployed.<p>
<p>
 The percentage of children within the 3-6 year age cohort that are attending
preschools/ kindergartens has not changed dramatically since the reforms, but
it is on the decline.  In Poland there are more children seeking places than
there are places available, but in the other countries the existing places are
not full, although the distribution of places does not always match
children&#146;s needs.<p>
<p>
 Parents would like to have their children attend preschool/kindergartens, but
the fees now being charged--for meals and a variety of activities--make the
costs prohibitive.  As a result,  many children are being deprived of these
early childhood experiences.  There are no clear data on how parents are
providing for the children who are no longer attending
preschools/kindergartens.  In some instances there is much greater reliance on
the extended family; in other instances there are informal care networks within
neighborhoods, but the bottom line is that we don&#146;t know what is happening
for these children.<p>
<p>
 With the introduction and/or increase in fees there will be increasing
inequities within the culture in terms of who is able to have access to early
childhood programs.  The preschool/ kindergarten experiences that have been
available to all children, putting them all on an equal footing when they enter
the primary school, will increasingly become something that only middle-class
parents can afford.  They will not be available to children living in poverty.
This will lead to greater inequalities in terms of children&#146;s performance
in primary school, setting those children who have had the early childhood
experiences on the road to school achievement, while those without preschool
will not be fully prepared to take on the challenge.<p>
<p>
 The quality of care within center-based programs is declining.  Resources are
no longer available to maintain the necessary professional staff, and the
maintenance of facilities is largely dependent on the commitment of local
authorities to the provision of childcare. <p>
<p>
<i>Recommendations</i><p>
<i></i><p>
	The specific recommendations that arise from these findings are as follows:<p>
<p>
1.	Alternative forms of child care need to be developed.  The most logical
approach is to develop family-based child care within the community and to
strengthen a sense of community responsibility for the upbringing of
children.<p>
<p>
2	Investment should be made in the development of parent education materials
and classes.  Young parents of today were raised under an ideology that
emphasized the importance of the State and did not emphasize the value of the
family as an important unit within society.  Thus the parenting they
experienced did not provide them with a model that is appropriate today where
there is a renewed emphasis on the importance and value of family. As a result,
young parents need access to information that will prepare them for the role of
parenting.<p>
<p>
3	As the services offered by government are declining--in scope and
quality--there is a need for human capacity-building in general, but
specifically within the NGO world.  NGOs are an emerging phenomenon that need
to be supported appropriately--financially and in terms of technical assistance
to build management and administrative skills.  Further, NGOs need to be
encouraged to develop culturally-appropriate family support models that will
enhance the family&#146;s capability to raise children and address directly the
needs of young children.<p>
<p>
4	Further research needs to be conducted to assess the experiences of children
in these countries today on a more micro-level.<p>
<p>
5	The changes in government policy should be monitored closely, with an
assessment of their impact made early on, in order to anticipate what that will
mean in the lives of families and children.  <p>
<p>
6	The needs of young children and their families should be brought to the
attention of policy-makers, making them aware of the importance of the early
years for the development of the child and ultimately for the development of
the society as a whole.<p>

<b>WHO IS CARING FOR THE CHILDREN?</b><p>
<b> AN EXPLORATORY SURVEY</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<p>
<p>
Starting from late 1989, practically all centrally-planned countries of Central
and Eastern Europe (CEE) began introducing radical political and economic
changes aimed at transforming their nations into pluralistic, market-based
democracies.  However, the pervasiveness, suddenness, extent and speed of these
reforms and the radical changes they seek to bring about--particularly in the
economic sphere--are without historical precedent.  Even the most fertile
imagination could not have envisaged the profoundeness of the changes to be
introduced. <p>
										( ICDC, 1993, pg. 1)<p>
<p>
The <i>profoundness of changes</i> has not been limited to the economic sphere.
As a result of changes in economic policy there have been changes in the
quality of people&#146;s lives, including the lives of children. Because of the
long-term impact of early experiences, children's needs in the changing economy
cannot be overlooked.  This report is about the changes in the lives of young
children and their families.  It provides a description of the context within
which children live in Poland, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.  It attempts to
answer the specific question: In the shift to a market economy, <b>who is
caring for the children?</b>  This report is based on a study begun in early
1994 designed to provide some answers to the question for the children in the
four countries mentioned above.  It is presented in two parts.  The first part
provides an overview and synthesis of what was discovered within the four
countries.  The second part contains the full reports from each of the
individual countries.<b>[1]</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>I.  	INTRODUCTION</b><p>
	<p>
	Why the focus on young children?  There are two reasons for looking
particularly at the needs of young children.  The first has to do with the fact
that what happens during the early years for young children, in terms of their
health, nutrition, and psycho-social development provides the basis for their
well-being and their ability to learn, and it lays the foundation for how they
live their adult lives.  This suggests the second reason for a focus on
children, which is that children are the future of the country.  The quality of
their early years and the way they are raised will determine the kind of
contribution they can make when they take on the responsibility of continuing
the society.  Inadequate child care, as defined by the lack of appropriate
child and parent interaction and/or lack of environmental stimulation, can
cause serious delays in the psychological and cognitive development of
children, which can have immediate and long-term effects, including increased
delinquency among adolescents  and reduced productivity in adults. (Myers,
1995)  Thus it is important that children's needs for health, nutrition and
stimulation be addressed during the early years.   The question is, how is this
best done?<p>
<p>
	The needs of young children can be addressed in a range of settings--at home
and in early childhood programs.  Before the recent refomrs, within Eastern and
Central European countries resources were devoted to providing appropriate care
and stimulation for children in center-based programs, from the earliest months
of life until they entered primary school. The provision of formalized
childcare had two purposes.  First it allowed women to participate fully in the
workforce.  Second, it provided a way for the State to assure that all children
were being cared for according to the standard set by the State.  In some
countries this standard was high and the quality of care provided a model for
others to follow in terms of caring for children.  In other countries, however,
childcare centers were places where children were kept but neither cared for
nor stimulated.<p>
<p>
	As social policies began to change as a result of economic reforms there was a
fear that there would be a decrease in children's opportunities to participate
in quality early childhood programs, and that this would have a negative impact
on children's development, particularly if these programs were not replaced by
adequate parenting support and alternative forms of care and stimulation.  This
concern derives from the fact that there are questions about the extent to
which parents are prepared and able to take on greater responsibility for
raising their children, given the role that the State has played in
people&#146;s lives.  An analysis of the situation is provided in the ICDC
Report which states:<p>
<p>
The centralization, paternalism and lack of popular participation typical of
socialist social policies engendered a strong sense of passivity and dependence
among the population and contributed to the weakening of the family&#146;s role
in the socialization, upbringing and education of children.  Indeed the need to
rely on two full-time salaries to ensure adequate living conditions, the
erosion of the traditional family and the strong role advocated by the State in
child socialization have all played a part in the rapid rise of poverty. (1993,
pg. 4)<p>
<p>
	There is indeed a rapid rise in poverty, and at the present time families are
under great stress.  They are being forced to move from what was a secure world
to one that presents challenges and unknowns never before imagined. They are
struggling to survive with unreliable and insufficient incomes; housing is
inadequate; food supplies are unpredictable; and families are faced with the
issue of how to provide for their children. There has been a shift in ideology
away from the State taking responsibility for the children to a focus on the
importance of the <i>family,</i> and an emphasis on the role of the mother, in
particular, in providing appropriate support for the child&#146;s growth and
development.<p>
	While it is easy to be cynical and say that the focus on the family is just
the State&#146;s way to justify limiting women&#146;s participation in the
workforce, to keep people from being distressed about high unemployment rates,
and to justify the decreasing State support for childcare facilities, the
reality is that responsibility for the care of young children has been shifted
to families. Thus a critical question is, what supports are available to
families as they shift their parenting role?  To put the supports available to
families today into context, it is important to have an understanding of the
situation prior to the shift to a market economy.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>II.   BEFORE THE SHIFT TO A MARKET ECONOMY</b> <p>
<p>
	The economic and social systems developed in Central and Eastern Europe
following World War II were built on an economy that required the full
participation of all adults.  Several things had to be accomplished.  First,
mechanisms had to be established that would allow for the full-time
participation of all able adults in the economy.  Second, there had to be
enough support to families that couples felt they could have children and it
would not significantly change their quality of life.  Thus an extensive system
of allowances, benefits and leaves was created that provided both appropriate
care and stimulation for young children and opportunities for women who were
already in the work force to maintain their employment and income during the
early years of a child's life.  As noted in the report from Hungary:<p>
<p>
The state socialist political system of the past forty years was characterized
by the dominance of a "caring state".  Families with children were given state
support at the expense of salaries, which did not correspond to the full value
of the worker's socially useful work, but only to a fraction of it.  This was
justified by state-financed health care, education, leisure time activities and
social services.  However, the funds drawn away from the employees this way
were increasingly spent for financing an obsolete, deficit-producing economy,
with the result that less and less money was spent on the "non-productive"
sector:  the health services, education, culture and social services.  In spite
of this process, however, by the end of the 1980s, a wide range of social
benefits were established.  (Korintus, 1995, pg. 2)<p>
<p>
	Support for families and children took several forms.  While these differed
somewhat from country to country, the basic supports available in the countries
included in the study consisted of:  <i></i><p>
<i>mmaternity and child health services</i>- health services were available
free of charge as part of a comprehensive social service system to those
employed full-time by the State and cooperative sector or through membership in
State-controlled associations.  Coverage was high: close to 100% of deliveries
were attended by trained personnel; immunization rates were high; and nearly
all women had access to prenatal health care.<p>
   <p>
<i>childbirth grants/maternity aid</i> - a one-time payment was given to
families on the birth of a child.<p>
<p>
<i>child/family allowance</i> - a monthly allowance was provided to families
from birth until the child was 16-21 years of age, depending on the country and
whether or not the child was still in school.  This was meant to compensate
families for the additional expenses incurred as a result of having children.
Benefits were designed to encourage families of a specific size.  There were
increments in the payments up to the desired family size.  The allowance was
then lowered for additional children.  The benefit varied from 3-20% of the
average wage, with eligibility related to full-time employment history.<p>
<p>
<i>maternity leave</i>  - a paid leave was provided to employed mothers before
and after delivery of the child.  It was paid from social security funds for a
period of 4 to 7 months.  The amount was between 50 and 100% of the
mother&#146;s salary, depending on how long she had been employed and where the
new baby was in the birth order. (For each subsequent child the time available
and/or the amount she was paid was greater.)<p>
<p>
<i>parental leave</i> - an extended leave, sometimes available to either
parent, paid or unpaid, was granted until the child was at least 2 and
sometimes until the child was 3.  Eligibility for this leave was based on
employment history, with the amount of the benefit based on a variety of
formulas (equal to minimum wage, a percentage of income earned during the
previous year of employment, etc.)  (In Romania parents were offered unpaid
leave until the child was 3.  In Hungary even parents who had not been employed
could get a minimum benefit.  In Bulgaria there were 2 years of paid leave with
the third year unpaid.  In Poland women were allowed unpaid leave for up to
three years.)<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Sick child allowance</i> - paid leave was provided for employed parents to
care for a sick child at home.  Eligibility in terms of number of days that
could be used each year and the age of the child differed from country to
country.   (In Bulgaria it was 60 days/year until the child was 10.  In Romania
it was available only until the child was 3, but the number of days per year
was unlimited.)<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Housing -</i> subsidies, payments and/or preferences were given to families
with children.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>childcare:</i><p>
<i>nurseries/creches </i>- center-based programs were provided for children
from a few months after birth to three (four) years of age.  These were
generally operated by the Ministry of Health, thus staff were health-care
providers. <p>
<i></i><p>
<i>preschools/kindergartens</i> - center-based programs were offered for
children from three (four) to six (seven) years of age. These were operated by
the Ministry of Education and had a much greater focus on educational
activities.  <p>
<p>
	When quality provision was offered, children attending the programs
benefitted.  Within the center-based programs provided for the children they
received health care, 3-5 meals a day and, in the best situations, an
educational program. <p>
<p>
	Enrollment in nurseries/creches (for children from several months after birth
to 3 years of age) and preschools/kindergartens for 3-6 year olds) was
voluntary, and for the most part it was provided by the State.  Attendance in
creches/nurseries was low, due to the childcare allowance provided by
government, which made it possible for women to stay home with their children
for the first two to three years of the child's life.  Many women took
advantage of this.  Thus there was not a great demand for creches/nurseries.
For example, childcare attendance was highest in Bulgaria where in 1992 it was
serving 14% of the 0-2 population.  In the other countries in the study it was
lower.  With the exception of some rural areas where there was inadequate
coverage, this level of provision appears to have been meeting the need.<p>
<p>
	On the other hand, center-based programs for the 3-6 year olds, begun in the
early 1800s,  were widely used, and increased in popularity and coverage until
1980. Historically a large percentage of the population took advantage of
preschools/kindergartens, although they were never mandatory.  <p>
	As a result of the movement to a market economy, the social support systems
are changing.  In all the countries included in the study the State employs
fewer people, social services have been decentralized (with the exception of
Romania) and privatization is underway, leading to the restructuring of
enterprises and changes in the provision of social supports.  During the early
years of the transition, governments did not make overt changes in the social
support policies in relation to health, education, and social services.
Overall fiscal austerity and the shift of responsibility for social services
from the State to local authorities has affected all social sectors, including
what is provided for children.   The restructuring of government has had a
significant impact on the accessibility and quality of social services.
Increasingly changes are being made in social policy, most of which have a
negative impact on the family and young children.  In 1994, governments began
to put forward changes in family support policies, and in 1995 we are seeing
the first implementation of some of these changes.<p>

<b>III.   THE STUDY </b><p>
	<p>
	In recognition of the changing economic and social situations in the countries
studied, the objectives of this study were formulated.  In general they were
to: (a) provide a systematic assessment of the changing child care situation
for young children, in terms of who is caring for the children and the quality
of that care;  and (b) make recommendations regarding future programming for
children and their families, in light of the shifts to a market economy.<p>
<p>
	The study began with a general literature review. While there are considerable
data describing the child care settings under the previous regimes, and UNICEF
has done some situational analyses of women and children, there was little
information available on current child care and pre-school provision as the
study began.<b>[2]</b> <p>
<p>
	The next step was to identify a lead research institution within each of the
four countries included in the study.  Those involved in the country studies
were: the National Institute for Day-care Centres in Hungary, the Institute for
Educational Research in Poland, the Institute for Education Studies in Romania,
and the Counseling and Psychotherapy Centre in Bulgaria.  The organizations in
Hungary, Poland and Romania are all State-supported.  In Bulgaria the lead
institution is a non-governmental organization.<p>
<p>
	Early in the course of the study a meeting was held in Budapest, Hungary to
determine the extent to which comparable data could be collected in each
country.<b>[3]</b>  At the meeting the situation in
each country was described, and it was determined that given the unique
characteristics of each country, and the lack of reliable data sets, there
would not be a common research design. However, a set of <i>themes</i> was
identified that all participants agreed would be important to address.  To the
extent possible, each country attempted to address each of the themes.  Given
the resources available (financial, human and time) it was not possible to
conduct an in-depth review.  In essence the study is meant to provide a picture
of the situation of young children in <i>broad strokes</i>.  From the results
it is possible to identify research interests and/or possible programming
opportunities for which additional funds can be sought.<p>
<p>
The major themes explored in each country study included:<p>
<p>
1.	Demographic data - population, birth rate, household composition, employment
of parents<p>
2.	Settings - where young children are cared for, and when, as well as changes
in child care settings that have occurred since 1989/90<p>
3.	Providers  - types of caregivers (family, neighbors, trained and untrained
workers, etc.) 	their qualifications and training available <p>
4. 	Programs/Services - what happens during a child's day<p>
5.	Costs and financing - what does it cost and who pays for it<p>
6. 	Quality of care being provided<p>
7. 	Parent involvement - information, materials and supports available to
parents<p>
8.  	Availability and use of public awareness materials regarding child
development<p>
9. 	Legislation/policy - what policies are in place and what is being changed<p>
10.	The relationship between women's work and child care (i.e. the relationship
between decreases in the availability of child care and women's decreasing
participation in the work force)<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>IV.  RESULTS</b><p>
<p>
	On the surface it would appear that the changes occurring in Central and
Eastern Europe are very similar.  The timing of the shift to a market economy
has been similar.  Economic reforms were first introduced in Eastern Europe in
late 1989 in the countries studied, with the exception of Hungary, which began
modifying its price and ownership system in 1968.  Specifically, Poland
introduced its first comprehensive reform program in 1990. Bulgaria and Romania
followed somewhat later.  While introducing some initial reforms in 1990,
reforms increased in intensity and scope in 1991 in Bulgaria and in 1992 and
1993 in Romania.  Thus the shift in economic and social policies has been
underway in the countries included in the study for three to five years.<p>
<p>
	Early on close attention was being paid to the economic impact of policy
changes. It was not until later that attention has been focused also on the
impact of the shifts on the quality of people&#146;s lives.   What has been
discovered is that economic polices that were created at the stroke of a pen
have had profound impacts on people&#146;s lives.  Thus it is critical to
assess the social costs of the transition. These costs have implications for
people&#146;s personal lives and for the long-term sustainability of the
reforms.  On the personal level there is unnecessary suffering and a waste of
human lives, and on the societal level the stress on individuals and families
represents a source of considerable instability that could well jeopardize the
reform process.<p>
<p>
	From a look at tables it is possible to see how the numbers are changing -- in
terms of infant mortality rates, unemployment, the percentage of families
living in poverty, etc.   It is possible to analyze these numbers and make
comparative statements about the quality of life in different countries.<a
href="euexe_fn.html#fn0">[4]</a>  But frequently the numbers gloss over the
day-to-day reality of people&#146;s lives.   In the study summarized in this
report there was an attempt to pull together some basic statistics that would
allow for comparisons -- both within country over time and across
countries--and to try to get at what these numbers mean for people.  We begin
with the data.<p>
<p>
<i>The Data</i><p>
<i></i><p>
	This section presents some of the basic data on each of the four countries
included in the study.  This allows an analysis of what has been happening over
time in each of the countries and it allows comparisons across the countries.<p>
	Table 1 presents data on the population and how it is changing.  From Table 1
it is possible to see that in Bulgaria and Hungary, since the early 1980's
there has been a steady decrease in the population (5% Bulgaria, 4% Hungary).
In Poland there has been an 8% increase and in Romania there has only been a 2%
increase.<p>

	One explanation for the decreases in the population in Bulgaria and Hungary is
the significant decreases in the birth rate in these countries. (See Table 2).
There was a 28.8% decrease in Bulgaria&#146;s birth rate and a 19.3% decrease
in the birth rate in Hungary between 1980 and 1993.  But if crude birth rate
were a sufficient explanation, then Poland and Romania should also be seeing
population decreases, since the decrease in the crude birth rate was even
greater in these countries (34.6% for Poland and 39.2% for Romania). <p>

	Another variable that may important in explaining a decreasing population is
the Crude Death Rate (See Table 3).  This has been increasing in all four

Again, these data would suggest a population decrease, especially when these
are combined with the data on crude birth rate.  However, neither of these data
are sufficient to explain the decrease in population.  In a search within the
country reports for further clarity, emigration rates were analysed.
Emigration, in fact seems to be a significant variable in population decreases.
For example, it is estimated that between 4 and 4.5 million Hungarians live
outside Hungary.  The Bulgarian report also indicates high emigration rates.<p>
<p>
	The data in Tables 1-3 are, as their titles suggest, <i>crude</i>.  They mask
what is going on in terms of fertility, birth and death rates, and the changes
that are going on for women in terms of when and how often they conceive and
give birth.<p>

<b>Young Children</b><p>

As can be seen from the table, the percentage of the population represented by
those under 4 has been decreasing since 1980 in all countries.  These data are
consistent with the general declines in population growth.  In essence women
are having fewer children.  Further evidence of this can be seen in Table 5
which presents data on fertility rates.  The largest change was in Romania,
where there was a 41% decrease, followed by Bulgaria at 29%, Poland at 19% and

	In addition to looking at the fertility rate, there are interesting data
provided by an analysis of who the women are that are having children.  Tables
6 through 8 help paint the picture.  The first things that can be seen is that
increasingly younger and younger women are having children in Bulgaria and
Romania (see Table 6).  In Poland and Hungary the percentage of mothers under
the age of 20 has remained more or less the same since 1989: 8% and 12%

	Table 7 suggests that in all the countries where data are available, more and
more of these young women are not married when they have children.  The issue
is discussed at length within the Bulgaria report.<p>
<p>
For decades in the past, society had negative attitudes about extramarital
births and it was not a compliment to be called <i>a single mother</i>, <i>a
bastard</i>, or even <i>an adopted child</i>. Today, the economic crisis is
very severe and it is difficult for single mothers, but the psychological
barriers have changed and many women who have extramarital babies prefer to
keep them. (Kornazheva, 1995, pg. 23)<p>
<p>
The reports indicate that this trend is likely to continue. This means that
there is an ever-increasing population of single-parent families.  This is
particularly frightening when data on family income, which follows, indicates
that it takes two parents working for a family to simply survive.  There will
need to be increased social support for the single-parent families.  This is
already happening in Poland and Bulgaria, where single parents (mothers or
fathers) are provided with larger allowances/child than two-parent families.<p>

	Abortion has never been encouraged in Poland, and in fact, there is an
anti-abortion law in effect which keeps the abortion rate extremely low.  In
Hungary there was a relatively high abortion rate prior to 1992, at which point
a law was instituted that makes abortions more difficult, and contraceptives
were made more widely available.  (UNICEF, 1994, pg. 60) There was a
significant decrease in abortions in 1993, and it is anticipated that the rate
will continue to decline.<p>
<p>
<p>
	Romania and Bulgaria present quite different social policies in relation to
abortion.  In both countries abortion is used as a form of contraception.   (In
Romania there were 1 million abortions in 1990.  The cost of an abortion in
Romania is less than a 3-month supply of contraceptives. (UNICEF, 1994, pgs.
65-66))  The impact of such high abortion rates can be seen in terms of
maternal mortality rates (see Table 9).    In Romania maternal mortality rates
are very high. One explanation for the high rates in Romania is the fact that
abortions were illegal prior to the reforms, yet they were the most common form
of birth control. It can be hypothesized that many women died as the result of
abortions that took place under conditions that put the women at great risk.
The same does not appear to be the case in Bulgaria. Since the maternal
mortality rates in Bulgaria are relatively low, it would appear that the
conditions under which women abort are not so life-threatening in Bulgaria.
However, one can imagine the toll a series of abortions would take on a
woman&#146;s body and what it would mean in terms of women&#146;s ability to
conceive when they want to have a child.  <p>

<b>Birth Outcomes</b><p>
<p>
	What happens for those children who are born?  Data on birth outcomes provide
some indication of the health of the population.  There are better birth
outcomes when women are provided with quality prenatal care and when women have
the appropriate nutrition prior to the birth of the baby. One way to look at
this is in terms of the Infant Mortality Rate - IMR (Table 10) and the
Under-Five Mortality Rate (Table 11).  These provide some indication of the
health of women when they have children and the conditions under which children
are born.<p>

The data indicate that between 1980 and 1989 there was a
decrease in the IMR in all countries.  Soon after transition the rates
increased somewhat in Bulgaria and Hungary, but subsequently they started to
decrease once again.  Poland and Romania, for the most part, continue to have
decreasing rates.  While the rates are decreasing they are still higher than

	The same trends can be seen in the Under-5 Mortality data.  In essence, the
conditions that produce children who survive and who remain alive during the
early years, have been improving.  In discussions about the current health care
systems in the four countries, however, the researchers indicate that these
systems are beginning to deteriorate, and unless there is an infusion of
support into the health system, there is likely to be a reversal in IMR and
Under-5 Mortality rates.<p>
<p>
	What these data show collectively is that given the smaller number of children
- both in absolute terms and in terms of the percentage of the population that
young children represent - under the previous political and economic system
there might well have been a closing of some childcare facilities since there
were fewer children.  The shift to a market economy is not, in and of itself,
an explanation for the closing of facilities.  Further, those children being
born into the world today are at much greater risk of delayed and debilitated
development, given that they are born to younger and younger women, who are not
fully adults themselves, and they are being born to women who are having the
children on their own and thus they will struggle even more than others to
provide the financial underpinning necessary to sustain a family.<p>
<p>
<p>
The Impact of the Transition on the Family<p>
<p>
	Clearly families in all four countries are under a great deal of economic
stress as a result of economic changes.  One indication of the stress is the
inflation rate.  This is presented in Table 12, with the consumer price index
set at 100 in 1989.   Poland was hit immediately at the time of transition with
high inflation, and it has been increasing significantly each year since then.
During the initial transition years inflation was controlled somewhat in the
other countries, particularly Hungary.  There has been a steady increase in
inflation in Bulgaria with a huge jump between 1992 and 1993 (56%).  The
situation is even worse in Romania.  During the same one-year period there was
a 338% increase in inflation.<p>

At the same time that inflation is making it impossible for families to
purchase even the most basic necessities, the State is decreasing the support
that it provides (Table 13), and the reports clearly indicate that even this

	But what if parents are unemployed? <p>
 Table on unemployment rates<p>
<p>
	In relation to issues of childcare, it is most significant to look at
women&#146;s unemployment rates.  Up until the 1989-1992 period the size of the
working-age female cohort (ages 15-55) was increasing.  Participation rates
were in the range of 80-90%.  Between 1989 and 1992 these dropped, with the
exception of Romania where there was an increase in agricultural activity which
increased women&#146;s employment between 1989 and 1991, with a slight drop in
1992.  From 1989 to 1992 female participation in the workforce dropped from 93%
to 66% in Bulgaria; from 78% to 66% in Hungary; and from 70% to 60% in POLAND.
(ICDC, 1993, pg. 56) Thus many women are unemployed during a time when family
survival is dependent on two incomes.<p>
<p>
	There is no doubt that increasingly families are becoming poorer.  As can be
seen in Table 15, for all four countries from 1989 to 1992, there are some
rather depressing trends.  In Hungary and Romania there are data to
differentiate what is happening for children from what is happening for
families in general.  The data indicate that impact of the trends noted above
are all contributing to more and more children being born into poverty.<p>

	As can be seen in Table 16 creches/nurseries for the youngest children have
never served a larger percentage of the population.  The percentage has
increased in Bulgaria, remained more or less the same in Romania and decreased
somewhat in Hungary and Poland since 1989.  The low attendance rates had to do
with the fact that women could take leave from their jobs during the early
years of the child&#146;s life, thus there was little call on center-based
child care.<p>

  	The situation has been quite different when children reached age 3.  At that
point women had to return to work so there was a great need for the State to
provide care for children.  Further there was some understanding of the value
of the preschool/kindergarten experience to support the growth and development
of children within the 3-6 age group.  What is interesting is that the
importance of a preschool/kindergarten experience was recognised early-on in
these countries.  In fact, within Europe, they set a high standard and were
strong advocates for kindergartens.  Nonetheless, preschool and kindergarten
were never mandatory.  Table 17 presents data on the percentage of children who
attended preschool/kindergartens in the four countries.<p>

	What is interesting about Table 17 is that it indicates that regardless of
where the countries started in terms of the percentage of children being served
in preschools prior to reforms, since then there has been a decline in
children&#146;s participation in preschool/kindergarten.  This is most striking
is Bulgaria where there was a 42.5% decrease, followed by Romania with a 35.5%
decrease, Poland with a 22.4% decrease, with the least change being in Hungary
(9.8%). <p>
<p>
	As has been shown these declines are the result of a variety of factors.  The
next question is, what is the impact of declining enrolment on children&#146;s
growth and development.  In situations where quality care and education were
being provided, and this was the case in a significant number of settings,
children are being deprived of valuable experiences. <p>
<p>
	What has brought about the decline in enrolment?  The decrease can be
explained by supply, demand, supply and cultural factors.<p>
	One reason for the diminishing supply is the shift from centralized control of
and support for social services from central government to local authorities,
with an attendant reduction is financial resources available for these service.
For example, beginning with the enactment of the new Law on Education in 1991,
the State of Poland began handing over not only administrative tasks to
municipalities but also financing and maintenance of nurseries, kindergartens
and primary and secondary schools.  <p>
<p>
	Unfortunately local authorities are sometimes forced to close kindergartens
and preschools due to a lack of financial resources to maintain staff and
maintain facilities, and provide them with appropriate equipment and supplies.
As has been noted in the country studies, not only are financial resources
lacking, but local authorities frequently lack the administrative and
management skills that would allow them to use their resources efficiently and
effectively.<p>
<p>
	Demand has been affected by women&#146;s unemployment--if they are not working
in the formal sector they are available to take care of their children
themselves--and the introduction of fees. <p>
	<p>
	The introduction (increase in the case of Poland) of user fees designed to
help local authorities finance kindergartens has not been enough to make a real
different in the running of programs.   Where fees have made a difference is in
terms of the parents&#146; ability to send their children to kindergarten.  In
Bulgaria fees more than doubled in 1993 when universal fees amounting to 15% of
the average wage.  In Poland, fees have steadily risen to 1/3rd of the average
wage.  In Romania fee increases introduced in September 1993 are now close to
16% of the average wage. (ICDC, 1993, pg. 59) yet the fees are paying less and
less of the real costs of the care.  In Romania the share of the costs borne by
the users has been decreasing since 1989, at which point it was 69%; in 1990,
it was 82%; in 1991, 59%; and in 1992, 51% (ICDC, 1993, pg. 60).<p>
<p>
	Despite the heavy subsidization of childcare by the State in Romania, there
has been a continuous decline in occupancy rates. (See Table 19) In essence the
number of places has not changed significantly, while the number of children
has been decreasing.<p>

Children&#146;s Homes<p>
	When families are dysfunctional and/or living under conditions of poverty the
response under previous regimes was to help the family out by placing the child
in an institution.  There were no social services that provided support to the
family in an effort to strengthen the family as a social unit. The result of
policies before reforms were instituted meant that only a small percentage of
those children living in State-operated homes were actually orphans.  For
example, in Hungary in 1992, only 2% of the children in homes had lost both
parents and 12% were fatherless or motherless. (ICDC, 1993, pg. 31)  <p>
<p>
	With a renewed focus on the family and in attempts to decrease dependence on
the State, some of the countries are attempting to shift services to supporting
families rather than continuing to institutionalize children. But as noted
earlier, this shift in expectations and responsibility is not one easily made.
<p>
<p>
	Table 20 presents data on the absolute number of children who are in
children&#146;s homes.  The data indicate that the number of children in
institutional care has been decreasing in all instances, except in Bulgaria,
where there was a decrease initially after the reforms began, but the numbers
are now increasing.<p>

<p>
Look at percentages of children in homes compared with population of age
group.<p>
<p>
	There are several plausible reasons for the decreasing numbers.  One is that
where countries have adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child, poverty
can no longer be used as a criterion for placing children in homes.  Thus
children who would once have been placed in children&#146;s homes are now
remaining in their families.  This is true in Hungary, Poland.<p>
<p>
	Another hypothesis is that more and more children are being placed in foster
care rather than in homes.  But a look at the data would suggest that this is
not the case in the countries where there are data on foster care.  For
example, in Hungary there was a decrease in the number of children in foster
care between 1989 and 1992 --  8717 in 1989 and 8487 in 1992.  In Poland there
was only a 2.8% increase between 1989 and 1992 in the number of children in
foster care (32087 in 1989 and 32968 in 1992).<p>
	Another possibility is that the decrease in number of children in
children&#146;s homes is the results of an increase in the number of adoptions.
However, the data suggest that the number of adoptions are decreasing.  In
Bulgaria there were 1123 adoptions in 1989 and only 905 in 1992.  The
respective number for Hungary were 982 and 923; for Poland they were 4176 and
3550, with 2810 adoptions in 1993.  (Data on Romania were not available.)  One
reasons for the drop in adoption rates is that soon after the reforms people
from outside the countries could adopt children.  Thus there were high
adoptions rates in 1989 and 1990.  Since then countries have developed much
more restrictive adoption policies.  Bulgaria is an example:<p>
<p>
In general, the conditions for adoption by a foreigner are more stringent than
those for adoption by a national. There are a number of rules that serve as a
barrier to the "export" of children. One of them is that only children at least
one-
                                                                      
year
old can be adopted. Another condition is that Bulgarians should have refused
several times to adopt the child and only then can the child be offered to
foreign applicants for adoption. For example, in Bulgaria today a child has to
be rejected a number of times by Bulgarian families before they can be adopted
by foreigners.  (Kornazheva, 1995, pg. 24)<p>
<p>
	The most plausible reason for the decrease in numbers has to do with the whole
system surrounding children&#146;s homes.  The system is being affected by the
economic crisis.  There are fewer funds available to support staffing and
maintenance of the homes.  The report on Hungary describes the issues in some
detail.  In Hungary there are fewer professionals in position to make
referrals, and the administrative structure currently in place is being
overloaded.  Thus, previously there would be only a short time before referral
and placement, today that process can be delayed for months.  But reforms are
underway.  <p>
<p>
The Government is preparing a law on child welfare and child protection.
Within this system of social provision, with regard to the particular rights
and interests of children, the Law wishes to establish a system which
guarantees welfare provisions and protection for children, which, on the one
hand, assists families in the upbringing of children by offering various kinds
of support and services, and, on the other hand, ensures the appropriate
provisions for and protection of children removed from their families.
(Korintus, 1995, pg. 44)<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Changes in Benefits<p>
<p>
	In most countries eligibility remains restricted to employed parents, rather
than being universally available, with the exception of Hungary where
eligibility for family supports has become less restricted, In 1990, already
widely available allowances became universal, limitations for families with one
child were removed and although several proposals for &#145;better
targeting&#146; have been put forward, no criteria have yet been introduced.<p>
<p>
	In Poland the situation has become more restrictive, with benefits further
targeted toward the very poor.  In 1992 the income threshold was decreased from
25% to 18% of the average wage.  The value was reduced to a flat rate of 21% of
the average wage.  (Previously it was 25% of the person&#146;s previous wage.
Benefits for single mothers were set slightly higher.<p>
<p>
	In Romania where no paid leave had been provided before 1989, a leave with
cash benefits (65% of the last wage) was introduced for full-time employed
parents, available until the child &#145;s first birth (ICDC, 1993, pg. 59).
Children of the self-employed, of those working in private enterprises and of
non-working parents not registered at public Labour offices remain ineligible
for family allowance. (Pg. 62) However, the intent was to universalize
allowances in 1994.<p>

<sup>1</sup> At the time this report was written the full
final report had not been received from Romania, so only the preliminary data
from that country has been included in the analysis.<p>
<sup>2</sup> The International Child Development Centre in Florence Italy,
under UNICEF, was in the process of publishing <b>Public Policy and Social
Conditions: Central and Eastern Europe in Transition, 1993</b>.  This was not
available when this study was initiated, but as will be seen, has become a
source of some interesting comparative data.<p>
<sup>3</sup>  At the time, Bulgaria had not yet joined the study.  They entered
in September 1994.<p>
<sup>4</sup>To take a step in the creation of such a monitoring system, the<i>
Public Policies and Social Conditions: Monitoring the Transition to the Market
Economy in Central and Eastern Europe Project (MONEE)</i> was initiated by the
Florence-Based UNICEF International Child Development Center (ICDC) in late
1992.  Its principle aim is to monitor social conditions and social policy
during this time of transition. <p>
<sup>5</sup> Many of the tables in this section of the report were taken from
the 1993 and 1994 Reports <b>Public Policy and Social Conditions: Central and
Eastern Europe in Transition, </b>produced by the International Child
Development Centre in Florence, Italy.  In some instances these data were
different from what was given in the country reports.  When that has happened,
it has been noted.<br><p>

<b>Introduction to the country</b><p>
<b></b>	Hungary has got a population of about 10.5 million.  The population
density, 113.8 persons/square kilometer, is typical in Europe.  59% of the
people live in urban areas.  Hungarians account for about 96% of the
population, with the rest being of German, Slovak, Serbian, Croatian, Romanian,
etc. origin.  According to estimates, some 4-4.5 million Hungarians live in
other countries (Hungarian Chamber of Commerce, 1989).<p>
	The area of the country is about 93 000 square kilometers, two thirds of it is
flat land, lower than 200 meters above sea level.  The rest is rolling country
between 200 and 400 meters above sea level.  <p>
	Hungary is poor in natural resources.  The country's weight in the world
economy is small: its population accounts for about 0.25 %, the industrial
output amounts to 0.5-0.6 % of that of the world.<p>
	Hungary has been the member of the United Nations Organization since December,
1955 and joined the GATT in 1973.  Now, it hopes to become a member of the
European Union in the near future.<p>
	In 1990, a multi-party democracy emerged and a democratically elected
government took office.  The subsequent changes in policy and the economy have
affected the population, especially families with children.  Subsidies were
reduced enormously, and the majority of the people has been getting poorer.
The unemployment rate was 10.9% by the end of 1994, and the inflation rate 25%
in January, 1995. <p>
<p>
<b>Introduction to the study</b><p>
<b></b>	When thinking about child care, it is very important to look at the
provision as a function of the philosophy, policy and practice of the times and
see how the changes in the philosophy and the value system concerning children
and families are reflected in the forms and quality of the provision.
Although, there seems to be a general consensus that children's emotional and
physical well being have to be ensured, that they need to feel loved and
understood and that they have to have a stimulating environment for maturation
and learning (EC Childcare Network Discussion Paper),  there is a great deal of
variety in what people mean by these terms and how these are explained and
translated into practice.  Different cultures have different views about what
is best for children at certain ages.  The same ideas are sometimes claimed to
form the bases of totally different practices.  <p>
	To summarize the shift in perspective and the consequent modifications in the
practice of day care provision in Hungary since the second half of the last
century, it could be said that the change has been from just keeping an eye on
children to care and education and from a primarily health oriented philosophy
towards one which takes into consideration the individual needs of children and
the needs of families (BOMI Guidance, 1972-1991).  Besides ensuring physical
and emotional well being, questions of enhancing cognitive development and
creativity have become more and more the focus of attention.  A new need for
services, too, has emerged lately on the part of many families (BOMI, 1992).<p>
	Our present day care and kindergarten provision is of good quality and meets
the needs of children.  Nevertheless, we have to think about preserving our
existing centers and their quality, and about introducing a greater variety in
terms of  available services, financing and training.  The aim is to meet the
needs of families.  However, the diversification should be a well-regulated
process.<p>
<b>What we hope to achieve with this study is to be able to map all the
existing and the still-needed services in child care for children between 0-6
in Hungary.  We believe that a detailed description helps to identify the areas
which need further development or where new services should be introduced and
might help to find better ways of financing as well.  Specific projects could
grow out of the findings and the analysis.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>THE SITUATION FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND FAMILIES UNDER THE PREVIOUS
GOVERNMENT</b><p>
The state socialist political system of the past forty years was characterized
by the dominance of a "caring state". Families with children were given state
support at the expense of salaries, which did not correspond to the full value
of the workers' socially useful work, but only with a fraction of it. This was
justified by state financed health care, education, leisure time activities and
social services. However, the funds drawn away from the employees this way were
increasingly spent for financing an obsolete, deficit-making economy, with the
result that less and less money was spent on the "non-productive" sector: the
health services, education, culture and social services.  In spite of this
process however, by the end of the 1980s, a wide range of social benefits was
established.<p>

single parent families has grown.  The frequency of divorces has somewhat
diminished since 1980, but the number of children hit by divorces has
doubled.<p>
All the services (health, social, etc.) available for families were provided by
the state. This meant small variety, less flexibility and a fairly standard
level across the country.  Day care centers and kindergartens were providing
for those children whose parents were working.  Some form of child care leave
(see later) was available for the mothers if they stayed home with the child
until his third birthday.  However, if the mother decided to return to the
workforce, the family could apply for a day care place.  Kindergartens offered
care and education for children between 3 and 6.<p>
<p>
<b>Day care (for children under the age of three)</b><p>
	Before World War II., most of the day care facilities were established and run
by a charity organization, called "First Pest Day Care Society" (Pesti
Els&otilde; B&ouml;lcs&otilde;dei Egylet), and a few by factories.  There were
about 1000 day care places in the country by 1945 (Ak&oacute;csi, 1968).  After
the war, women were needed in the workforce, the value of their contribution
was emphasized and as a result, the provision of <u>day care for young children
whose mothers were employed</u> was declared to be the responsibility of the
state.  A Decree by the Council of Ministers in 1953 ordered the extensive
building of new day care centers and stated that centers should be built at new
housing developments.  Day care was available for those families where the
mother decided to take up employment.  <p>

Documents signed by the employer had to be presented at registration to show
the family's income.  Admission was decided by the so called "social committee"
in the area whose members were people from the local council and the day care
centers.  Those children had priority who came from low income or one-parent
families or who lived under poor/bad conditions.   There was a steady increase
in the demand for day care and consequently, in  the number of day care places
until 1986.<p>

Daycare facilities were crowded because almost all women had full time jobs.
and the pace of opening new centers could not keep up with the increase in the
number of births.  The introduction of the first maternal leave i.e. GYES
(Child Care Assistance) in 1967 only lessened but not solved the problem of
shortage in available places.  The trend slowly changed only in the second half
of the 1980's, partly because the number of births was declining and partly
because of a new trend in policy stressing the importance of families.  As a
result of this emerging philosophy which declared that the family is the
smallest unit of society, a relatively generous family benefit system was
developed during the 1970's and 1980's.  The benefit made it possible for
mothers to stay home and receive some kind of support until the child reached
the age of three (see later the description of the different types of family
assistance available).  <p>
	The provision for under-threes belonged to the health provision under the
responsibility of the Ministry of Health.  The primarily health oriented
philosophy determined the major concern of providers: children's health and the
prevention of diseases.  However, the changes effectuated in the norms and
regulations for the architectural design of day care centers after 1954 imply a
step forward in taking into consideration other aspects of children's needs,
too, in the quality of care provided:  The buildings were designed not only to
ensure the safety of children but also to ensure that caregivers could spend
the maximum time with them.  Bathrooms had direct connections with children's
rooms and meals could be trollied up to the door of the rooms from the kitchen.
The connections between the rooms and the bathrooms were planned to make it
easier for the caregivers to keep an eye on the children all the time, terraces
were built to enable children to sleep outside all year around, etc.
(Ak&oacute;csi,&Aacute;.; Galamb,E., 1973).  The number of children in a group
was limited at 12 and two adults were required per group.  The area for
children's rooms was settled at a minimum of 4 square meters per child.<p>
	Training for caregivers providing care for under threes began during the
1950's.  At the time, hospital nursing was the accepted model so, the
certificate issued stated that the students who finished the training were
qualified as caregivers and as nurses for sick children.  There was a
standardized curriculum from 1960 on.<p>
The routes for obtaining qualification as a caregiver were the following:<p>
<u>before 1965:</u><p>
<pre>
before 1965:

elementary school		+		1 year regular training
     (8 years)						    or			
						1 1/2 years on the job training

after 1965:

elementary school	+	secondary school	+	2 years regular training

after 1975:

     (8 years)		+	     secondary school		+		training
				          (4 years)
</pre>
<p>
The content of the curriculum was improved by adding literature, music, and
more in depth instruction of pedagogy and child development to the health
related subjects.<u></u><p>
<u></u>	During the late 1960's, so called "methodological centers" were
appointed in the districts of Budapest and in the counties.  Their task was to
monitor and to supervise other centers under their authority and to organize
further training courses for the caregivers.  In 1970, the National Institute
of Day Care Centers was founded under the auspices of the Ministry of Health to
ensure a fairly standard provision all over the country.  Ever since, its
responsibilities have been to conduct research, to develop methods and
guidelines, to monitor day care centers, to participate in the further training
of caregivers and to provide consultancy (Ak&oacute;csi, 1970).  Its tasks and
duties have been fulfilled through and with the assistance of the
methodological centers.<p>

The team of professionals working for the Institute (including pediatricians,
psychologists, pedagogues and caregivers) soon developed a set of guidelines
concerning several areas of the provision which all reflect the appreciation of
the child as an individual.<p>
	All day care arrangements were full-time and center-based.  The regulations
were the same for all, regardless of who maintained them (councils or
factories/companies).  The day care law of 1978 and the adjoining regulations
set the legal frame and the guidance issued by the National Institute of Day
Care Centers regulated the practice.<p>

<b>Kindergarten (for children between 3 to 6)</b><p>
<b></b>Kindergarten education in Hungary goes back to as early as the beginning
of the last century. The first kindergarten was set up by Ter&eacute;z
Brunszwik in 1828 and ever since these institutes provide child care for
children between the ages of 3 and 6. Since this beginning, kindergarten
education has seen a series of significant improvements.  There was a steady
extension of kindergarten services until 1990.  The network of kindergartens
has doubled in size.<p>

The widespread need for kindergartens was obviously related to the fact that a
great proportion of women participated in the workforce but it was also the
expression of the recognition of the significance of kindergarten education.
Kindergarten attendance <u>was not compulsory</u>.<p>
	The Law No 1. of 1985 on Education, in line with previous legislation
allocated the right for operating kindergartens to councils. However,
for-profit organizations, organizations funded from the central budget, as well
as nonprofit organizations could also establish and operate kindergartens.<p>
	Hungary was among the first countries in Europe to launch training for
kindergarten teachers. The first college for kindergarten teachers opened in
Tolna in 1837. At this time a total of fourteen kindergartens operated in the
country.  From 1959 onwards kindergarten teachers have acquired their training
in higher education. At the beginning, training was based on the matriculation
gained at the secondary school, and lasted for two years. Prior to this,
training took three years following the accomplishment of the eight classes of
elementary school.  From the academic year 1972/73, due to the dynamic
development of the kindergarten network, training courses at the secondary
level were also organized to tackle the labour shortage in kindergarten
teachers. Untrained staff was also employed at a very high percentage since
filling the posts of kindergarten teachers who were on child care leave was
often possible only by employing untrained staff.<p>

The
manual published in 1956 for the kindergarten teachers in the country was
replaced by the "Program for Kindergarten Education" in 1971. The elaboration
of this document was based on 20 years of research and due to its then modern
ideas, was followed by great interest in several countries. Among others it was
translated into Japanese. Under the direction of the National Institute of
Education  an efficiency study of the program was carried out with the
participation of 3000 children attending the year prior to starting school in
1976. <p>

<b>Children under age in state care</b><p>
<b></b>The  number of children under age placed in state care gradually
decreased in  numbers, and so did their proportion within the population of
children under age, between 1975 and 1988. One reason behind this process was
the shift in policy: assistance given to families with at risk children had
become the preferred form of intervention.  Placements were only decided on,
when assistance to the family did not lead to beneficial  changes for the
child.<p>

<b></b>A very disadvantageous arrangement typical of this period was the lack
of children's homes which fostered children of a wide age-range. Consequently,
children under age were faced with repeated moves from homes: at the age of
three from nursery homes to residential homes accommodating three to six year
olds, from then, between the ages of six and seven, to children's homes, and
from the ages of 14 and 15 to "youth homes".  "Children's towns" were the only
exceptions, yet these, with their big sizes, accommodating several hundred
children, and closeness were unsuitable for providing individual care, and for
preparing the children for life after care.<p>
<p>
<b>Family Day Care </b>as an accepted form of child care did not exist
officially.  Only some "illegal" arrangements could be found, mainly neighbours
or friends looking after the children.  There were no regulations for this kind
of provision<p>
<p>
<b>Costs and Financing.</b><p>
<b></b>All services were financed by the state from the central budget and
there were different types of benefits families could receive.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Types of family assistance available</b><p>
1.  Family Allowance<p>
It was covered by national insurance so, it was available only for those who
were employed.  Mainly families with two or more children were eligible but one
parent families and families with chronically ill or disabled children could
receive it, too.  It was paid until the child became 16 years old.  The amount
was between 920 - 2700 Forints/child/month depending on the number of
children.<p>
2.  Maternity Allowance<p>
This was also covered by national insurance.  Those mothers were eligible who
had been employed (insured) for at least 180 days during the two years before
the child's birth.  Its sum was either the full amount or the 65% of the
mother's average previous salary.<p>
3.  Maternity Aid<p>
It was a fixed sum, 6 000 Forints, paid to the mother when the baby was born.
those women were eligible who were covered by national insurance.<p>
4.  Child Sickness Benefit<p>
Those mothers were eligible for this benefit who were covered by national
insurance and had a child under 10.  Depending on the age of the child, they
could receive child sickness benefit for a period of 14-84 days a year.<p>
5.  Childcare Allowance (GYED)<p>
Those could receive it who were covered by national insurance, who had received
maternity allowance and took unpaid leave from work in order to receive this
benefit.  It could be paid until the child was 2 years old.  Its sum was the
65-75% of the mother's average previous income.<p>
6.  Childcare Assistance (GYES)<p>
Mothers, and those fathers who brought up their children alone were eligible
until the child reached age 3 (or until age 10 if the child was chronically ill
or disabled) if they had received Childcare Allowance and claimed Childcare
Assistance right after that (continuously).  Its sum was 800 Forints on the
right of the first child, 900 Ft on the right of the second child and 1000 Ft
on the right of the third and any further number of children.<p>
7.  Housing Benefit<p>
Support was available for building or buying homes.  So called
"social-political" benefit could be claimed if there were children in the
family.  This meant that a certain amount could be deducted from the price of
the apartment.  The sum of the support was 50 000 Forints on the right of the
first child, 150 000 Ft on the right of the second child, 400 000 Ft on the
right of the third child and 200 000 Ft on the right of any further number of
children.<p>
Another 1 500 000 Ft. state support could be claimed by families with young
children or by young couples planning to have children for paying back the
interest on loans taken up for building or buying homes.<p>

<p>
8.  Educational Allowance<p>
Councils could give a single grant to those families whose children were at
risk.  Its sum was three times the amount of the Family Allowance that one
parent families with two children could receive.  This grant could be used for
paying the price of meals in day care centers, kindergartens and schools.<p>
9.  Educational Assistance<p>
Councils could allocate Educational Assistance to those families where
children's development was at risk because the joint income of the parents was
less than the minimum pension at any given time.<p>
	However, all forms of financial support were gradually loosing their real
values over the years and there was less and less money for financing the
otherwise free (for the citizens) health services, education, and the cultural
and social institutions.  More and more parents bringing up children were
forced to seek additional jobs in the so called "second economy", to be able to
provide an acceptable standard of living for their families.  As a consequence,
the time spent with children decreased which in turn, resulted in serious
problems in the functioning of families.  This was considered to be one of the
major causes of the increase in deviant behaviors of children.<p>
<p>
<b>Costs of day care and kindergarten</b><p>
<b></b>Free access to day care and kindergarten services operated by the
councils or state institutions was always guaranteed by law in Hungary.  State
support was provided for all day care centers and kindergartens covering the
total cost of care of children from the state's budget.  The money was
allocated to the councils which maintained the facilities.  Parents had to pay
only a small fee for the meals children received which was calculated on the
basis of their income and the number of children in the family.  For example,
it was somewhere between 5 - 24 Forints per day in the day care centers until
the mid 1970's.  Nonetheless, even this contribution could be decreased or
waived for those children who came from socially or financially deprived
families.  <p>
All children in day care centers and about 95% of children in kindergartens had
meals there.  <p>

<b>THE SITUATION AS THE COUNTRY IS IN TRANSITION TO A MARKET ECONOMY</b><p>
<b>A description of the situation today - the context</b><p>
According to the reports of the latest census (1990), 3.1% less people lived in
Hungary in 1990 than ten years earlier.  The number of births decreased and the
number of early deaths increased.  The mortality rate of today's male
population has become almost the same as it was in the 1920's and 1930's.<p>
	1989 and 1990 saw the beginning of the transition from planned economy to
market economy. This means the dismantling of state property, the modernization
of the structure of economy, accompanying a great upsurge of private
enterprise.  The changes in ownership have brought about changes in the
structure of employment, too: more people work now in the private sector, in
retail, in the small scale industry and in farming then before.  At the same
time, the diminishing active population (40%) carries the burden of providing
for an increasing inactive population while the health status of everyone
deteriorates.  Many of the earners have retired or have become dependent (e.g.
very often women become housewives).<p>
	There was a 20 percent decline in the gross domestic product.  Consumer's
prices more than doubled between 1990 and 1994, mainly because of the
considerable rise in energy prices and in the cost of public transportation and
because of the cuts in government subsidies (e.g. for food products).  In
January, 1995, the inflation rate was 25% which has had an adverse effect,
first of all in small-income families and pensioners.  The real income per
capita of the population has also decreased.  In 1993, the per capita real
income was 8-10% less than in 1989.  This can be accounted for by the dropping
numbers of people employed and the diminishing value of both the real wages and
the different forms of social benefit.  There was a 25% drop in the number of
people in the workforce which resulted a 10% unemployment rate.  At the end of
1993, 28% of the population received pensions.<p>

In Hungary, the prevailing form of living is living in families.  Even though
there have been changes in the number, size and composition of families over
the years, no major changes are expected.  The ratio of people living in
families was:<p>
	84.2% 		in 1970<p>
	83.1%		in 1980<p>
	81.3%		in 1990.<p>
The number of marriages have also declined since 1990, and if this tendency
continues or becomes stronger, according to estimates, the ration of people
living in cohabitation only will almost equal the ratio of people living in
marriages (Hablicsek, 1994.).  Since the majority of children are born into
marriages, the above mentioned tendency might result in a further drop in the
already declining number of births.  Presently, 15% of all births occur out of
wedlock.  <p>
Forming partnerships without getting married seems to become widespread among
those who have already divorced once.  So, the number of one-parent families is
also rising (Csern&aacute;k, 1994.).  The number of divorces has been growing:
it was 16 590 in 1960 and 22 350 in 1993.    In 50% of the families two parents
live with their children while 15.4% are single parent families.  According to
the 1990 census:<p>
	34.2% of the families have got no children<p>
	32.9% of the families have got 1 child<p>
	26.3% of the families have got 2 children<p>
	 5.1% of the families have got 3 children<p>
	 1.4% of the families have got 4 or more children.<p>
Compared to 1970 statistics, the ratio of one-parent families and childless
marriages have increased and the number of large families (with 3-4-5 children)
has dramatically dropped by 1994 (Klinger, 1994).<p>
	A rising number of families, primarily families with several children have
been forced below subsistence level. In 1993, more than one third of children
under the age of 14 and more than 50 percent of families with three or more
children lived in poverty.<p>
	For young couples who have decided to have children, housing has posed the
greatest problem. Poor chances for acquiring a flat, which have been
characteristic for decades, have now reached catastrophic measures. The
construction of homes by the state, or by the local authorities have
practically ceased, while families living on steadily shrinking incomes have
become incapable of solving their housing problems either from their own
resources, or by making use of housing assistance policies as they are in force
today.<p>

One fifth of all families live in comfortless or in low-comfort homes (that is,
in homes without hot water, bathrooms or toilets).  Many of the buildings need
repair and at many places the infrastructure requires improvement.  However,
the increasing maintenance costs are the greatest problem.<p>
<p>
<b>Types of family assistance provided</b><p>
Following the political changes, national insurance has been streamlined and
several provisions have been removed from its scope.  Today, the different
forms of support covered by national insurance or paid from the state's or the
local authorities' budgets, are clearly separated.<p>
I. Benefits paid from the state's (central) budget<p>
1.  Family Allowance<p>
There was an essential change in the financing of this benefit in 1990.
Earlier, it was covered by national insurance so, it was available only for
working parents.  Since 1990, it is paid from the state's budget and all
Hungarian citizens rearing children under 18 in their homes are eligible.
Furthermore, children in state care under 18 also receive it.  The money is
deposited in a separate savings account for each child and they receive it when
they reach the age of 18.  In 1993, its amount was 2 750 - 3 950 Forints/month,
depending on the number of children in the family.  Families with chronically
ill or disabled children receive 5100 Ft/child/month.  The sum of the family
allowance is about 35% of an average salary after taxes or about 20% of a
family's income in the lower income level category.<p>
2.  Pregnancy Allowance<p>
This benefit replaced the earlier Maternity Aid.  All Hungarian citizens and
non-citizens with a permit for residence living in Hungary are eligible from
the fourth month of the pregnancy until the birth of the child.  Its sum is 9
000 Forints.<p>
3.  Childcare Allowance (GYED)<p>
The conditions for eligibility have not been changed.  Those can receive it who
received Maternity Allowance and took unpaid leave from work in order to get
this benefit.  It is paid from the state's budget (and is not covered by
national insurance) when the child is between 24 weeks and 24 months of age.
Its amount has not been changed, it is either 65 or 75% of the mother's average
previous salary, depending on the number of insured days before the child's
birth.  In 1993, its amount was about the 55% of an average salary.<p>
4.  Childcare Assistance (GYES)<p>
Mothers, - and those fathers who bring up their children alone - are eligible
until the child reaches age 3 (or until age 10 if the child is chronically ill
or disabled) if they received Childcare Allowance (GYED) and have claimed
Childcare Assistance right after that (continuously).   The conditions for
eligibility have not changed but now the benefit is paid from the state's
budget when the child is between 24 and 36 months of age.  Its sum is 800 Ft on
the right of the first child, 900 Ft on the right of the second child and 1 000
Ft on the right of the third and any further number of children.  Since
September 1993, an extra amount is added to the sum regardless of the number of
children, which is 6700 Ft at the present.  In 1993, the amount of GYES was
about the 32% of an average salary.<p>
5.  Housing Benefits<p>
Support is available for building or buying homes.  So called
"social-political" benefit can be claimed if there are children in the family.
This means that a certain amount could be deducted from the price of an
apartment (that is, the state pays that sum).<p>
Eligibility and the conditions have not been changed, only the amount of the
support has been increased.  The sum which can be claimed is 200 000 Ft on the
right of the first child, and 1 000 000 Ft/child on the rights of the second
and the third child.  <p>
6.  Child Upbringing Allowance (GYET)<p>
The Social Act (1993) introduced and made available this form of support.  It
can be paid to families with 3 or more children where the youngest child is
between 3 and 8 years of age.  That mother -or father in exceptional cases - is
eligible who was employed (insured) for at least 180 days before the child's
birth.  Its sum equals the sum of the minimum pension at any given time; now it
is 7480 Ft.  An important feature of this support is that the number of years
the mother receives it can be taken into account as years spent in
employment.<p>
II. Benefits covered by national insurance<p>
1.  Maternity Allowance<p>
Those mothers are eligible who were employed (insured) for at least 180 days
during the two years before the child's birth.  It is paid during the first 24
weeks of the child's life.  Its sum is either the full amount or the 65% of
their average previous salary.  It is the full amount if the mother was insured
at least for 270 days during the two years before giving birth.<p>
2.  Child Sickness Benefit<p>
Those mothers are eligible for this who are covered by national insurance and
have a child under 10.  Depending on the age of the child, they can receive
paid child sickness leave for a period of 14-84 days a year.<p>
III. Benefits paid from the local governments' budget<p>
1.  Educational Allowance<p>
Local governments can give this support to those persons who are at risk, and
to those who are struggling to meet the costs of living.  First of all, those
people are eligible who are unable to provide for themselves or for their
families.  The help can also be in the form of school books for children or in
the form of fees paid in day care centers, kindergartens, schools.  Its sum is
determined by the elected board of the local government.<p>
2.  Educational Assistance<p>
Local governments can allocate Educational Assistance to those families where
children's development is at risk because the joint income of the parents is
less than the minimum pension at any given time.  Local authorities regulate
eligibility and the sum of the support themselves.<p>
3.  Nursing Allowance<p>
That member of a family is eligible who is nursing at home a seriously disabled
or chronically ill child between the ages of 2 and 18.  Its sum equals to the
sum of the minimum pension at any given time.  Presently, it is 7480 Ft.<p>

One of the greatest shocks of the transition to market economy is the emergence
of unemployment.  With the structural changes in the economy a great number of
unprofitable factories and companies have been closed down both in the
industrial and in the agricultural sector.  The newly formed and developing
private sector could take up only a fraction of those who lost their jobs
because of the closures in the state sector.  The rate of unemployment was
10.9% at the end of 1994.  It was the lowest in Budapest, 5.8%, while it ranged
from 7.5% to 19% in other parts of the country.  In September 1994, there were
545 868 registered unemployed 56.9% of these were men and 43.1% were women.
The total number included 75 177 young people who had just finished school and
could not find a job. <p>

problems the number of children at risk has increased enormously.  Their number
doubled between 1989 and 1993.  While the number of children at risk because of

<b></b>Day care for children in Hungary is guaranteed by law in Hungary.  The
Social Act (1993) regulates its institutions, namely day care centers for under
threes, kindergartens and school-based day care.<b></b><p>
<b>Day care (for children under three)</b><p>
<b></b>Day care for under threes is almost entirely provided in center-based
institutions.  Quite recently, two of these were privatized and a few are
maintained by the church or foundations.  The regulation for all are the same.
The Social Act (1993) made it possible for local governments to contract
private or non-profit organizations to provide services.<p>
	Day care provision is regarded as a substantial complementary element to the
family benefit system.  Centers provide a choice for families, parents can
decide whether they want to use day care or take advantage of the financial
support available for those families who decide to bring up their young
children at home.<p>
	The preventive child protection role of day care centers is significant.  The
number of children served by the provision who are at risk and/or from socially
or financially deprived families has been growing steadily over the years.
Family support centers, health visitors and the public guardianship authority
refer more and more children to day care centers which at times seem to provide
an alternative to state care for some of these children.  In 1993, about 17% of
the families using day care applied for and paid either only a reduced fee or
no fee at all.<p>
	Children between the ages of 20 weeks to 3 years of age can be admitted to day
care centers.  Those whose development is judged to be lagging behind can stay
until they are four years old.  The others go to kindergarten at the age of
three.  During the past few years, day care centers have begun to admit special
needs children up to the age of six, too.  Relevant legislation was passed in
1994.<p>
	The Social Act (1993) defines the range of eligibility for day care for
children under the age of three.  It states that local governments have to
provide day care in their area for children:  <p>
-  whose parents work or are ill, and thus cannot take care of them during the
day<p>
-  whose physical and mental development requires day care<p>
-  brought up by lone parents <p>
-  who have got two or more sisters or brothers<p>
-  whose family is not able to care for them during the day because of their
difficult    <p>
   social/financial situation.<p>
Most of the times it is the day care center (i.e. the director of the center of
the day care adviser of the district or town) who decide about admission.  At
some places it is the elected body of the local authority who makes the final
decision.  Usually, if they have to set up priorities, it is the living
condition of the family and the status of the child which are taken into
account.<p>
	Considering the childcare leave available until 1 July, 1995, almost all
families who needed day care and were eligible, could find a place for their
children.  However, it is true only  on a national level since many of the
small towns and practically none of the villages have got day care centers.<p>

<b></b>	Geographically, the day care centers in small towns and villages were
hit the hardest.  Between January, 1990 and December, 1992 the day care
facilities in 121 villages were closed (2 947 places) so, there are counties in
Hungary where there are not day care centers at all, or where they can be found
only in very small numbers (BOMI, 1992).  In these small settlements the only
way of providing day care for children under three is to admit them to
kindergartens into so called "mini groups".  In these groups the number of
children is less (15-20) than in a regular kindergarten group (25-30) but the
care provided for them is not suitable.  Not suitable because the educationally
oriented program of kindergartens was developed for older children,
kindergarten teachers are trained to work with older children and kindergartens
do not have the kind of facilities needed for diapering and caring for younger
children.<p>
	Parallel with the slow down of closing day care centers, their utilization has
been growing.  Utilization is calculated based on the number of days children
actually spent at the center.<p>

<b></b>The 99.9% utilization in 1993 meant that the centers were crowded.  They
were filled 20% above capacity (e.g. meaning that 120 children were admitted to
100 places).  Most of the children are between 2 and 3 years of age, but the
number of infants and children between 1 and 2 years of age has been
increasing.  The number of children above 3 is relatively high. They are in the
centers because they reach their third birthday sometimes during the academic
year and kindergartens usually admit new children at the beginning of September
each year only.<p>

	Day care centers usually offer full time care, three meals a day, as well as
clothes and diapers for the children.  There are a few that provide weekly
care, mainly for those families whose social and economical status justify it
and/or for those children whose health and development is endangered at home
for some reason.  Besides full day care, centers have already started to offer
part-time care, overnight care, and organize playgroups, mother-toddler groups
and discussion groups for parents.<p>
<p>
<b>Kindergarten education</b><u></u><p>
<u></u>	In Hungary kindergartens operate as educational institutions under the
administration of the Ministry of Public Education and Culture. Kindergartens
are regarded as institutions which promote the childs personality and abilities
together with the families, and thereby lay the foundation of school education.
Kindergartens are also viewed as institutions which can successfully make up
for educational disadvantages.<p>
Kindergartens take children from the age of three to the age of seven, at the
oldest. Participation in kindergarten education is a right of every child, and
parents have the right to select the kindergarten they find most appropriate
for their children. Admission to kindergartens takes place on the basis of the
parents  request, by means of application, and through the decision of the head
of the kindergarten after considering local kindergarten opportunities.
However, attendance to kindergartens has never been compulsory for the whole
age group of children between the ages of three and seven. Attending
kindergartens has been made compulsory by the Public Education Law No I of
1995. for those children whose education provided by the family is seen as not
sufficient in promoting the child s development. The Public Education Law of
1993. ordered compulsory attendance of kindergartens for children who passed
the age of five. This obligation can be met by the parents taking the child to
the local kindergarten or to a kindergarten somewhere else. If the parents fail
to meet their obligation the notary of the local government authority is
duty-bound to proceed along appropriate lines.<p>
<u>The maintenance of kindergartens</u><p>
<u></u>	The Law No 1. of 1985 on Education, in line with previous legislation
allocated the right for operating kindergartens to local government
authorities. However, for-profit organizations, organizations funded from the
central budget, as well as nonprofit organizations can also establish and
operate kindergartens.<p>
	The Law No. XXIII of 1993-. which modified the Law No. 1. of 1985 passed at
the time of the political-economical transformation,- in conjunction with the
Law IV. of 199 on Freedom of Conscience and Religion created the opportunities
for organizations outside the public sector, to provide services to do with the
education of children. By now kindergartens can be established and operated by
not only the local government authorities, but other legal entities, as well as
individuals, provided their services meet specific requirements. Licenses are
required for every kindergarten with the exception of kindergartens run by the
local authorities.<p>
	The duties of the local government authorities concerning kindergartens are
stated in the law defining the duties of local authorities in relation to
educational institutions:<p>
Local government authorities of villages, towns, municipal towns and the
districts of the capital are obliged to make provisions for kindergarten
education. Local authorities can meet this duty by setting up and operating
kindergartens themselves, or in partnership, as well as by means of contracting
out these services .<p>
	The majority of kindergartens are operated by the local authorities
themselves, and their share in providing services, has remained unchanged in
the last four years.<p>

thousand -from 391,129 to 397,153-since the academic year 199/1991. According
to the forecasting of the Central Statistical Office the increased birthrate
witnessed from the 9s, which has been due to the larger cohorts of the 197s, is
to peak in 1999. However, while the number of children attending the
kindergarten has increased, the total capacity of kindergartens have diminished
by nine thousand -from 385,2 to 376,57, and the number of groups in the
kindergartens has shrunk by more than a hundred -from 16,55 to 15,952, and that
of kindergarten teachers by more than six hundred -from 33,635 to 32,957-, in
the same period.<p>
The services therefore cannot meet the full demand, and the number of children
whose application has been turned down due to shortage of places has increased
every year. In 1993/94 5,289 children were turned down, 912 more than in the
previous year, and 2,517 more than in 199/91.<u></u><p>
<u>The types of kindergartens and their organizations</u><p>
<u></u>Kindergartens operate from Monday to Friday, most of them 12 hours a
day. From the total of 4712 kindergartens as few as 355 keep open for eight
hours only. The opening hours of the kindergartens are set by the operating
authorities, on the basis of the parents working hours. Parents are free to
decide how many hours their children spend in the kindergartens per day, within
the kindergartens opening hours. <p>
	The size and organizational structure of kindergartens vary by centres. Some
of them work in one building, with one or more groups, while others operate in
different precincts but under the same administration. Whether  a kindergarten
is separate, or is a member of a bigger organization is dependent on how many
groups the kindergarten runs, on its geographic location, and on its loading.<p>
<p>
<b>Current system of child- and youth protection and its operation</b><p>
<b></b>Similarly to other branches of social services, child and youth
protection is divided into basic and special services.  Basic services aim at
prevention, that is at either preventing the establishment of the condition of
risk, or overcoming the state of being at risk. For this purpose a signalling
system is necessary, which can signal risks towards organizations able to give
support and authorized to take measures. Today this preventive system consists
of general practitioners, health visitors, the caregivers and teachers at day
care centres, teachers at school with duties of child care, and those police
staff which are commissioned with youth care, as well as the professionals and
family support centres. This system however is suffering from a lack of
communication among these agents, with the result that their work is not
coordinated, often overlap, and there are also cases which are not signalled by
any of the parties involved. The efficiency of the system would greatly benefit
from  basic and  further training courses given to these people, the curricula
of which would involve the detection and handling of risk situations for
children, and also from in this field.<p>
	The key institution in the present child care system is the Social Services
Department for Children Under Age, at the local authorities. The Family Law and
the adjoined legislation define the measures Social Services Departments for
Children Under Age can take, in case ,- for any reasons- the physical, mental
or moral development of the child is not secured. These measures are the
following depending on the degree of risk the child is exposed to:<p>
a/ protective-caring measures, which include reprimanding the child under age
for his or her behaviour  admonition of the parent  obliging the parent to
ensure that his or her child attend the educational institution etc.<p>
b/ provision of educational allowance<p>
c/ appointing a children's officer for the child at risk<p>
d/ placing the child in residential care on the request, or with the agreement
of the parent ("placed in residential care")<p>
e/ the temporary placement of the child under age in case of emergencies<p>
f/ taking the child into residential care in case of severe risk ("brought up
in residential care")<p>
g/ taking the child under age without a parent practicing parental supervision,
in state care ("brought up by the state")<p>

The drastic increase in the number of children at risk, with a simultaneous
decrease in the number of protective-caring measures indicate that Social
Services Departments for Children Under Age are less and less able to exercise
control over the problems involved, that is, they do not possess an adequate
set of means for overcoming conditions of risk.<p>

The drastic increase of state help both in terms of the number of cases and the
sums paid has been warranted by the soaring number of those at risk, due to
financial reasons, in recent years. More than four times as many families, and
children under age were given educational allowance in 1992 than in  1989. The
number of families and children under age entitled for educational allowance or
educational support grew threefold in three years. The increased funds for
support (approx. 630 million HF-s in 1989, and 3.3 billion HF-s in 1992)  were
provided from the central budget through increasing the support bracket of
local authorities on the basis of competition, where applicants had to indicate
the figures of the expenses planned originally for support of the local
authorities, and also the main social indices of their settlements.<p>
<u>Special services in child and youth protection</u><p>
<u></u>When the means of protective child care do not prove to be sufficient in
eliminating  the risk condition of the child under age, the child is removed
from his or her family. The number and relative proportion of children under
age placed into state care has steadily decreased within the population of
children under age.<p>

<b>Family day care</b><p>
<b></b>	Family day care is still practically non-existent in Hungary.  Probably
there are some (illegal) arrangements where a friend or a neighbour takes care
of children but the number of these is almost negligible.  According to surveys
of the National Institute of Day Care Centers (BOMI, 1992, 1995) there is a
need on the part of families for a new form of child care which is more
flexible than the existing day care arrangements.  However, many of the
families would like to use it irregularly and for a limited number of hours at
a time.  Some would use family day care beside center-based day care.  <p>
	Relevant regulation has been passed by the Ministry of Welfare in 1994 (see
Legislation) which makes it possible for people to provide family day care and
for local governments to support them.  However, till this moment no one has
really tried how such a provision could be organized, supported and supervised
properly so that both providers and families could feel confident about it.  A
research team, coordinated by he National Institute of Day Care Centers, have
developed the criteria for family day care and is conducting a pilot
(modelling) experiment in Kiskunhalas, a medium sized town in Hungary, to see
how such a provision can be introduced, can function and can be supervised
properly by the local authority.<p>
(see Special Studies)<b></b><p>
<b>Costs and Financing</b><p>
<b></b><u>Day care centers</u><p>
The Social Act (1993) has given many of the states previous responsibilities,
among them the provision of day care, to local authorities.  Local governments
have a budget for social welfare provision, part of which is used to cover the
costs of day care centers (which are almost exclusively the only form of day
care in Hungary at the present).  Day care centers are the only childrens
institutions which receive no per capita support from the states (central)
budget.  As a result, the financing of day care places varies from one place to
the other, depending on the size of the local governments budgets and their
other duties.  In many places, especially in small settlements, they are unable
to maintain day care centers.<p>
	The maintenance cost of a day care place is higher than in kindergartens or
schools because of the smaller group sizes, higher adult:child ratios and the
requirements concerning the environment, such as place and equipment for
diapering, bigger room space, etc..  The average cost of day care is between
180-200 000 forints per year per place.<p>
Parents make only a small contribution.  They pay the cost of meals children
receive.  Beside this, at some places, centers charge an additional fee (for
the care they provide).  This latter one is quite an new development,
evidently, it is the result of very limited budgets.  In such cases, the local
authority and the center together specify the sum to be paid, based on the
familys income.  Parental fees can be reduced of waived entirely, depending on
the social and financial status of the family.  In 1993, about 17% of the
families of children in day care were included in this form of support (BOMI,
1994).<b></b><p>
<b></b>	The operation of not-for-profit institutions in the social sector has
been made possible by legislation since 1989. Institutions operated by
organizations other than central and local authorities, and providing social
services are entitled for the same state per capita subsidy as local
authorities.  Unfortunately, day care children are not eligible for per capita
subsidy, so day care places operated by foundations or by the private sector do
not receive any from the state.<p>
<u>Kindergartens</u><p>
The central government secures state support for the provision of kindergarten
services, by means of a per capita support, the sum of which is decided upon in
the annual budget. This is supplemented by the local authorities and other
operators, from their own income to cover the full expense of the provision.
The per capita central government support for the operators of kindergartens
was the following in the last four years: 1991: 15, Ft; 1992: 19, Ft; 1993:
27,5 per capita, 1994: 27,5,-Ft.<p>
<u>Childrens homes</u><p>
The costs of these institutions are high, as only 14 % of the costs of care is
actually spent on the children directly, the rest of the expenses cover wages
and maintenance costs.  With a few exceptions residential institutions are
operated by county authorities. Their financing is covered from a normative per
capita subsidy from the central budget, which is currently 245,000 HF per
fulfilled year. According to the findings of a recent survey, the average
yearly cost of residential care per child is 465,000HF, while this cost in
nursery homes comes up to 571,000 HF.. The costs above the per capita normative
subsidy are paid by the county authorities.<p>
	This form of financing however, does not encourage local authorities to give
support to the families of children at risk, and thereby to promote their stay
in their families. The decision of local authorities as to placing a child in a
residential institution, operated by the county, does not bear any financial
consequences for local authorities.<p>
<p>
<b>THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR CHILDREN IN THE VARIOUS SETTINGS</b><p>
<b>The curriculum</b><p>
<b></b><u>Day care</u><p>
	There is no written educational program for day care centers but there are
several guidance issued by the National Institute of Day Care Centers (BOMI)
concerning the lives of children and the role and work of caregivers in the
centers.  The main principles of the provision can be summarized as the
following:<p>
1.  Care and education through experience are at times part of the same
process.  <p>
2.  Progressivity is important in introducing (settling in) children to day
care and its environment to reduce the stress of separation from the family.<p>
3.  Stability and continuity are the main organizing principles for forming
children's groups.  The key-worker system (where one caregiver is assigned five
or six children) and the same peer group and classroom for the duration of the
day care years for each child are important factors in providing an environment
which promotes feelings of security and well-being.<p>
4.  Individual needs and the developmental level of each child determine the
way children are looked after and educated in the day care center.<p>
5.  Accepting children as individuals, loving and emphaty towards them increase
their motivation to become active and autonomous.<p>
6.  Positive attitude is the foundation for working with children.<p>
7.  Regularity and predictability in the daily schedule result in feelings of
security and create a favorable atmosphere for independent activities and
provide longer uninterrupted periods of play.<p>
8.  The truism that adult differ in their personalities, beliefs and attitudes
towards children has to be accepted while it is important both for the center
and the home to have a set of common values and to act upon similar principles
to ensure the best possible circumstances for children's personality
development.  It is important to form and have a good relationship with
parents.<b></b><p>
<b>	</b>The whole day is for free play for the children, except the time
allocated for the care routines, meals and sleeping.  There are no group
activities organized in which all children have to participate.  Either a child
or a caregiver can initiate any activity but they are usually started on a
one-to-one basis.  Caregivers keep in mind what each child's needs are in terms
of promoting his development and try to engage him in such sort of play that
gives an opportunity to practice certain skills.  If all the children join the
activity is fine but nothing is ever initiated as a group activity and everyone
can enter and leave any time.<b></b><p>
<b></b><u>Kindergarten</u><b></b><p>
<b></b>In 1990/91 an improved version of the Kindergarten Education Program was
published, which retained the psychological foundation of the Education Program
of 1971, but gave greater liberties to kindergarten teachers in their actual
work by emphasizing that the program served as a framework for kindergarten
education.  The improved version was also issued by the National Institute of
Education under the commission of the Ministry of Education.  The program
suggests a tolerant educational attitude and  child centeredness. A few
examples are given below to illustrate this approach:<p>
	It stresses the advantages of educating children of mixed ages in one group,<p>
	The Document gives a description of the various ages, rather than setting
requirements,<p>
	The promotion of abilities is given great emphasis,<p>
	Teaching is replaced by learning,<p>
	It leaves the decision, whether organized learning should take place in free
activities or 		in organized activities, to kindergarten teachers ,<p>
	The program is extended with new contents, such as the various aspects of
mental 			health.<p>
	The education of the children takes place through a great variety of
activities. Among 		these the program puts the greatest emphasis on play, and
it encourages 			kindergarten teachers to provide a period as long as possible
for playing. <p>
The aim of the program is to promote the harmonious development of the child
and it sets forth the educational content by age groups.<p>
	Preparing for school is not a separate task in  kindergartens. The
kindergarten provides the conditions for the child's mental, physical and
social development in a manner that is adjusted to the child's pace of
development.<p>
	The schedule for the children is arranged by taking into account the age of
the children, their time of arrival, and the conditions of the kindergarten.
In the past years various schools of  kindergarten education have increased the
offer in kindergarten services, and thereby prompting a competition among them.
With the increased independence of kindergartens, initiatives have mushroomed,
and  today several  educational philosophies and several forms of education are
present in Hungary.<p>
<u>State care</u><p>
The educational programs, daily routines, and the rules and regulations
established in each residential home separately, and are developed by the
staff.. These duties, together with others require a lot of specific knowledge
and skills from the staff, who are also in great need of getting access to
specialized literature and of getting familiar with the experiences abroad. For
all these, however their opportunities are steadily shrinking among the
conditions of a deteriorating economy.<p>
<p>
<b>The staff</b><p>
<b></b><u>Day care</u><b></b><p>
<b></b>Unfortunately, just as in many other countries, the prestige of looking
after children is not very high.  The wages of caregivers (looking after
children under the age of 3) are among the lowest.  The importance of their
work is not fully recognized, as it is also reflected in their schooling:
secondary school or vocational school for nurses and other health personnel and
ten months on the job training.  There is an additional 1 year long course
(further training) for those who wish to become directors or just wish to have
a more in depth knowledge of child development, health, nutrition, and
management.  Recently, efforts have been made to improve the training.  There
are three vocational secondary schools where a six-year long experimental
training has been started three years ago, which will give a secondary school
diploma and a special caregiver diploma.  There are plans to introduce college
level education.<p>

Those kindergarten teachers who have no special qualification, or have only a
secondary school diploma, have to acquire the degree in kindergarten education.
The modification of  the Public Education Law of 1985, in 1990 extended the
period of training from two to three years.<p>
	Kindergarten teachers have 40 working hours per week, out of which 32 are
spent in children's groups. The rest of the hours are used for preparation,
family visits, consulting hours with the parents etc.<p>
	According to needs, kindergartens can employ other professional staff, such as
psychologists, special education teachers etc.  Auxiliary staff consists of
carers, who assist in caregiving activities, and who are responsible for
cleaning. For this post there is no special training required by the law. In
1990 however, a special training course was set up for auxiliary staff working
in the kindergartens, who can now-after completing the eight classes of
elementary school- acquire a vocational certificate for auxiliary staff in
kindergartens.<p>
<u>State care</u><p>
<u></u>Teachers working at child care institutions usually possess some kind of
a teacher's diploma. Most of them graduated at teacher training colleges and
gained their diplomas for teaching specific subjects, such as biology,
geography etc. During their training they are not prepared to become able to
meet  the special educational needs of traumatized, disturbed children often
displaying behaviour disorders. In Hungary, up to the recent past, there was no
special training program  for would be teachers in this field. The training
program to fill this gap now is offered by the College of Special Education and
it leads to a diploma in "psychopedagogy".  However, a significant proportion
of graduates from this course are drained away by various institutions for the
handicapped. Statistics from 1993 indicate that out of the 1300 teachers
working at the 110 residential child care institutions of the country, only 60
have acquired diplomas in psychopedagogy. During the last 3-4 years a number of
colleges have launched programs for training social pedagogues and social
workers, but the tertiary education of those working in the field is very
expensive, with the result that both the individual teachers and the employing
institutions find  difficult to afford. it.<p>
<b>A day</b><p>
<b></b><u>Day care</u><b></b><p>
<b></b>Day care centers are usually open form 6 in the morning until 6 in the
evening, with the caregivers working in shifts.  Families can bring and take
home their children whenever they want to.  Most of them, though, come between
7:30 and 8:30 in the morning and leave between 4:00 and 5:00 in the afternoon.
The opening hours of the center are decided upon by taking into consideration
the needs of the families using it.  If no one comes before 7 o'clock, the
center might open only then and stay open longer.<p>
	Children receive meals three times a day: breakfast, lunch and a mid-afternoon
snack plus fruit juice in mid-morning.  The times for these is set in their
daily schedules, breakfast is usually between 8 and 8:30, juice around 10:00,
lunch at 11:30 and afternoon snack around 3:30.  During the day they have free
play both in the morning and in the afternoon.  Most of the time when the
weather permits it they go outside.  During winter, they usually go out to play
in the garden around 10:00 while during summer they might spend the whole day
outside (including the meals).  After lunch they usually sleep outside, in most
centers even during winter.  Children sleep as long as they like but usually
two hours.  Infants and younger ones might sleep in the morning, too, according
to their needs.  Caretaking routines are tied to meal times but toileting,
diaper changing, handwashing, etc. are also done according to the needs.<p>
	Parents are asked to come and spend time with their children during the
settling in period, which is thought to be about two weeks for most children.
Parent (most of the time it is the mother) and child spend an increasingly
longer period in the center each day until the child gets to know the new
environment and feels comfortable and the parent can leave.  At any other time
parents are also welcome to spend time in the center, the only requirement is
that he let the caregiver know in advance.  There is always an opportunity to
talk to the caregivers and discuss the child at dropping off and picking up
times.<p>
	A pediatrician comes into each center every day.  He does the regular health
check-ups, measures height and weight once a month for each child.  If there
are any children who are not well, the pediatrician examines them, and writes
prescriptions or referrals as necessary.  If there are special needs children
in the center, he is participating in the team advising and supervising the
caregivers who work with those children.<p>
	During the spring of their final yeas in day care, children are prepared for
the transition to kindergarten.  Kindergarten teachers come to the center to
get to know the individual children, and their routines.  Caregivers and the
children usually visit the kindergarten to learn what it is like.  There might
be a whole succession of exchange visits.<p>
<u>Kindergarten</u><p>
Kindergartens have very similar opening hours and daily schedules for children
to day care centers.  The usual hours are from 6 in the morning until 6 in the
evening.  The majority of children arrive between 7:30 and 8:00 in the morning
and leave between 4:00 and 5:00 in the afternoon.  Daily schedules include set
time periods for meals, sleep, organized activities and as much time for free
play as possible.  Educationally oriented activities are introduced by the
kindergarten teacher from the first year on and the length of these periods and
the subjects covered increase as children grow older.  These activities are
organized only during the academic year, the summer is "free".  Topics include:
facts about the surrounding environment and the children themselves, art,
literature, language, music, mathematics and physical education.  Some
kindergartens offer foreign language classes, swimming, dancing, etc.,
depending on their opportunities.  Kindergartens following any certain
pedagogical traditions (e.g. Montessori, Frenet, etc.) have their curriculum
and schedules for the children designed accordingly.<p>
<u>State care</u><b></b><p>
<b></b>Residential homes by now admit children of a wide age range, with the
exception of nursery homes, where children are cared for up to the age of
three, in some places up to the age of six. This constitutes a huge step
forward, as children in need of lasting state care do not have to move several
times during their lives and thus they do not go through the repeated
disruptions of their attachments which it involved. The institutions
increasingly become open ones, thus helping the children acquire the skills
necessary for life after care. The majority of children placed in residential
homes attend kindergartens and schools in the local community together with
children from families.<p>
	The great majority of the buildings in use as residential homes for children
(one time mansions, country halls, workers' hostels), due to their
characteristics of design, are not suitable for providing an environment of
care that prepares children for an autonomous conduct of their lives. The
network of residential homes consists mainly of institutions of big size.  More
than half of the children in residential care live in institutions with over
the capacity of a hundred places. Two third of  the children in residential
care are not provided with rooms modelling the scenes of family life the groups
comprising 10-20 children are provided a dayroom and a dormitory, but dining
rooms and washrooms are used jointly by the groups. Consequently, the social
adjustment of children after care is greatly hindered, many of them become
homeless, and are in need of social care.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>LEGISLATION/POLICY</b><p>
	The Constitution of the Republic of Hungary declared even before the changes
in the political-economical system in 1989 - 1990, that it protected the
institutions of marriage and the family, and devoted a special care to the
defence of the existential security of young people and to the protection of
children and youth.<p>
	The Law passed in 1990 concerning the tasks and scopes of  the local
government authorities established after the political economic transformation,
clearly laid down the duties of local government authorities. Among these
featured the basic and specific tasks concerning the protection of children and
young people. For the performance of local government tasks, the state in its
annual budget determines the extent of central funding and transfers it to the
local government authorities.<p>
	From the point of view of the protection of the interest of  children  and
youth, the signing of the Convention on the Rights of Children dated November
20, 1989 in New York, and its incorporation into the Hungarian legislation as
Law LXIV of 1991 was of extraordinary significance.  A parliamentary resolution
obliges the government to frame regulations in line with the provisions of the
Convention, and also to ensure the modifications of legal regulations affected
by the prescriptions of the Convention. <p>
<u>Day care</u><p>
	After World War II., women were needed in the workforce, the value of their
contribution was emphasized and as a result, the provision of day care for
young children whose mothers were employed was declared to be the
responsibility of the state.  A Decree by the Council of Ministers in 1953
ordered the extensive building of new day care centers and stated that centers
should be built at new housing developments.  Another Decree in 1954 stated
that state owned centers, run by city or county councils, should be opened
instead of ones belonging to factories or companies.  There was a steady
increase in the number of day care places until the 1980's despite the
introduction of the Childcare Assistance (GYES) in 1967.  Since the 1970's,
several measures have been introduced to help families meet the costs of
brining up children.  These have been listed in the previous chapters.<p>
	As the gradual introduction of these measures reflect, there was a slow, not
very apparent change in the philosophy concerning women, children and mothers'
employment.  Women's contribution in the workforce was not so imperative
anymore and researchers talked about the detrimental effects of institutions
such as hospitals and orphanages.  Group day care was thought to have similar
consequences on the development of children.  Nevertheless, in spite of all
these, a great demand for day care still existed.  There were women who wanted
to pursue their careers and families whose income was not enough even with all
the support to live on if the mother stayed home.  <p>
	The decree No. 10/1978 (XII.5.) of the Minister of Health regulated the
establishing, operation and supervision of day care centers.  The Regulations
for the Organization and Operation of Day Care Centers was included in the
appendix.  <p>
	The democratically elected coalition government took office in 1990, and the
subsequent changes in policy and the economy have affected families and the day
care provision, too. The public administration system was reformed, local
governments were formed instead of the old council system.  Several laws and
regulations came into force, among them:<p>
-  Law No. LXV of 1990 concerning local governments;<p>
-  Law No. XX of 1991. concerning the duties and powers of local governments;<p>
-  Governmental decree No. 22/1992. concerning the duties and powers of mayors
and notaries in the domain of social welfare.  It declares that it is
obligatory for local governments to provide day care for children as part of
the basic welfare provision.<p>
	Law No III of 1993. (called the Social Act) concerning social management and
social provision.  It gives many of the state's previous responsibilities,
among them the provision of day care, to local authorities.  It:<p>
	-  states that the state and the local governments ensure the provision of
personal care 	   (solicitude?) <p>
	-  states that the provision of personal care include day care for children as
one of the 	   forms of basic welfare provision<p>
	-  defines the range of eligibility for day care for children under the age of
three (whose 	   parents work or are ill, whose physical and mental development
requires day care, 	   who are brought up by lone parents, who have got two or
more sisters or brothers, 	   whose family is in difficult social/financial
situation)<p>
	-  declares that local governments can draw up contracts with organizations
from the 	   private and the non-profit sector to provide services<p>
	-  states that a fee has to be paid for the services which is calculated by
the maintaining 	   agency.<p>
	The Decree No. 2/1994. (I.30) of the Minister of Welfare, concerning the
duties and operations of institutes providing personal care, supersede the
decree No. 10/1978 (XII.5.) of the Minister of Health.  Among others the decree
concerns day care centers and family day care.  In the case of day care centers
it:<p>
	-  regulates day care for special needs children up to the age of 6 (the
earlier decree did 	   not make this provision legally possible), and the
special programs promoting the 	<p>
	   development of these children<p>
	-  defines the range of other services which can be offered to help families
(playgroups, 	   part-time care, 24-hour care)<p>
	-  defines the duties of the Public Health Authority (?) concerning the health
and safety 	   inspections of day care centers<p>
The "Guidance concerning the organization and professional work in day care
centers" issued by BOMI in 1993 supplements this decree.<p>
	The No. 2/1994 directive of the Minister of Welfare states that the National
Institute of Day Care Centers (B&ouml;lcs&otilde;d&eacute;k Orsz&aacute;gos
M&oacute;dszertani Int&eacute;zete) is under the charge of and  guidance of the
Ministry of Welfare and that it oversees and supervises all day care centers,
regardless of who maintains them.<p>
	The No. 7009/1993. directive of the Minister of Health provides guidelines for
the Rules and Operations of leading (methodological) day care centers in the
districts of Budapest and in the counties.<p>
 <u>Kindergartens</u><p>
<u></u>The legal regulation of kindergartens goes back to more than a hundred
years. The first Kindergarten Law was passed in 1891,-63 years after that
Brunszvik Ter&eacute;z set up her kindergarten. This Law, modified in 1936, was
followed by the Law of 1953. The Law of 1953 was replaced by the Law No.I. on
Education of 1985. Departing from earlier policies, the Law of 1985 integrated
kindergarten education into the educational system.<p>
	The Law, which got into force from September 1, 1986 had a number of
progressive features. It guaranteed greater autonomy to educational
institutions in general, and within that to kindergartens with the aim of
encouraging democratic practices within educational institutions. The Law
contained fewer central instructions, and thereby enhanced  the role of local
decisions and widened the kindergartens scope of authority. <p>
	The new Law abolished Rules of Orders, including those concerning
kindergartens, which were dealt with in the regulation No 3/1974 (IX.12 issued
by the Ministry of Education, which regulated the operation of kindergartens
down to detail. Instead, Rules of Operation were introduced, which had to be
drafted by the kindergartens and schools themselves. Issues of operations have
become subjects of decisions made by educational institutions after the careful
consideration of local conditions. Rules of Organization and Operation
currently in force, which have retained these qualities, contain concrete
regulations concerning the operation of kindergartens, their relationship to
other institutions, and their internal relations. (The general prescriptions
concerning rules of operation were given in the Law on Public Education of
1993, No. LXXIX.. <p>
	In 1986 a new legislation was introduced whereby the time of starting school
was adjusted to the childs level of development. The aim of this new system,
which took into account the childs interest, has been that the child should
start his or her studies when most appropriate on the basis of his or her level
of development. That is, starting school should occur at an optimum time, after
considerations concerning both the childs age and level of development. In case
the child reaches the level of development necessary for starting school, he or
she becomes of school age from the calendar year, which he or she completed his
or her sixth year by May 31. For establishing the time when the child enters
school, kindergarten teachers give a report of the child s level of development
in connection with his or her possible start of school.<p>
	In September, 1994 the decree No 11/1994 (VI.8 regulating the operation of
educational institutions, came into force, which served the implementation of
the Law on Public Education of 1993 No/ LXXIX. At one and the same time, the
many times modified decree No. 12/1986 (VIII.1 regulating the operation of
kindergartens lost its validity.<p>
	The Law No. XXIII of 1993-. which modified the Law No. 1. of 1985 passed at
the time of the political-economical transformation,- in conjunction with the
Law IV. of 199 on Freedom of Conscience and Religion created the opportunities
for organizations outside the public sector, to provide services to do with the
education of children.<b></b><p>
<b>	</b>The duties of the local government authorities concerning kindergartens
are stated in the law defining the duties of local authorities in relation to
educational institutions:<p>
Local government authorities of villages, towns, municipal towns and the
districts of the capital are obliged to make provisions for kindergarten
education. Local authorities can meet this duty by setting up and operating
kindergartens themselves, or in partnership, as well as by means of contracting
out these services .<p>
<u>State care</u><b></b><p>
<b></b>The Government is preparing a law on child welfare and child protection
within this framework.<p>
Within this system of social provision, - with regard to the particular rights
and interests of children,- the Law wishes to establish a system which
guarantees welfare provisions and protection for children, and which on the one
hand assists families in the upbringing of children by offering various kinds
of support and services, and ones which ensure the appropriate provisions and
protection of children  removed from their families. The Law is based on the
following principles:<p>
-the constitution guarantees the right of the child to live and to be brought
up  in his or her family<p>
-families must get support for the upbringing of their children, and for this
the state must provide support and services adjusted to the individual needs of
the families<p>
-in the interest of the appropriate care of the child and of insuring his or
her interests, the responsibilities of the state, the local authorities and the
bodies and persons providing services should be clearly defined<p>
	The Law will oblige every local authority to build up its own preventive
childcare system and operate it in an efficient way. For this it wishes to
allocate funds to the local government authorities from the central state
budget. In order to modernize the system of residential care, it will include
regulations concerning professional an operational requirements, and will
oblige the bodies operating these institutions to make the necessary
alterations in the institutions not meeting these requirements, by a given
deadline. For this task, too, funds should be made available from the central
budget.<p>
	The Law currently under elaboration, aims to bring about  fundamental changes
in the system of preventive childcare and in the system of state care.,
However, the up-to-date specialist provisions of the Law will be implemented
only at the rate made possible by the availability of financial resources.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>THE ROLE OF NON-GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN PROVIDING CARE FOR YOUNG
CHILDREN</b><p>
<b></b>	During the last decades there have been a growing interest worldwide in
organizations that can be characterized as non-governmental.  The reasons
underlying this interest include:<p>
	- a search for more cost-effective ways of delivering conventional public
services <p>
	- the flexibility and responsiveness of NGOs to the needs of the communities
with 	<p>
	  whom they work and their capacity for innovation.<p>
	- the demonstrated capacity of some NGOs to reach the poor  and
discriminated-against <p>
	  groups more effectively than public agencies.<p>
There is a growing interest in the Central-Eastern European region, too, among
donors and national governments in strengthening the role of institutions
outside the public sector. (Save the Children UK position paper)<p>
	The Hungarian non-profit sector has been developing dynamically since 1989.
Though, there were some areas of service provision, mainly sports, recreation
and fire protection, where voluntary organizations could be active even under
state socialism.  Foundations were recognized by law in 1987, the freedom of
association was enacted in 1989.  Government control of foundations was
abolished and the whole policy towards voluntary organizations became quite
favourable.  (Kuti, 1994)<p>

<b></b>Since non-profit service provision and the establishment of foundations
became legal, many such organizations have been created in order to meet the
unsatisfied demand or at least to lessen the shortage which were the result of
the overcentralized state provision of welfare services.  Most of these new
organizations are fund-raising agencies or foundations supporting service
providing public institutions but some service providing organizations are also
operating.<p>

1994.<p>
<p>
As it can bee seen in the table, the share of voluntary organizations in health
and education is relatively low, compared to other developed, democratic
countries.  The reason behind this is the state monopoly of education and
health care that existed under state socialism.  And, although this monopoly
was broken by the change in government in 1990, the non-profit service
provision could not develop rapidly because of the lack of capital needed for
investment.  <p>
The role of the NGO sector in services aimed at children and families is even
less.  In 1993, there were just over 100 registered non-profit organizations
with "child" or "youth" as part of their title, according to the Nonprofit
Information and Training Center in Budapest.  <p>
	However, there were only 4 foundations concerned with childcare for under
threes (personal communication, Eva Kuti, 1994).  In 1995, another foundation,
supporting the work of the National Institute of Day Care Centers has been
established.  There is specific provision in the Social Act (1993) to allow
local authorities to contract with NGOs for the provision of services, but
there are only very few examples of privatized day care services supported by
local authorities.  There were only two registered private day care centers in
the country in 1993. (see chapter on day care).  The percentage of day care
places provided by the private and the voluntary sector are 0.45 and 0.04
respectively.  (Central Statistical Office, 1994).<p>
"Public authorities, however, are well aware of the necessity of modernizing
and restructuring of the provision of welfare services and of a new partnership
between public, non-profit and for-profit organizations." (Kuti, 1994).<p>
	The reason for the relatively low participation of NGOs in day care for under
threes is probably the almost total lack of experience on the part of both the
local authorities and the providers in providing day care out of the public
sector.  Questions of financing are the major concern.<b></b><p>
<b>	</b>By now kindergartens can be established and operated by not only the
local government authorities, but other legal entities, as well as individuals,
provided their services meet specific requirements. Licenses are required for
every kindergarten with the exception of kindergartens run by the local
authorities.  Churches, social organizations, foundations fulfilling public
duties can apply for the above normative per capita support, provided they meet
the requirements stated in the law, such as stating the conditions for the
service to be provided, a contract concluded with the local government on
giving the service etc.<p>
	The operation of not-for-profit institutions in the social sector, and within
that in state (child) care has been made possible by legislation since 1989.
Institutions operated by organizations other than central and local
authorities, and providing social services are entitled for the same state per
capita subsidy as local authorities. Only a few not-for-profit organizations
are involved in child and youth care in Hungary, the one operating for the
longest time and caring for the greatest number of children is the Hungarian
SOS Children's Villages Society, which operates three children's villages in
the country.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>SPECIAL STUDIES</b><p>
<b></b>So far, the prevailing form of day care for children under three has
been center-based, as it is mentioned earlier.  However, there clearly exist a
need for another, more flexible type of care, too, and with the introduction of
the changes the government carries out in the family benefit system, the
question of diversifying non-parental child care has become extremely urgent.
Given the number of day care centers in the country presently, a great number
of the families predicted to be in need of day care as a consequence of the
cuts and restrictions in family support, will not find a place for their child.
Family day care seems to be the only alternative.  Legislation is in place and
the National Institute of Day Care Centers (BOMI) coordinates a pilot study in
childminding with the collaboration of the Ministry of Welfare and the Pikler
Institute (for nursery homes).  Criteria for introducing family day care have
been developed, the present study aims to find out how local authorities can be
involved (registering, supporting and monitoring providers) in order to ensure
the good quality of such a provision and how the support and inspection of
providers can be best organized.  The local government of Kiskunhalas (a medium
sized town in the Southern part of Hungary) participates in the study.<p>
Several steps have been taken so far:  a survey was carried out among families
with young children and among prospective providers; written materials have
been produced (based on foreign literature) on how to set up the registration
process; a brochure is published with information for those who would like to
offer family day care; advising the local authority has been and will be going
on; planning to begin the service was done in collaboration with the local
authority; developing the curriculum for advisors and supervisors of providers
is in process.  The next phases of the project will include: a training course
for those who will be advising and supervising the providers in Kiskunhalas;
surveys at the beginning of the new service and a few month later to assess the
initial setup and later the problems and successes; writing and publishing a
series of brochures (small books) for family day care providers on different
aspects of their work (e.g. safety, health, development, behavior management,
nutrition, etc.).  <p>
	There are plans for another major representative survey concerning day care
workers and the families who are using day care.  All kinds of information will
be collected on the social-economic status, attitudes, preferences,
satisfaction, etc..  Data collection will probably begin towards the end of
1995.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>THE FUTURE</b><p>
<b></b>	There have been several changes proposed in the health and social
welfare provisions by the government which will come into force in the near
future.  These were summarized in the <b>Law No. XLVIII of 1995</b>.  Some
features relevant to this study and affecting the situation of families and
children are the following:<p>
<u>Chapter I:</u><b></b><p>
<b></b>Modifications of the Law No. XXV of 1990 concerning the eligibility for
Family Allowance:<p>
61[[section]]  	-those are eligible whose per capita monthly income in the
family during the previous year did not exceed 17 000 forints after taxes.<p>
	-those are not eligible whose joint and separate properties together in the
family:<p>
		exceed the value of 10 million forints in case of homes (houses, apartments)
and 			land<p>
		exceed the value of 2 million forints in case of cars.<p>
62[[section]]	when calculating the sum of Family Allowance, the basic sum
should be multiplied by 1.5, if there is a permanently ill or physically or
mentally disabled child in the family, regardless of his age <p>
63[[section]]	those families who have got only one child are eligible during
the first six years of the child's life but are after the six birthday of the
child they are eligible only if one of the parents is not working or if the
child is disabled or permanently ill<p>
64[[section]]	the monthly sum of the Family Allowance in 1995 can be between 1
100 and 3 750 forints depending on the number of children in the family and the
family's income and the sum can be between 2 100 and 5 100 forints if the child
is disabled or permanently ill<p>
<u>Chapter II:</u><p>
Childcare Assistance (GYES)<p>
-  It can be received until the child becomes 3 years old or if the child is
disabled, until he becomes 10 years old.  The Childcare Assistance can be
extended until the child's sixth birthday if he cannot go to day care because
of his illness.<p>
-  Its sum equals the sum of the minimum pension at any given time.<p>
-  Childcare Assistance should be discontinued if the child is taken to day
care.<p>
-  Persons receiving Childcare Assistance can have a job when the child is
older than 1 1/2 years old.<p>
-  All regulations concerning Childcare Assistance (eligibility, termination,
registry, etc.) are the same as those of the Family Allowance.<p>
Maternity Allowance<p>
-  Those are eligible who are eligible for free prenatal care<p>
-  Eligibility criteria concerning the income of the family are the same as
those of the Family Allowance<p>
-  Its sum in 1995 is 10 000 per child<p>
	The regulations concerning the Family Allowance come into force from July 1,
1995.<p>
Those who are receiving Childcare Assistance (GYES), Childcare Allowance (GYED)
and Pregnancy Allowance can receive these until December 31, 1995.<p>
<u>Chapter III:</u><p>
<u></u>Maternity Allowance<p>
-  It can be received during the first 52 weeks after the birth of the child<p>
-  During the first 26 weeks its sum equals the 70% of the previous average
wage if the mother had 270 days spent in employment during the previous year.
Its sum equals 60% of the previous average wage if the mother had 180 days
spent in employment during the previous year.<p>
-  During the next 26 weeks its sum equals the 50% of the previous average
wage.<p>
<p>
	What has been revealed here so far, supports the belief that child care
provision will have to diversify, in accordance with changes in the country's
economy and with the needs of children and their families.  The types of
service available need to be expanded, financing and eligibility for providing
different forms of service have to be diversified.  It is inevitable that
<u>besides public provision, the private and the emergent voluntary sectors
will have to be involved</u>.  Steps have been taken in this direction by the
government as well as by day care and kindergarten authorities.  Legislation
have been passed recently (Social Act, 1993, Public Education Law, 1993) to
make the participation of both the private and the voluntary sector in the
provisions legally possible.  The Social Act states specifically that local
authorities can ensure provision by drawing up contracts with organizations
from both of these sectors.  In the area of child and family welfare services,
as elsewhere in the social economy, not-for-profit organisations are taking on
a more prominent role in their delivery, but their social, political and
economic role is constrained by the lack of a non-profit law (Kuti, 1991, Kuti
and Perri6,1993).  There are a few examples for day care centers and
kindergartens run by foundations and private providers.  However, their number
is small, they account for less than 7% and 4% of the provision respectively.
There are also <u>initiatives for introducing new types of service</u>.
Besides full day care, centers have already started to offer part-time care,
playgroups, and at some places, overnight care.  Special needs children are
accepted, and new programs have been introduced, such as club meeting for
parents.  Furthermore, a small group of experts, with the coordination of the
National Institute of Day Care Centers is conducting a pilot project in
childminding to see how this form of day care could be organized, provided,
supported and supervised.  Project plans are also under way to initiate,
promote and encourage local grass roots groups to form themselves into
not-for-profit organizations and to encourage their participation in the
design, management and delivery of early years services.  On the other hand,
studies would be essential to map the existing possibilities and conditions for
private providers (both organizations and individuals) and to design schemes or
projects to assist them.<p>
	Kindergatens already have the right to develop their own curriculum, the
policy framework is already in place.  During the past few years, a growth in
the number of kindergartens using different pedagogical models could be seen.
A National Kindergarten Education Program is under elaboration and will be
published by the Ministry of Culture and Public Education.  In this document
the national requirements to do with kindergarten education will feature as
guidelines.   The government program, which was published last summer set the
target of the supervision, and -if necessary- the modification, of the
regulation of the content of education in the Public Education Law of 1993. The
government aims to implement changes in the regulation of the education law in
order " to secure the existence of the kindergarten network which plays a
crucial role in levelling out life chances, and  to restitute its state of
appreciation, as well as to increase its professional standard&#148;.  The
draft that takes into account the aims articulated in the government program,
and also the issues in need of  new regulations, has been completed. The main
targets of the Program  are  the promotion  of the autonomy of kindergartens,
and the establishment of the legal guarantees necessary for this autonomy.<p>
	To sum up, the system of residential institutions for children in Hungary
calls for urgent reforms both in the field of training and in the objective
conditions of care.  This includes the  training and further training of staff
to prepare them for the specific tasks they will encounter in residential
institutions of daycare, and the replacement of big size residential homes by
institutions modelling  the scenes of family life. At the same time, families
should get maximum support to become able to  take back their children from
residential care, so that the state care of the child under age should last the
minimum period possible.  Several initiatives have been made in the line of
renewing the system of state care. Some large size residential homes have been
closed down, and the residents were placed in separate family homes where their
teachers followed them. In one of the biggest children's towns "home-flats"
have been set up, in which groups of 6 - 8 children live together with their
teachers.  These initiatives however involve only a small percentage of
children in state care as their operating bodies usually do not have the
financial resources to implement the necessary changes and modernisation.<p>
<p>
The importance of the following, however, should be emphasized:<p>
  a coordinated approach to the process of diversification<p>
  a strict control and regulation by professionals in the interest of children
and their families <p>
<p>
In order to achieve good results in the management of the change, the following
projects could be carried out to provide a solid basis:<p>
	- A study on who is using the day care provision now<p>
	- A study on what type of services families would use if they had the choice<p>
	- A wider-range study on childminding provision at different parts of the <p>
	  country (villages, small towns, big cities, etc.)<p>
	- Pilot studies and also wider-range studies to see how local communities,
non-profit 	   organizations and the private sector could be involved in child
care.<p>
<p>
In addition, training programs, drawing heavily on the knowledge and support of
day care centers and professionals of the existing day care network and
kindergartens, have to be developed to enable staff in the institutions and
other interested parties to provide, coordinate and supervise these new
services.<p>
