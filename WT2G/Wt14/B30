<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-45-121.</H1>
1-45-121.  Penalty - affirmative defense. (1) (a)  Any person who
knowingly violates any provision of this article or who gives or accepts any
contribution or contribution in kind required to be reported under section
1-45-108 in such a way as to hinder or prevent identification of the true donor
commits a class 3 misdemeanor and shall be punished as provided in section
18-1-106, C.R.S.  Any such person  who conspires with another to violate any
provision of this article and who is also a candidate shall, in addition to any
other penalty provided in this section, forfeit his right to assume the
nomination or to take the oath for the office to which he may have been
elected, unless he has already taken said oath, in which case the office shall
be vacated.  In the event the office to which the candidate has been elected is
vacated, the vacancy to said office shall be filled as provided by law.
<P>(b)  The secretary of state may, upon sufficient evidence, hold a hearing
pursuant to section 1-45-113 (2) upon the secretary of state's own motion or
upon written complaint to enforce the civil penalty provided for in this
paragraph (b).  In addition to the criminal penalty provided for in this
section, any person who knowingly violates any provision of this article
involving a contribution or a contribution in kind shall be subject to a civil
penalty in an amount not to exceed the greater amount of three hundred percent
of the amount of the contribution or the fair market value at the time of the
contribution in kind, or five thousand dollars.
<P>(2)  It shall be an affirmative defense to prosecution under this article
that the offender did not have actual knowledge of his responsibility under
this article and was an uncompensated volunteer.
<P>(3)  The appropriate officer, after proper notification by certified mail,
return receipt requested, shall impose an additional penalty of ten dollars per
day for each day that a statement or other information required to be filed by
this article is not filed by the close of the business day on the day due;
except that the appropriate officer may excuse such penalty for bona fide
personal exigencies.  Revenues collected from penalties assessed by the
secretary of state shall be deposited in the department of state cash fund
created in section 24-21-104 (3), C.R.S.
<P>(4)  No person who has not fully complied with the provisions of this
article shall be permitted to be a candidate for any public office in any
subsequent election until the deficiencies have been corrected.
