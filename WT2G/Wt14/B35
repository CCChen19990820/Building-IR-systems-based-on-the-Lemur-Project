Pacific Power operates a large telecommunications network, used on a 
day-to-day basis for the administration and control of electricity 
generation for New South Wales.  By making use of spare bandwidth/capacity, 
this telephone network provides a free backbone service for the delivery of
electronic resources to remote primary and secondary schools across
New South Wales.<P></P>

<IMG SRC  = "/shared/images/earth160.gif">
In addition to the <I>backbone</I> service mentioned above, a
comprehensive coverage is achieved by establishing regional  HUB
systems owned and operated by pro-active schools to provide local
dial-in services to their surrounding STD areas - a kind of
"co-operative, cellular" distribution system.<P></P>
<P></P>

Individual schools and education based organisations have the option
to set themselves up as a HUB system, allowing authorised students and
their families to access PowerNet outside school hours.<P></P> Not all
schools will want to operate as regional hubs, and a number of
membership categories have been designed to meet the needs of
particular school/teacher and remote education situations. <P></P>

<H3>MEETING THE NEW SOUTH WALES POWER DEMAND</H3>
<HR>

<P>
Pacific Power provides one of the state's most vital public services.
<P>
There would be few people who don't turn to electricity at least
sometime during a normal day.
<P>
But with a safe and reliable electricity supply now a common expectation,
few people take the time to consider just what it is we rely on
when we turn a power switch.
<P>
This booklet seeks to provide a brief overview of our electricity
supply industry, explaining what electricity is, and how it is
brought to the home and the workplace.<HR>

<H1>OVERVIEW OF THE NSW POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM</H1>

<P>
Development of the New South Wales power supply system has resulted
in location of the state's main generating stations close to the
coal fields from which they draw their fuel. Electricity is delivered
to major usage points via an extensive high voltage transmission
network (grid).
<P>
The advantages of this approach are that vast industrial power
complexes are removed from population centres, and the associated
problems of fuel haulage and provision of other major services
(water supply etc.) do not affect urban environments. As well,
it is much cheaper to transmit electricity than to transport vast
quantities of coal.
<P>
The state's overall power needs at any one time are met jointly
by all operating power stations on the grid. The stations pool
their electricity output. No one power station serves a particular
area.
<P>
Large, long-distance transmission lines are an integral part of
the philosophy on which the New South Wales supply system has
been built and are essential to economic and efficient bulk power
delivery.
<P>
These power lines have some undesirable aesthetic characteristics
but the alternative, a large number of smaller power stations
and transmission lines within cities and towns across the state,
would be self defeating, both environmentally and economically.
<P>
Nearly all the electrical energy used by the people and industries
of New South Wales is produced and transmitted in bulk, by Pacific
Power (The Electricity Commission of New South Wales). The remainder
is produced by a few small councils and privately owned generating
plants, some of which sell surplus production to the state supply
system.
<P>
A deregulatory trend, encouraging greater competitive input to
the system from the private sector, is expected to have significant
long-term impact.
<P>
Localised delivery of electricity to consumers in more than twenty
regions of the state is carried out by distributing authorities
which are closely attuned to the special needs of their district.
<P>
The New South Wales supply system could be likened, in business
terms, to a manufacturer/wholesaler, distributor/retailer arrangement
where Pacific Power is the main manufacturer/wholesaler and your
local electricity council is the distributor/retailer, i.e., the
people from whom you purchase your electricity.
<P>
As a marketable energy source (commodity if you like), electricity
is unusual. It must be manufactured at the instant it is needed.
When a light is turned on, the supply system must immediately
produce the additional power. Unlike most commodities, electricity
cannot be drawn, as required, from a reservoir or storage area,
except in a very small way from storage batteries.
<P>
This, of course, results in a constantly changing demand on the
supply network as electrical equipment and lighting is turned
on and off throughout the day, and presents supply authorities
with logistical problems unique to the electricity industry.
<P>
In New South Wales a sophisticated Data Acquisition and Control
(DAC) system is used to constantly evaluate and regulate the combination
of generating plant in service to ensure the changing power demand
is met with a maximum of economy and efficiency.
<P>
Supervision and overall control of the performance of the state's
supply network is carried out at Pacific Power's control centre
at Carlingford in Sydney.
<P>
An emerging national approach to electricity supply planning envisages
stronger interconnections between eastern state supply networks,
and competitive, cross-border interchange.
<P>
State and private generating authorities would compete for markets
anywhere within the interconnected system. For example, a privately
owned generating plant could contract to supply a customer in
another state (if the price was right) by paying a &quot;delivery&quot;
fee for use of the interconnected grid.
<H1>ELECTRICITY AUTHORITIES SERVING NEW SOUTH WALES</H1>

<P>
PACIFIC POWER (The Electricity Commission of New South Wales)
is the major authority responsible for generation and bulk transmission
of electric power, reliably, economically and safely throughout
the state. Pacific Power is the registered business name of The
Electricity Commission of New South Wales.
<P>
THE OFFICE OF ENERGY provides broad oversight of the energy industry,
including electricity supply. The Office also administers electrical
safety rules and their implementation as well as the operations
of local electricity distributing councils. Electricians are licensed
by the Building Services Corporation.
<P>
ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTING COUNCILS are responsible for all aspects
of safe and economical local electricity supply to industrial,
commercial and domestic consumers within their particular region.
There are some 25 distribution authorities serving all parts of
New South Wales.
<P>
THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS HYDRO ELECTRIC AUTHORITY is a Commonwealth
Statutory Authority responsible for operation and maintenance
of the Snowy Scheme as a whole. The scheme is under the regulatory
guidance of the Snowy Mountains Council which oversees water releases
for irrigation and hydro generation.
<P>
THE ELECTRICITY COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH WALES acts as a forum for
co-ordination of initiatives within the New South Wales electricity
supply industry and provides industry advice to the government.
Members of The Council represent the distributing authorities,
Pacific Power, The Office of Energy, Department of Local Government,
The Local Government Electricity Association and the Labour Council
of NSW.
<H1>PRODUCING ELECTRICITY</H1>

<P>
Electricity for widespread commercial and domestic use is almost
invariably produced by a generator. Storage batteries are an exception.
In these, a chemical reaction produces electricity.
<P>
The means by which the generator is driven varies widely throughout
the world, and is largely dependent on the natural energy resources
available.
<P>
A generator has a magnetised rotor as its core, spinning within
a surrounding shell of coils (usually copper) called a stator.
The stator coils intersect the spinning magnetic fields of the
rotor, inducing an alternating electric current into the coils.
<P>
Producing electricity is, in effect, an energy conversion process,
from one basic form of energy into electrical energy.
<H2>Using coal for electricity generation</H2>

<P>
In New South Wales, the main energy source for electricity generation
is black coal. There are abundant reserves available at reasonable
cost. New South Wales, and Australia generally, produce relatively
cheap electric power by world standards...one of the country's
few competitive advantages.
<P>
The coal is burnt in the furnace of a boiler to produce steam
at very high pressures and temperatures. The steam is directed
onto the blades of a turbine (imagine rows of finely bladed windmills
on a common shaft). The spinning turbine is directly coupled to,
and drives, the generator. (See Diagram One).
<H2>Other energy sources for electricity generation</H2>

<P>
A nuclear power station operates on the same basic principles,
except that the heat to produce steam is created by nuclear reaction
rather than by burning coal. Capital costs are very high and Government
legislation prevents development of nuclear power stations for
electricity generation in New South Wales.
<P>
In a hydro power station, the energy from falling water spins
the turbine which drives the generator. Vast quantities of water
are needed for large scale power production. Mainland Australia
has very limited hydro power potential, much of which has already
been realised.
<P>
A gas-turbine power station is one in which combustion gases at
very high pressure and temperature (rather than steam) are used
to spin the turbo-generator. A mixture of compressed air and vaporised
liquid fuel (or natural gas) is ignited in a combustion chamber
to produce the high pressure gas stream which drives the turbine.
<H2>Diagram One - Energy sources used to generate electricity
</H2>

<P>
New South Wales has a number of small gas-turbine units in its
system but, because of their high operating costs, they are mainly
for emergency use (they quickly reach their maximum generating
capacity). Additional, strategically located, gas-turbine stations
are being considered for short term operation during periods of
high electricity demand (in much the same way as the Snowy Mountains
power stations are used).
<P>
Wind energy can be used to drive a turbine which, in turn, is
coupled to a generator. In this case the turbine is often like
a large aeroplane propeller. New South Wales is researching suitable
locations.
<P>
In some cases, tidal and wave flows can be harnessed to provide
energy, but again, to drive the same basic generator. The large
tidal changes needed for successful development of a tidal power
station do not occur in New South Wales. Wave patterns are the
subject of research.
<P>
Solar energy can be used to both produce electricity or to reduce
the demand for electric or other energy forms.
<P>
One form of solar power station (solar thermal station) focuses
the sun's rays to collect heat energy which, again, produces steam
to drive a turbine/generator.
<P>
Solar collectors commonly found on roof tops collect and focus
energy from the sun's rays to heat water supplies, thus reducing
the demand for other energy forms... a desirable outcome from
a greenhouse point-of-view.
<P>
Photo-voltaic cells convert the sun's energy directly into an
electric current. These are the subject of extensive research
in New South Wales and will probably be providing useful supplementary
power to homes and factories by the turn of the century.
<H2>New technologies for electricity generation</H2>

<P>
There are a number of other emerging combinations of modern technology.
Many of them are environmentally friendly and of high efficiency.
These are likely to play a part in the future provision of electrical
energy for New South Wales.
<P>
Most of these still fall within the general principle of harnessed
energy driving a generator, which will continue as the basis for
nearly all of our electricity production in the medium term future.
<P>
Some of these new technologies are:
<P>
FLUIDISED BED COMBUSTION, where a wide range of fuels including
low grade coal or coal wastes, sewerage sludge etc. are burned
as a fluid mix in a special furnace to produce steam, again, to
drive a conventional generator.
<P>
COMBINED CYCLE GENERATING PLANTS, where hot exhaust gases from
a gas turbine generating unit are utilised to operate an associated
steam turbine generator, thus achieving a better overall efficiency.
<P>
MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS, where extremely high temperature gases are
expanded within a magnetic field to directly produce an electrical
current. This technology is still very much in the experimental
stage.
<P>
Another technology, already in small scale practical use, is the
<P>
UTILISATION OF METHANE GAS (an unfriendly greenhouse gas), from
compressed refuse dumps or coal seams, as fuel for gas-turbine
generators or reciprocating engine driven generators.
<P>
CO-GENERATION, is not so much a new technology as one on which
much greater emphasis is being placed for efficiency reasons.
This technique involves the use of waste heat from industrial
process plants for power generation or vice versa.
<H1>DISTRIBUTING ELECTRICITY</H1>

<P>
The concept of producing electricity at or near the basic energy
source depends on a large scale transmission network to move bulk
quantities of electricity efficiently to strategic demand centres
throughout New South Wales.
<P>
This distribution network must also provide, as far as economically
practicable, for alternative routing of supply to these demand
centres in the event of interference or damage (usually lightning)
to a major power line.
<P>
The &quot;backbone&quot; of this network is an extensive 330 000
volt grid running between the northern and southern borders of
New South Wales and extending into the near western regions. Superimposed
over this are sections of a developing 500 000 volt grid which
will interlink major cities or demand points with major power
stations. There is also an interwoven 132 000 volt system from
which supply usually passes to local distributing authorities.
<P>
The New South Wales bulk supply network and the Victorian and
South Australian systems are interconnected for mutually beneficial
interchange of electricity supplies.
<P>
Introduction of the national grid concept will involve strengthening
interconnections and perhaps the inclusion of Queensland and Tasmania
in a South and East Australian National Grid.
<P>
Electricity, when produced at a power station, passes through
a transformer to raise voltage for efficient long distance transmission.
At delivery or transfer points around the network the voltage
is lowered, again through transformers (in substations), for local
distribution through council networks.
<P>
A typical example of power station to household supply voltages
would be:
<P>
Power station generation at 23 000 volts, stepped up to 500 000
or 330 000 volts (in a transformer) for initial transmission across
the state. The voltage would be stepped down (again in a transformer)
for more localised delivery via 132 000 and 66 000 volt lines.
Retail distribution is usually handled at 33 000 and 11 000 volts
finally reaching smaller end-users at 415 and 240 volts.
<P>
Though power ultimately arrives at the point of use through street
lines and small local transformers, the end user, in reality,
is totally dependent on the very big transmission lines, often
some distance away.
<H2>Diagram Two - From Power Station to You</H2>

<P>
Pacific Power has service centres strategically located throughout
New South Wales and carries out regular aerial and ground patrols
to inspect and maintain the substations and transmission lines
of the bulk supply network. Distributing councils have similar
emergency and routine maintenance provisions within their individual
retail networks.
<P>
Future development and expansion of the state's main transmission
grid is entirely dependent on any increase in demand for electricity
at growth centres.
<P>
Today's environmental climate demands that any such development
undergo the most rigorous scrutiny to both justify need and ensure
environmentally harmonious construction.
<P>
No generally applicable technology exists as an alternative to
transmission lines. High-voltage underground cables cost up to
twenty times as much as overhead lines and, because they are technically
limited to sections about 20 kilometres in length, are only used
in high density urban or city areas.
<P>
These days, transmission lines are positioned, where the topography
permits, below the skyline, and blended into the countryside by
painting structures, dulling conductors and colouring insulators.
<P>
Electromagnetic fields associated with the state's biggest power
lines are well within standards laid down by the World Health
Organisation and often significantly less than those experienced
in common domestic situations.
<H1>PEOPLE AND THE POWER DEMAND</H1>

<P>
Nearly half the electricity consumed in New South Wales is for
industrial and commercial purposes. Rural consumption is about
two percent and miscellaneous uses such as public lighting and
railway traction account for about five percent. The remainder
is used by domestic consumers.
<P>
Electricity travels from power station to power point at the speed
of light, about 300 000 kilometres a second. Effectively, activation
of a single switch anywhere in the state has an instantaneous,
though minute, impact on the interconnected power supply network.
As power is turned on, the system, collectively, experiences an
increase in &quot;load&quot; and vice versa as power is turned
off.
<P>
The state's consumption of electric energy is, in effect, something
of a measure of economic activity while the instantaneous demand
is a barometer of the collective activities and habits of the
community. It reflects peaks of industrial activity which, when
added to domestic cooking, heating and lighting needs, usually
results in an annual maximum demand occurring during winter months
on a working day at about six pm.
<H2>Diagram Three - The Daily Power Demand Curve</H2>

<P>
A cold, bleak, or wet evening, on a day of the week when industry
normally works overtime, is the usual combination of factors which
sends the power demand to the year's &quot;high&quot;.
<P>
Summer demands are generally less, but industrial and commercial
demands continue and special factors, such as a growing air conditioning
load, can actually increase demand in some areas.
<P>
Even special community events such as sporting activities or very
popular TV programmes show up as power demand fluctuations, but
not always in an expected way.
<P>
There may be a rise in demand during the commercial break of a
high-rating TV show (rather than a fall) due to widespread use
of electric jugs for tea making. There is always a significant
fall in demand during the running of the Melbourne Cup. Many TVs
and radios are turned on, but this demand increase is more than
offset by a big decrease in industrial load as plant and machinery
are turned off.
<P>
Economic and efficient control of the state's power network under
these constantly changing conditions thus requires the best technology
and human skills available.
<H2>Electricity Tariffs</H2>

<P>
Two separate sets of prices apply to the electricity supply industry
in New South Wales, a Bulk Supply Tariff for the wholesaling of
electricity by Pacific Power to the various distributing authorities,
and Retail Tariffs for retail supply by distributing authorities
to their customers (the community generally).
<P>
Different retail tariffs apply to different groups or classes
of customers.
<P>
Domestic Tariffs and Off-peak Tariffs apply to residential customers.
General Supply Tariffs or Time-of-day General Supply Tariffs are
usually applicable to small business customers (commercial and
industrial). Larger business customers are usually on a Demand
Tariff or Time-of-day Demand Tariff.
<P>
Special end-use tariffs such as Irrigation Tariffs, Process Heating
Tariffs etc., are also available to business customers.
<P>
For large electricity intensive industries, such as aluminium
smelters, special contract tariffs can apply. These tariffs usually
have special features such as &quot;interruptibility&quot; agreements,
which can give Pacific Power the right to interrupt power supplies
for limited periods of time. This provides a valuable &quot;buffer
margin&quot; in cases of short-term emergencies (generator repairs
etc.) on the state's power supply system.
<P>
Supply industry restructuring, the introduction of a national
grid and wholesale electricity market could positively influence
electricity pricing during the 90's and beyond.
<P>
The evolving electricity market will function like other commercial
commodity markets, encouraging open access to the grid and free
trade in bulk electricity for private generating companies, public
utilities and private and public electricity customers.
<P>
In effect, a private generating company might sell electricity
to a bulk customer in another state. The contract between supplier
and purchaser would pay the grid a &quot;delivery&quot; fee.
<H1>UNDERSTANDING ELECTRICITY</H1>

<H2>Magnetism and Electricity </H2>

<P>
Commercial generation of electricity relies on the principles
of magnetism and magnetic fields. The biggest example of a magnetic
field is that which links the earth's north and south magnetic
poles, and on which navigational compasses depend.
<P>
If a piece of conductive material (like copper wire) is passed
through the magnetic field of say, a bar magnet, a tiny electrical
impulse (a movement of electrons) occurs in the wire. If the wire
is passed back through the field, the electrons move in the opposite
direction. This is the very basis for the production of alternating
current electricity.
<H2>Diagram Four - The Production of an Electrical Current</H2>

<P>
To produce commercial quantities of electricity, coils of copper
conductor are grouped in a stationary housing around a spinning
electro-magnet (to intersect the magnet's lines of force). Alternating
electric current is induced into the coils (windings) as the alternate
magnetic fields pass through them. The &quot;shell&quot; of coils
is called a stator. The spinning electro-magnet is the rotor (imagine
a cylinder divided, along its length, into north and south poles).
The combined unit is a generator, sometimes called an alternator.
<P>
The flow of electrons is called the current. The rate of their
movement back and forth (alternating current) is the frequency,
usually expressed in cycles per second (50 in Australia) or &quot;hertz&quot;.
All generators linked to the supply network are synchronised to
a single frequency. This is carefully maintained within one-tenth
of a hertz.
<P>
Electric time is controlled by the system frequency. Minute fluctuations
in frequency are monitored to keep the cumulative variation of
electric time within a maximum of 3 seconds of standard time.
The variation in New South Wales is usually held to about one
and a half seconds.
<P>
Electricity must flow in a circle (circuit) from the generator
back to the generator. This principle is best understood if electricity
is thought of as a fluid, the generator as a pump and the conductor
as a pipeline. If the pipeline is closed off the fluid will not
flow, no matter how powerful the pump. However, if a closed circuit
of pipes is established and say, a &quot;water wheel&quot; incorporated
in the circuit, the fluid will flow and the wheel will turn (i.e.
work will be done using the energy of the moving fluid).
<P>
Diagram Five - Electrical Energy must flow in a circuit to do
work . . .
<P>
Similarly, a light bulb in a electricity circuit will draw energy
for its operation from the flow of electrons in the circuit.
<P>
There are many intermediate steps between a power station generator
and a household light bulb in a commercial electricity undertaking.
<P>
If the conductor is again thought of as a delivery pipeline, the
walls of the pipe would set up a resistance to the passage of
fluid. A long, narrow pipe would create a lot of resistance over
its total length. So it is with electricity through a conductor.
But, rather than use an expensive large conductor, electricity
is boosted to a high pressure to achieve delivery with minimal
losses. This is done in a transformer.
<P>
A transformer has two coils of wire around an iron core. One coil
comes from the generator circuit and magnetises the core. The
second coil, on the other side of the core has more turns (in
a step-up transformer). The electro-magnetic field of the incoming
circuit induces an electric current to flow in the second coil,
but at a higher pressure (voltage) because of the greater number
of turns in the coil (windings). A step-down transformer works
in the reverse way.
<H2>Diagram Six - How a Transformer Works</H2>

<P>
The current handling capacity of a transformer is usually expressed
in kilovolt-amps (kVA) or megavolt-amps (MVA) and is known as
the &quot;rating&quot;.
<P>
Voltage then, is a measure of electrical pressure. Amperage is
the rate of flow (think litres per second in fluid terms) and
wattage is the resultant force of delivery or power, i.e. volts
x amps = watts.
<P>
Power (watts) multiplied by time is energy or the work done by
an electric current. This, in turn, leads to a usage measure of
watt-hours (kilowatt-hours in metering terms). A kilowatt is a
thousand watts. A megawatt is a thousand kilowatts (or a million
watts) and a gigawatt is a million kilowatts. A kilowatt-hour
is a thousand watts of electricity used for one hour, (e.g. a
100 watt light bulb used for ten hours would consume one kilowatt-hour
of electric energy).
<P>
In a normal power supply system then, electricity is generated
at a certain voltage and flows at a certain amperage to a step-up
transformer where the voltage is boosted for efficient long distance
transmission. At the other end of the transmission line the voltage
is reduced in a step-down transformer, usually in a substation,
where the flow is divided and sent in several directions on lower
voltage and amperage &quot;feeders&quot; (transmission lines).
<H2>Diagram Seven - Electricity Generation and Transmission</H2>

<P>
The process is repeated to the final point where, in the case
of Australian systems, a pole-top or local transformer provides
household supply which, in domestic terms, is at 240 volts and
up to 10 amps giving a maximum power point supply of 2400 watts.
If greater quantities of electricity are required, a second &quot;phase&quot;
can be connected to provide supply at 415 volts. (Three phases
are normally used in a major supply system to achieve a more economic
delivery of energy to larger users).
<P>
Direct current does not have the same cyclical flow as alternating
current (i.e. there is no frequency wave) and is ideal where a
smooth and wide range of speed control is required for special
motor driven applications (electric trains are a good example).
However, because direct current cannot be stepped up or down in
voltage by a transformer, a widespread d.c. distribution system
would be very complex and costly. If required, for special situations,
direct current is usually transmitted as a.c. and converted to
d.c. near the point of delivery by a rectifier.
<P>
Substations are, in effect, junction points in the supply system
which incorporate transformers, circuit breakers (i.e. large switches),
capacitors, sometimes rectifiers and other equipment. These are
points where the supply characteristics are changed and redirected.
<P>
Circuit breakers are very big switches often with the special
ability to extinguish the electrical arc associated with the opening
of a high-voltage switch in a circuit carrying a high current.
As well, they are designed to activate automatically and isolate
a section of the network if an abnormal condition is detected.
<P>
Bus-bars are simply common connectors (frequently steel, galvanised
iron or aluminium tube, or stranded copper wire) which link electrical
equipment. They are used extensively in substations and switching
stations.
<P>
Capacitors help improve, in certain &quot;load&quot; conditions,
the amount of energy which can be delivered at a given voltage.
<P>
Static Var Compensators are a sophisticated form of capacitor
with much broader and precise control capabilities.

<H1>MAJOR POWER STATIONS SUPPLYING NEW SOUTH WALES</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
Nearly ninety five percent of the state's electricity needs is
supplied from coal burning power stations.
<P>
The remainder comes from hydro sources, mostly the Snowy Mountains
Scheme.
<P>
(There is a very small, occasional contribution from the Pacific
Power's standby gas-turbine plant).
<P>
Most of the state's power stations are sited close to their fuel
or energy source. Coal-fired stations are near coal bearing areas.
Hydro stations are, of course, near suitable bodies of water.
<H1>BAYSWATER</H1>

<P>
Bayswater Power Station is a coal burning station located about
15 kilometres south east of Muswellbrook in the Upper Hunter Valley,
and some 250 kilometres north of Sydney along the New England
Highway.
<P>
The station was completed in 1987 and has a capacity of 2640 megawatts.
There are four steam driven turbo-generators each with a capacity
of 660 megawatts.
<P>
Bayswater produces over a quarter of the state's electricity needs
and burns about six million tonnes of coal annually. Most coal
is mined nearby using &quot;open cut&quot; techniques. A small
amount comes from underground mines.
<P>
A large proportion of the station's coal needs is delivered by
direct conveyor, reducing the need for costly and environmentally
undesirable road haulage.
<P>
Bayswater has a recirculating cooling water system which relies
on four large concrete cooling towers. Apart from the station's
general domestic consumption, water needs are limited to make-up
supplies only. Make-up water is drawn via the Hunter River from
Glenbawn Dam. Supplementary supplies are pumped over the mountains
into Glenbawn Dam from Pacific Power's own water supply system
on the Barnard River to the north.
<H1>LIDDELL</H1>

<P>
Liddell Power Station is also in the Upper Hunter Valley, a few
kilometres north of Bayswater and on the shores of man-made Lake
Liddell. It shares some of the local power production infrastructure
with its neighbour station.
<P>
Liddell was completed in 1973, has four 500 megawatt steam driven
turbo-generators and is also a major contributor to the state's
power network.
<P>
The station uses about 3 million tonnes of coal annually, delivered
mostly from the same sources as Bayswater and mostly via the same
conveyor network.
<P>
Water for cooling is circulated through the station directly from
Lake Liddell. Cooling towers are not required. Make-up water is
also drawn from the Hunter River.
<H1>ERARING</H1>

<P>
Eraring, another coal burning power station, is on the western
side of Lake Macquarie about 15 kilometres south of Toronto and
is, in most respects, a sister station to Bayswater.
<P>
It has the same generating capacity (2640 megawatts) and almost
identical power plant (4 x 660 MW units) to that of its younger
relation. The most noticeable difference is that Eraring has no
cooling towers. Cooling water is circulated through the station
from Lake Macquarie via a canal and tunnel system.
<P>
Eraring Power Station was completed in 1984 and usually burns
well in excess of 5 million tonnes of coal annually, delivered
to a large extent, by direct conveyor or private road from local
underground mines.
<P>
Make-up fresh water supplies are from the Hunter District Water
Board system.
<H1>VALES POINT</H1>

<P>
The first portion of Vales Point Power Station was the forerunner
of New South Wales power stations with conveyor-linked &quot;captive&quot;
coal mines and was originally built in the early sixties.
<P>
The station is on the southern end of Lake Macquarie about 20
kilometres north of Wyong.
<P>
It now has two modern 660 megawatt turbo-generators. These were
the first to be installed in Australia, and are almost the same
as those at Bayswater and Eraring. Installation of these units
was completed in 1979.
<P>
Vales Point is a significant contributor to the New South Wales
power network. It can burn some 2.5 million tonnes of coal annually,
supplied to a large extent from conveyor linked underground mines.
<P>
Cooling water is circulated via a canal from Lake Macquarie. Fresh
water make-up supplies come from the Wyong water supply system.
<H1>MUNMORAH</H1>

<P>
Munmorah Power Station lies just a few kilometres to the east
of Vales Point and was completed in 1969.
<P>
The station was originally built with a capacity of 1400 megawatts,
but in recent years its four 350 megawatt turbo-generators have
been re-rated to 300 MW and two of them put into storage, giving
the station a current operating capacity of 600 megawatts.
<P>
Munmorah can burn up to 1.5 million tonnes of coal annually. This
is mostly conveyor delivered from nearby underground mines. There
is also a coal conveyor interchange facility with Vales Point.
<P>
The station draws its cooling water from a dedicated canal link
between Lake Munmorah on its northern side and Lake Budgewoi to
the south. Make-up fresh water supplies come from the Wyong water
supply system.
<H1>WALLERAWANG</H1>

<P>
Wallerawang Power Station is on the western coalfields about 15
kilometres west from Lithgow along the Mudgee Road.
<P>
It has two 500 megawatt turbo-generators giving the station an
installed capacity of 1000 MW. These two units were commissioned
in 1976 and 1980.
<P>
Wallerawang draws its coal supplies from nearby underground mines.
The station burns up to 2 million tonnes a year which is delivered
by road transport, mostly over a private road.
<P>
Wallerawang, as an inland station, uses cooling towers for its
circulating water cooling system. Make-up water is drawn from
an adjacent dam which in turn is replenished from Lyell Dam, a
major storage area developed by Pacific Power some 16 kilometres
downstream on the Coxs River to serve both Wallerawang and Mount
Piper Power Station (some 10km to the north).
<H1>MT PIPER</H1>

<P>
Mount Piper Power Station is the western coalfields equivalent
of Bayswater and Eraring power stations, though half the capacity
(1320 megawatts) of its sisters. It is on the Mudgee Road about
25 kilometres north west of Lithgow.
<P>
Mount Piper, a coal burning station, has two 660 MW turbo-generators
of the same type as the northern stations. It can burn about 3
million tonnes of coal each year from nearby underground mines.
<P>
The station has two large concrete cooling towers to cool circulating
water. Make-up water will be drawn from Thompsons Creek Dam and
Lyell Dam on the Coxs River.
<P>
Diagram Eight - Cross-section of a coal-fired power station
<H1>HYDRO POWER STATIONS</H1>

<H2>The Snowy Mountains Scheme</H2>

<P>
The Snowy Scheme supplies most of the five or six percent of hydro
electricity used annually by New South Wales and is by far the
biggest single hydro-electric undertaking in Australia.
<P>
Development of the scheme by the Commonwealth government started
soon after World War II and extended over nearly three decades.
It was planned primarily as an irrigation scheme with secondary
hydro-electricity benefits.
<P>
The scheme has a high generating plant capacity (3740 megawatts)
but is operated on a strictly limited basis. Water release through
the power stations is carefully managed to consider irrigation
requirements. New South Wales is entitled to two-thirds of the
electricity produced by the scheme after a small allowance for
Commonwealth Government use. Victoria gets one third.
<P>
There are seven power stations in the Snowy Mountains,
<P>
Tumut 1 (4 x 80 MW units),
<P>
Tumut 2 (4 x 70 MW),
<P>
Murray 1 (10 x 95 MW),
<P>
Murray 2 (4 x 137.5 MW),
<P>
Blowering (1 x 80 MW),
<ADDRESS>
Guthega (2 x 30 MW). 
</ADDRESS>

<P>
Tumut 3 is the biggest with six 250 MW turbo-generators. Three
of these generators can also operate as pumps to send water uphill
in those night periods when low cost electricity is available.
In the day time the water is then used again to generate electricity
avoiding the use of higher cost generators.
<P>
The great advantage of the scheme is that it can supply New South
Wales and Victoria with large amounts of electricity for short
periods of time, vital in coping with emergencies and daily peak
demands.
<P>
A further advantage is that hydro plant can be producing at full
capacity within minutes of start-up. Thermal plant must undergo
a warm-up period of many hours.
<P>
The Snowy Scheme is, thus, an ideal complementary contributor
to the New South Wales supply network.
<P>
Other NSW hydro stations
<P>
Pacific Power has a number of small hydro power stations in its
system, all with the same limitations and advantages as the Snowy
Scheme.
<P>
There are stations at:
<P>
Kangaroo Valley (2 x 80 MW units),
<P>
Warragamba (1 x 50 MW),
<ADDRESS>
Hume, near Albury (2 x 25 MW) shared with Victoria, 
</ADDRESS>

<P>
Burrinjuck (2 x 5 MW),
<ADDRESS>
Keepit, near Gunnedah (1 x 6 MW) and 
</ADDRESS>

<P>
Brown Mountain, near Bega (4 MW).
<P>
Other small privately-owned hydro stations are being developed
in some areas where suitable water resources are available.
<P>
Diagram Nine - Cross-section of a hydro power station

GAS-TURBINE STATIONS

National Electricity Statistics
<P>
Australia uses upward of 130 000 gigawatt hours (130 000 million
kilowatt hours) of electrical energy each year to power its industries,
and its commercial, domestic and rural sectors.
<P>
The following graph compares state by state consumption of electricity
and shows the proportion which is produced from coal, water, natural
gas or other basic energy sources (left column of each state group).
The Australian Capital Territory is supplied through the NSW system.
<P>
The adjoining right-hand column for each state group shows the
quantity of black or brown coal burned by the particular state
for electricity generation. Brown coal (Victoria, South Australia)
has a lower heat energy content than black coal, so it takes more
brown coal than black coal to produce a kilowatt hour of electricity.

<HR>
<H3> UNDERSTANDING THE &quot;GREENHOUSE&quot; PROBLEM</H3>
<HR>

<H4>THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT . . .</H4>

<P>
It is beyond any doubt that:
<UL>
<LI>the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have
increased over recent years and are still increasing.
<LI>the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases will have
some effect on the earth's climate.
</UL>

<P>
. . . WHAT IS IT?
<P>
The earth, and all other bodies in our solar system, are exposed
to radiation from the sun. During the day, this radiation heats
the surface of the planet.
<P>
At all times, but more noticeably during the night, the planet
re-radiates energy back into space and this causes a drop in temperature
on earth.
<P>
Large variations in temperature do not occur because a blanket
of GREENHOUSE GASES mainly trap a lot of this re-radiated energy.
<P>
Without this &quot;Greenhouse Effect&quot; the average temperature
on earth would be about -18 degrees celsius compared with a present
average of +15 degrees celsius and life on earth, as we know it,
would not exist.
<P>
The Greenhouse Effect is essential to our very existence, but
like all things, too much of a good thing is dangerous.
<P>
The concern about the Greenhouse Effect relates to an increase
in the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which are,
in effect, closing the &quot;window&quot; for the outgoing radiation.
This then causes an increase in the average temperature of the
earth which, in turn, will lead to climatic changes.
<P>
The principal greenhouse gases are:
<MENU>
<LI>Water vapour
<LI>Carbon dioxide
<LI>Methane
<LI>Nitrous oxide
<LI>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's)
<LI>Ozone
</MENU>

<P>

<P>
THE CAUSES
<P>
Fundamentally, the increase in each of these greenhouse gases
is caused by an increasing population working towards an increasing
standard of living.
<P>
Fifty years ago the world's population was about 2 billion - now
it is 5 billion. We are living longer and consuming more.
<P>
By the year 2000 the population will probably exceed 8 billion.
<P>
When searching for a solution to the greenhouse problem it is
pertinent to examine the activities of man which contribute to
the problem. They are:
<UL>
<LI>Release of methane and nitrous oxide from agriculture.
<LI>Deforestation.
<LI>Burning of fuel for transport.
<LI>Release of CFC's from refrigerators.
<LI>Urban pollution.
<LI>Burning of coal.
<LI>Burning of gas.
</UL>

<P>
Some of these activities are necessary to support the worlds population
and the quest for an improved standard of living as we know it.
<P>
We should remember that the Greenhouse problem has no geographical
or political boundaries. We all contribute to the problem (although
to differing degrees) and none of us are insulated from its consequences.
<H1>HOW DO WE COMBAT THE PROBLEM?</H1>

<P>
There are fundamentally three choices:
<UL>
<LI>do nothing
<LI>plan to adapt to the likely climate change
<LI>initiate preventative actions to slow the rate of change
</UL>

<P>
The &quot;do nothing option&quot; means, just ignore the problem
and hope that it will go away.
<P>
This option hardly bears consideration.
<P>
The second option &quot;plan to adapt&quot;, has some attraction,
but the question is ADAPT TO WHAT? Despite the lack of precision
in trying to forecast the future climate, wherever the costs are
not excessive, our planning should recognise the likely climate
changes due to the Greenhouse Effect.
<P>
The third option is to initiate reduction or mitigating strategies.

</PRE>

<H1>WHAT MITIGATION MEASURES ARE BEING CONSIDERED?</H1>

<H2>Agriculture</H2>

<P>
Scientists, recognising that domestic animals produce 20% of all
methane, are experimenting with special diets which, it is hoped,
will result in a reduction of methane from this source.
<H2>Deforestation</H2>

<P>
There has been a lot of debate on the contribution of deforestation
to emissions of carbon dioxide and methane, with special attention
to the vast areas of land being cleared in South America.
<H2>Release of CFC's</H2>

<P>
In the 1987 Montreal protocol, the signatory countries, of which
there are now 52, agreed to try to reduce tha amount of CFC's
released into the atmosphere by 50% by the end of the century.
<H2>Burning of Fossil Fuels</H2>

<P>
This area is seen to be the area of human activity most amenable
to change. The reasons for concentrating on the burning of fossil
fuels are:
<UL>
<LI>the burning of fossil fuels represents about 50% of the addition
to the greenhouse effect.
<LI>population pressures will not allow the agricultural sources
to be considered as vigorously.
<LI>fossil fuel use is linked with other environmental problems
eg. acid rain in Europe and North America, and ozone in urban
atmospheres.
<LI>in Australia, 27% of the total energy consumption is associated
with transport of which 77% is for road transport.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
GREENHOUSE AND THE ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY
<H2>Where does Australia fit into this scene?</H2>

<P>
On a per capita basis, Australia is the fifth highest contributor
of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion. 
<P>
However, in terms of total carbon dioxide emissions,our contribution
is very small.
<P>
The whole of Australia contributes 1.3% of the total carbon dioxide
generated world wide. The NSW share
<P>
is 0.4% while the NSW electricity industry contributes 0.2%.
<P>

Fossil Fuels

<P>
USSR    19.0
<P>

<P>
Japan     4.7
<P>

<P>
Australia     1.3
<P>
Netherlands    0.8
<P>
Belgium     0.6
<P>
--------------------------------------------------------------
<H1>ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY MITIGATION ALTERNATIVES</H1>

<P>
Although the contribution of electricity to the overall greenhouse
effect is a small proportion of the total, the industry is actively
looking at ways in which it can reduce this contribution.
<H2>Carbon dioxide Removal</H2>

<P>
Firstly, the carbon dioxide could be removed by planting sufficient
trees to absorb it.
<P>
It would require 2 million hectares of rapidly growing vegetation
(trees) to remove the carbon dioxide generated by the power stations
in NSW. But, once the trees mature they no longer absorb carbon
dioxide and will need to be replaced. But the mature trees can
neither be burned since that will generate carbon dioxide nor
left to rot since, even worse, they will generate methane. They
must either be used for building or alternately buried so the
carbon is locked up.
<P>
Alternatively, it is technically feasible to remove carbon dioxide
from power station exhaust gases, however it is estimated this
would more than double the cost of electricity and create additional
environmental problems.
<H2>Energy Efficiency and Demand Management</H2>

<P>
The amount of carbon dioxide released is directly related to the
amount of electricity generated and so energy efficiency and conservation
are an effective means of reducing the greenhouse effect.
<P>
There are a number of ways that this could be introduced:
<UL>
<LI>Public campaigns
<LI>Electricity pricing strategies
<LI>Promoting energy efficiency at the point of end use
<LI>Promoting energy efficiency in generation and transmission
</UL>

<H2>Higher Efficiency Generating Plant</H2>

<P>
Natural gas-fired turbines produce 30% less carbon dioxide per
kWh than the equivalent coal fired plant and so, from the greenhouse
point of view, there is a definite advantage in using gas turbines
for electricity generation.
<P>
With the use of combined cycle plant, where gas turbine exhaust
gases are used to raise steam for a conventional turbine, the
reduction in carbon dioxide is about 50%.
<H2>Cogeneration</H2>

<P>
The combined production of heat and power by industry can provide
energy efficiencies of 70% to 80% - twice that of coal-fired power
stations.
<H2>Renewable Energies</H2>

<P>
About 5% of the energy sold by Pacific Power comes from renewable
sources - mainly hydro. But the real issue is - can we expand
the use of renewable energy sources and thus reduce our emission
of carbon dioxide?
<P>
Lets look at the various alternatives:
<P>
Hydro - There is a possibility of developing
<P>
around 300MW of additional hydro plant in
<P>
NSW. A number of small hydro projects are
<P>
being pursued. Larger projects have been
<P>
studied but are considered environmentally
<P>
sensitive.
<P>
Wind - This form of generation will have a role to
<P>
play in providing electricity for the NSW
<P>
system in the future.
<P>
Wind turbines of 300kW capacity are considered
<P>
viable for commercial wind farms of 5-10MW.
<P>
Such wind farms in appropriate locations would
<P>
occupy about 3-4 sq. kms of land and provide
<P>
power at about twice the current cost of coal-
<P>
fired power stations.
<P>
Solar - There are presently two methods of generating
<P>
electricity from solar energy:
<UL>
<LI>SOLAR CELLS (photovoltaic) where electricity is generated
from solar energy. The cost of energy from such a system is at
least five times the cost of energy from coal fired stations.
<LI>SOLAR THERMAL CONVERSION where solar energy is used to heat
an intermediate fluid which is then, in turn, used to power a
heat engine. This has been demonstrated in facilities of up to
30MW in California and requires very large areas of land. Alternatively,
solar thermal systems may have greater potential as domestic installations
for hot water and space heating requirements.
</UL>

<P>
Tidal - There is little or no opportunity to utilise
<P>
tidal power in NSW.
<H3>Wave Power -</H3>

<P>
It is unlikely that wave power could be a viable option in NSW.
However, Pacific Power is currently assessing this technology
with a view to carrying out a survey of prospective sites.
<P>
Biomass - Biomass consumption (ie. the burning of wood or
<P>
the conversion of biomass into an intermediate fuel such as ethanol)
is often cited as a means of limiting the emission of carbon dioxide
and may be a viable option in some cases.
<P>
Nuclear - Development of nuclear energy is expensive and
<P>
presently prohibited in NSW by law. Pacific Power is maintaining
a watching brief on nuclear power.
<H3>Methane Drainage -</H3>

<P>
In addition to the methane generated by agricultural pursuits,
methane is also emitted from coal mines and municipal waste dumps.
Electricity generation using this fuel is the focus of a number
of current initiatives in New South Wales.
<H1>PACIFIC POWER INITIATIVES</H1>

<UL>
<LI>studies to measure the level of community awareness about
greenhouse and to assess the cost the community would be prepared
to pay in social and economic terms to reduce the emissions of
greenhouse gases.
<LI>scenario planning to analyse the consequences and our possible
responses to limits being placed on carbon dioxide, either by
way of taxes or by legislation.
<LI>provision of speakers to explain the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;
and to listen to the opinions of customers and the general public.
<LI>sponsorship of research into climate modelling and other greenhouse
issues.
<LI>studies of wave energy resources in New South Wales
<LI>support for research into solar energy
<LI>support for research into electric vehicles and mobile batteries
<LI>planning for the development of gas turbine and combined cycle

<H4>The Greenhouse Effect - Part 1 (18 minutes)</H4>

<P>
The phenomenon known as the Greenhouse Effect has been around
since the earth was formed.
<H2>Why is the Greenhouse Effect such a concern today?</H2>

<P>
The naturally occurring gases that make up the earth's atmosphere
are essential for life. Some also play a role in trapping the
heat radiated from the earth's surface and help to maintain the
temperature at a pleasant 15 degrees celsius.
<P>
This video programme helps you understand what the Greenhouse
Effect is and what causes it.
<P>
It tells the story of how mankind's increasing numbers, development
and industrialisation have affected the natural balance that existed.
<P>
Greenhouse: Some Options - Part 2 (22 minutes)
<P>
The Greenhouse Effect is a natural phenomenon.
<P>
But in the 20th century the population of the earth has expanded
dramatically.
<P>
Many scientists believe that development and industrialisation
have begun to effect the natural balance!
<P>
This video looks at what the effects of global warming might mean
for the human race and the environment in which we live.
<P>
More importantly, it looks at some of the actions we can take
to try and tackle the prblems.
<P>
The important thing to remember is that looking after the environment
is everyone's responsibility, adn we should all be aware of the
options that are open to us.
<P>
Understanding the costs, benefits and implications of reducing
Greenhouse emissions is the first step in dealing with the problem.
<P>
Only then can informed decisions be made.

<H3>ENERGY SOURCES FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION</H3>

<P>
In many cases, primary energy sources are not of a form suitable
for the immediate needs of our community. Instead they have to
be converted once or twice before they are in a form more suitable
to their intended use. For the sake of simplicity the sources
providing such primary energy are themselves referred to as primary
energy sources. They include:
<MENU>
<LI>. coal
<LI>. petroleum
<LI>. natural gas
<LI>. uranium
<LI>. renewable energy sources
</MENU>

<P>
From these primary energy sources, conversion to more desirable
energy forms can be performed. Each step in the conversion process
involves losses, or more correctly, production of waste energy
and by-products. The most common form of waste energy being heat.
<P>
The efficiency of conversion processes is therefore, always less
than 100%. Typical efficiency values are:
<H4>. 99.9% for a transformer;</H4>

<P>
. 90% for an electric motor;
<P>
. 37% for electricity generated by modern coal-fired power stations;
<P>
. 14% for electricity generated by crystalline silicon solar cells.
<P>
There are a number of energy sources receiving significant attention
in the development of cheaper, more efficient and environmentally
friendly power generation technologies for the future. These energy
sources include wastes, as well as by-products from various activities
(such as coal washeries, domestic garbage, scrap tyres) and are
only recently being identified as possible competitors to our
more traditional fuels of coal, oil and gas.
<P>
As well as this, 'renewable' energy sources such as wind, solar,
wave and others are receiving a great deal of attention. The development
of technologies to harness these energies are already progressing
rapidly with many developments already proving to be economically
competitive with our more traditional forms of power generation
such as that produced from fossil fuels.
<H5>1.1 Coal</H5>

<P>
Australia is currently the world's leading exporter of coal, a
primary energy source, with exports of some 120 million tonnes
in 1991. Australia's main black coal production (95%) is located
in New South Wales and Queensland whilst production of brown coal
is carried out extensively in Victoria and South Australia.
<P>
Figure 1.1 - Coal Resources in Australia.
<P>
Australia's known, as well as inferred black coal resource is
estimated to be in excess of 550 billion tonnes with some 51 billion
tonnes considered to be economically recoverable.
<P>
Electricity in mainland Australia is predominantly produced by
coal-fired power stations and of the total installed capacity
of 33,900 MW, some 19,000 MW are fuelled by black coal (using
approximately 37.5 million tonnes per annum). Achieving more efficient
and environmentally friendly processes, is a major aim of the
electricity industry and research organisations in Australia.
Pacific Power is becoming increasingly involved in the development
and adaptation of these technologies to the Australian situation.
<P>
Alternative coal based technologies are an important consideration
in the overall assessment of future options for power generation.
They are being assessed with a broad range of renewable and non-renewable
technologies such as conventional coal-fired power stations, gas
turbines, wind and solar, as options for future power supplies
to New South Wales. These alternative coal based technologies
include:
<UL>
<LI>Fluidised Bed Combustors
<LI>Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle
<LI>Coal Gasification for Fuel Cells
<LI>Ultra Clean Coal and Clean Coal Engines
<LI>Coal Bed Methane
</UL>

<H5>1.2 Natural Gas</H5>

<P>
Natural gas was initially associated with the discovery of petroleum
oil in Australia. At the time it was of low value but subsequent
developments in the gas industry have led to gas becoming a major
fuel in Australia. Gas is now searched for in its own right, and
is still found during exploration for oil. Apart from the Bass
Strait oil and gas fields, other natural gas reserves are generally
found in remote locations considerable distance from the population
centres where the largest markets for gas exist. Due to the necessity
of long and costly pipelines for transporting gas from these distant
locations, it has taken a number of years for the gas supply infrastructure
to become developed. Gas pipelines now supply gas to all capital
cities and most other major centres of population. Natural gas
is also exported from the North West Shelf project as liquefied
natural gas (LNG) to Japan, where it is used by gas utilities
and as fuel in power generation.
<P>
The term &quot;natural gas&quot; describes the naturally occurring
mixture of gases found in gas deposits. However like other &quot;natural&quot;
products it is not used in the &quot;as found&quot; state. The
constituents of natural gas vary considerably from well to well.
Often natural gas contains large quantities of liquids and heavy
gases as well as significant quantities of carbon dioxide and
moisture. The petroleum based liquids, and gases such as propane,
are separated and recovered for separate sale as oil and liquid
petroleum gas (LPG). Ethane, a feed stock for petrochemical plants,
is also removed and stored. At the Cooper Basin gas field which
supplies New South Wales and South Australia, the ethane is stored
underground in depleted gas wells. Processing of natural gas is
carried out at the gas field before transportation by pipeline.
After processing, the main constituent of natural gas is methane
(refer to Figure 1.2). Natural gas is a high quality fuel and
produces low emissions and significantly less carbon dioxide than
other fossil fuels per unit of energy consumed.
<P>
Figure 1.2 - Natural Gas Composition.
<H3>Gas Fields and Reserves</H3>

<P>
Australia has several gas fields containing economically recoverable
reserves of gas. The major fields are, off the coast of Western
Australia (North West Shelf), off Southern Victoria (Bass Strait),
on-shore in Central Australia and in South West Queensland.
<P>
Figure 1.3 - Gas Resources.
<P>
Gas resources are classified by the certainty of the quantities
present and the commercial viability of production. In Australia,
gas resources that have been declared commercial were estimated
at 36,300 PJ as of December 1989, whilst recoverable but not yet
declared commercial reserves, were 80,900 PJ. By comparison, the
current rate of gas usage in Australia is approximately 550 PJ
per year. A further 200 PJ year is exported to Japan as LNG. The
location of approximately 82% of the total gas resource is off
the west coast of Western Australia.
<P>
When the gas resources supplying NSW, Victoria and South Australia
become depleted (possibly around the year 2015) it has been proposed
that a transcontinental pipeline connecting the northwest Australian
gas resources to the south east pipe grid be constructed. There
are estimated to be more than 100 years gas supply in the North
West Shelf based on current consumption in Australia.
<H3>Gas Supply to NSW</H3>

<P>
Gas is supplied to NSW from the Cooper Basin in South Australia.
Gas is also supplied to South Australia from this basin. The gas
is processed at Moomba and transported by pipeline to Sydney with
branch pipelines to Wagga Wagga, Canberra, Bathurst, Orange and
Lithgow. The Pipeline Authority, a Federal government statutory
body, operates and maintains the Moomba-Sydney pipeline and charges
for carriage of the gas.
<P>
AGL Gas Companies currently distribute the majority of natural
gas to NSW. AGL also owns and operates gas distribution pipelines
to Newcastle and Wollongong.
<P>
Albury is supplied with gas from Bass Strait via the pipe grid
in Victoria.
<H3>LNG for Supply During Peak Periods</H3>

<P>
Natural Gas can be liquefied in large quantities in insulated
tanks at atmospheric pressure. The temperature of the gas needs
to be reduced to -160 degrees Celsius in order for it to be stored
as a liquid at this pressure. When the stored gas is to be used,
it is vaporised and can then be fed to a gas distribution network.
A 20,000 tonne tank of LNG would be able to supply gas turbines
for instance of 400 MW(e) capacity for around 200 hours of operation.
<H5>1.3 Methane From Coal Seams</H5>

<H6>1.3.1 Coalbed Methane</H6>

<P>
Most coal seams contain quantities of gas, commonly methane, locked
within pores and tiny fractures in the coal. In some locations,
the quantities of methane present can constitute a major fuel
resource. For example, the Sydney Geological Basin is estimated
by Pacific Power geologists to contain gas resources comparable
in size to those in established gas fields such as the Gippsland
and Cooper Basins.
<P>
Methane is extracted from the coal seams by means of wells sunk
from the surface down to the coal. The coal seam around the hole
is fractured using water pumped down the hole at very high pressure.
Sand is injected into these fractures so that they remain open
after the water pressure is released. Methane can then seep into
these fractures and be collected at the surface for use as a fuel
source.
<H3>Figure 1.4 - Coalbed Methane</H3>

<P>
Large projects that already operate in the United States produce
coalbed methane from the Warrior Basin in Alabama and the San
Juan Basin in Colorado. Total investment in these projects will
exceed $3 billion in 1991 and current production exceeds 270 PJ
per annum.
<P>
The physical parameters that control the existence and productivity
of coalbed methane can vary from one coalfield to another and
hence the technology, for its removal is site specific. Pacific
Power is currently conducting investigations into the feasibility
and economic viability of coal bed methane technology in the coalfields
of NSW. Pacific Power has sought the advice of experts with experience
in production fields in the USA and is working in co-operation
with the CSIRO which has a series of major coalbed methane R&amp;D
projects in place.
<P>
In addition, a program of coalbed methane exploration and assessment
has commenced. Pacific Power has held rights to explore for all
forms of gas in parts of the Sydney Geological Basin including
the Hunter Valley and along the coastal strip around Sydney and
Wyong. It is expected that the investigations will take some three
to five years to complete.
<H3>Figure 1.5 - Potential Coalbed Methane Production Areas</H3>

<H6>1.3.2 Methane Drainage During Mining Operations</H6>

<P>
Coal seams often contain gas which during mining operations must
be continually removed for safety reasons. The quantity of methane
present in the coal seam gas can vary greatly from one location
to another. Methane quantity also varies with changing properties
of the coal seam, including coal rank and surrounding geological
strata. As a coal seam is progressively mined, methane is released
from the 'relaxing' coal seam and surrounding layers of strata.
This methane is then collected from a series of boreholes and
vents before being vented to atmosphere, 'flared' or collected
for other purposes.
<P>
In some instances this gas can be of sufficient quality and quantity
to fuel gas turbine power stations or other furnace heating equipment.
As the gas must be removed for safety reasons the actual cost
of gas to a consumer is quite low, hence making it competitive
with other fuel sources for a variety of uses.
<P>
A typical composition for this gas would be:
<P>
At the coal face - methane 63%
<P>
carbon dioxide 7%
<P>
Bore holes preceding - methane 90%
<P>
the coal face carbon dioxide 10%
<P>
Impurities in the gas and the current high cost of removing these
impurities prevents the transport of the gas on the existing network
of gas pipelines which currently supply the state of NSW with
natural gas.
<P>
A number of privately owned power generation projects successfully
operate using gas produced from mining operations. These facilities
operate on the escarpment between Sydney and Wollongong.
<H5>1.4 Coal Washery Wastes</H5>

<P>
Coal washery facilities operate at select mining locations in
order to remove inert materials (ash) present in coal. The material
removed from the coal during the washing process is known as the
washery waste and because of its high ash and low energy characteristics
is not economic to be used as a fuel in conventional power stations.
Separation of ash from coal by physical processes is achieved
by firstly reducing the size of coal extracted from the mine to
the point where most of the coal and ash are liberated from each
other. The coal and ash can then be more easily separated on the
basis of their different physical properties for example their
specific gravity. Washery wastes can be divided into two groups;
course rejects and tailings, in a ratio of approximately 2:1 respectively.
<P>
The waste material produced by 'washing' can contain sufficient
combustible material to be of use in more recently developed combustion
boilers. The attractiveness of washery waste as a fuel, is its
'zero' and in some cases 'negative' cost, the abundance of washery
wastes produced by the State's coal mining industry, and the improved
'handlability' and storage of the waste material once the combustible
material has been burnt off.
<P>
Washery wastes, on average can contain between 30% and 40% of
the specific energy content of coal on a dry basis; more for tailings
and less for coarse rejects.
<P>
A technology receiving a great deal of attention worldwide, is
that of the fluidized bed combustor (refer to Section 2.1) of
which various types have already been developed. In particular,
this technology is suitable for the burning of washery wastes
and other low energy fuels, whilst also having environmental benefits.
This technology is already leading us toward a new generation
in power station development.
<P>
In a second edition report prepared in July, 1991 by Ecogen Pty
Ltd for the Department of Minerals &amp; Energy, the following
electricity generation potential was identified.

<P>
Generation Capacity (MW(e)) 1,500 2,200 3,600
<H5>1.5 Nuclear Fuels</H5>

<P>
Naturally occurring uranium consists primarily of uranium 238
and about 1% uranium 235. The numbers 238 and 235 refer to the
atomic masses of the two isotopes of uranium.
<P>
In practice the only elements which can fuel the fission reaction
in a nuclear reactor are uranium 235, uranium 233 and plutonium
239. Of these only uranium 235 is naturally occurring.
<P>
In a nuclear power station 1 kg of uranium 235 produces the same
amount of energy as 3000 tonnes of coal or an equivalent 7.5 million
kWh.
<P>
The potential environmental hazards of nuclear power are well
documented, however, the contribution of nuclear power to the
greenhouse effect is negligible when compared with fossil fuel
power generation. When developing scenarios to meet carbon dioxide
reduction targets (such as that set during the 1988 Toronto conference
of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20% of 1988 levels), nuclear
power can contribute significantly to the reductions required.
Electricity production from nuclear energy is prohibited in New
South Wales, under the &quot;Uranium Mining and Nuclear Facilities
(Prohibitions) Act, 1986, No. 194&quot;.
<H3>Enriched Uranium</H3>

<P>
Most nuclear power stations are fuelled by enriched uranium. The
enriching process increases the uranium 235 content of uranium
to about 3%, and it requires 5.5 kg of natural uranium to produce
1 kg of enriched uranium. Uranium ore, more commonly known as
yellowcake, is the raw material used to produce the 'enriched'
uranium. The uranium ore is first converted to gaseous uranium
hexafluoride which is then enriched by one of two processes, centrifuging
or diffusion. The uranium isotopes 235 and 238 are partially separated
in this process because of their different atomic mass. Diffusion
separation plants in the USA, France and the USSR provide for
90% of the world's isotope separation requirements.
<H5>1.6 Renewable Energy</H5>

<P>
Renewable energy sources are those which are effectively or potentially
infinite. They are generally non-polluting energy resources and
often mean 'zero' fuel cost. They depend on energy from the sun
or other natural sources.
<P>
There are two broad categories of renewable energy technologies.
Those which are well established such as hydroelectric energy,
and those which are new technologies and are developing rapidly
world-wide.

<LI>Pacific Power actively supports the development of renewable
energy technologies. These technologies are becoming increasingly
competitive with conventional power generation whilst also offering
certain other advantages such as reducing carbon dioxide emissions
as well as other atmospheric pollutants. Renewables are of particular
interest as power supplies for remote areas. Pacific Power is
supporting research and development projects in wind energy, solar
photovoltaics and solar thermal, as well as having completed a
study in wave energy.

<H5>Introduction</H5>

<P>
Developments in power station technology in the past have focused
mainly on improving the overall economics of the industry. This
on the one hand has led to an increase in the size of power station
machines in order to reduce the specific cost of construction
and operation per unit energy produced. Coal-fired power stations,
which play the most important role in the generation of electricity
in most industrialised countries, commonly operate with outputs
of around 500-800 MW(e) per machine of which multiples of 2, 4
or 6 are most often constructed. On the other hand, it is increasingly
important to maintain generating capacity whilst reducing the
amount of fuel being consumed through efficiency measures.
<P>
The efficiency of large coal-fired steam cycle power stations
with an output of 660 MW(e) is now 35-37% (HHV higher heating
valve). Reaching 38% or even 40%, the most recent power stations
are now approaching the limit in both technical and economic terms.
The steam driving the turbine in this case has a temperature of
about 540 degrees Celsius, and pressure of around 16 MPa. Any
further increase in temperature or pressure would improve efficiency
only slightly but would result in a disproportionate increase
in costs to build such facilities.
<P>
In the following sections, new and alternative technologies which
utilise 'non-renewable' energy sources are discussed. Development
of all of these technologies are well under way worldwide, with
many technologies already seeing commercial returns. The high
efficiency of these new processes is one of the major driving
forces in their development and with efficiencies of greater than
50% expected, as well as excellent environmental control, more
and more of these installations are finding application in today's
energy markets.
<MENU>
<LI>2.1 Fluidised Bed Combustors (FBC)
<LI>2.1.1 Introduction
<LI>Fluidised bed combustion is a technology developed for the
combustion of a wide range of variable quality fuels and wastes.
The fluidised bed can be fuelled with low quality coals through
to washery wastes and sewage sludge, wastes from municipal dumps
and even used scrap tyres. Materials which have typically been
viewed only as wastes, in the past, and for which large disposal
projects have been implemented, may in the near future be providing
us with a cheap, useful source of energy for conversion to electricity.
<LI>The fluidised bed, Figure 2.1, is essentially a holding vessel
containing a mixture of predominantly inert material. The composition
of material in the bed can consist of up to 99% non-combustible
material, mainly ash and limestone, the limestone providing an
important advantage in pollution control. The 'mixed' bed is supported
by a uniformly perforated base plate through which air is supplied
for two main purposes:
</MENU>

<P>
. as a source of oxygen for combustion in the bed;
<P>
. as the fluidizing agent by effectively lifting the
<P>
bed at a minimum air velocity (known as the
<P>
fluidizing velocity) and hence thoroughly mixing the
<P>
fuel and inert materials as though they were fluids. This
<P>
provides intimate contact of fuel and oxygen and ensures
<P>
efficient combustion.
<P>
A bed consists of about 1% coal (up to a maximum of 3%) and 99%
glowing ash and additives. Even when the fuel used is of very
inferior quality, this large volume of red-hot material (reaching
temperatures of up to 850 degrees Celsius) ensures stable and
uniform ignition for as long as fluidised air is supplied to the
unit. Yet another benefit is that fluidised bed combustors do
not involve any slag formation even when high-ash coal is being
burnt, since the ash components neither melt nor sinter in the
relatively low temperatures prevailing in the bed. This is particularly
important where the ash fusion temperature is relatively low and
if used in conventional combustion systems would cause 'slagging'
and 'fouling' of boiler tubes in the higher temperature furnace.
<P>
Although the fluidised bed can utilise a broad range of fuel types,
this is not the only benefit to be gained from implementing this
technology for power generation. The environmental benefits of
a fluidised bed combustor are also significant.
<P>
Environmentally a fluidised bed combustor allows the operator
to maintain levels of atmospheric pollutants, sulphur dioxide
and oxides of nitrogen at low levels well within emission limits.
When fuel to be combusted, by nature, contains impurities which
will produce these pollutants in conventional combustion systems,
fluidised bed combustion can be employed as an alternative to
avoid:
<P>
. the high cost of installing additional, special
<P>
equipment for their removal;
<P>
. the cost associated with a reduction in overall
<P>
plant efficiency normally associated with pollution
<P>
control systems; and
<P>
. overall, a more complicated process.
<P>
This in turn should reduce the overall cost of the electricity
produced and hence the cost being passed onto consumers.
<P>
Removal of sulphur originating in the fuel which would otherwise
be oxidised to sulphur dioxide, is achieved by the addition of
limestone to the bed. As the bed operates at temperatures in the
region of 700-850 degrees Celsius, limestone ensures optimum binding
of the sulphur present. More than 95% of sulphur is removed in
this way.
<P>
Combustion temperatures of less than 850 degrees Celsius in the
bed also aids in reducing the amount of oxides of nitrogen formation
to lower levels. Conventional coal fired power stations operate
with temperatures typically in the range 1400-1500 degrees Celsius.
In this temperature range oxides of nitrogen is readily formed
from organic nitrogen within the coal as well as atmospheric nitrogen,
and hence methods must be employed for its control e.g. 'low oxides
of nitrogen' burners. The oxides of nitrogen level from a fluidised
bed combustor is typically reduced by 75% below that of an equivalent
size pulverised coal-fired boiler.
<P>
Figure 2.1 - Fluidised Bed Combustor (FBC)
<MENU>
<LI>2.1.2 Atmospheric Fluidised Bed Combustor (AFBC)
<LI>The most basic design of the fluidised bed is known as the
atmospheric fluidised bed. Heat is transferred from the fuel combustion
to steam tubes submerged within the bed as well as in the flue
gas pass. Because of the intimate contact between the tubes and
the bed, heat transfer is up to five times greater than that which
occurs with the exiting flue gas. The steam generated in the tubes
is then used to drive a steam turbine and generator for the production
of electricity. Typically these facilities can be constructed
up to 60 MW(e) in size.
<LI>The minimum velocity of fluidising air (this also being the
combustion air) is of the order of 0.8-1.0 m/s with the maximum
being about 3 m/s. At low load, the bed is designed such that
steam tubes become exposed (ie. the bed shrinks) and heat transfer
from the bed is reduced. At high load, high velocity, the bed
increases in height hence covering the tubes and increasing steam
production. If the bed is completely shut down, steam tubes are
fully exposed and the combustion is smothered. In this situation,
the mass of the bed retains its heat for several hours allowing
easy start up when desired.
<LI>The state of the art today is a further development of the
atmospheric fluidised bed to a circulating process in order to
improve the efficiency of combustion and reduce gaseous emissions.
<LI>2.1.3 Circulating Fluidised Bed Combustor (CFBC)
<LI>In the circulating fluidised bed the flue gas moves at speeds
of 5-8 m/s carrying with it tons of silica sand, lime and ash
up the roughly 40 m high combustion chamber, together with the
coal (or whichever fuel is being employed). This material which
is carried along with the gas stream is separated in a cyclone.
Inside the cyclone the gas is forced into a swirling motion, throwing
solid particles to the outside walls of the cone shaped collection
unit. The solids are delivered to a hopper to be returned to the
combustion chamber. The recirculation of fly ash has a positive
influence on the process by improving overall combustion efficiency
(over 99% carbon burnout for all fuels), better utilisation of
the limestone in absorbing sulphur dioxide and by cooling the
fluidised bed by up to 50 degrees Celsius. Reducing the temperature
by this amount helps to maintain optimum sulphur removal.
<LI>The operation of a fluidised bed with circulation reduces
sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions even further
when compared to atmospheric fluidised beds. The rigorous circulation
in the bed promotes intimate contact of sulphur compounds with
limestone. This ensures high retention of sulphur irrespective
of the quality of fuel. Typical gas temperatures of 850 degrees
Celsius as well as 'staged' combustion maintains oxides of nitrogen
levels within acceptable limits. It also avoids the need to install
steam tubes inside the fluidised bed (these tubes accept heat
predominantly by conduction), since convectional heat transfer
is increased by the high volume of combustion products flowing
through the back pass of the boiler. In-bed tubes in the atmospheric
bed are subject to substantial erosion.
<LI>The circulating fluidised bed process was developed by a European
engineering company - Lurgi. The first industrial application
of their technology using coal, being in Luenen, West Germany
in 1982. This particular facility has a thermal capacity of 84
MW, burning coal washery wastes with a moisture content of up
to 65% and a sulphur content of 2%. The plant generates process
steam as well as electric power for a nearby aluminium oxide plant.
Other circulating fluidised bed installations include 67 MW electrical
with a simultaneous 138 MW of steam for district heating at Duisburg,
West Germany, 39 MW electrical and 109 MW of steam for district
heating at Flensburg, West Germany, as well as numerous demonstration
facilities, and plants under construction.
<LI>Circulating fluidised beds should be able, in the near future
to provide an electricity output of up to 200 MW(e). Part loads
down to 30% of the rated capacity can be catered for with a load
changing capability of 5% per minute.
<LI>Inherent disadvantages of the circulating fluidised bed technology
include the high auxiliary power requirement for the circulation
of bed material, as well as, erosion problems from ash carried
along in the flue gas. In this technology these disadvantages
are more pronounced than the other fluidised bed technologies.
<LI>Integration of the atmospheric bed technology with that of
the 'circulating' bed, has led to the development of the so-called
'circofluid' technology. This new development will combine the
advantages of the atmospheric bed, such as short start-up and
shut down times, low auxiliary power requirement and low investment
with the advantages of the 'circulating' bed which include, high
combustion efficiency, as well as reduced sulphur dioxide and
oxides of nitrogen emissions.
<LI>Figure 2.2 - Circulating Fluidised Bed Combustors (CFBC).
<LI>2.1.4 Pressurised Fluidised Bed Combustors (PFBC)
<LI>Pressurised fluidised beds operating at pressures of between
1 and 3 MPa are currently being tested in demonstration facilities
of a commercial scale. Given their greater energy density resulting
from operation at elevated pressure and with a greater mass flow
of combustion air, they have the potential to reach sizes of up
to 300 MW(e) and physically still be substantially smaller than
similar atmospheric fluidised bed combustors and circulating fluidised
bed installations. The pressurised fluidised bed as with the other
fluidised bed combustion technologies is capable of using a wide
variety of fuel types including those with low heating values
in an environmentally acceptable manner. Efficiency of these facilities,
however, is significantly higher between 40 and 45% (HHV) due
to the combined use of gas turbine technology and heat recovery
systems.
<LI>With conventional power generation facilities now reaching
a plateau in terms of efficiency improvements, combined gas/steam
cycles offer the potential to once again significantly increase
power generation efficiencies. The pressure energy of the fluidised
bed exhaust gases is recovered (after being cleaned of entrained
ash particles), in a gas turbine before heat recovery and exhaust
to atmosphere. It is important to ensure the gas is sufficiently
clean so as not to damage the gas turbine blades through erosion.
The gas turbine compressor supplies compressed air for combustion
in the high pressure fluidised bed. The generation of electricity
is therefore possible from both the gas turbine generator and
a conventional steam turbine and generator. Approximately 20%
of the electricity generated is provided by the gas turbine whilst
the remaining 80% is generated by the steam cycle. This combination
provides an increase of over 10% above the overall efficiency
of conventional coal-fired plant which does not utilise a gas
turbine.
<LI>Three commercial pressurised fluidised bed combustion installations
have recently been completed in Spain, Sweden and USA. One of
these plants located in Stockholm, Sweden and conceived as a twin
plant, generates 135 MW of electricity and 220 MW of district
heating. Fluidised bed combustion power stations have been extensively
developed worldwide and are now finding significant application
in energy markets. They have a claimed efficiency of 40-45% and
represent an investment 10-15% lower than a conventional power
station with complete flue gas purification, as they do not require
the related purification facilities of modern pulverised coal
power stations in Europe and the USA. Pressurised fluidised beds
have a predicted output in the intermediate range of 200-350 MW(e).
<LI>Figure 2.3 - PFBC Combined Cycle.
<LI>2.2 Gas Turbines and Combined Cycle
<LI>Gas turbines have been used for electricity generation for
many years. In the past, their use has been generally limited
to generating electricity in periods of peak electricity demand.
Gas turbines are ideal for this application as they can be started
and stopped quickly enabling them to be brought into service as
required to meet energy demand peaks. However, their previously
small unit sizes and their low thermal efficiency restricted the
opportunities for their wider use for electricity generation.
<LI>Over the last ten years there has been major improvements
to gas turbines such that they are now considered an attractive
option for base load electricity generation. Advances in gas turbine
technology have resulted in the efficiency of gas turbines being
increased to that of coal-fired power stations with much larger
machines being manufactured. Further, combined cycle plants (these
use the waste heat from the gas turbine exhaust to generate steam
to drive a steam turbine and so produce additional electricity)
have one of the highest efficiency ratings of non-renewable generating
plant currently available 40 to 45% HHV. The same technology improvements
have also resulted in the output capacity of gas turbines being
doubled. The largest units in service today produce 150 MW(e)
while units of around 200 MW(e) are scheduled to enter service
in 1993.
<LI>Figure 2.4 - Combined Cycle.
<MENU>
<LI>2.2.1 Operation
</MENU>

<LI>Gas turbines are internal combustion engines. The operating
principle is identical to conventional reciprocating petrol engines:
air is compressed, fuel burnt, and the expanding hot gas drives
the engine. However, instead of pistons compressing the air and
the hot expanding gases driving the piston, rotating compressor
blades (like a fan) compress the air and the resulting hot combustion
gases drive the turbine blades to produce power. A combustion
chamber is positioned between the air compressor and the power
turbine. Fuel is injected on a continuous basis into this chamber
and burnt. The continuous combustion of fuel enables more power
to be produced compared to a reciprocating engine of similar weight
and size.
<LI>Figure 2.5 - Simple Cycle Gas Turbine.
<LI>For electricity generation, the output shaft of the gas turbine
is connected to an electrical generator, identical to those driven
by steam turbines in coal fired plant.
<LI>Industrial gas turbines convert approximately 31% (HHV), of
the energy contained in the fuel to electrical energy. The remaining
energy is contained in the exhaust gases or used by auxiliary
equipment. By directing the exhaust gases through a heat recovery
boiler, steam is produced which can be used to drive a steam turbine
and generator set. This is the principle of combined cycle plant.
<LI>2.2.2 Aeroderivative &amp; Industrial Gas Turbines
<LI>There are two basic types of gas turbines - aeroderivative
and industrial units. As their name suggests, aeroderivative units
are aircraft jet engines modified to drive electrical generators.
These units have a maximum output of 40 MW(e) and are more fuel
efficient than industrial units. The latest aeroderivative unit
has a thermal efficiency of 36%. Aeroderivative units can produce
full power within three minutes after start up.
<LI>Industrial gas turbines range in sizes up to 150 MW(e). The
major gas turbine companies are just commencing to manufacture
units of around 200 MW(e). One company has a 218 MW(e) unit schedule
for operation in 1993. The most efficient industrial units have
efficiencies of around 31%. Depending on size, start up can take
from 10 to 40 minutes to produce full output.
<LI>Industrial gas turbines have a lower capital cost per kilowatt
installed than aeroderivative units. For this reason, it would
be most likely for Pacific Power to use industrial units if gas
turbines were selected as a generating option. Combined cycle
plant would also probably be based on industrial units as the
larger gas turbine capacities enable the use of larger steam plant
components which have significant cost advantages due to 'economies
of scale'.
</MENU>

<H5>Fuels</H5>

<P>
Gas turbines are capable of burning a wide variety of fuels. Distillate
and natural gas are the most common fuels as they do not contain
impurities which could damage the components in the turbine that
operate at high temperature. Crude oil and heavy fuel oils can
be burnt, but additional fuel treatment plant is necessary. When
natural gas is used, power output and thermal efficiency of gas
turbines are higher than when using distillate.
<P>
Gas turbines that operate at low capacity factors (referring to
the extent to which they are utilised) can be operated economically
on distillate. Base load combined cycle plant, however, needs
to be fuelled on natural gas for it to be competitive with alternative
coal based generating plants.
<H5>Environment</H5>

<P>
Natural gas contains only trace levels of sulphur, so sulphur
dioxide emissions are virtually non-existent when natural gas
is burnt. With distillate, the levels of sulphur dioxide in the
exhaust gas are low due to the very low levels of sulphur in the
distillate. Nitrogen oxides generation can be minimised by the
design of the combustion process. With natural gas, extremely
low levels of nitrogen oxides are achievable from burner design
alone. With distillate, nitrogen oxides generation is easily controlled
by the injection of water or steam into the combustion chamber.
<P>
Gas turbines and combined cycles are very compact and occupy small
ground area. Noise from the gas turbines needs to be considered,
but statutory limits on noise levels at site boundaries can be
achieved either by increasing the distance from the boundary to
the plant or by installing noise abatement equipment on the machines.
<H5>Potential Use of Gas Turbines for Pacific Power</H5>

<P>
Forecasts of future generating plant requirements indicate gas
turbines are an important option when considering the next generation
increment in NSW after the new coal fired Mount Piper Power Station
commences generating electricity in 1993. These gas turbines would
operate at low capacity factors, that is below 10% of the time.
The role of these machines would be to provide 'back-up' supply
for base load coal fired units that are forced out of service
due to plant failure. Gas turbines are suited to this role because
of their low capital cost around $410/kW compared to $1100/kW
for coal plant.
<P>
The lead time for gas turbine installation can be as short as
two years provided development approval is obtained in advance.
This short lead time would enable gas turbines to be installed
quickly should the electricity supply system require additional
unforeseen capacity. Combined cycle plant has a short lead time,
three years provided development approval is obtained in advance.
Combined cycle plant costs around $850/kW and retains this cost
for small generating increments as low as 400 MW(e).
<MENU>
<LI>2.2.3 Technological Developments
<LI>Over the last ten years there have been many advancements
in gas turbine technology. New materials and techniques used to
manufacture the turbine blades have resulted in a significant
increase in operating temperatures which leads to a corresponding
increase in efficiency. Turbine blades are manufactured with passages
inside the blades that allow air to pass through the blades to
keep them cool. This cooling air is provided by the compressor
section of the gas turbine. Further increases in turbine operating
temperatures are possible by pre-cooling the air after it leaves
the compressor.
<LI>Ceramic blades offer the possibility of higher operating temperatures
and increased efficiencies.
<LI>Currently, turbine blades are made from exotic alloys that
retain their strength at the high temperatures experienced in
the turbine. However, at these high operating temperatures, impurities
in the fuel (even at extremely low levels) can cause corrosion
of the blades. Various coatings for turbine blades have been developed
to avoid this high temperature corrosion.
<LI>2.3 Coal Gasification
<LI>2.3.1 Gasification Processes
<LI>In the early 1970's, as a result of the increasing fuel cost
and uncertainty of future fuel supply, research was begun on the
gasification of coal. Coal gasification was investigated as an
alternative to natural gas. Compared with direct coal firing of
power stations, the advantage of gasification is in the production
of a purified gas for which there is no subsequent need for flue
gas cleaning equipment, particularly for removal of sulphur dioxide.
Accordingly, the volume of gas to be cleaned is reduced to about
one hundredth of the equivalent flue gas volume. The integration
of gasification with the combined cycle process (referred to as
integrated gasification combined cycle) which yields higher efficiencies
than coal-fired and simple cycle power generation (combined cycle
refers to steam production utilising the waste heat from exhaust
gases) more than compensates for the loss in efficiency in coal
gasification brought about by partial oxidation of the gas and
incomplete gasification of the coal. The raw gas produced in the
gasification process contains mainly carbon monoxide and hydrogen
with small amounts of methane, hydrogen sulphide, tars, oils and
particulates. Ash or slag is removed from the bottom of the gasifier.
<LI>To generate the gas, coal is heated to temperatures typically
between 800 and 1600 degrees Celsius, oxygen and steam being added
at the same time. This produces a gas made up primarily of hydrogen
and carbon monoxide. Low-temperature processes (up to about 900
degrees Celsius) also generate methane and carbon dioxide. The
gas produced in this process has to be cooled and cleaned before
use. The heat inside the gasifier, the crude gas, and the slag
provides the energy for generating steam to drive a steam turbine
and generator set.
</MENU>

<H5>Types of Coal Gasification</H5>

<P>
The three main gasification methods are described below, and are
shown in Figure 2.6.
<P>
Figure 2.6 - Basic Types of Coal Gasification Processes.
<P>
Fixed Bed - In the &quot;fixed bed&quot; system, coal (3-30 mm)
is distributed onto a rotary grate at the base of the gasifier,
where the oxygen or air and steam are introduced. Ash is removed
from the rotary grate and passes through the ash lock under the
gasifier. The temperature in the gasifier must be kept below the
ash melting point to avoid slag formation. This form of gasifier
has a gas exit temperature in the order of 800 degrees Celsius,
and a pressure of 1 - 10 MPa. The low gas exit temperature in
this gasifier reflects the fact that as much as 90% of the coal's
energy remains as chemical energy in the gas.
<P>
Fluidised Bed - In this process, the coal (1-5 mm) is fed into
a 'fluidised' bed consisting of inert material and coal. Oxygen
or air for combustion, nitrogen to carry the fuel, and steam are
introduced through nozzles in the bed, thus fluidising the coal.
Gasification of the coal occurs in the bed, however further oxygen
or air, nitrogen and steam are added above the bed, increasing
the temperature and facilitating the conversion of coal and preventing
by product formation. Ash is removed from the bottom of the gasifier,
typically by a cooled screw conveyor.
<P>
Fluidised bed gasifiers work best with coals with an ash melting
point higher than 1100 - 1200 degrees Celsius, low coking tendency
and high reactivity. Wood and peat can also be used. This form
of gasifier has a gas exit temperature in the order of 1000 degrees
Celsius, and a pressure of 1 - 2.5 MPa. The moderate gas exit
temperature in this gasifier reflects the fact that 80% of the
coal's energy remains as chemical energy in the gas.
<P>
Entrained Flow - The fuel mix is introduced into the entrained
flow
<P>
gasifier through burner nozzles, and the gasification occurs as
the
<P>
fuel flows through the gasifier. The coal is introduced with a
<P>
particle size of 0.1 mm. This type of gasifier operates at a
<P>
temperature higher than the ash melting point, which enables the
ash
<P>
(slag) to flow out of the gasifier. The resulting gas has negligible
<P>
tar, oil, or phenol content. This form of gasifier has a gas exit
<P>
temperature in the order of 1400 degrees Celsius, and a pressure
of
<MENU>
<LI>2.5 - 4 MPa. The high gas exit temperature in this gasifier
reflects the fact that only 70% of the coal's energy remains as
chemical energy in the gas.
<LI>Processes currently being developed now operate at higher
pressures. The advantage is an increase in power output as well
as a reduction of the investment required for both the gasifier
and the subsequent processing of the product gas.
<LI>A variant now proposed is to operate with partial gasification
of coal; only 70% of the coal is transformed into gas, the rest
is left over as coke. The advantage is that this procedure does
not require pure oxygen that would have to be generated at high
cost; rather, air is quite sufficient. The exhaust heat produced
by such partial gasification serves together with the combustion
of the coke to generate steam. The hot exhaust gases from the
gas turbine still contain enough oxygen to be added to the coke
burning.
<LI>2.3.2 Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC)
</MENU>

<H5>General Process Description</H5>

<P>
Basically IGCC is a combined cycle process (gas turbine/heat recovery
boiler) fuelled by gasified coal. This system takes advantage
of the abundance of coal and the high efficiency of the combined
cycle.
<P>
Gas Purification - After the coal is gasified, the fuel gas produced
passes through a heat recovery boiler which generates steam to
drive a steam turbine and generator. The dust in the cool fuel
gas is removed by wet scrubbing prior to sulphur compounds being
removed. About 2 to 5% of the fuel gas energy is lost in this
process. Hot gas cleaning methods are being researched, so that
gas cooling can be avoided and plant can operate at higher efficiency.
<P>
Combustion - The cleaned gas is mixed with compressed air, nitrogen
(from the air separation plant, if one exists) and/or steam, and
combusted in a gas turbine combustion chamber. The resulting hot
gas is passed through the gas turbine. The generator coupled to
the turbine produces electrical power. The nitrogen and steam
have a cooling effect on the process by diluting and controlling
combustion, hence decreasing the rate of oxides of nitrogen production.
<P>
Waste Heat Boiler - Heat remaining in the gas turbine exhaust
is retrieved by a waste heat boiler. This heat generates steam
which drives the steam turbine/generator.
<P>
Air Separation Plant - Processes which use oxygen rather than
air for gasification, require process plant for air separation.
The gas turbine's compressor provides air for the air separation
plant, where the oxygen and nitrogen are separated. The oxygen
is supplied to the gasifier, while the nitrogen is supplied to
the gas turbine combustion chamber and is also used to carry coal
into to the gasifier.
<P>
Coal Feed - Coal is introduced to the gasifier in a number of
ways, including screw feeds, blown pulverised coal and as a water
slurry. Slurry fed gasifiers use more heat to evaporate the water
and they also have a greater oxygen requirement.
<H5>Plant Capacity/Staged Construction</H5>

<P>
Although gasifiers have not reached sizes comparable to conventional
coal plant, a 250 MW(e) unit is under construction at Buggenum
in the Netherlands. One major advantage of IGCC is that its construction
can be staged. Initially a gas turbine can be commissioned (and
run on natural gas), then the heat recovery boiler (completing
the combined cycle, fuelled by natural gas) and finally the gasifier
to fuel the combined cycle with gasified coal.
<H5>Water Consumption</H5>

<P>
Based on a generation capacity of 600 MW(e) the table below shows
expected water requirements for cooling purposes of a gasification
process compared with conventional coal and combined cycle power
plant.

<H5>Developments</H5>

<P>
The main thrust of IGCC development is to build plant of comparable
capital cost to pulverised coal plant but achieve higher efficiencies.
It is claimed that existing IGCC systems have a similar capital
cost to pulverised coal systems fitted with flue gas desulphurisation.
Designed to achieve up to 43% efficiency (HHV) it is expected
to reach 45% (HHV) in the event that development of hot gas cleaning
technology is a success.
<P>
Apart from a number of pilot units, one large demonstration power
station with integrated coal gasification has been built so far:
the 100 MW(e) Southern California Edison power station in Cool
Water, USA operated successfully between 1984 and 1989 and has
been acknowledged as one of the cleanest coal based power stations
in the USA. Buggenum in the Netherlands, rated at 250 MW(e) will
be commissioned in 1993 and is designed to operate with an efficiency
of 41.4% (HHV).
<P>
Figure 2.8 - Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle.
<P>
2.4 Fuel Cells
<P>
The fuel cell operates by directly converting the chemical energy
in a fuel to electrical energy through an electrochemical process.
It consists of two electrodes separated by an electrolyte (fluid
capable of conducting an electric current) and electrically connected
through an external circuit.
<P>
Figure 2.9 - Fuel Cell.
<P>
Fuel cells offer considerable benefits as a future power source
due to high efficiencies in the range of 50-60% as well as quiet
and versatile operation. They are predicted to be serious contenders
for both central power stations and dispersed power generation
at load centres. Suitable fuels include methanol, natural gas
and gasified coal.
<P>
A fuel is supplied continuously to one electrode, where it is
oxidised, (i.e. burnt) and an oxidant (air) is supplied at the
other electrode where it is reduced. The electrolyte enables flow
of ions between the two electrodes. Fuel cell types are generally
classified by the type of electrolyte used.
<MENU>
<LI>(i) Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells (PAFC) - these are currently
the most developed and field tested fuel cell systems to date.
A 4.5 MW(e) and an 11 MW(e) demonstration plant have been successfully
operated. The temperature of operation of the cell is about 200
degrees Celsius and waste heat recovery can be used for low temperature
applications. These low temperature fuel cells generally use hydrogen
as the fuel source.
<LI>(ii) Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC) - these are less developed
than the phosphoric acid fuel cells. They operate at about 650
degrees Celsius with an efficiency of 55-60%, and the potential
to recover the waste heat generated for combined cycle operation.
Natural gas can be reacted directly in such a facility because
of the high temperature of operation. The development of MCFC
is at an advanced stage but several serious material problems
relating to degradation and stability of cell components still
needs to be investigated and resolved.
<LI>(iii) Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) - these use ceramic electrolytes
based on zirconia, and operate at about 1000 degrees Celsius.
Experimental SOFCs have been demonstrated, and industry experts
predict megawatt size installations with energy densities of 1
MW/m3 and operation at 50-60% efficiency within a decade. Because
of the high temperature of operation they will be suited for combined
cycle operation where the unreacted fuel leaving the fuel cell
is augmented and combusted in a gas turbine. As the temperature
of exhaust gases is of the order of 500 to 900 degrees Celsius,
the waste heat can be used to generate steam. It is expected that
such an arrangement could achieve an overall efficiency of close
to 80% with waste heat recovery.
<LI>A marketing report prepared for the CSIRO indicates that SOFC's
would be particularly attractive for meeting the energy needs
of non-residential buildings. In this application natural gas
fuelled units of between 100 kW(e) and a few megawatts, would
reduce carbon dioxide emissions significantly and be viable where
capital cost is less than $2000/kW inclusive of all power conditioning
equipment.
<LI>Some of the inherent advantages of operating fuel cells as
power supplies includes their flexibility in utilising a wide
variety of fuel sources (gasified coal, oil, gas, hydrogen, methanol),
their silent operating characteristics particularly attractive
in building installations, their modular construction allowing
cost effective increases in capacity and the potentially high
efficiency in the conversion of chemical energy into electricity.
<LI>Pacific Power has recently joined a consortium which established
a new joint-venture company, Ceramic Fuel Cells Ltd. to develop
SOFC's. The ultimate objective is the development of the technology
for application to large central and dispersed power stations
for use within grids.
<LI>2.5 Magnetohydrodynamics
<LI>Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) energy conversion is a process where
heat can be converted directly into electricity. The basic principle
by which electricity is generated is by moving a conductor through
a magnetic field. Thus, in the case of a conventional electricity
generator, using a turbogenerator, a coil of conductor is rotated
in a stationary magnetic field, or a magnetic field is rotated
in a cage of stationary conductors, namely copper or aluminium
bars.
<LI>Figure 2.10 - Open Cycle MHD Plant.
<LI>In the MHD generator, the combustion gas itself is an electrical
conductor. The gas is usually derived from the high temperature
combustion of coal. The combustion products produced are so hot
that they become electrically conducting, ie. a plasma. The ability
of the gas to conduct electricity is increased by &quot;seeding&quot;
it with a salt of readily ionisable alkali metal such as potassium
or caesium. This hot gas expands at high velocity through an intense
magnetic field via a long, narrow, divergent channel or nozzle.
An electric potential is induced between two opposite walls of
the generator and electric power can be extracted.
<LI>In both cases (conventional and MHD generators) the motion
of a conductor through a magnetic field gives rise to an electromotive
force and a flow of current in accordance with Faraday's laws
of induction. In a conventional generator, the current is carried
to the external load circuit through brushes. In the MHD generator
electrodes mounted in the channel walls tap off the current directly.
Thus for MHD, the energy released by the expanding hot gases is
converted directly to electricity without the use of rotating
machinery hence reducing mechanical losses.
<LI>When a conductor is placed in a magnetic field and a current
passed through it perpendicular to the field, a voltage is set
up perpendicular to both the field and current directions. This
phenomenon is known as the Hall effect, and the transverse voltage
developed is called the Hall voltage.
<LI>If a continuous electrode were used along the wall of a linear
MHD generator, Hall current would flow in the plasma, seriously
degrading performance. For this reason electrodes are segmented,
ie. there are a large number of electrodes separated by insulators
along the channel. With segmentation a voltage can develop between
adjacent electrodes because of the Hall effect.
<LI>The flue gas from the MHD process can be directed to a waste
heat boiler for steam raising or be passed to a gas turbine for
direct electricity generation. In both cases the efficiency of
the overall process can be significantly enhanced recovering energy
which would otherwise be exhausted to atmosphere.
<LI>An alternative to the linear MHD system described has been
developed as a result of technical problems associated with linear
systems on a commercial scale. Known as MHD disk generators they
avoid problems of the linear type such as superconducting magnets
of commercial scale are complex, expensive and of a size which
would make transport to site a difficult task. Cooling systems
as well as power consolidation systems and inverter system are
also less complex and expensive.
<LI>The MHD - disk generator has an overall simpler construction
than the linear system and benefits from less components under
high electrical potential and unbroken plasma flow.
<LI>By installing an MHD generator as a topping plant (installed
upstream of a secondary process which can also generate electricity),
overall efficiencies of up to 45% may be achievable with established
technology, reaching 50-55% with second generation development
and triple cycle configuration. Triple cycle refers to combined
MHD/gas turbine/steam plant. Size of MHD plant when used as a
topping cycle is in the range 25 MW(e) to 1000 MW(e).
<LI>Pacific Power has recently sponsored research at the University
of Sydney into a design study for retrofitting of MHD technology
at an existing power station.
<LI>2.6 Ultra Clean Coal (UCC)
<LI>Coal, in its natural form consists of carbon, hydrogen and
oxygen with traces of contaminants bound into the atomic structure,
as well as inert material known generally as ash. Because coal
typically contains from 10 to 30% ash by weight, its use as a
fuel is restricted to more conventional, coal-fired boilers. If
the inert material or ash content can be removed from the coal
such that less than 0.5% of ash remains, a new class of fuel,
ultra clean coal, can be produced and considered for a variety
of other uses, in particular as a replacement for liquid petroleum
fuels.
</MENU>

<H5>The Process</H5>

<P>
Physical processes for the removal of ash from coal have been
developed over the years to improve its quality for combustion
in conventional processes. In order to remove a high percentage
of ash from the coal by physical methods, large expensive and
cumbersome industrial plants need to be constructed.
<P>
A process for the chemical cleaning of coal, pioneered by the
CSIRO, is currently under development in Australia.
<P>
Figure 2.11 - Ultra Clean Coal Technology.
<P>
It is expected that this process will reduce the ash in coal to
less than 0.5% at a competitive cost and hence broaden the technologies
for which coal would be a substitute fuel.
<P>
The chemical cleaning process, which is currently under development
involves a number of distinct processing stages. Generally these
stages can be described as: caustic digestion of the mineral matter,
followed by acid neutralisation and finally water washing. The
reagents which are used throughout the process can be regenerated
for re-use in the process. Whilst being environmentally sound
and avoiding problems with waste disposal of chemicals this also
reduces the cost of the overall process and hence the finished
product.
<P>
The commercial success of the process for producing UCC will see
some very distinct benefits particularly in the area of electricity
generation. Some of these benefits include:
<P>
. increased export earnings through shipping a more versatile
fuel
<P>
to other countries resulting in their reduced dependence on gas
<P>
and petroleum products in electricity generation
<P>
. reduced transport and shipping costs for a fuel which can be
up to 30% lighter than raw coal from the mine;
<P>
. the ability to transport UCC through pipelines as a preference
to coal moved by rail or road transport. This being cheaper, less
congestive to our roads and environmentally sound.
<P>
. The development of high quality carbon anodes for use in the
production of aluminium.
<P>
. Development of advanced combustion technologies for more efficient
generation of electricity.
<P>
A pilot UCC plant co-funded by Pacific Power, was constructed
with production of tonnage quantities of UCC. The demonstration
project was erected on the site of the old Ulan Power Station
near Mudgee in central western NSW. The technical feasibility
of producing UCC was demonstrated during these trials.
<P>
The pilot plant has now been moved to the ACIRL laboratories at
Maitland where further development is being carried out by a consortium
of Australian interests.
<P>
A second project being considered, jointly with the production
of UCC, involves the development of a Clean Coal Engine. It is
envisaged that in order to develop this technology a modified
'coal burning' gas turbine will have to be constructed and tested
using UCC.
<MENU>
<LI>2.7 Underground (In-Situ) Coal Gasification (UCG)
<LI>Underground coal gasification is the process by which coal
is partially burned without being mined, and the heat generated
by the combustion decomposes and gasifies additional coal to produce
a combustible gaseous fuel. The benefit of this process is that
coal seams which are poor in quality and/or expensive to mine
can still be utilised by converting the coal into gas. Development
of UCG is quite recent and a great deal of interest in the technology
has already been shown worldwide.
<LI>The simplest type of underground gasification requires drilling
a well into a coal seam to inject oxygen containing gases whilst
another well is drilled to remove the gaseous products. The process
has two stages, the first being an ignition and linking stage
and the second a gasification stage.
<LI>Figure 2.12 - Underground Coal Gasification.
<LI>In the first stage the injection and production wells are
connected using a linking technique such as a horizontal borehole
or reverse combustion (i.e. fire and injection gases travel in
opposite directions). This stage produces a path of increased
permeability between the injection and production wells. At shallow
depths linked vertical wells may be used where it is possible
to establish linkage. At greater depths or where linkage is more
difficult to establish deflected 'horizontal' bores may be used.
<LI>Once the gasification channel is established and combustion
commenced, air or oxygen rich gases are injected and the gasification
zone progresses gradually toward the production well.
<LI>If air is injected as the oxidant, the product has a low heating
value (3 to 7 MJ/Nm3) due to the presence of nitrogen in the product
gas. If however oxygen and steam are injected, the product has
a medium heating value (8 to 11 MJ/Nm3 as compared to 38 MJ/Nm3
for natural gas). The product gas generally contains carbon monoxide,
hydrogen and methane.
<LI>The product gas may be used to fire a boiler to raise steam
or to fuel a gas turbine for generation of electricity. The product
gas can also be further refined to produce chemicals or liquid
fuels. The cost to produce gas using UCG compared to using a surface
gasifier is much lower due to the fact that mining and coal handling
equipment, as well as, surface gasifiers are not required.
<LI>Developments overseas include industrial scale operation in
the USSR since the 1950's and numerous demonstrations in the USA
to confirm technical feasibility, particularly since the 1972
oil price crisis. Testing has been curtailed in more recent years
due to fuel price declines and increased availability of both
natural gas and petroleum. However, with instability of oil prices
in more recent times, development of this technology could once
again takeoff. There are no commercial operations currently in
the USA or Australia.
<LI>The process has been shown to be technically feasible and
is appropriate where coal is not mineable by conventional means.
Areas have been identified in NSW with coal resources suitable
for UCG. However, a period of up to 10 years may be required to
prove the potential of these specific areas and develop experience
in the technology in Australia.
<LI>2.8 Geothermal Energy
<LI>The flow of heat from within the earth to the surface averages
0.06 W/m2 and is attributable to two factors: the process of the
earth cooling down and newly generated heat as a result of natural
radioactive decay in the earth's crust. Estimates show that the
latter is probably the more significant factor. Since this heat
liberation is not evenly distributed across the surface of the
earth, geothermal anomalies can lend themselves to economic utilisation.
Such anomalies are found mainly but not exclusively in areas with
active volcanoes.
<LI>Figure 2.13 provides a schematic diagram of a geothermal reservoir.
Depending on the temperature of the heat discharged, such reservoirs
may be subdivided into various categories:
<UL>
<LI>hot-steam reservoirs (e.g. the oldest source of this type
in operation is in the Italian town of Larderello operated since
1904);
<LI>hot-water reservoirs (e.g. Wairakei, New Zealand, Cerro Prieto,
Mexico, and in Iceland);
<LI>warm-water reservoirs with temperatures below 100 degrees
Celsius (e.g. Birdsville, Queensland).
</UL>

</MENU>

<P>
Of the energy stored, approximately 25% can be extracted in the
case of hot-steam reservoirs and about 1% in the case of hot-water
reservoirs.
<P>
There are also hot dry rock reservoirs which store by far the
most geothermal energy but have to be developed first by the artificial
creation of crevices and the insertion of water as a heat carrier.
This concept is still in the experimental stage.
<P>
Figure 2.13 - Geothermal Energy for Power Generation.
<H5>Use and Potential</H5>

<P>
Geothermal energy is used for generating electricity and for heating.
In steam and hotwater reservoirs the steam obtained is used directly
for driving turbines. In warm-water reservoirs steam is generated
via a second, closed circuit using low boiling point gases such
as isobutane or ammonia, as the working fluid. The principles
are based on the Rankine cycle; the organic gas being passed through
an expansion turbine/engine. The resulting mechanical energy is
used to generate electricity. Overall design and economy of a
geothermal installation is site specific depending greatly on
the quality and quantity of energy in the reservoir.
<P>
About 1% of the global heat flow is concentrated in geothermal
energy. Geothermal heat is not an immediately renewable source
of energy if a power station extracts more heat from a reservoir
than the adjacent rock can provide.
<P>
Figure 2.14 shows the rated output capacity of major geothermal
facilities currently installed in various countries. The largest
and most successful plant so far is The Geysers in the USA where
several power stations with a total installed capacity of 2000
MW(e) are fed from 250 geothermal sources.
<P>
Figure 2.14 - Number of major geothermal power stations installed
<P>
worldwide (Sept 1986)
<H5>Environmental Considerations</H5>

<P>
The main problem in the use of geothermal energy is that the steam
or water flowing from the artesian bore contains partly aggressive
gases and minerals. Up to a maximum of 26% of the water is made
up of dissolved solids, the average being about 3%. These impurities
cause corrosion and deposits in turbines and heat exchangers and
may also be a burden on the environment.
<P>
General repercussions for the environment include:
<UL>
<LI>the amount of heat discharged is 23 times greater than conventional
power stations;
<LI>the problem of harmful waste waters can be solved in part
by re-injection into the reservoir;
<LI>the amount of sulphur released in the Geysers field by way
of exhaust gases is comparable to the discharge of sulphur by
conventional power stations, a further factor being the unpleasant
smell of other gases including hydrogen sulphide;
<LI>with steam containing a large amount of water, the process
of separation of water from steam may cause significant noise,
requiring good sound insulation.
<MENU>
<LI>2.9 Nuclear Fission
</MENU>

</UL>

<H5>Nuclear Power in NSW</H5>

<P>
The &quot;Uranium Mining and Nuclear Facilities (Prohibitions)
Act, 1986, No. 194&quot; Section 9 prohibits the Electricity Commission
of New South Wales from constructing, operating or approving a
nuclear reactor for the purposes of generating electricity. This
discussion of nuclear power generation is included for completeness
in the context of alternative and emerging technologies for power
generation.
<H5>The Status of Nuclear Power Fission</H5>

<P>
Electricity was first generated by a nuclear power station in
1951 at the &quot;Experimental Breeder Reactor 1&quot; in Idaho.
Since then nuclear power stations have become a major electricity
source. In 1988, 430 nuclear power stations were in operation,
producing 16% of the world's electrical energy (17 000 TWh). Nuclear
power stations have mostly large units typically 600-1300 MW(e)
in size. The USA has the greatest nuclear capacity, followed by
France, the USSR, Japan and Germany. At over 70%, France has the
greatest proportion of nuclear energy in their generation capacity.
<MENU>
<LI>2.9.1 Types of Nuclear Power Stations
<LI>The fission process which produces the heat required for a
conventional steam cycle occurs when the nucleus of a Uranium
235 atom is split in two after colliding with a neutron. As well
as a large amount of heat being generated, an average of 2.5 neutrons
are released per collision, one of these then moving on to continue
the fission process, and thus sustain the reaction. The 1.5 neutrons
which don't continue in the fission reaction are absorbed by nuclei.
<LI>The heat produced during the fission reaction, is transferred
to a fluid which may be a gas or liquid for example, air, helium,
carbon dioxide, molten salt, water, liquid metal (sodium), or
an organic liquid. This hot fluid then transfers its heat to a
conventional steam cycle from which electricity can be generated.
</MENU>

<H5>Light-Water Reactors</H5>

<P>
There are two forms of light water reactors; pressurised water
reactors (PWR) and less commonly boiling water reactors (BWR).
These reactors use light water as a coolant as opposed to a heavy
water cooled reactor which is also used to supply energy. The
boiling water reactors produce steam in the reactor core, the
saturated steam then passes directly to the turbo-generator where
the energy is recovered. In the pressurised water reactor, high
pressure liquid water is used as the reactor coolant, the water's
heat is then transferred to a secondary steam cycle which supplies
energy to a turbine and generator. Light water reactors are the
most common of the reactor types, and are likely to be for several
decades. They operate with efficiencies slightly less than conventional
fossil fuelled power stations.
<P>
A new design of light water reactor has been developed in the
USA. Known as the 'advanced' light water reactor (ALWR), it operates
with improved passive safety systems and is smaller than other
light water reactors. The reduction in the number of nuclear power
stations being constructed worldwide has slowed the implementation
of the ALWR.
<H5>High Temperature Reactors</H5>

<P>
High temperatures are possible in these reactors as the reactor
core is cooled by compressed helium gas. High temperatures of
up to 950 degrees Celsius result in relatively high efficiencies
of the order of the efficiency of fossil fuelled power stations.
<H5>Fast Breeder Reactors</H5>

<P>
In fast breeder reactors high energy neutrons cause most of the
fission events. This is in contrast to &quot;thermal&quot; reactors
where the neutrons are deliberately slowed down in the moderator,
releasing slow or &quot;thermal&quot; neutrons to the fission
process.
<P>
In the reactor, plutonium 239 is the main fuel. Depleted or natural
uranium (mostly U238) is placed as a blanket around the core.
<P>
High energy &quot;fast&quot; neutrons are necessary in breeder
reactors for the fission of the &quot;fertile&quot; uranium 238.
This in turn produces an increasing amount of plutonium 239. The
rate of production of plutonium 239 is greater than the rate of
consumption, thus the reactor is breeding fissionable fuel. This
reactor utilises the more abundant uranium 238, and could result
in total uranium reserves worldwide being extended.
<P>
Fast breeder technology is currently being promoted above all
in countries without their own uranium resources, such as France
and Japan, but also the USSR. More than 10 fast breeders are now
operating. Considering the low level of uranium prices today,
even proponents of the fast breeder do not believe that this type
of reactor can operate economically in this century.
<P>
This type of reactor is particularly suitable for the extraction
of high temperature heat for chemical processes, the gasification
of coal or the production of steam for electricity generation.
<H5>Radioactive Wastes</H5>

<P>
The nuclear fuel cycle including the production of fuel, its use
in a reactor and its subsequent disposal as waste, produces what
are termed low, medium and high level radioactive wastes.
<P>
Low level wastes are those items and materials used through the
fuel cycle which may have become contaminated. Typically this
may include cleaning equipment, gloves, clothes, tools etc. Low
level waste has similar radioactivity to uranium orebody.
<P>
Medium level wastes include fuel handling equipment, reactor equipment
and parts etc. Both low and medium radioactive wastes are disposed
of in shallow burial sites. Prior to disposal, highly toxic portions
of these wastes are separated and included for disposal with the
high level wastes.
<P>
High level wastes include fission products (spent fuel) and high
atomic mass elements artificially formed by neutron capture. This
waste emits a high level of radiation as well as a great deal
of heat. The heat mainly arising from fission products.
<P>
Quite a few countries have final storage facilities for low and
medium activity waste, however highly active waste is cooled for
years prior to storage, and as yet no final storage facilities
for highly active waste have been implemented. The following brief
descriptions indicate some of the avenues of research in this
area.
<H5>Glass Blocks in Salt Domes</H5>

<P>
The final storage method chosen by Germany is to cast the highly
active material into boron silicate glass blocks, ready for storage
in salt domes. The blocks are placed 850m underground in galleries
drilled in the salt dome. Salt domes have several characteristics
which make them suitable as final storage sites:
<MENU>
<LI>(i) they are located in proven water tight strata, by virtue
of their existence;
<LI>(ii) salt is structurally suitable to protect enclosed waste
from geological upheavals; and
<LI>(iii) salt has a good thermal conductivity allowing efficient
dissipation of heat produced by radioactive decay.
</MENU>

<P>
In spite of the above there are still problems to be considered
with salt domes such as recently small pockets of brine have been
detected in salt domes (in one case a test bore filled with water),
and the resistance of salt domes to high temperatures has been
questioned.
<P>
There is also doubt about the durability of the glass blocks when
subjected to the high temperatures and pressures experienced while
buried deep in geological formations. High temperatures and pressures
cause devitrification of glass and with water present leaching
may occur. Because of these doubts, Britain plans to keep their
glass blocks in air cooled enclosures for at least 50 years.
<H5>Synroc</H5>

<P>
Synroc (which is being developed in Australia) is a synthetic
ceramic crystalline rock, in which it is proposed to dispose of
highly active waste. The waste will be incorporated in synrocs
crystalline structure. Waste on a large scale has not yet been
incorporated in synroc and even after successful incorporation
of the waste, a 50 year testing programme will be required to
ensure the material is secure. If successful, the synroc blocks
would be stored in a stable geological structure such as granite.
Such structures are found in Australia.
<H5>Reprocessing of Fuel</H5>

<P>
Used fuel rods are reprocessed for three main reasons:
<MENU>
<LI>(i) to recover viable fuel for further use;
<LI>(ii) to recycle plutonium for use and destruction in the fission
process of a reactor;
<LI>(iii) to remove fission waste products for final storage.
</MENU>

<P>
The alternative to reprocessing is to store used fuel rods in
intermediate storage until they are cool enough for final storage.
<H5>Nuclear Energy Cost </H5>

<P>
Currently, nuclear power stations are technology intensive, resulting
in very high capital costs. Decommissioning of these power stations
at the end of their useful life is also now being identified as
a major cost. In total, electricity produced by nuclear power
stations costs of the order of three times that of electricity
produced by NSW coal-fired stations.
<MENU>
<LI>2.10 Nuclear Fusion
<LI>The aim of nuclear fusion research is to provide a new source
of energy for the industrialised world which offers significant
advantages:
<UL>
<LI>unproblematic procurement of fuel,
<LI>high energy yield,
<LI>minimum hazard,
<LI>minimum environmental pollution.
</UL>

</MENU>

<P>
Since this type of energy represents a long-term development,
it is currently not possible to make any reliable forecasts as
to the economic viability of nuclear fusion energy.
<P>
Commercial fusion power stations are not expected to be available
before the middle of next century.
<H5>Elementary Process and Fuel</H5>

<P>
The elementary process releasing energy is the fusion of two light
atomic nuclei. Fusion is counteracted by the electrostatic repulsion
of the nuclei, which can only be overcome by making them collide
with a sufficient impact, as is the case at temperatures above
100 million degrees Celsius. The requirement, therefore, is to
heat up the fusion fuel to such temperatures and to maintain it
with adequate density for sufficiently long period.
<P>
Deuterium and tritium have the highest reaction rates for nuclear
fusion. Deuterium can be extracted from water at low cost and
is therefore available in unlimited quantities. Tritium is &quot;bred&quot;
in the reactor itself out of lithium, an element found in large
quantities and well distributed in the earth's crust.
<P>
This would provide a virtually inexhaustible fuel supply, particularly
considering the very small amount of fuel required in nuclear
fusion: generation of 1 million kWh of electricity requires approximately
400t of hard coal but only 40g of lithium and 12.5g of deuterium.
<P>
An important advantage of the fusion reactor is that it does not
pollute the environment with chemically toxic substances. Rather,
the reaction product of the fusion process is helium, a chemically
inactive rare gas. None of the other processes in the fuel cycle
results in the emission of chemical contaminants either. In particular,
there is no emission of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides or carbon
dioxide.
<MENU>
<LI>2.11 Dry Cooling In Power Stations
</MENU>

<H5>Future Power Station Sites in NSW</H5>

<P>
New South Wales power stations have in the past been sited close
to large coal reserves, and water supplies since these raw materials
strongly affect the economics of the electricity generated. Future
power stations may be required to make use of coal reserves which
are remote from sufficient water resources normally required for
cooling purposes. For this reason dry cooling technologies are
being developed such that areas which possess large quantities
of coal but little water become economically attractive as future
power generation sites.
<H5>Power Station Cooling Systems</H5>

<P>
Cooling systems are an integral part of the steam cycle of coal-fired
power stations. Their role can be described as follows:
<H5>The Basic Steam Cycle</H5>

<P>
Water is pumped into the boiler drum at high pressure and then
flows through banks of tubes into a boiler. This water is then
heated (in New South Wales the energy is provided by burning coal),
past its boiling point producing steam at a super-heat condition
of 540 degrees Celsius. When the super-heated high pressure steam
leaves the boiler, it enters an expansion turbine. The steam turns
the fan-like blades of the turbine which is, in turn connected
by a shaft to the electrical generator. This converts the rotational
mechanical power to electricity.
<P>
The spent steam exits the turbine at a low temperature (less than
50 degrees Celsius) and low pressure and is condensed using one
of the cooling systems outlined below. The resulting water is
then ready to be pumped back into the boiler drum to start the
cycle again.
<P>
Figure 2.15 - The Basic Steam Cycle.
<H5>Cooling Systems at NSW Power Stations</H5>

<P>
At present New South Wales power stations are either cooled by
using saltwater from coastal (estuarine), freshwater cooling pond
lake water or wet cooling towers, depending on the availability
of water resources at the particular site.
<P>
Limits have been placed on the maximum temperature (35 degrees
Celsius) at which cooling water can be discharged to prevent high
lake temperatures and avoiding environmental problems. Wet cooling
towers use freshwater and achieve 80% of their cooling by evaporation
of the cooling water. This evaporation represents a loss of millions
of litres of water per year. When the cost of water reaches approximately
70-90 cents/kL (depending on the location), dry cooling may become
the more attractive option for cooling. Current water costs of
Pacific Power Power Stations are of the order of 50 cents/kL.
<H5>Lake Cooling</H5>

<P>
In this system exhaust steam exiting the turbine enters the condenser.
The cooling water from the lake is pumped through a large number
of tubes which pass through the condenser box. The steam is condensed
by the cooling water and is then pumped out from the bottom of
the condenser. The cooling water is heated during this process,
and is then returned to the lake.
<H5>Wet Cooling Towers</H5>

<P>
Wet cooling towers use the same condenser system as in lake cooling,
however, the cooling water comes from a large basin at the bottom
of the cooling tower. In a natural draft cooling tower the heated
cooling water from the condenser is sprayed down the inside of
the cooling tower whilst air, under the effects of natural convection
flows up through the cooling tower. The air draft evaporates some
of the cooling water, lowering the temperature of the remaining
cooling water. The draft can also be produced by fans in an induced
draft cooling tower. A plume of pure water vapour can often be
seen exiting the top of wet cooling towers particularly when the
atmosphere has high humidity.
<H5>Figure 2.16 - Lake Cooling/ Figure 2.17 - Wet Cooling Tower
</H5>

<H5>Dry Cooling Systems</H5>

<P>
There are two main types of dry cooling technology, the direct
system and the indirect system. These systems operate similar
to car radiators, in that they use a flow of air to cool water
flowing inside finned tubes.
<H5>Indirect Dry Cooling</H5>

<P>
Indirect dry cooling towers use the same condenser system as in
lake cooling, however the cooling water is recirculated through
banks of finned tubes over which cooling air flows. The air flow
is induced in a natural draft cooling tower by convection.
<P>
If fans were used instead of the natural draft tower, a large
number of fans would be required to achieve the same heat rejection.
This is because the temperature difference between the air and
the cooling water is relatively small. The natural draft cooling
tower for dry cooling is larger than for an equivalent wet system,
since heat transfer rates are much less.
<P>
Another form of indirect cooling system is that of the 'spray'
condenser. In this system the boiler water acts also as the cooling
water and is circulated through the finned tubes for cooling.
This system is theoretically more efficient than other indirect
systems as heat transfer through tubes from the boiler water to
the cooling circuit is no longer required. In practice these condensers
have not proved to be as efficient as expected and research is
continuing. Water treatment in this case however is more critical
to maintain demineralised water quality for such a large volume.
<H5>Direct Dry Cooling</H5>

<P>
In the direct dry cooling system the turbine exhaust steam is
passed directly through finned tubes. The tubes are finned to
increase their surface area and hence cooling capability. Ambient
air is forced over these tubes with the aid of fans cooling and
condensing the steam.
<P>
The cooling system needs to be located as near as possible to
the turbine, so that the turbine operates efficiently. This also
minimises leaks which can contaminate the steam (steam pressure
is below atmospheric pressure, so leaks will allow air to flow
into the tubes). It is possible to locate a fan forced cooling
system closer to the turbine than a natural draft system. The
tube banks are located directly adjacent to the turbine hall,
minimising piping distance, and the fans are located under the
tubebanks.
<P>
Comparison of Direct vs Indirect Dry Cooling Systems. Indirect
dry cooling systems tend to have a large capital cost (due to
the large cost of the natural draft cooling tower) but low operating
cost. In comparison direct dry cooling has a low capital cost
but high operating cost (due to large power consumption of the
fans). In general, direct dry cooling is favoured at sites with
low fuel cost (the fan power is less costly), whilst indirect
dry cooling is more suitable at sites with high fuel costs.
<H5>Current Status</H5>

<P>
The largest dry cooled power stations have been constructed in
South Africa. Three power stations were built consisting of 6
units, each unit having an output in the range 660-685 MW(e):
Matimba - a direct dry cooled station, Majuba - also a direct
system and Kendal - an indirect dry cooled station. The largest
power station units in NSW are similar in size to the South African
units, hence the technology being developed for South Africa has
particular relevance to NSW developments.
<P>
Pacific Power is currently investigating the site specific nature
of corrosion and fouling of a variety of dry cooling tube types.
Because of the low heat transfer rates of dry cooling, this aspect
of their operation is critical as it may cause heat rejection
rates to vary considerably and hence affect the economics of electricity
produced.

<H5>3.1 Wind Energy</H5>

<P>
For centuries mankind has been harnessing the power of the wind,
to propel sailing ships, pump water and, during this century,
to produce electricity. Today a major focus for wind energy is
the production of electricity for supply into the main electricity
network.
<P>
Wind turbines for producing electricity range from kilowatt sized
machines for use on yachts and at isolated homesteads to a few
machines of several megawatts that are still largely experimental.
Currently, worldwide there are more than 2000 MW(e) of installed
wind turbine capacity, roughly equivalent to about 60% of the
capacity of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Although this is located
mainly in California, Denmark has a total installed capacity of
some 360 MW(e), comprising almost 3000 turbines and providing
about 2% of electricity demand.
<P>
Various designs of wind turbines are available.
<H6>Figure 3.1 - Typical Wind Turbine Performance Data</H6>

<P>
Several countries are operating largescale (1 to 4 MW) experimental
wind turbines. However, the most widely used machines for electricity
production are much smaller. The design concept is relatively
simple and a typical 300 kW(e) machine could have the following
features:
<P>
. three-bladed 30 metre diameter rotor rotating at 40 rpm;
<P>
. blades constructed from fibreglass or wood epoxy and which are
<P>
able to change their pitch to optimise the angle to the wind;
<P>
. hub of the rotor connected to a gearbox and induction generator,
<P>
both placed within an enclosed nacelle;
<P>
. nacelle and rotor placed on a 30 metre tower, and able to rotate
<P>
so that the wind turbine is always facing into the wind;
<P>
. able to replace the combustion of 250 tonnes of coal per year
<P>
which would supply the energy requirements of 70 NSW homes.
<P>
Today, the most economical turbines are about 300 kW - 600 kW
capacity
<P>
and could typically be located as a 'wind farm' of 3 to 6 MW(e)
total
<P>
capacity occupying approximately 2 square kilometres of land.
The wind
<P>
turbines in each farm would be operated as an integrated unit
with
<P>
connection often being into the local electricity transmission
network.
<P>
Several countries have active wind energy programs. In some countries
<P>
the cost of electricity generated by wind turbines is competitive
with
<P>
that from other forms of generation. Other countries desirous
of
<P>
achieving a portion of generation from non fossil fuel sources
have
<P>
embarked upon wind generation programs.
<P>
Proponents of wind energy claim a number of advantages in support
of
<P>
the technology in addition to the value associated with providing
<P>
energy, and some credit for capacity. These advantages include
the
<P>
following:
<P>
. the energy produced displaces combustion of fossil fuels and
hence
<P>
emissions of carbon dioxide, particulates, sulphur dioxide and
<P>
other pollutants;
<P>
. the wind is a renewable resource;
<P>
. diversification of an electricity supply system generally reduces
<P>
risk;
<P>
. some distribution systems may benefit from local generation;
<P>
. local economic and employment benefits may result.
<P>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
The relationship between wind speed, wind power and typical wind
turbine performance follows:
<P>
The power (P) available from a wind swept area (A) with wind blowing
at velocity (V) is given by the following formula.
<P>
P = 0.5 x D x A x V3
<P>
P = Wind Power (watts)
<P>
D = Air Density (kg/m3)
<P>
A = Swept Area (m2)
<P>
V = Wind Speed (m/s)
<P>
It is important to note that power is proportional to the wind
speed
<P>
cubed, and hence for relatively small increases in wind speed
large
<P>
increases in power can be observed.
<P>
Betz Limit of Wind Turbine Efficiency
<P>
There is a theoretical limit to the amount of power which can
be
<P>
extracted from the wind. This is termed the Betz limit. The Betz
<P>
limit stipulates that a perfect wind turbine can at best extract
59.3%
<P>
of the total power available. This limit was originally derived
by A.
<P>
Betz in 1927.
<P>
Modern Wind Turbine Efficiencies
<P>
At their design wind speed, modern wind turbines can extract as
much as
<P>
40% of the available power from the wind.
<P>
The amount of energy produced by a wind turbine per year depends
<P>
strongly on the selected site and the climatic conditions associated
<P>
with that site. An annual average wind speed of above 6 m/s defines
a
<P>
good wind site.
<P>
The wind turbine energy production vs. wind speed curve shows
that most
<P>
of the electrical energy is produced at wind speeds well above
the
<P>
average wind speed.
<P>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
The cost of wind generated electricity is very sensitive to the
available wind resource. For example, wind with a velocity of
8 m/s will provide more than twice the power of 6 m/s wind. In
countries with an established wind turbine manufacturing industry,
and a good wind resource, the cost of electricity from the wind
is about 5 to 7 cents/kWh (or about twice the current cost of
producing coal-fired electricity in NSW).
<P>
Several issues must be carefully assessed when planning to install
wind turbines. Wind energy is not completely environmentally benign,
only relatively so. The choice of a suitable site involves assessment
of the wind and the availability of the necessary electricity
transmission infrastructure. However, other issues must also be
addressed which are particular to wind generation:
<UL>
<LI>visual impact of the wind farm on the local community;
<LI>local noise annoyance;
<LI>electromagnetic interference;
<LI>impact on bird life;
<LI>safety aspects.
<MENU>
<LI>It is anticipated that these issues would be resolved in NSW
with appropriate planning and community consultation. As a first
step in this process Pacific Power is funding a $220,000 study
with the CSIRO Centre for Environmental Mechanics to identify
prime wind farm sites in NSW. Figure 3.2 shows areas that may
contain suitable conditions for wind generation in NSW.
<LI>Figure 3.2 - Wind Generation Study Areas in New South Wales.
<LI>It is difficult to assess the potential for wind energy generation
in NSW other than to say that it is anticipated that it will play
a small, but important role in the future electricity supply mix.
To provide a perspective on this technology and its possible utilisation
in NSW it is interesting to note that supply of just 1% of existing
electrical needs would require the installation of more than twenty
10 MW(e) wind farms.

<H5>3.2 Solar Photovoltaic</H5>

<P>
Photovoltaics (PV's) is the technology which uses thin sheets
of semiconductive material to directly transform sunlight into
electricity when illuminated.
<P>
The electricity is generated directly in the cell itself, and
so the process is virtually maintenance free except for cleaning
of the active surface as there are no moving parts in the system.
Another advantage of solar cells over concentrator type solar
thermal systems is that it is still possible for them to operate
in diffuse sunlight and in slightly overcast weather.
<P>
Production of solar photovoltaic cells began 30 years ago, with
cells of approximately 2% efficiency being developed for space
programmes. Now, cell efficiency at market level is approximately
14 - 15%. BP Solar are carrying out research here in Australia
and are now producing cells in a pilot production facility with
efficiencies of between 17 to 18%. Costs per watt have decreased
markedly, and research should see this continue whilst also providing
further increases in efficiency. The installed cost of photovoltaics
is still their major disadvantage, however, they still find practical
application for telecommunications, marine navigation, water pumping,
terrestrial applications and remote area power supplies.
<P>
Solar cells are made of 2 layers of a semiconductor material such
as silicon which is doped with minute quantities of other elements
to give n-type and p-type semiconductors. Sandwiching these together
gives what is termed a pn junction across which current flows.
This sets up an internal electric field which has a potential
difference of approximately 0.5 V.
<P>
Figure 3.3 - Construction of a Solar Photovoltaic Cell.
<P>
The electric current is then drawn by way of metal contacts which
are distributed across the negative and positive faces of the
cell. This necessary distribution of pick-ups also creates a problem
for cell efficiencies because the contacts create an area that
shades the semiconductor material. A great amount of research
goes into the practicalities of getting photons into the material,
quite apart from the movement of carriers within it.
<P>
A number of different forms of photovoltaic technology exist.
For example, there are concentrating and non-concentrating cells,
different cell materials such as silicon, gallium arsenide, and
compounds of copper with trace elements. Within the silicon cell
market, there are mono-crystalline, poly-crystalline and amorphous
silicon cells. Each type is being continually refined, and hence
efficiencies improved.
<P>
Professor Martin Green and his team at the University of NSW presently
hold the world record with a non-concentrating silicon cell at
an efficiency of 24.2%. Theoretically the maximum conceivable
efficiency would be of the order of 30%.
<P>
Professor Green also heads up the 'Centre for Photovoltaic Devices
and Systems'. One of the aims of this centre is to further research
into thin film silicon devices. This presently appears to be the
most promising of cells under research for the future. As well
as continuing with other cell research, part of the aim of the
centre is to look for specific sites within the electricity supply
network where PV's might best be used. Some examples are, preventing
the need for re-conductoring of heavily loaded lines approaching
thermal limits, reducing voltage drop at the end of single wire
earth return lines, and offsetting capital costs for upgrading
of thermally overloaded transformers.
<P>
The second largest application of solar cells in Australia provides
power for water pumping. This represents very good matching of
solar energy with water requirements because, usually, most water
is required when agricultural evaporation is high due to sunny
and hot conditions.
<P>
Solar cells are also being more widely used as Remote Area Power
Supplies (RAPS) where they can be economic in offsetting the cost
of diesel fuel for small communities, or single dwellings not
connected to the main electricity supply grid. PV cells can be
seen providing electricity for navigational aids on waterways,
lighting, electric fencing in remote areas, cathodic protection,
and outback telephone systems.
<P>
Presently, in Australia, solar cells would cost approximately
$6000/kW in large scale use. However, at least this much again
would be required for the balance of system costs, which includes
such items as power conditioning equipment and site installation
costs. By comparison, a coal-fired power station would cost around
$1200/kW for a coastal power station with access to lake or sea
water cooling, plus the cost of developing a coal mine to supply
the power station and bulk transmission cost.
<P>
Even given the dramatic reduction in cell costs over the years,
and the fact that photovoltaic generation would probably be connected
at distribution voltage level, some time would be required before
cells could compete on a large scale grid connected basis. The
availability of electricity would only correspond to the availability
of sunlight, and thus, could not directly compete as a reliable
alternative, without the added expense of storage such as a battery.
<P>
This in no way negates the goal of improving the viability of
solar cells. Specific site application has shown them to be viable,
and their generality of use will only increase as research continues
to reduce costs.
<H6>Types of Cells</H6>

<P>
Silicon is the second most abundant material on earth, and is
the most common material used in solar cells.
<P>
There are three major types of silicon solar cells.
<P>
Amorphous: These cells do not possess a regular crystal structure.
They can be produced in films of 0.3 microns and their production
is relatively simple and cheap. Mass production of these cells
is quite easy, with small amounts of material being deposited
on to a substrate such as glass or aluminium, and can even be
made flexible.
<P>
Their major drawback is their low efficiency and short lifespan.
Presently, efficiencies are only 5-7%, however this drops to 3-4%
in operation due to amorphous silicon instabilities. It is generally
used for small scale applications such as calculators and watches.
<P>
Poly-crystalline: These cells consist of a number of silicon crystals
grown as an ingot from which wafers are cut. Their maximum efficiency
is generally 15% and is standard material for high output applications.
Its layers are of the order of 250-400 microns thick.
<P>
Mono-crystalline: These are the highest efficiency silicon cells
available, however in the past their expense has generally precluded
them from anything except &quot;space&quot; applications where
the sun shines nearly all day. Recent developments in mono-crystalline
cell technology has seen their cost reduced to around that of
the poly-crystalline cell. Mono-crystalline cells consist only
of a single crystal.
<P>
Cells other than silicon are available, and some, such as gallium
arsenide, have efficiencies higher than that of silicon. They
are more efficient because their particular band-gap energies
are closer to the theoretical optimum than silicon. They do however
use materials which are more expensive, less abundant, and can
be environmentally hazardous.
<P>
Because different semi-conductor materials absorb different portions
of the solar spectrum, the possiblility of piggy-backing them
to produce a tandem cell has been investigated. These then absorb
much more of the incident radiation than either material would
alone. Once again, however, their cost is much greater than silicon
cells, even on a unit energy delivered basis.
<H5>3.3 Solar Thermal</H5>

<H6>Introduction</H6>

<P>
Solar thermal does not create electricity directly as does photovoltaic
technology but rather uses solar collectors to heat a fluid, usually
water. The resulting heat may then be used either directly, as
hot water (e.g. domestic hot water system), or process heat, which
is when solar energy systems are at their most efficient (e.g.
domestic hot water system), or may supply preheating, or indeed
steam, for turning a heat engine and generator.
<P>
The solar collectors are the heart of the system and their design
determines the final application and efficiency. The critical
factors are the amount and temperature of solar energy collection
that they provide.
<P>
Flat plate solar collectors are commonly used for heating water
or air for a range of domestic and industrial applications. This
collector provides no concentration and its maximum operating
temperature is generally around 80 degrees Celsius.
<P>
To reach higher temperatures efficiently, some concentration needs
to be employed. Concentration to give high temperatures offers
advantages of more efficient heat transfer, higher theoretical
steam cycle efficiencies, and subsequently a much wider range
of applications. However higher temperatures require greater emphasis
upon reducing thermal losses. As well as this, the greater the
concentration, the greater can be the detrimental effect of cloud
cover or hazy days.
<H6>Solar Thermal Systems</H6>

<P>
Residential flat plate collectors are presently installed on about
5% of NSW homes. The Pacific Power and Sydney University are collaborating
in the testing of a system using a mildly concentrating trough
with an evacuated tube collector. It can supply not only hot water
but space heating and cooking requirements as well. Investigations
show that with one day's storage, solar collection could supply
up to 90% of the thermal loads of a household. The reason for
this and its inherent advantages over other solar systems, is
that it can be designed to give a winter bias, which is when thermal
energy is most needed. A home in the Sydney region has been retrofitted
with such a system and data is now being collected. In keeping
with the whole concept of energy efficiency, a 12-star equivalent
refrigerator, insulation, and compact fluorescent lighting have
also been installed for evaluation.
<P>
Solar Cogeneration: In terms of solar cogeneration, a practical
study was co-funded by Pacific Power in 1991 to look at the provision
of electrical energy and process heat for applications such as
hospitals and process industries. The energy for the production
of steam would be supplied by high temperature collectors. Though
technically viable, none of the sites studied would presently
be economically viable against gas-fired systems or grid electricity.
<P>
Industrial process heat is the largest single energy sector in
Australia, amounting to some 900 PJ annually. Of this, 15% is
below 200 degrees Celsius and 50% below 500 degrees Celsius. Present
solar collector technology could provide the former, and higher
temperature collectors under refinement could provide much of
the latter. Some estimates predict that low temperature steam
could be provided by mass-produced solar collectors at around
2 c/kWh.
<P>

be supplied by high temperature collectors. Though technically
viable, none of the sites studied would presently be economically
viable against gas-fired systems or grid electricity.
<P>
Large-Scale Grid Connection: Electricity generation can be provided
24 hours per day by using a solar and gas system, with the gas
providing super-heat or backup to that steam provided by solar
energy. Sites in NSW such as Cobar could be ideal for this technology
since there is a gas supply available and the number of hours
of sunshine per year are high. The largest solar installations
in the world are the 275 MW solar thermal electricity plants installed
by LUZ in Southern Calfornia.
<P>
The solar array is composed of parabolic trough reflectors which
individually track the sun's movement with microprocessors and
light sensing instruments. The light is concentrated on to evacuated
tubes through which a synthetic oil, heat transfer fluid flows.
Temperatures of nearly 400 degrees Celsius are possible. This
is used to produce super-heated steam via a heat exchanger, with
natural gas fuel as a supplement. The power plant produces electricity
with a peak solar to electric efficiency of approximately 25%.
<P>
Average solar radiation at these LUZ sites is similar to that
at Broken Hill in NSW. SEGS VIII, LUZ's largest project so far,
sized at 80 MW(e), is designed for an annual output of 252.7 GWh.
It has 464 000 square metres of collecting surface area, and occupies
an area of some 300 hectares.
<P>
A small-scale demonstration plant was installed at White Cliffs,
Western New South Wales, using 14 parabolic dishes. The dishes
themselves performed extremely well, however, there were problems
with the steam engine and oil separation system. Larger systems
(greater than 5 MW(e)) which can use steam turbines rather than
engines are expected to give greater overall performance, and
also cost reductions due to economies of scale.
<P>
Central Receiver Systems: These use the heliostats in a reflective
arrangement to generate very high temperatures at a single point.
Though this offers greater turbine efficiency, their capital cost
is higher.
<P>
Solar Ponds: Such a system is most attractive for arid regions
of Australia where there is accompanying high salinity. Technically,
this process is quite feasible. A 250,000 square metres, 5 MW(e)
pond in Israel collects heat at an efficiency of 16%. A demonstration
pond at Curtin Springs in the Northern Territory quotes costs
of around $10,800/kW with energy supplied at 16.6 c/kWh. Further
development is required to make this system viable in the future.
<P>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<H6>Evacuated Tube Solar Water Heaters</H6>

<P>
Convection and conduction losses become more serious as high temperature
applications are attempted, and it became apparent very early
on in research, that evacuating the space between the glass cover
and the absorber surface would yield much improved performance.
<P>
Figure 3.4 - Solar House Retrofit Project.
<P>
Evacuated flat plate collectors have been investigated, however
are unable to withstand atmospheric pressure without costly mechanical
reinforcement. Tubes have been shown that they can withstand such
pressures.
<P>
The combination of the vacuum (which reduces convection and conduction
losses) and a selective surface (which reduces radiation losses)
means that while evacuated tubes do not offer efficiency improvements
over flat plates at temperatures around 80 degrees Celsius, they
do allow higher temperatures to be reached, up to 350 degrees
Celsius.
<P>
Evacuated tubes have solar energy concentrated on them by a reflective
surface. These surfaces range from flat white painted diffuse
reflectors with no concentration and optical efficiencies of 53%
to highly reflective, concentrating, parabolic troughs with optical
efficiencies of greater than 90%.
<H6>Selective Surfaces</H6>

<P>
Solar energy is a form of electromagnetic radiation whose wavelength
ranges from about 0.3 to 2.5 microns. When this strikes a surface,
some is reflected, some absorbed, and the remainder transmitted
through. Materials are then chosen to suit the application. For
example, in the hot, arid regions of the world, houses are usually
painted white to reflect as much of the radiation as possible.
However, in a solar collector, black coatings are used to absorb
as much of the heat as possible. A problem arises here, however,
in that the more heat that is absorbed, the hotter the surface
gets, and thus the more radiation that the surface emits back
to its environment as a loss. This is what prevents standard flat
plate collectors reaching temperatures much above 80 degrees Celsius.
Loss of heat through emittance is especially a problem in areas
with cold, clear nights. It explains for example, why pools are
often warmer after a cloudy night.
<P>
The emittance from a hot surface is at a higher wavelength than
the solar radiation which heats it initially, and this is why
a selective black surface is a more efficient means of collection
than conventional black surfaces. A selective surface uses a specially
selected combination of materials to allow the sunlight portion
of the spectrum in, but which has very low emissivity in the infra-red
range, and therefore lose very little heat through re-radiation.
<P>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<H5>3.4 Wave Energy</H5>

<P>
Waves are not regarded as a large energy source in NSW, as wave
energy is reduced significantly by the existence of the continental
shelf along the coastline. Suitably sited, however, wave energy
may be beneficial to coastal communities remote from the electricity
supply network.
<H6>Wave Formation</H6>

<P>
Energy is transmitted to the ocean from the winds through friction
between the air and the surface of the seas across which they
blow. As winds derive their energy from solar gradients, wave
energy is an indirect by-product of solar energy. Contrary to
popular belief the water in a wave does not actually travel but
merely oscillates while the energy of the wave is translated across
the surface of the ocean.
<P>
The power in a wave is equal to the product of the potential energy
per unit area and the phase velocity of the wave train. The average
power flux in kW/m can be calculated from the expression P = 0.5H2T
(approx) where H is the significant wave height at the location
and T is the dominant wave period.
<P>
Preliminary estimates of some NSW sites yields wave energies of
approximately 12 kW/m of coastline. Thus a 120 kW device would
need to be 10m wide at this location. Ideal on-shore sites yield
wave energies of 25 kW/m.
<P>
A study commissioned by Pacific Power and completed in 1991 investigated
suitability of sites along the New South Wales coastline. The
NSW coast wave power is not high enough for long enough to be
presently viable.
<P>
Costs for a prototype device are estimated to be of the order
of $3000/kW.
<P>
It is estimated that some 1 000 000 GWh of wave energy is dissipated
each year along the southern shores of Australia.
<P>
A number of attempts have been made to harness the perennial motion
of the ocean. These include such devices as the Nodding Duck,
Cockerell Raft, Circular Sea Clam, Bristol Cylinder, the Frog,
and a Swedish Wave Rotor. However the two devices which have shown
the most promise are the Tapchan and the oscillating water chamber:
<P>
Tapchan: The principle here is capital intensive yet very simple.
Waves moving forward through a tapered channel rise and spill
over the sides into an elevated reservoir, from which water can
be released through a turbine as in a hydro system. The advantages
here lie in the buffer storage which dampens the irregularity
of the waves.
<P>
Oscillating Water Chamber: A number of versions of this technology
exist, however essentially as the wave rolls in a column of water
is forced upwards through a cylinder, the pocket of air trapped
above being blown through an air turbine which in turn drives
a generator. As the wave rolls out, air is drawn back through
the air turbine. The profile of the turbine blades are designed
so that they continue to spin the turbine in the same direction
no matter what the direction of airflow. This allows energy to
be extracted from the air as the wave rolls in and also as it
recedes.
<P>
Figure 3.5 - Wave Resonance Power Generation.
<P>
Installation of a number of different sized chambers allows maximum
use to be made of different period waves in resonating chambers.
<H6>Data Collection</H6>

<P>
Wave data is collected using wave-rider buoys. These are large
spherical steel floats which house the electronic processing equipment.
The heart of this equipment, is an accelerometer which responds
to the vertical movements of the buoy. Integration of wave movement
via a microprocessor calculates wave velocities in the vertical
direction, and as a result can calculate wave displacement data.
A solar cell powered transmitter sitting atop the buoy then relays
the data to a shore based receiver. This data is compiled on computer
for processing and assessment.
<P>
Eight wave rider buoys have been deployed along the NSW coast,
and are constantly compiling data which is useful for investigating
wave power potential. This data is used for a variety of engineering
projects along the coast including wharves and jetties, foreshore
developments, storm damage, etc.
<P>
A New Zealand device for wave energy measurement consists of a
seismograph on the shore, monitoring the energy of breaking waves
and correlating this data to wave height.
<H5>3.5 Biomass</H5>

<P>
The extraction of energy from biomass is understood to mean two
processes: first, large-scale production of liquid or gaseous
fuel from plants or crops specially cultivated for this purpose;
second, biological recovery of combustible gas from organic waste
commonly known as biogas.
<P>
The potential and economics of these two processes are clearly
different. The utilization of crops and plants for energy production
purposes is, in general, not practicable on a large scale. In
addition to this, it still has to be proved whether the substantial
input of energy by way of manuring, sowing, tilling the fields,
harvesting and transport can be recovered anyway. Last but certainly
not least, the harmful effect of monocultures on the environment
with large amounts of fertilisers, insecticides, pesticides and
herbicides would be difficult to justify.
<P>
So far, most of the emphasis has been on the useful energy obtained
from organic waste which is considered to be zero cost. The waste
may be used for energy production in many ways. The direct combustion
of such waste for process heat and electricity generation is finding
increasing application. However, such waste must be used within
reasonably close proximity to its point of origin to compensate
for its high collection cost and to avoid the high cost of transportation
to the point of use.
<P>
In principle, many farms could provide themselves with the energy
they need from their own organic waste. One of the main advantages
of biogas is that the gas which is generated is produced where
biomass accumulates as a waste material.
<P>
Biogas systems have been in widespread use for more than 30 years,
especially in Third World countries. India has a few hundred thousand
simple facilities of this kind, whilst in China about 7 million
operate.
<P>
Compared with other energy generation facilities, construction
and operation of a biogas facility is a simple and straightforward
task. Animal excrements and plant waste are the source of energy
used. They are reduced in size and mixed before being placed in
a fermentation tank. The organic waste decomposes under anaerobic
(ie. without oxygen) conditions as a result of its exposure to
microbes naturally present, generating combustible gases in the
process. The only prerequisite for proper fermentation is correct
acidity and operating in a specific temperature range so that
the microbes thrive. Pesticides, disinfectants and antibiotics
must be avoided as they are likely to bring the fermentation process
to a halt.
<P>
Figure 3.6 - Floating Bell Biogas Producer Schematic Diagram.
<P>
The biogas generated in this way consists primarily of 40-70%
methane and 30-60% carbon dioxide. If the gas contains 60% methane,
it has a calorific value of 70% of natural gas. The yield generated
by a biogas facility depends above all on the composition of the
waste material to be fermented and the ambient temperature. If
this temperature is low, up to 50% of the gas generated can be
required afterwards for heating the biomass.
<P>
The other product generated by the process is odourless and hygienic
compost which is ideally suited for use as a fertiliser, provided
the biomass was free of toxic substances such as heavy metals.
<P>
Biogas generation facilities are used mainly by family operated
farms and, in particular, by farms keeping their own livestock.
Using fermentation tanks with a capacity of 6-25 cubed metres,
small and medium-sized farms mainly generate their own energy
for cooking and lighting. The following figures provide basic
orientation on the capacities available. Using the dung of four
head of cattle or 10 pigs, a farm can produce approximately 2
cubed metres of gas and 100 L of sludge manure a day in a 10 cubed
metres facility. This gas is sufficient for:
<P>
. cooking three meals for a family of eight, or
<P>
. running a refrigerator all day and burning a lamp for
<P>
three hours, or
<P>
. generating electricity for one hour with a 3 kW motor
<P>
generator.
<P>
The bright light of gas lamps is generated by incandescent mantles.
Gas operated refrigerators are ammonia absorption refrigerators,
biogas serving merely as the external heating supply. The gas
motors for driving power generators, in turn, are modified diesel
or petrol engines. Any corrosion caused by the hydrogen sulphide
in biogas is kept within limits by changing the oil regularly.
<P>
The production and use of biogas for energy generation has significant
environmental implications. The biogas as it is produced contains
major greenhouse gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide. It
is estimated that methane is 8 times more potent a greenhouse
gas than is carbon dioxide. Therefore by burning the methane gas
produced, which would otherwise have escaped to atmosphere, carbon
dioxide is formed and the overall addition of greenhouse gases
to the atmosphere is less. The environmental benefit is further
enhanced by using the biogas to generate energy, thus reducing
the amount of fossil fuel required to match energy demand. The
utilization of biogas is not only of benefit to the environment,
but has the potential to provide economic returns as well.
<H5>3.6 Waste Incineration</H5>

<P>
In 1989 there were 3.75 million tonnes of solid waste disposed
of in the Sydney region. The quantity of waste being disposed
of is increasing both in total and on a per capita basis. It is
estimated that at these rates, annual waste quantities would increase
to some 5.5 million tonnes by 2001 and by as much as 7.1 million
tonnes by 2011.
<P>
Waste analysis programs carried out by the then Waste Management
Authority (WMA) indicate the average composition of council collected
garbage are those shown in the following table:
<H6>Figure 3.7 - Average composition of council collected garbage
</H6>

<P>
Component of Waste Weight % (as received)
<P>
----------------------------------------------------------
<P>
paper products 20.9
<P>
food waste 27.5
<P>
garden waste 20.5
<P>
plastics 7.6
<P>
wood, rubber, textiles 4.3
<P>
metals 6.3
<P>
glass 9.3
<P>
fines 3.6
<P>
It is important to note that solid wastes are not homogeneous
in nature but are a mixture of both combustible and non-combustible
materials which vary from location to location and over time.
<P>
Apart from avoiding waste from the very beginning and recycling
the waste produced, one of the best methods of waste management
for the future is to burn it in a refuse fuelled power station.
<P>
An international comparison shows that countries with little space
for waste disposal sites make greater use of incineration technologies.
While the incineration of household waste in the European Community
member countries averages only 20%, the corresponding figures
for Japan and Switzerland are 65% and 80% respectively.
<P>
The energy content of household waste varies greatly. This energy
can be recovered in waste incineration. The relative contribution
of waste incineration to the overall generation of energy is small,
hardly exceeding 1% of the national consumption of primary energy
in any country. However, considered from the perspective of plant
technology, conventional waste incineration is a well-developed
process.
<P>
The technology of waste incineration provides two distinct advantages.
The first is the reduction in volume of disposed wastes to about
5% of the original volume (or about 20-30% of the original weight)
and the second is the utilization of the energy produced for the
generation of electricity.
<P>
The scarcity of landfill sites and the increasing difficulty in
obtaining approval for future disposal sites, particularly in
built-up areas such as the Sydney Basin, is forcing other disposal
options to be considered. Waste incineration whilst it is not
necessarily the whole answer, will be an important consideration
in the assessment of options for future disposal.
<P>
The WMA Strategic Plan has included the use of incineration as
an alternative to the long distance transfer of waste away from
the metropolitan area. The WMA also indicate that a strategy of
progressive implementation of three incinerators (1000 tonnes/day)
during the planning period of 2001 to 2011 would require an investment
of the order of $450 million in 1988 values.
<H6>Technologies</H6>

<P>
The technologies for the incineration of wastes can be divided
in two distinct categories. The first has been developed for the
incineration of domestic refuse and sewage sludge, whilst the
second has been developed for the incineration of industrial refuse
and sludge.
<P>
Domestic incinerators consist of a moving grate, of which there
are numerous designs and onto which the garbage is dumped (some
of the more common designs are known as the roller grate, tilting
grate, step type travelling grate and the inclined grate). Combustion
air is passed from beneath the grate through the burning garbage.
The heat produced is used for the production of steam. Residence
time in the incinerator can be strictly controlled by varying
the grate speed and hence avoiding emission problems caused by
incomplete combustion.
<P>
There are two types of industrial refuse and sludge incineration
plant, namely the rotary kiln and the fluidised bed.
<P>
Both domestic and industrial waste disposal methods rely on the
concept of complete 'burnout' of the waste. This is done to minimise
the pollutants contained in combustion gases. Complete 'burnout'
is best achieved by high temperatures, long residence times and
by good mixing of the combustion gases.
<P>
The heat produced from the combustion of waste material is transferred
to banks of water wall tubes for the production of steam which
in turn is used to drive a steam turbine and electrical generator.
This process of steam raising is similar in design to some of
the other technologies discussed throughout this document, for
instance fluidised bed combustion technologies and combined cycle.
<P>
Once the heat contained in the combustion gases is transferred
to the steam circuit, pollution control equipment is used to reduce
harmful pollutants. Burning of domestic and industrial refuse,
leads to emissions of pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen
oxides, carbon monoxide and particulate matter. Depending on the
nature of refuse, it is expected that the refuse residue should
only contain low levels of organic compounds and heavy metals.
Waste incineration plants can operate with minimum impact on the
environment by employing emission control equipment such as flue
gas desulphurisation for the control of sulphur dioxide and acid
gases, a thermal nitrogen oxides removal system for control of
nitrogen oxides and a high efficiency particulate collection device
such as a fabric filter for removal of solids and heavy metals
carried along by the exhaust gases.
<P>
The size of waste incineration plants is often quoted in terms
of the mass of refuse consumed per hour rather than the maximum
electrical output. This is useful because the energy contained
in the refuse feed can vary substantially with time and hence
the maximum electrical energy generated also varies. Common incinerator
sizes are between 5 and 30 tonnes per hour. Plant sizes are generally
between 15 and 30 MW of electrical output. For waste tonnages
greater than this, it is usual to install a number of these units
in a single facility.
<P>
The energy contained in domestic garbage is approximately 8-10
MJ/kg or 30-40% of the energy content of black coal.
<P>
Industrial refuse incineration generally excludes the burning
of scrap tyres. Because of the nature of manufacture of tyres,
the tyre combustion process releases a significant amount of potentially
toxic air pollutants such as arsenic, cadmium, dioxins, furans
and other trace heavy metals.
<P>
Therefore, tyre combustion requires &quot;Best Available Control
Technology&quot; (BACT) for the control of emissions. To achieve
this level of environmental control a significant amount of expenditure
is required which adds significantly to the total cost of the
incineration plant. For this reason, the current practice of waste
disposal is to separate scrap tyres from other wastes.
<P>
Tyre combustion technology has already proven to be clean, safe,
odourless and virtually pollution free at a power plant constructed
at Modesto, California, U.S.A. The plant can burn up to 6 million
tyres per year. Whole scrap tyres are fed into two identical incineration
plants at a rate of about 6.5 tonnes/hour and burned under carefully
controlled conditions. Combustion is carried out at a temperature
of 1100 degrees Celsius to produce 14 MW of electric power. This
relatively high temperature combustion process ensures the complete
burnout of the tyres. Together with complete air quality control,
the operation of this facility has been claimed to be environmentally
safe.
<H5>3.7 Landfill Gas</H5>

<P>
Landfill gas refers to the formation of combustible gases from
garbage dumps through primarily anaerobic decomposition of organic
wastes (mostly food, garden and paper wastes). The gas produced
consists predominantly of methane and carbon dioxide and contains
40-60% of the energy content of natural gas.
<P>
Some 3.75 million tonnes of solid waste were disposed of in the
Sydney region in 1989, and as much as 7.1 million tonnes annually
are projected by the year 2011. These wastes not only represent
a significant problem in terms of disposal urban areas such as
Sydney but also a large potential energy resource.
<P>
Driven by environmental concerns during the 1950's investigations
were carried out around the world into the characteristics of
landfills over their lifetime and the constituents of the odorous
gases produced. It was found that the wastes decomposed in the
presence of moisture and the action of anaerobic bacteria, producing
methane and carbon dioxide. As well as these gases being produced,
other gases were released including nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen
and traces of hydrogen sulphide (rotten egg gas) resulting in
the foul odours normally associated with garbage dumps.
<P>
Methane as a gas contributes significantly to the greenhouse effect
and contributes 6 times more to global warming than does carbon
dioxide on a molecule for molecule basis. For this reason there
is an advantage in burning this methane to produce energy, which
although producing carbon dioxide has less impact on the greenhouse
effect.
<P>
The decomposition of garbage commences soon after collection with
the initial process being aerobically activated and the gases
produced consisting mainly of carbon dioxide. Once the garbage
has been compacted into the landfill the remaining oxygen is consumed
and anaerobic conditions prevail. This is then suitable, providing
moisture is present, for the production of methane.
<P>
The technology for using landfill gas as a fuel source for power
generation, using gas turbines or engines is well established.
In 1975, the USA started utilising landfill gas at Palos Verdes
in southern California and since then more than 70 sites have
been developed. In Germany more than 50 sites now exploit this
gas and in Britain there are 24 commercial schemes drawing gas
from 18 locations with a further 26 schemes either in advanced
planning stages or under construction.
<P>
In the Sydney region there are two projects presently underway.
The first located at Merrylands was originally the site of an
old brickworks excavation which was filled with approximately
700,000 tonnes of garbage between 1979 and 1985 and now produces
about 700 cubed metres per hour of landfill gas. Most of this
site has now been dressed with soil and landscaped. About 7 years
ago the then Waste Management Authority began selling this gas
to the local brick works for firing its kilns. More recently,
however, the brickworks have ceased operation and a 165kW engine
and generator have now been installed to utilise the gas for generating
electricity. This project has been a joint effort between Prospect
Electricity, Waste Management Authority and Pacific Power and
will provide valuable operating experience for future use of this
technology.
<P>
The second project located at Lucas Heights, south-west of Sydney,
is planned to be larger than the Merrylands project and will be
built, owned and operated by a private company as a commercial
venture. There is estimated to be at least 0.5 PJ per annum (initially
some 3000 cubed metres per hour) of gas at this location which
is sufficient to generate on average 5 MW of electricity over
the next 15 years.

<H4>Chapter 4 </H4>

<H4>Energy Storage Systems</H4>

<MENU>
<LI>4.1 Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES)
<LI>4.2 Batteries
</MENU>

<H4>4.1 Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES)</H4>

<P>
Compressed air energy storage (CAES) offers a means of storing
excess electrical energy available during 'offpeak' periods, usually
during the night, for recovery during the 'peak' demand periods
of early morning and evenings. By storing energy, utilities can
avoid the installation of more power stations to cover the peak
electricity demand.
<P>
There are five above-ground components required by the basic CAES
installation.
<MENU>
<LI>1. The motor/generator which employs clutches to provide for
alternate engagement to the compressor or turbine trains.
<LI>2. The air compressor which may require two or more stages,
intercoolers and aftercoolers to achieve economy of compression,
and reduce the moisture content.
<LI>3. The turbine train, high and low pressure turbines.
<LI>4. Equipment control centre for operating the combustion turbine,
compressor, and auxiliaries and to regulate and control changeover
from generation mode to storage mode.
<LI>5. Auxiliary equipment consisting of fuel storage and handling,
and mechanical and electrical systems to support various heat
exchangers required to support the operation of the facility.
</MENU>

<H5>Figure 4.1 - Compressed Air Energy Storage</H5>

<P>
In the power generation mode, compressed air is mixed with fuel
and expanded through a modified gas turbine driving the electrical
machine as a generator. In storage mode the electrical machine
is used to drive the compressor which compresses the air into
the underground storage for later use.
<P>
The introduction of natural gas in the generating mode of the
CAES cycle allows increased 'peak' power production, than would
otherwise be available from the recovery of compressed air.
<P>
The CAES system is similar in principle to a 'pumped' hydro scheme.
A pumped hydro scheme is basically conventional hydro where by
the water is passed through a water turbine to produce electricity.
During 'offpeak' times, however, the water can be pumped back
to a high elevation in preparation for the next 'peak' period.
<H5>Siting of CAES Plants</H5>

<P>
Compressed air for CAES plant is stored underground either in
man made excavations or in naturally occurring porous rock media.
Plant siting requires favourable geology for the air storage reservoir
as well as suitable location near transmission lines and fuel
supplies.
<P>
Geological/Geotechnical criteria in the selection of potential
sites for underground storage are grouped into three categories.
<UL>
<LI>Underground rock caverns created by excavating comparatively
hard and impervious rock formations.
<LI>Salt caverns created by solution or dry mining of salt formations.
<MENU>
<LI>There are no potential locations in NSW where large salt caverns
could be created.
</MENU>

<LI>Porous media reservoirs made by water bearing aquifers or
depleted gas or oil fields e.g., sandstone, fissured limestone.
</UL>

<P>
In a gas turbine 50-60% of the energy produced by the power turbine
is consumed by the compressor. If compression is carried out at
a different time to when power generation is needed, ie, by CAES,
the peak power which the gas turbine can generate is increased
by this amount, and hence additional plant is not required to
be installed.
<P>
Rock caverns may be operated either with 'hydraulic compensation'
(an interconnected surface reservoir) which provides constant
pressure as the water level and hence volume of the cavern varies
as air is released or stored, or, dry where the pressure varies
because the cavern maintains the same volume. Water curtains surrounding
the caverns may be used to control air leakage. The principal
geotechnical criteria for rock caverns are rock mass, strength
and stability, depth, and structure such that they will contain
air with minimal losses.
<P>
Principal requirements for an aquifer to be a candidate for CAES
include:
<UL>
<LI>Structure which entraps the air. Strata is porous enough to
contain sufficient air at the desired pressure and permeable enough
to allow the flow of air which is required by the facility.
<LI>Overlain by an impermeable rock strata which will prevent
vertical movement of the fluid from the storage zone.
<LI>Mineralogy which will not result in oxidation reactions and
reaction products which would consume the oxygen contained in
the stored air.
<LI>Be located at sufficient depths to allow safe operation at
required pressures.
</UL>

<P>
Future developments of CAES include the addition of recuperators
to extract heat from the compressed air during the charging cycle
and to heat the air on discharge. This will substantially improve
efficiency of the CAES system but still requires advances in materials
of construction for recuperators.
<P>
The Huntorf plant in West Germany rated at 290 MW(e) operated
from 1978 and over 10 years showed 90% availability and 99% starting
reliability. In Alabama USA a 110 MW(e) plant is scheduled for
operation in 1991 and a 1050 MW(e) plant is being proposed for
the Donbass region in the USSR.
<P>
Italy has operated a small 25 MW(e) CAES research facility based
on aquifer storage. It is also understood that Israel is interested
in building a 3 x 100 MW(e) CAES facility using fractured hard
rock aquifers.
<H4>4.2 Batteries</H4>

<P>
Demand for electricity varies according to time of day, leading
to corresponding peaks and troughs in the amount of electricity
being generated. Load levelling by matching customer needs to
system capability can be achieved by a variety of means. Through
'demand-side' planning and management, load patterns can be controlled
by influencing the electricity demands of customers. Although
this planning is very effective, removing the peaks and troughs
totally from energy demand is not feasible. For this reason energy
storage facilities find application in the storing of 'offpeak'
energy during periods of low demand (for example overnight) for
use during 'peak' periods (morning and evenings) as the customer
requires. One energy storage technology receiving a great deal
of attention worldwide is that of the so-called 'giant' battery.
<P>
As well as providing an excellent source of energy storage, batteries
can also provide a number of other significant benefits to the
electricity industry. They have been found useful for assisting
in maintaining the stability of electricity transmission networks,
particularly during fault conditions, whilst also providing instantaneous
replacement power, should a power generating unit trip off line
for any reason.
<P>
Batteries are generally named after the chemical components which
in combination produce the electrical energy. Typical battery
systems being investigated worldwide are included in the Table
below:
<P>
Figure 4.2 - Typical Battery Systems.
<P>
The conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy is a
well established science and in some cases has been performed
with energy conversion efficiencies quoted at greater than 90%.
Whilst not all battery systems can claim such high energy conversion
efficiency, it is not unusual for efficiencies to exceed 70%.
Power conversion to convert DC to AC would typically be around
95% for large convertors.
<P>
In 1988, in the United States, Southern California Edison installed
a 10 MW(e), 4 hour capacity lead/acid battery. Known as the Chino
plant it was constructed for demonstration purposes and to investigate
operational and maintenance characteristics. As a grid connected
power station this battery has been quoted as being the largest
in the world, although it actually consists of more than 8200
individual battery units.
<P>
With continued investigations and development of battery construction,
materials and electrolytes, batteries may play an increasing role
in the supply of electricity and electricity supply management.

<MENU>
<LI>5.1 Superconductivity
<LI>5.2 High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC)
</MENU>

<H4>5.1 Superconductivity</H4>

<P>
The prospect of obtaining &quot;zero loss&quot; electrical conductors
has produced a great deal of interest since superconductivity
was discovered by Onnes in 1911 and for which in 1913, he received
the Nobel prize for physics.
<P>
The transmission of electricity to load centres ultimately leads
to energy losses and hence reduces the overall efficiency of electricity
supplied to consumers. Superconductivity refers to the transmission
of electricity with no losses.
<P>
Until recently superconductivity was only possible at temperatures
approaching absolute zero (-273 degrees Celsius) and in the case
of metallic elements the highest temperature achievable has been
for niobium at -266 degrees Celsius. Recent discoveries using
complex chemical compounds has increased this temperature to -148
degrees Celsius and has led to new speculations about the potential
impact on the operation of the electricity supply industry.
<P>
It is useful to note some limitations of superconducting materials.
<MENU>
<LI>(i) They have some losses for alternating current applications.
<LI>(ii) They maintain their superconductivity only while operated
below certain temperature limits, current density and magnetic
field.
<LI>(iii) The cost of cooling is considerable.
<LI>(iv) The new, high temperature superconductors are made from
ceramic materials, not easily formed into wires.
</MENU>

<P>
Helium-cooled (&quot;low temperature&quot;) superconducting materials
have been widely used, particularly in large magnets. Of more
direct relevance to the electricity supply industry are demonstration
models of high voltage cables, generators and magnetic energy
storage devices which have been developed, but of which none are
in regular service.
<P>
With lower refrigeration requirements, the new liquid nitrogen
cooled high temperature superconductors may find a number of applications,
but much development work is still required.
<H4>5.2 High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC)</H4>

<P>
Some very early power supply systems used direct current (DC).
Now, throughout the world, electricity supply is almost always
done with alternating current (AC) systems. This is because AC
allows simple transformers to be used to change the supply voltage
from the very high levels required for bulk transmission, to the
lower levels required for distribution systems and the even lower
levels at which power is supplied to consumers.
<P>
In the past few decades, High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) connections
have been built in some countries between AC supply systems. HVDC
systems can be used to transmit large amounts of power over long
distances more economically than AC transmission. However, the
relatively high cost of AC to DC converter equipment has meant
that it has not yet been applied in Australia.
<P>
One consideration with very large AC systems (such as that which
connects New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia) is that
all the generators connected must rotate at exactly the same rate
for the whole system to &quot;remain in synchronism&quot;. The
connection of separate systems via a HVDC link avoids this necessity
and the power that it transmits can be rapidly regulated to enhance
the stability of the connected systems.
<P>
A HVDC link is being considered for a possible interconnection
between the New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian systems
and the Queensland system. Options being considered include the
conversion of existing 330 kV AC transmission lines to HVDC lines.

Pacific Power is highly committed to the development and implementation
of technologies which improve the environmental acceptability
of power stations. To date Pacific Power's concern for the environment
has seen significant firsts in emission control and in the reduction
to the point of 'zero discharges' of waste water from power station
sites.
<P>
Combustion of fossil fuels inevitably generates carbon dioxide
which is a highly significant greenhouse gas and there are no
reasonable procedures or technologies for retaining carbon dioxide
within the power station. There are, however, new power station
technologies which help to provide an improvement through higher
efficiency and hence smaller output of carbon dioxide per unit
of energy generated.
<P>
In addition to this, fuel selection can influence the amount of
carbon dioxide produced. Carbon dioxide emissions decrease with
decreasing carbon to hydrogen ratio in the fuel; accordingly from
coal to oil to gas and ultimately hydrogen. Consequently, moisture
in the combustion gases is increased for higher hydrogen content
fuels. Naturally this is one factor which favours the use of natural
gas as a replacement fuel for coal and oil and the development
of hydrogen as a fuel for transport.
<P>
Another serious but technically manageable factor is the emission
of pollutants into the atmosphere. Each year consumption of fossil
fuels worldwide releases an estimated 80 million tonnes of nitrogen
oxides, 140 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide, 300 million tonnes
of dust and similarly large amounts of hydrocarbons.
<P>
With the burden on the environment, industrialised countries are
implementing counter measures and it is the introduction of new
technologies, improved efficiencies and government policies that
the problem is now being addressed.
<H4>6.1 Flue Gas Desulphurisation</H4>

<P>
Acid rain is the subject of considerable concern throughout the
world, particularly in Europe where it is now regarded as fact
that pollutants play a major part in the current damage to lakes
and forests. In New South Wales, however, the low sulphur content
of locally mined coal, which the Commission uses, significantly
reduces missions of sulphur dioxide in flue gases. Pacific Power
has participated in a study under the National, Energy, Research,
Development and Demonstration programme to analyse the acidity
of precipitation in the Hunter region. The study concluded that
precipitation acidity was equivalent to or slightly greater than
background.
<P>
Pacific Power maintains a watching brief on technologies for sulphur
control as well as the associated capital and operating costs
of such facilities. The most common flue gas desulphurisation
technology available (scrubbing devices) can add up to 40% to
the investment value of a conventional coal fired power station.
A brief description of the more relevant technologies follows.
<H5>6.1.1 Wet Scrubbing</H5>

<P>
Perhaps the most widely used technology for the desulphurisation
of flue gases is 'Wet Scrubbing'. The technology employs an alkaline
sorbent slurry which is predominantly lime or limestone based.
A 'scrubbing vessel' or scrubber is located downstream of the
boiler in which intimate contact between gas and sorbent is carried
out, a process which readily removes over 90% of sulphur dioxide
from the flue gases. The resulting solid is predominantly calcium
sulphite which can be further oxidised to be sold as a by-product
to the building industry where it finds application as plaster
board. Wet scrubbing technology is currently in place in over
300 coal-fired installations worldwide with at least another 100
units planned to be constructed in the foreseeable future.
<H6>Figure 6.1 - Flue Gas Desulphurisation Wet Scrubbing</H6>

<P>
The capital cost of new ($250/kW) or retrofitted ($400/kW) equipment
is considerable and is a function of the sulphur content of the
fuel source, chlorine levels (which may require an additional
pre-scrubber) and often land space available. Design considerations
which lead to such high costs include:
<P>
. size of equipment (e.g. 'scrubber') in order to handle voluminous
<P>
quantities of flue gas;
<P>
. material selection to handle the wet and corrosive nature of
<P>
material;
<P>
. incorporation of equipment into the boiler flue gas path;
<P>
. ancillary equipment which must also be of high quality to handle
<P>
corrosive sorbent and by-product;
<P>
Operating cost components include:
<UL>
<LI>purchase of sorbent materials
<LI>maintenance
<LI>disposal of wastes
<LI>additional cost of fuel to account for reduced overall plant
efficiency by 3.8% of total electrical output
</UL>

<P>
Modern 'wet scrubbers' use sorbents efficiently which they purchase
for reasonably low prices. The by-product produced is potentially
saleable although it is expected that in European countries the
construction/building industry may become flooded with gypsum
reducing its saleable value. Finally, recent developments in this
technology for example, regenerative flue gas reheating and natural
draft cooling towers are looking at increasing overall efficiency
to minimise operating costs.
<H5>6.1.2 Spray Dry Scrubbing</H5>

<P>
This technology as with 'wet scrubbing' employs a sorbent slurry
or solution, however, the by-product produced is 'dry'. The slurry
of sorbent, again alkaline based, is sprayed into the scrubbing
vessel in very fine droplets and dries as it contacts the flue
gas. At this point the sorbent reacts with the sulphur dioxide.
<P>
The dry sorbent is picked up by the gas stream and carried into
the dust collection plant (e.g. fabric filters) for removal.
<P>
Spray dry scrubbing has been installed in over 80 power station
installations worldwide making it the second most popular flue
gas desulphurisation technology available. Currently capital costs
are only slightly less than for wet scrubbing systems, whilst
removal efficiencies of up to 90% have been quoted.
<P>
Operating costs are noticeably higher than for 'wet scrubbers'
because of the reduced contact between sorbent and gas. Lime rather
than limestone is the preferred sorbent although more costly.
Because of the cost structure of this technology it is more suited
when burning low to medium sulphur coals. Another disadvantage
with 'spray dry scrubbing' is that there is no commercial use
for the by-product produced, since it is mixed with the dust originating
in the coal and collected in the dust collecting plant. Of course
this may also prevent the sale of fly ash to existing markets
such as for concrete.
<H5>6.1.3 Sorbent Injection</H5>

<P>
The technology of calcium sorbent injection is a more recently
developed technology and is the lowest in terms of capital outlay
of all the available sulphur dioxide removal technologies.
<P>
The sorbent can be added dry into one of three locations;
<UL>
<LI>with the fuel, thus into the furnace (gas temperature 850-1250
degrees Celsius)
<LI>into the economiser region (gas temperature 950-550 degrees
Celsius)
<LI>after the air heaters (gas temperature close to saturation).
<MENU>
<LI>However, because of relatively poor contact between the sorbent
and sulphur dioxide, efficiency is generally in the range 30-60%
and hence, sorbent use is much higher. The residual sorbent and
ash mixture is not a commercial product as with 'wet scrubbing'.
<LI>The technology has found a niche market for small boilers
with less stringent environmental controls than are imposed on
large utilities, or where the ash content of the coal is sufficiently
alkaline in itself to assist in the sulphur dioxide removal process.
<LI>Considerable research of the technology is underway with efficiencies
expected to reach as high as 80% should techniques like humidification
of the flue gas or other additives into the gas stream prove successful.
<LI>Due to Pacific Power's commitment to the use of fabric filter
technology for particulate control on coal-fired power stations,
direct sorbent injection was identified as being an attractive
alternative to more complex wet flue gas desulphurisation systems.
A study is currently deing conducted by Pacific Power to investigate
the feasibility of the large scale use of direct sorbent injection
upstream of fabric filter plant for sulphur dioxide reduction.
<LI>A pilot has been constructed which utilises flue gas diverted
from an operating 660 MW(e) power station boiler into a 160 bag
fabric filter pilot test plant. The plant consists of a sorbent
storage silo, volumetric feeder, pneumatic conveying and injection
equipment along with oxygen and sulphur dioxide monitoring equipment
upstream of the sorbent injector, immediately prior to the bags
and downstream of the filter bags.
<LI>Preliminary testing has been conducted using industrial grade
Calcium Hydroxide as the sorbent material, no flue gas humidification
and 'as-found' inlet sulphur dioxide concentrations. The results
have demonstrated removal efficiencies in excess of 60% at high
dosing rates are possible.
<LI>Although the previously discussed sulphur removal technologies
are proven, new technologies such as pressurised fluidised bed
combustors as well as integrated gasification and combined cycle
plants (as discussed earlier in sections 2.1.4 and 2.3.2 respectively)
provide similarly clean exhaust gases by reducing sulphur dioxide
formation prior to or during the combustion process.

</UL>

<H4>6.2 Control Of Gaseous Oxides Of Nitrogen</H4>

<P>
In coal and oil-fired power stations with conventional combustion
systems, the measures to reduce emissions must be taken largely
by cleaning the flue gas. Environmental measures for removing
pollutants from the flue gas can be very expensive and depending
on the quality of the coal and location of the plant can increase
overall investment by up to 40%. The principal measures carried
out to control nitrogen oxides in the combustion chamber of a
power station involves strict control of air and fuel supply to
the burners. Up to a 50% reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions
can be achieved in this way and at relatively low cost.
<P>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
There are as many as five stable gaseous oxides of nitrogen but
of these the only ones present in the atmosphere in significant
amounts are nitrous oxide, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide.
These three gases are potential atmospheric pollutants.
<P>
Nitric oxide is a colourless gas. Its ambient concentration is
usually much less than that which leads to biological toxicity
in terms of human health. Nitric oxide is, however, a precursor
to an active gaseous compound in the formation of photochemical
smog, nitrogen dioxide. Nitrogen dioxide is a reddish-brown gas
and in sufficient concentration visible to the eye. The toxicological
and epidemiological effects of nitrogen dioxide are not fully
understood and unless present in extremely high concentrations
does not affect human health. Environmental emission standards
for this gas are often based on visibility effects.
<P>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
Where environmental limits cannot be achieved using this method,
DENOX units are required as secondary measures. The only process
applied so far on a large scale, has been selective catalytic
reduction (SCR) using ammonia or ammonia compounds in the presence
of a catalyst. A schematic of this process is shown in Figure
6.2.
<P>
Figure 6.2 - Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for Reduction
of
<P>
Oxides of Nitrogen Emissions
<P>
The ammonia is injected at about 450 degrees celsius in the presence
of a vanadium pentoxide catalyst (titanium dioxide catalysts have
also been used successfully). Reduction of nitrogen oxides in
the flue gas of more than 80% is possible and in conjunction with
burner management systems can be increased to over 90% removal.
The cost of employing this technology can be up to 10 times greater
than burner control and efficiency management systems however
removal efficiency is much higher.
<P>
The amount of nitrogen oxides produced from the combustion of
two different fuel types can vary significantly if the nitrogen
content of the raw fuel is different. As shown in Figure 6.3,
fuel oil which contains nitrogen chemically bound into its molecular
structure gives rise to higher levels of nitrogen oxides emissions
than does natural gas which contains none.
<H6>Figure 6.3 - Gas Turbines - Oxides of Nitrogen Emissions</H6>

<P>
SCR has been applied in Japan and throughout Europe and is fast
gaining acceptance in industrialised countries worldwide. In Germany
alone, over 25 000 MW of coal-fired power stations are expected
to be using this technology by the early 1990's.
<H4>6.3 Fabric Filter Gas Cleaning</H4>

<P>
The flue gas discharged from a power plant boiler carries fly
ash (residue from the coal burned in the boiler). The amount of
this residue (in the form of solid particles which can be discharged
in to the atmosphere) with the flue gas is limited by the Regulations
of The Clean Air Act.
<P>
The Clean Air Act makes it necessary to provide plant between
the boiler and the stack to remove the fly ash from the flue gas
so that the total mass of solid particles actually passing into
the atmosphere is not greater than the amount permitted by the
Act.
<P>
Flue gas cleaning plant may consist of either fabric filters or
precipitators. The plant extends from the boiler discharge flanges
(located after the air heaters), to the inlet flange on the stack.
The fabric filter or bag house operates in a similar manner to
a domestic vaccuum cleaner.
<P>
There are three basic types of fabric filters designated by the
cleaning mode adopted. They are:
<MENU>
<LI>(i) Mechanical Shaker
<LI>(ii) Reverse Gas
<LI>(iii) Pulse Jet
</MENU>

<P>
For all of these types, the fabric is installed in the form of
tube like bags.
<H5>6.3.1 Mechanical Shaker Fabric Filters</H5>

<P>
Mechanical Shaker cleaned units operate on the principle of the
bags being suspended from a shaker frame with the open end of
the bags facing down. These are attached to a cell plate which
separates the 'dirty' gas side from the 'clean' gas side of the
fabric filter compartment.
<P>
As dirty gas is filtered in the bags, the differential pressure
across the plant will gradually rise, requiring the bags to be
cleaned. This is accomplished by sequentially isolating the individual
cells and energising the associated shaker mechanisms, shaking
the bags and causing the ash to fall into the hoppers. The ash
is continually discharged from the hoppers into the disposal system.
<P>
The gas enters from below the cell plate, (through thimbles protruding
through the cell plate) passes up through the centre of the bags
and deposits fly ash on the inside of the bags. The clean gas
passes through the bags and discharges through outlet dampers
at the top of the cell. The filtered flue gas enters an outlet
manifold that joins other similar ducts and is discharged through
induced draft fans to the stack.
<P>
Fabrics used in shaker plants are normally woven from synthetic
polymer fibres such as acrylics, polyesters, etc. Pacific Power
plant of this design characteristically have between 47 360 and
52 480 bags per (660 MW) unit divided into 40 individual cells.
<P>
The bags are 5.5 m long and 165 mm diameter and handle between
890 and 1090 m cubed metres per second of flue gas. Inlet burdens
average 25 g per cubed metre while outlet emissions range from
20 to 30 mg per cubed metre.
<P>
This type of plant is often described as a low-ratio filter as
it has a relatively large fabric area compared to the amount of
gas being cleaned.
<H5>6.3.2 Reverse Gas Fabric Filters</H5>

<P>
Reverse Gas cleaned fabric filters are very similar to mechanical
shaker plant. The cleaning method differs when a cell is taken
off line for cleaning. Instead of activating a mechanical shaker
mechanism, 'clean' gas from the discharge side of the filter is
drawn into the clean side of the cell undergoing cleaning. This
gas passes from the 'clean' to the 'dirty' side of the bags, dislodging
the collected fly ash in a 'back washing' operation. This type
of filter is also known as a low-ratio filter and is usually designed
along similar sizing parameters to shaker plant. The cleaning
operation is much more gentle relative to shaker plant. The fabric
traditionally used in reverse gas units is woven fibreglass.
<P>
Reverse gas plants are widely used in American power stations
as the fibreglass bags are suitable for gas at a higher temperature
than generally expected in New South Wales power stations. This
is due to the high sulphur coal in the USA and the necessity to
reduce corrosion caused by the formation of acid if condensation
occurs.
<H5>6.3.3 Pulse Jet Cleaned Plant</H5>

<P>
Pulse jet plants have a cell plate located above the bags and
the gas passes through the bags from outside to inside. The fly
ash is deposited on the outside of the bag.
<P>
Cleaning of the bags is carried out by passing a short burst of
compressed air down the centre of the bags which causes them to
flex, dislodging the fly ash from the outside of the bag.
<P>
As this plant cleans bags on-line it is not necessary to provide
equipment for cell isolation to clean the bags.
<P>
Pacific Power plant of the pulse jet design are characteristically
equipped with between 9120 and 14664 bags, varying in length from
6 m to 8 m, and a nominal diameter of 130 mm. Gas volumes range
from 480 cubed metres per second to 550 cubed metres per second
with similar inlet burdens and emission figures to low-ratio plants.
<P>
Because of the much smaller amount of fabric area required to
clean a given amount of gas, these plants are known as high-ratio
and are significantly cheaper to build and to run.
<P>
All power stations which have been commissioned in NSW since 1981
have fabric filters installed for particulate emission control.
Retrofitting of fabric filters to a number of older boilers in
our system is currently taking place. In all of the fabric filters
currently used by Pacific Power, the concept of Best Available
Control Technology has been vital. All of the installations to
date and those in progress have been very effective in the elimination
of visible emissions from power station chimneys. This is a significant
factor in the public acceptance of power stations as part of this
local community.

<H3>ENERGY SOURCES FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION</H3>

<P>
In many cases, primary energy sources are not of a form suitable
for the immediate needs of our community. Instead they have to
be converted once or twice before they are in a form more suitable
to their intended use. For the sake of simplicity the sources
providing such primary energy are themselves referred to as primary
energy sources. They include:
<MENU>
<LI>. coal
<LI>. petroleum
<LI>. natural gas
<LI>. uranium
<LI>. renewable energy sources
</MENU>

<P>
From these primary energy sources, conversion to more desirable
energy forms can be performed. Each step in the conversion process
involves losses, or more correctly, production of waste energy
and by-products. The most common form of waste energy being heat.
<P>
The efficiency of conversion processes is therefore, always less
than 100%. Typical efficiency values are:
<H4>. 99.9% for a transformer;</H4>

<P>
. 90% for an electric motor;
<P>
. 37% for electricity generated by modern coal-fired power stations;
<P>
. 14% for electricity generated by crystalline silicon solar cells.
<P>
There are a number of energy sources receiving significant attention
in the development of cheaper, more efficient and environmentally
friendly power generation technologies for the future. These energy
sources include wastes, as well as by-products from various activities
(such as coal washeries, domestic garbage, scrap tyres) and are
only recently being identified as possible competitors to our
more traditional fuels of coal, oil and gas.
<P>
As well as this, 'renewable' energy sources such as wind, solar,
wave and others are receiving a great deal of attention. The development
of technologies to harness these energies are already progressing
rapidly with many developments already proving to be economically
competitive with our more traditional forms of power generation
such as that produced from fossil fuels.
<H5>1.1 Coal</H5>

<P>
Australia is currently the world's leading exporter of coal, a
primary energy source, with exports of some 120 million tonnes
in 1991. Australia's main black coal production (95%) is located
in New South Wales and Queensland whilst production of brown coal
is carried out extensively in Victoria and South Australia.
<P>
Figure 1.1 - Coal Resources in Australia.
<P>
Australia's known, as well as inferred black coal resource is
estimated to be in excess of 550 billion tonnes with some 51 billion
tonnes considered to be economically recoverable.
<P>
Electricity in mainland Australia is predominantly produced by
coal-fired power stations and of the total installed capacity
of 33,900 MW, some 19,000 MW are fuelled by black coal (using
approximately 37.5 million tonnes per annum). Achieving more efficient
and environmentally friendly processes, is a major aim of the
electricity industry and research organisations in Australia.
Pacific Power is becoming increasingly involved in the development
and adaptation of these technologies to the Australian situation.
<P>
Alternative coal based technologies are an important consideration
in the overall assessment of future options for power generation.
They are being assessed with a broad range of renewable and non-renewable
technologies such as conventional coal-fired power stations, gas
turbines, wind and solar, as options for future power supplies
to New South Wales. These alternative coal based technologies
include:
<UL>
<LI>Fluidised Bed Combustors
<LI>Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle
<LI>Coal Gasification for Fuel Cells
<LI>Ultra Clean Coal and Clean Coal Engines
<LI>Coal Bed Methane
</UL>

<H5>1.2 Natural Gas</H5>

<P>
Natural gas was initially associated with the discovery of petroleum
oil in Australia. At the time it was of low value but subsequent
developments in the gas industry have led to gas becoming a major
fuel in Australia. Gas is now searched for in its own right, and
is still found during exploration for oil. Apart from the Bass
Strait oil and gas fields, other natural gas reserves are generally
found in remote locations considerable distance from the population
centres where the largest markets for gas exist. Due to the necessity
of long and costly pipelines for transporting gas from these distant
locations, it has taken a number of years for the gas supply infrastructure
to become developed. Gas pipelines now supply gas to all capital
cities and most other major centres of population. Natural gas
is also exported from the North West Shelf project as liquefied
natural gas (LNG) to Japan, where it is used by gas utilities
and as fuel in power generation.
<P>
The term &quot;natural gas&quot; describes the naturally occurring
mixture of gases found in gas deposits. However like other &quot;natural&quot;
products it is not used in the &quot;as found&quot; state. The
constituents of natural gas vary considerably from well to well.
Often natural gas contains large quantities of liquids and heavy
gases as well as significant quantities of carbon dioxide and
moisture. The petroleum based liquids, and gases such as propane,
are separated and recovered for separate sale as oil and liquid
petroleum gas (LPG). Ethane, a feed stock for petrochemical plants,
is also removed and stored. At the Cooper Basin gas field which
supplies New South Wales and South Australia, the ethane is stored
underground in depleted gas wells. Processing of natural gas is
carried out at the gas field before transportation by pipeline.
After processing, the main constituent of natural gas is methane
(refer to Figure 1.2). Natural gas is a high quality fuel and
produces low emissions and significantly less carbon dioxide than
other fossil fuels per unit of energy consumed.
<P>
Figure 1.2 - Natural Gas Composition.
<H3>Gas Fields and Reserves</H3>

<P>
Australia has several gas fields containing economically recoverable
reserves of gas. The major fields are, off the coast of Western
Australia (North West Shelf), off Southern Victoria (Bass Strait),
on-shore in Central Australia and in South West Queensland.
<P>
Figure 1.3 - Gas Resources.
<P>
Gas resources are classified by the certainty of the quantities
present and the commercial viability of production. In Australia,
gas resources that have been declared commercial were estimated
at 36,300 PJ as of December 1989, whilst recoverable but not yet
declared commercial reserves, were 80,900 PJ. By comparison, the
current rate of gas usage in Australia is approximately 550 PJ
per year. A further 200 PJ year is exported to Japan as LNG. The
location of approximately 82% of the total gas resource is off
the west coast of Western Australia.
<P>
When the gas resources supplying NSW, Victoria and South Australia
become depleted (possibly around the year 2015) it has been proposed
that a transcontinental pipeline connecting the northwest Australian
gas resources to the south east pipe grid be constructed. There
are estimated to be more than 100 years gas supply in the North
West Shelf based on current consumption in Australia.
<H3>Gas Supply to NSW</H3>

<P>
Gas is supplied to NSW from the Cooper Basin in South Australia.
Gas is also supplied to South Australia from this basin. The gas
is processed at Moomba and transported by pipeline to Sydney with
branch pipelines to Wagga Wagga, Canberra, Bathurst, Orange and
Lithgow. The Pipeline Authority, a Federal government statutory
body, operates and maintains the Moomba-Sydney pipeline and charges
for carriage of the gas.
<P>
AGL Gas Companies currently distribute the majority of natural
gas to NSW. AGL also owns and operates gas distribution pipelines
to Newcastle and Wollongong.
<P>
Albury is supplied with gas from Bass Strait via the pipe grid
in Victoria.
<H3>LNG for Supply During Peak Periods</H3>

<P>
Natural Gas can be liquefied in large quantities in insulated
tanks at atmospheric pressure. The temperature of the gas needs
to be reduced to -160 degrees Celsius in order for it to be stored
as a liquid at this pressure. When the stored gas is to be used,
it is vaporised and can then be fed to a gas distribution network.
A 20,000 tonne tank of LNG would be able to supply gas turbines
for instance of 400 MW(e) capacity for around 200 hours of operation.
<H5>1.3 Methane From Coal Seams</H5>

<MENU>
<LI>1.3.1 Coalbed Methane
<LI>Most coal seams contain quantities of gas, commonly methane,
locked within pores and tiny fractures in the coal. In some locations,
the quantities of methane present can constitute a major fuel
resource. For example, the Sydney Geological Basin is estimated
by Pacific Power geologists to contain gas resources comparable
in size to those in established gas fields such as the Gippsland
and Cooper Basins.
<LI>Methane is extracted from the coal seams by means of wells
sunk from the surface down to the coal. The coal seam around the
hole is fractured using water pumped down the hole at very high
pressure. Sand is injected into these fractures so that they remain
open after the water pressure is released. Methane can then seep
into these fractures and be collected at the surface for use as
a fuel source.
</MENU>

<H3>Figure 1.4 - Coalbed Methane</H3>

<P>
Large projects that already operate in the United States produce
coalbed methane from the Warrior Basin in Alabama and the San
Juan Basin in Colorado. Total investment in these projects will
exceed $3 billion in 1991 and current production exceeds 270 PJ
per annum.
<P>
The physical parameters that control the existence and productivity
of coalbed methane can vary from one coalfield to another and
hence the technology, for its removal is site specific. Pacific
Power is currently conducting investigations into the feasibility
and economic viability of coal bed methane technology in the coalfields
of NSW. Pacific Power has sought the advice of experts with experience
in production fields in the USA and is working in co-operation
with the CSIRO which has a series of major coalbed methane R&amp;D
projects in place.
<P>
In addition, a program of coalbed methane exploration and assessment
has commenced. Pacific Power has held rights to explore for all
forms of gas in parts of the Sydney Geological Basin including
the Hunter Valley and along the coastal strip around Sydney and
Wyong. It is expected that the investigations will take some three
to five years to complete.
<H3>Figure 1.5 - Potential Coalbed Methane Production Areas</H3>

<MENU>
<LI>1.3.2 Methane Drainage During Mining Operations
<LI>Coal seams often contain gas which during mining operations
must be continually removed for safety reasons. The quantity of
methane present in the coal seam gas can vary greatly from one
location to another. Methane quantity also varies with changing
properties of the coal seam, including coal rank and surrounding
geological strata. As a coal seam is progressively mined, methane
is released from the 'relaxing' coal seam and surrounding layers
of strata. This methane is then collected from a series of boreholes
and vents before being vented to atmosphere, 'flared' or collected
for other purposes.
<LI>In some instances this gas can be of sufficient quality and
quantity to fuel gas turbine power stations or other furnace heating
equipment. As the gas must be removed for safety reasons the actual
cost of gas to a consumer is quite low, hence making it competitive
with other fuel sources for a variety of uses.
<LI>A typical composition for this gas would be:
</MENU>

<P>
At the coal face - methane 63%
<P>
carbon dioxide 7%
<P>
Bore holes preceding - methane 90%
<P>
the coal face carbon dioxide 10%
<P>
Impurities in the gas and the current high cost of removing these
impurities prevents the transport of the gas on the existing network
of gas pipelines which currently supply the state of NSW with
natural gas.
<P>
A number of privately owned power generation projects successfully
operate using gas produced from mining operations. These facilities
operate on the escarpment between Sydney and Wollongong.
<H5>1.4 Coal Washery Wastes</H5>

<P>
Coal washery facilities operate at select mining locations in
order to remove inert materials (ash) present in coal. The material
removed from the coal during the washing process is known as the
washery waste and because of its high ash and low energy characteristics
is not economic to be used as a fuel in conventional power stations.
Separation of ash from coal by physical processes is achieved
by firstly reducing the size of coal extracted from the mine to
the point where most of the coal and ash are liberated from each
other. The coal and ash can then be more easily separated on the
basis of their different physical properties for example their
specific gravity. Washery wastes can be divided into two groups;
course rejects and tailings, in a ratio of approximately 2:1 respectively.
<P>
The waste material produced by 'washing' can contain sufficient
combustible material to be of use in more recently developed combustion
boilers. The attractiveness of washery waste as a fuel, is its
'zero' and in some cases 'negative' cost, the abundance of washery
wastes produced by the State's coal mining industry, and the improved
'handlability' and storage of the waste material once the combustible
material has been burnt off.
<P>
Washery wastes, on average can contain between 30% and 40% of
the specific energy content of coal on a dry basis; more for tailings
and less for coarse rejects.
<P>
A technology receiving a great deal of attention worldwide, is
that of the fluidized bed combustor (refer to Section 2.1) of
which various types have already been developed. In particular,
this technology is suitable for the burning of washery wastes
and other low energy fuels, whilst also having environmental benefits.
This technology is already leading us toward a new generation
in power station development.
<P>
In a second edition report prepared in July, 1991 by Ecogen Pty
Ltd for the Department of Minerals &amp; Energy, the following
electricity generation potential was identified.

<H5>1.5 Nuclear Fuels</H5>

<P>
Naturally occurring uranium consists primarily of uranium 238
and about 1% uranium 235. The numbers 238 and 235 refer to the
atomic masses of the two isotopes of uranium.
<P>
In practice the only elements which can fuel the fission reaction
in a nuclear reactor are uranium 235, uranium 233 and plutonium
239. Of these only uranium 235 is naturally occurring.
<P>
In a nuclear power station 1 kg of uranium 235 produces the same
amount of energy as 3000 tonnes of coal or an equivalent 7.5 million
kWh.
<P>
The potential environmental hazards of nuclear power are well
documented, however, the contribution of nuclear power to the
greenhouse effect is negligible when compared with fossil fuel
power generation. When developing scenarios to meet carbon dioxide
reduction targets (such as that set during the 1988 Toronto conference
of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20% of 1988 levels), nuclear
power can contribute significantly to the reductions required.
Electricity production from nuclear energy is prohibited in New
South Wales, under the &quot;Uranium Mining and Nuclear Facilities
(Prohibitions) Act, 1986, No. 194&quot;.
<H3>Enriched Uranium</H3>

<P>
Most nuclear power stations are fuelled by enriched uranium. The
enriching process increases the uranium 235 content of uranium
to about 3%, and it requires 5.5 kg of natural uranium to produce
1 kg of enriched uranium. Uranium ore, more commonly known as
yellowcake, is the raw material used to produce the 'enriched'
uranium. The uranium ore is first converted to gaseous uranium
hexafluoride which is then enriched by one of two processes, centrifuging
or diffusion. The uranium isotopes 235 and 238 are partially separated
in this process because of their different atomic mass. Diffusion
separation plants in the USA, France and the USSR provide for
90% of the world's isotope separation requirements.
<H5>1.6 Renewable Energy</H5>

<P>
Renewable energy sources are those which are effectively or potentially
infinite. They are generally non-polluting energy resources and
often mean 'zero' fuel cost. They depend on energy from the sun
or other natural sources.
<P>
There are two broad categories of renewable energy technologies.
Those which are well established such as hydroelectric energy,
and those which are new technologies and are developing rapidly
world-wide.

<P>
Pacific Power actively supports the development of renewable energy
technologies. These technologies are becoming increasingly competitive
with conventional power generation whilst also offering certain
other advantages such as reducing carbon dioxide emissions as
well as other atmospheric pollutants. Renewables are of particular
interest as power supplies for remote areas. Pacific Power is
supporting research and development projects in wind energy, solar
photovoltaics and solar thermal, as well as having completed a
study in wave energy.
<H2>CHAPTER 2</H2>

<H3>NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN POWER GENERATION </H3>

<H4>Non-Renewables</H4>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Developments in power station technology in the past have focused
mainly on improving the overall economics of the industry. This
on the one hand has led to an increase in the size of power station
machines in order to reduce the specific cost of construction
and operation per unit energy produced. Coal-fired power stations,
which play the most important role in the generation of electricity
in most industrialised countries, commonly operate with outputs
of around 500-800 MW(e) per machine of which multiples of 2, 4
or 6 are most often constructed. On the other hand, it is increasingly
important to maintain generating capacity whilst reducing the
amount of fuel being consumed through efficiency measures.
<P>
The efficiency of large coal-fired steam cycle power stations
with an output of 660 MW(e) is now 35-37% (HHV higher heating
valve). Reaching 38% or even 40%, the most recent power stations
are now approaching the limit in both technical and economic terms.
The steam driving the turbine in this case has a temperature of
about 540 degrees Celsius, and pressure of around 16 MPa. Any
further increase in temperature or pressure would improve efficiency
only slightly but would result in a disproportionate increase
in costs to build such facilities.
<P>
In the following sections, new and alternative technologies which
utilise 'non-renewable' energy sources are discussed. Development
of all of these technologies are well under way worldwide, with
many technologies already seeing commercial returns. The high
efficiency of these new processes is one of the major driving
forces in their development and with efficiencies of greater than
50% expected, as well as excellent environmental control, more
and more of these installations are finding application in today's
energy markets.
<MENU>
<LI>2.1 Fluidised Bed Combustors (FBC)
<LI>2.1.1 Introduction
<LI>Fluidised bed combustion is a technology developed for the
combustion of a wide range of variable quality fuels and wastes.
The fluidised bed can be fuelled with low quality coals through
to washery wastes and sewage sludge, wastes from municipal dumps
and even used scrap tyres. Materials which have typically been
viewed only as wastes, in the past, and for which large disposal
projects have been implemented, may in the near future be providing
us with a cheap, useful source of energy for conversion to electricity.
<LI>The fluidised bed, Figure 2.1, is essentially a holding vessel
containing a mixture of predominantly inert material. The composition
of material in the bed can consist of up to 99% non-combustible
material, mainly ash and limestone, the limestone providing an
important advantage in pollution control. The 'mixed' bed is supported
by a uniformly perforated base plate through which air is supplied
for two main purposes:
</MENU>

<P>
. as a source of oxygen for combustion in the bed;
<P>
. as the fluidizing agent by effectively lifting the
<P>
bed at a minimum air velocity (known as the
<P>
fluidizing velocity) and hence thoroughly mixing the
<P>
fuel and inert materials as though they were fluids. This
<P>
provides intimate contact of fuel and oxygen and ensures
<P>
efficient combustion.
<P>
A bed consists of about 1% coal (up to a maximum of 3%) and 99%
glowing ash and additives. Even when the fuel used is of very
inferior quality, this large volume of red-hot material (reaching
temperatures of up to 850 degrees Celsius) ensures stable and
uniform ignition for as long as fluidised air is supplied to the
unit. Yet another benefit is that fluidised bed combustors do
not involve any slag formation even when high-ash coal is being
burnt, since the ash components neither melt nor sinter in the
relatively low temperatures prevailing in the bed. This is particularly
important where the ash fusion temperature is relatively low and
if used in conventional combustion systems would cause 'slagging'
and 'fouling' of boiler tubes in the higher temperature furnace.
<P>
Although the fluidised bed can utilise a broad range of fuel types,
this is not the only benefit to be gained from implementing this
technology for power generation. The environmental benefits of
a fluidised bed combustor are also significant.
<P>
Environmentally a fluidised bed combustor allows the operator
to maintain levels of atmospheric pollutants, sulphur dioxide
and oxides of nitrogen at low levels well within emission limits.
When fuel to be combusted, by nature, contains impurities which
will produce these pollutants in conventional combustion systems,
fluidised bed combustion can be employed as an alternative to
avoid:
<P>
. the high cost of installing additional, special
<P>
equipment for their removal;
<P>
. the cost associated with a reduction in overall
<P>
plant efficiency normally associated with pollution
<P>
control systems; and
<P>
. overall, a more complicated process.
<P>
This in turn should reduce the overall cost of the electricity
produced and hence the cost being passed onto consumers.
<P>
Removal of sulphur originating in the fuel which would otherwise
be oxidised to sulphur dioxide, is achieved by the addition of
limestone to the bed. As the bed operates at temperatures in the
region of 700-850 degrees Celsius, limestone ensures optimum binding
of the sulphur present. More than 95% of sulphur is removed in
this way.
<P>
Combustion temperatures of less than 850 degrees Celsius in the
bed also aids in reducing the amount of oxides of nitrogen formation
to lower levels. Conventional coal fired power stations operate
with temperatures typically in the range 1400-1500 degrees Celsius.
In this temperature range oxides of nitrogen is readily formed
from organic nitrogen within the coal as well as atmospheric nitrogen,
and hence methods must be employed for its control e.g. 'low oxides
of nitrogen' burners. The oxides of nitrogen level from a fluidised
bed combustor is typically reduced by 75% below that of an equivalent
size pulverised coal-fired boiler.
<P>
Figure 2.1 - Fluidised Bed Combustor (FBC)
<MENU>
<LI>2.1.2 Atmospheric Fluidised Bed Combustor (AFBC)
<LI>The most basic design of the fluidised bed is known as the
atmospheric fluidised bed. Heat is transferred from the fuel combustion
to steam tubes submerged within the bed as well as in the flue
gas pass. Because of the intimate contact between the tubes and
the bed, heat transfer is up to five times greater than that which
occurs with the exiting flue gas. The steam generated in the tubes
is then used to drive a steam turbine and generator for the production
of electricity. Typically these facilities can be constructed
up to 60 MW(e) in size.
<LI>The minimum velocity of fluidising air (this also being the
combustion air) is of the order of 0.8-1.0 m/s with the maximum
being about 3 m/s. At low load, the bed is designed such that
steam tubes become exposed (ie. the bed shrinks) and heat transfer
from the bed is reduced. At high load, high velocity, the bed
increases in height hence covering the tubes and increasing steam
production. If the bed is completely shut down, steam tubes are
fully exposed and the combustion is smothered. In this situation,
the mass of the bed retains its heat for several hours allowing
easy start up when desired.
<LI>The state of the art today is a further development of the
atmospheric fluidised bed to a circulating process in order to
improve the efficiency of combustion and reduce gaseous emissions.
<LI>2.1.3 Circulating Fluidised Bed Combustor (CFBC)
<LI>In the circulating fluidised bed the flue gas moves at speeds
of 5-8 m/s carrying with it tons of silica sand, lime and ash
up the roughly 40 m high combustion chamber, together with the
coal (or whichever fuel is being employed). This material which
is carried along with the gas stream is separated in a cyclone.
Inside the cyclone the gas is forced into a swirling motion, throwing
solid particles to the outside walls of the cone shaped collection
unit. The solids are delivered to a hopper to be returned to the
combustion chamber. The recirculation of fly ash has a positive
influence on the process by improving overall combustion efficiency
(over 99% carbon burnout for all fuels), better utilisation of
the limestone in absorbing sulphur dioxide and by cooling the
fluidised bed by up to 50 degrees Celsius. Reducing the temperature
by this amount helps to maintain optimum sulphur removal.
<LI>The operation of a fluidised bed with circulation reduces
sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions even further
when compared to atmospheric fluidised beds. The rigorous circulation
in the bed promotes intimate contact of sulphur compounds with
limestone. This ensures high retention of sulphur irrespective
of the quality of fuel. Typical gas temperatures of 850 degrees
Celsius as well as 'staged' combustion maintains oxides of nitrogen
levels within acceptable limits. It also avoids the need to install
steam tubes inside the fluidised bed (these tubes accept heat
predominantly by conduction), since convectional heat transfer
is increased by the high volume of combustion products flowing
through the back pass of the boiler. In-bed tubes in the atmospheric
bed are subject to substantial erosion.
<LI>The circulating fluidised bed process was developed by a European
engineering company - Lurgi. The first industrial application
of their technology using coal, being in Luenen, West Germany
in 1982. This particular facility has a thermal capacity of 84
MW, burning coal washery wastes with a moisture content of up
to 65% and a sulphur content of 2%. The plant generates process
steam as well as electric power for a nearby aluminium oxide plant.
Other circulating fluidised bed installations include 67 MW electrical
with a simultaneous 138 MW of steam for district heating at Duisburg,
West Germany, 39 MW electrical and 109 MW of steam for district
heating at Flensburg, West Germany, as well as numerous demonstration
facilities, and plants under construction.
<LI>Circulating fluidised beds should be able, in the near future
to provide an electricity output of up to 200 MW(e). Part loads
down to 30% of the rated capacity can be catered for with a load
changing capability of 5% per minute.
<LI>Inherent disadvantages of the circulating fluidised bed technology
include the high auxiliary power requirement for the circulation
of bed material, as well as, erosion problems from ash carried
along in the flue gas. In this technology these disadvantages
are more pronounced than the other fluidised bed technologies.
<LI>Integration of the atmospheric bed technology with that of
the 'circulating' bed, has led to the development of the so-called
'circofluid' technology. This new development will combine the
advantages of the atmospheric bed, such as short start-up and
shut down times, low auxiliary power requirement and low investment
with the advantages of the 'circulating' bed which include, high
combustion efficiency, as well as reduced sulphur dioxide and
oxides of nitrogen emissions.
<LI>Figure 2.2 - Circulating Fluidised Bed Combustors (CFBC).
<LI>2.1.4 Pressurised Fluidised Bed Combustors (PFBC)
<LI>Pressurised fluidised beds operating at pressures of between
1 and 3 MPa are currently being tested in demonstration facilities
of a commercial scale. Given their greater energy density resulting
from operation at elevated pressure and with a greater mass flow
of combustion air, they have the potential to reach sizes of up
to 300 MW(e) and physically still be substantially smaller than
similar atmospheric fluidised bed combustors and circulating fluidised
bed installations. The pressurised fluidised bed as with the other
fluidised bed combustion technologies is capable of using a wide
variety of fuel types including those with low heating values
in an environmentally acceptable manner. Efficiency of these facilities,
however, is significantly higher between 40 and 45% (HHV) due
to the combined use of gas turbine technology and heat recovery
systems.
<LI>With conventional power generation facilities now reaching
a plateau in terms of efficiency improvements, combined gas/steam
cycles offer the potential to once again significantly increase
power generation efficiencies. The pressure energy of the fluidised
bed exhaust gases is recovered (after being cleaned of entrained
ash particles), in a gas turbine before heat recovery and exhaust
to atmosphere. It is important to ensure the gas is sufficiently
clean so as not to damage the gas turbine blades through erosion.
The gas turbine compressor supplies compressed air for combustion
in the high pressure fluidised bed. The generation of electricity
is therefore possible from both the gas turbine generator and
a conventional steam turbine and generator. Approximately 20%
of the electricity generated is provided by the gas turbine whilst
the remaining 80% is generated by the steam cycle. This combination
provides an increase of over 10% above the overall efficiency
of conventional coal-fired plant which does not utilise a gas
turbine.
<LI>Three commercial pressurised fluidised bed combustion installations
have recently been completed in Spain, Sweden and USA. One of
these plants located in Stockholm, Sweden and conceived as a twin
plant, generates 135 MW of electricity and 220 MW of district
heating. Fluidised bed combustion power stations have been extensively
developed worldwide and are now finding significant application
in energy markets. They have a claimed efficiency of 40-45% and
represent an investment 10-15% lower than a conventional power
station with complete flue gas purification, as they do not require
the related purification facilities of modern pulverised coal
power stations in Europe and the USA. Pressurised fluidised beds
have a predicted output in the intermediate range of 200-350 MW(e).
<LI>Figure 2.3 - PFBC Combined Cycle.
<LI>2.2 Gas Turbines and Combined Cycle
<LI>Gas turbines have been used for electricity generation for
many years. In the past, their use has been generally limited
to generating electricity in periods of peak electricity demand.
Gas turbines are ideal for this application as they can be started
and stopped quickly enabling them to be brought into service as
required to meet energy demand peaks. However, their previously
small unit sizes and their low thermal efficiency restricted the
opportunities for their wider use for electricity generation.
<LI>Over the last ten years there has been major improvements
to gas turbines such that they are now considered an attractive
option for base load electricity generation. Advances in gas turbine
technology have resulted in the efficiency of gas turbines being
increased to that of coal-fired power stations with much larger
machines being manufactured. Further, combined cycle plants (these
use the waste heat from the gas turbine exhaust to generate steam
to drive a steam turbine and so produce additional electricity)
have one of the highest efficiency ratings of non-renewable generating
plant currently available 40 to 45% HHV. The same technology improvements
have also resulted in the output capacity of gas turbines being
doubled. The largest units in service today produce 150 MW(e)
while units of around 200 MW(e) are scheduled to enter service
in 1993.
<LI>Figure 2.4 - Combined Cycle.
<MENU>
<LI>2.2.1 Operation
</MENU>

<LI>Gas turbines are internal combustion engines. The operating
principle is identical to conventional reciprocating petrol engines:
air is compressed, fuel burnt, and the expanding hot gas drives
the engine. However, instead of pistons compressing the air and
the hot expanding gases driving the piston, rotating compressor
blades (like a fan) compress the air and the resulting hot combustion
gases drive the turbine blades to produce power. A combustion
chamber is positioned between the air compressor and the power
turbine. Fuel is injected on a continuous basis into this chamber
and burnt. The continuous combustion of fuel enables more power
to be produced compared to a reciprocating engine of similar weight
and size.
<LI>Figure 2.5 - Simple Cycle Gas Turbine.
<LI>For electricity generation, the output shaft of the gas turbine
is connected to an electrical generator, identical to those driven
by steam turbines in coal fired plant.
<LI>Industrial gas turbines convert approximately 31% (HHV), of
the energy contained in the fuel to electrical energy. The remaining
energy is contained in the exhaust gases or used by auxiliary
equipment. By directing the exhaust gases through a heat recovery
boiler, steam is produced which can be used to drive a steam turbine
and generator set. This is the principle of combined cycle plant.
<LI>2.2.2 Aeroderivative &amp; Industrial Gas Turbines
<LI>There are two basic types of gas turbines - aeroderivative
and industrial units. As their name suggests, aeroderivative units
are aircraft jet engines modified to drive electrical generators.
These units have a maximum output of 40 MW(e) and are more fuel
efficient than industrial units. The latest aeroderivative unit
has a thermal efficiency of 36%. Aeroderivative units can produce
full power within three minutes after start up.
<LI>Industrial gas turbines range in sizes up to 150 MW(e). The
major gas turbine companies are just commencing to manufacture
units of around 200 MW(e). One company has a 218 MW(e) unit schedule
for operation in 1993. The most efficient industrial units have
efficiencies of around 31%. Depending on size, start up can take
from 10 to 40 minutes to produce full output.
<LI>Industrial gas turbines have a lower capital cost per kilowatt
installed than aeroderivative units. For this reason, it would
be most likely for Pacific Power to use industrial units if gas
turbines were selected as a generating option. Combined cycle
plant would also probably be based on industrial units as the
larger gas turbine capacities enable the use of larger steam plant
components which have significant cost advantages due to 'economies
of scale'.
</MENU>

<H3>Fuels</H3>

<P>
Gas turbines are capable of burning a wide variety of fuels. Distillate
and natural gas are the most common fuels as they do not contain
impurities which could damage the components in the turbine that
operate at high temperature. Crude oil and heavy fuel oils can
be burnt, but additional fuel treatment plant is necessary. When
natural gas is used, power output and thermal efficiency of gas
turbines are higher than when using distillate.
<P>
Gas turbines that operate at low capacity factors (referring to
the extent to which they are utilised) can be operated economically
on distillate. Base load combined cycle plant, however, needs
to be fuelled on natural gas for it to be competitive with alternative
coal based generating plants.
<H3>Environment</H3>

<P>
Natural gas contains only trace levels of sulphur, so sulphur
dioxide emissions are virtually non-existent when natural gas
is burnt. With distillate, the levels of sulphur dioxide in the
exhaust gas are low due to the very low levels of sulphur in the
distillate. Nitrogen oxides generation can be minimised by the
design of the combustion process. With natural gas, extremely
low levels of nitrogen oxides are achievable from burner design
alone. With distillate, nitrogen oxides generation is easily controlled
by the injection of water or steam into the combustion chamber.
<P>
Gas turbines and combined cycles are very compact and occupy small
ground area. Noise from the gas turbines needs to be considered,
but statutory limits on noise levels at site boundaries can be
achieved either by increasing the distance from the boundary to
the plant or by installing noise abatement equipment on the machines.
<H3>Potential Use of Gas Turbines for Pacific Power</H3>

<P>
Forecasts of future generating plant requirements indicate gas
turbines are an important option when considering the next generation
increment in NSW after the new coal fired Mount Piper Power Station
commences generating electricity in 1993. These gas turbines would
operate at low capacity factors, that is below 10% of the time.
The role of these machines would be to provide 'back-up' supply
for base load coal fired units that are forced out of service
due to plant failure. Gas turbines are suited to this role because
of their low capital cost around $410/kW compared to $1100/kW
for coal plant.
<P>
The lead time for gas turbine installation can be as short as
two years provided development approval is obtained in advance.
This short lead time would enable gas turbines to be installed
quickly should the electricity supply system require additional
unforeseen capacity. Combined cycle plant has a short lead time,
three years provided development approval is obtained in advance.
Combined cycle plant costs around $850/kW and retains this cost
for small generating increments as low as 400 MW(e).
<MENU>
<LI>2.2.3 Technological Developments
<LI>Over the last ten years there have been many advancements
in gas turbine technology. New materials and techniques used to
manufacture the turbine blades have resulted in a significant
increase in operating temperatures which leads to a corresponding
increase in efficiency. Turbine blades are manufactured with passages
inside the blades that allow air to pass through the blades to
keep them cool. This cooling air is provided by the compressor
section of the gas turbine. Further increases in turbine operating
temperatures are possible by pre-cooling the air after it leaves
the compressor.
<LI>Ceramic blades offer the possibility of higher operating temperatures
and increased efficiencies.
<LI>Currently, turbine blades are made from exotic alloys that
retain their strength at the high temperatures experienced in
the turbine. However, at these high operating temperatures, impurities
in the fuel (even at extremely low levels) can cause corrosion
of the blades. Various coatings for turbine blades have been developed
to avoid this high temperature corrosion.
<LI>2.3 Coal Gasification
<LI>2.3.1 Gasification Processes
<LI>In the early 1970's, as a result of the increasing fuel cost
and uncertainty of future fuel supply, research was begun on the
gasification of coal. Coal gasification was investigated as an
alternative to natural gas. Compared with direct coal firing of
power stations, the advantage of gasification is in the production
of a purified gas for which there is no subsequent need for flue
gas cleaning equipment, particularly for removal of sulphur dioxide.
Accordingly, the volume of gas to be cleaned is reduced to about
one hundredth of the equivalent flue gas volume. The integration
of gasification with the combined cycle process (referred to as
integrated gasification combined cycle) which yields higher efficiencies
than coal-fired and simple cycle power generation (combined cycle
refers to steam production utilising the waste heat from exhaust
gases) more than compensates for the loss in efficiency in coal
gasification brought about by partial oxidation of the gas and
incomplete gasification of the coal. The raw gas produced in the
gasification process contains mainly carbon monoxide and hydrogen
with small amounts of methane, hydrogen sulphide, tars, oils and
particulates. Ash or slag is removed from the bottom of the gasifier.
<LI>To generate the gas, coal is heated to temperatures typically
between 800 and 1600 degrees Celsius, oxygen and steam being added
at the same time. This produces a gas made up primarily of hydrogen
and carbon monoxide. Low-temperature processes (up to about 900
degrees Celsius) also generate methane and carbon dioxide. The
gas produced in this process has to be cooled and cleaned before
use. The heat inside the gasifier, the crude gas, and the slag
provides the energy for generating steam to drive a steam turbine
and generator set.
</MENU>

<H3>Types of Coal Gasification</H3>

<P>
The three main gasification methods are described below, and are
shown in Figure 2.6.
<P>
Figure 2.6 - Basic Types of Coal Gasification Processes.
<P>
Fixed Bed - In the &quot;fixed bed&quot; system, coal (3-30 mm)
is distributed onto a rotary grate at the base of the gasifier,
where the oxygen or air and steam are introduced. Ash is removed
from the rotary grate and passes through the ash lock under the
gasifier. The temperature in the gasifier must be kept below the
ash melting point to avoid slag formation. This form of gasifier
has a gas exit temperature in the order of 800 degrees Celsius,
and a pressure of 1 - 10 MPa. The low gas exit temperature in
this gasifier reflects the fact that as much as 90% of the coal's
energy remains as chemical energy in the gas.
<P>
Fluidised Bed - In this process, the coal (1-5 mm) is fed into
a 'fluidised' bed consisting of inert material and coal. Oxygen
or air for combustion, nitrogen to carry the fuel, and steam are
introduced through nozzles in the bed, thus fluidising the coal.
Gasification of the coal occurs in the bed, however further oxygen
or air, nitrogen and steam are added above the bed, increasing
the temperature and facilitating the conversion of coal and preventing
by product formation. Ash is removed from the bottom of the gasifier,
typically by a cooled screw conveyor.
<P>
Fluidised bed gasifiers work best with coals with an ash melting
point higher than 1100 - 1200 degrees Celsius, low coking tendency
and high reactivity. Wood and peat can also be used. This form
of gasifier has a gas exit temperature in the order of 1000 degrees
Celsius, and a pressure of 1 - 2.5 MPa. The moderate gas exit
temperature in this gasifier reflects the fact that 80% of the
coal's energy remains as chemical energy in the gas.
<P>
Entrained Flow - The fuel mix is introduced into the entrained
flow
<P>
gasifier through burner nozzles, and the gasification occurs as
the
<P>
fuel flows through the gasifier. The coal is introduced with a
<P>
particle size of 0.1 mm. This type of gasifier operates at a
<P>
temperature higher than the ash melting point, which enables the
ash
<P>
(slag) to flow out of the gasifier. The resulting gas has negligible
<P>
tar, oil, or phenol content. This form of gasifier has a gas exit
<P>
temperature in the order of 1400 degrees Celsius, and a pressure
of
<MENU>
<LI>2.5 - 4 MPa. The high gas exit temperature in this gasifier
reflects the fact that only 70% of the coal's energy remains as
chemical energy in the gas.
<LI>Processes currently being developed now operate at higher
pressures. The advantage is an increase in power output as well
as a reduction of the investment required for both the gasifier
and the subsequent processing of the product gas.
<LI>A variant now proposed is to operate with partial gasification
of coal; only 70% of the coal is transformed into gas, the rest
is left over as coke. The advantage is that this procedure does
not require pure oxygen that would have to be generated at high
cost; rather, air is quite sufficient. The exhaust heat produced
by such partial gasification serves together with the combustion
of the coke to generate steam. The hot exhaust gases from the
gas turbine still contain enough oxygen to be added to the coke
burning.
<LI>2.3.2 Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC)
</MENU>

<H3>General Process Description</H3>

<P>
Basically IGCC is a combined cycle process (gas turbine/heat recovery
boiler) fuelled by gasified coal. This system takes advantage
of the abundance of coal and the high efficiency of the combined
cycle.
<P>
Gas Purification - After the coal is gasified, the fuel gas produced
passes through a heat recovery boiler which generates steam to
drive a steam turbine and generator. The dust in the cool fuel
gas is removed by wet scrubbing prior to sulphur compounds being
removed. About 2 to 5% of the fuel gas energy is lost in this
process. Hot gas cleaning methods are being researched, so that
gas cooling can be avoided and plant can operate at higher efficiency.
<P>
Combustion - The cleaned gas is mixed with compressed air, nitrogen
(from the air separation plant, if one exists) and/or steam, and
combusted in a gas turbine combustion chamber. The resulting hot
gas is passed through the gas turbine. The generator coupled to
the turbine produces electrical power. The nitrogen and steam
have a cooling effect on the process by diluting and controlling
combustion, hence decreasing the rate of oxides of nitrogen production.
<P>
Waste Heat Boiler - Heat remaining in the gas turbine exhaust
is retrieved by a waste heat boiler. This heat generates steam
which drives the steam turbine/generator.
<P>
Air Separation Plant - Processes which use oxygen rather than
air for gasification, require process plant for air separation.
The gas turbine's compressor provides air for the air separation
plant, where the oxygen and nitrogen are separated. The oxygen
is supplied to the gasifier, while the nitrogen is supplied to
the gas turbine combustion chamber and is also used to carry coal
into to the gasifier.
<P>
Coal Feed - Coal is introduced to the gasifier in a number of
ways, including screw feeds, blown pulverised coal and as a water
slurry. Slurry fed gasifiers use more heat to evaporate the water
and they also have a greater oxygen requirement.
<H3>Plant Capacity/Staged Construction</H3>

<P>
Although gasifiers have not reached sizes comparable to conventional
coal plant, a 250 MW(e) unit is under construction at Buggenum
in the Netherlands. One major advantage of IGCC is that its construction
can be staged. Initially a gas turbine can be commissioned (and
run on natural gas), then the heat recovery boiler (completing
the combined cycle, fuelled by natural gas) and finally the gasifier
to fuel the combined cycle with gasified coal.
<H3>Water Consumption</H3>

<P>
Based on a generation capacity of 600 MW(e) the table below shows
expected water requirements for cooling purposes of a gasification
process compared with conventional coal and combined cycle power
plant.

<H3>Developments</H3>

<P>
The main thrust of IGCC development is to build plant of comparable
capital cost to pulverised coal plant but achieve higher efficiencies.
It is claimed that existing IGCC systems have a similar capital
cost to pulverised coal systems fitted with flue gas desulphurisation.
Designed to achieve up to 43% efficiency (HHV) it is expected
to reach 45% (HHV) in the event that development of hot gas cleaning
technology is a success.
<P>
Apart from a number of pilot units, one large demonstration power
station with integrated coal gasification has been built so far:
the 100 MW(e) Southern California Edison power station in Cool
Water, USA operated successfully between 1984 and 1989 and has
been acknowledged as one of the cleanest coal based power stations
in the USA. Buggenum in the Netherlands, rated at 250 MW(e) will
be commissioned in 1993 and is designed to operate with an efficiency
of 41.4% (HHV).
<P>
Figure 2.8 - Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle.
<MENU>
<LI>2.4 Fuel Cells
<LI>The fuel cell operates by directly converting the chemical
energy in a fuel to electrical energy through an electrochemical
process. It consists of two electrodes separated by an electrolyte
(fluid capable of conducting an electric current) and electrically
connected through an external circuit.
<LI>Figure 2.9 - Fuel Cell.
<LI>Fuel cells offer considerable benefits as a future power source
due to high efficiencies in the range of 50-60% as well as quiet
and versatile operation. They are predicted to be serious contenders
for both central power stations and dispersed power generation
at load centres. Suitable fuels include methanol, natural gas
and gasified coal.
<LI>A fuel is supplied continuously to one electrode, where it
is oxidised, (i.e. burnt) and an oxidant (air) is supplied at
the other electrode where it is reduced. The electrolyte enables
flow of ions between the two electrodes. Fuel cell types are generally
classified by the type of electrolyte used.
<LI>(i) Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells (PAFC) - these are currently
the most developed and field tested fuel cell systems to date.
A 4.5 MW(e) and an 11 MW(e) demonstration plant have been successfully
operated. The temperature of operation of the cell is about 200
degrees Celsius and waste heat recovery can be used for low temperature
applications. These low temperature fuel cells generally use hydrogen
as the fuel source.
<LI>(ii) Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC) - these are less developed
than the phosphoric acid fuel cells. They operate at about 650
degrees Celsius with an efficiency of 55-60%, and the potential
to recover the waste heat generated for combined cycle operation.
Natural gas can be reacted directly in such a facility because
of the high temperature of operation. The development of MCFC
is at an advanced stage but several serious material problems
relating to degradation and stability of cell components still
needs to be investigated and resolved.
<LI>(iii) Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) - these use ceramic electrolytes
based on zirconia, and operate at about 1000 degrees Celsius.
Experimental SOFCs have been demonstrated, and industry experts
predict megawatt size installations with energy densities of 1
MW/m3 and operation at 50-60% efficiency within a decade. Because
of the high temperature of operation they will be suited for combined
cycle operation where the unreacted fuel leaving the fuel cell
is augmented and combusted in a gas turbine. As the temperature
of exhaust gases is of the order of 500 to 900 degrees Celsius,
the waste heat can be used to generate steam. It is expected that
such an arrangement could achieve an overall efficiency of close
to 80% with waste heat recovery.
<LI>A marketing report prepared for the CSIRO indicates that SOFC's
would be particularly attractive for meeting the energy needs
of non-residential buildings. In this application natural gas
fuelled units of between 100 kW(e) and a few megawatts, would
reduce carbon dioxide emissions significantly and be viable where
capital cost is less than $2000/kW inclusive of all power conditioning
equipment.
<LI>Some of the inherent advantages of operating fuel cells as
power supplies includes their flexibility in utilising a wide
variety of fuel sources (gasified coal, oil, gas, hydrogen, methanol),
their silent operating characteristics particularly attractive
in building installations, their modular construction allowing
cost effective increases in capacity and the potentially high
efficiency in the conversion of chemical energy into electricity.
<LI>Pacific Power has recently joined a consortium which established
a new joint-venture company, Ceramic Fuel Cells Ltd. to develop
SOFC's. The ultimate objective is the development of the technology
for application to large central and dispersed power stations
for use within grids.
<LI>2.5 Magnetohydrodynamics
<LI>Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) energy conversion is a process where
heat can be converted directly into electricity. The basic principle
by which electricity is generated is by moving a conductor through
a magnetic field. Thus, in the case of a conventional electricity
generator, using a turbogenerator, a coil of conductor is rotated
in a stationary magnetic field, or a magnetic field is rotated
in a cage of stationary conductors, namely copper or aluminium
bars.
<LI>Figure 2.10 - Open Cycle MHD Plant.
<LI>In the MHD generator, the combustion gas itself is an electrical
conductor. The gas is usually derived from the high temperature
combustion of coal. The combustion products produced are so hot
that they become electrically conducting, ie. a plasma. The ability
of the gas to conduct electricity is increased by &quot;seeding&quot;
it with a salt of readily ionisable alkali metal such as potassium
or caesium. This hot gas expands at high velocity through an intense
magnetic field via a long, narrow, divergent channel or nozzle.
An electric potential is induced between two opposite walls of
the generator and electric power can be extracted.
<LI>In both cases (conventional and MHD generators) the motion
of a conductor through a magnetic field gives rise to an electromotive
force and a flow of current in accordance with Faraday's laws
of induction. In a conventional generator, the current is carried
to the external load circuit through brushes. In the MHD generator
electrodes mounted in the channel walls tap off the current directly.
Thus for MHD, the energy released by the expanding hot gases is
converted directly to electricity without the use of rotating
machinery hence reducing mechanical losses.
<LI>When a conductor is placed in a magnetic field and a current
passed through it perpendicular to the field, a voltage is set
up perpendicular to both the field and current directions. This
phenomenon is known as the Hall effect, and the transverse voltage
developed is called the Hall voltage.
<LI>If a continuous electrode were used along the wall of a linear
MHD generator, Hall current would flow in the plasma, seriously
degrading performance. For this reason electrodes are segmented,
ie. there are a large number of electrodes separated by insulators
along the channel. With segmentation a voltage can develop between
adjacent electrodes because of the Hall effect.
<LI>The flue gas from the MHD process can be directed to a waste
heat boiler for steam raising or be passed to a gas turbine for
direct electricity generation. In both cases the efficiency of
the overall process can be significantly enhanced recovering energy
which would otherwise be exhausted to atmosphere.
<LI>An alternative to the linear MHD system described has been
developed as a result of technical problems associated with linear
systems on a commercial scale. Known as MHD disk generators they
avoid problems of the linear type such as superconducting magnets
of commercial scale are complex, expensive and of a size which
would make transport to site a difficult task. Cooling systems
as well as power consolidation systems and inverter system are
also less complex and expensive.
<LI>The MHD - disk generator has an overall simpler construction
than the linear system and benefits from less components under
high electrical potential and unbroken plasma flow.
<LI>By installing an MHD generator as a topping plant (installed
upstream of a secondary process which can also generate electricity),
overall efficiencies of up to 45% may be achievable with established
technology, reaching 50-55% with second generation development
and triple cycle configuration. Triple cycle refers to combined
MHD/gas turbine/steam plant. Size of MHD plant when used as a
topping cycle is in the range 25 MW(e) to 1000 MW(e).
<LI>Pacific Power has recently sponsored research at the University
of Sydney into a design study for retrofitting of MHD technology
at an existing power station.
<LI>2.6 Ultra Clean Coal (UCC)
<LI>Coal, in its natural form consists of carbon, hydrogen and
oxygen with traces of contaminants bound into the atomic structure,
as well as inert material known generally as ash. Because coal
typically contains from 10 to 30% ash by weight, its use as a
fuel is restricted to more conventional, coal-fired boilers. If
the inert material or ash content can be removed from the coal
such that less than 0.5% of ash remains, a new class of fuel,
ultra clean coal, can be produced and considered for a variety
of other uses, in particular as a replacement for liquid petroleum
fuels.
</MENU>

<H3>The Process</H3>

<P>
Physical processes for the removal of ash from coal have been
developed over the years to improve its quality for combustion
in conventional processes. In order to remove a high percentage
of ash from the coal by physical methods, large expensive and
cumbersome industrial plants need to be constructed.
<P>
A process for the chemical cleaning of coal, pioneered by the
CSIRO, is currently under development in Australia.
<P>
Figure 2.11 - Ultra Clean Coal Technology.
<P>
It is expected that this process will reduce the ash in coal to
less than 0.5% at a competitive cost and hence broaden the technologies
for which coal would be a substitute fuel.
<P>
The chemical cleaning process, which is currently under development
involves a number of distinct processing stages. Generally these
stages can be described as: caustic digestion of the mineral matter,
followed by acid neutralisation and finally water washing. The
reagents which are used throughout the process can be regenerated
for re-use in the process. Whilst being environmentally sound
and avoiding problems with waste disposal of chemicals this also
reduces the cost of the overall process and hence the finished
product.
<P>
The commercial success of the process for producing UCC will see
some very distinct benefits particularly in the area of electricity
generation. Some of these benefits include:
<P>
. increased export earnings through shipping a more versatile
fuel
<P>
to other countries resulting in their reduced dependence on gas
<P>
and petroleum products in electricity generation
<P>
. reduced transport and shipping costs for a fuel which can be
up to 30% lighter than raw coal from the mine;
<P>
. the ability to transport UCC through pipelines as a preference
to coal moved by rail or road transport. This being cheaper, less
congestive to our roads and environmentally sound.
<P>
. The development of high quality carbon anodes for use in the
production of aluminium.
<P>
. Development of advanced combustion technologies for more efficient
generation of electricity.
<P>
A pilot UCC plant co-funded by Pacific Power, was constructed
with production of tonnage quantities of UCC. The demonstration
project was erected on the site of the old Ulan Power Station
near Mudgee in central western NSW. The technical feasibility
of producing UCC was demonstrated during these trials.
<P>
The pilot plant has now been moved to the ACIRL laboratories at
Maitland where further development is being carried out by a consortium
of Australian interests.
<P>
A second project being considered, jointly with the production
of UCC, involves the development of a Clean Coal Engine. It is
envisaged that in order to develop this technology a modified
'coal burning' gas turbine will have to be constructed and tested
using UCC.
<MENU>
<LI>2.7 Underground (In-Situ) Coal Gasification (UCG)
<LI>Underground coal gasification is the process by which coal
is partially burned without being mined, and the heat generated
by the combustion decomposes and gasifies additional coal to produce
a combustible gaseous fuel. The benefit of this process is that
coal seams which are poor in quality and/or expensive to mine
can still be utilised by converting the coal into gas. Development
of UCG is quite recent and a great deal of interest in the technology
has already been shown worldwide.
<LI>The simplest type of underground gasification requires drilling
a well into a coal seam to inject oxygen containing gases whilst
another well is drilled to remove the gaseous products. The process
has two stages, the first being an ignition and linking stage
and the second a gasification stage.
<LI>Figure 2.12 - Underground Coal Gasification.
<LI>In the first stage the injection and production wells are
connected using a linking technique such as a horizontal borehole
or reverse combustion (i.e. fire and injection gases travel in
opposite directions). This stage produces a path of increased
permeability between the injection and production wells. At shallow
depths linked vertical wells may be used where it is possible
to establish linkage. At greater depths or where linkage is more
difficult to establish deflected 'horizontal' bores may be used.
<LI>Once the gasification channel is established and combustion
commenced, air or oxygen rich gases are injected and the gasification
zone progresses gradually toward the production well.
<LI>If air is injected as the oxidant, the product has a low heating
value (3 to 7 MJ/Nm3) due to the presence of nitrogen in the product
gas. If however oxygen and steam are injected, the product has
a medium heating value (8 to 11 MJ/Nm3 as compared to 38 MJ/Nm3
for natural gas). The product gas generally contains carbon monoxide,
hydrogen and methane.
<LI>The product gas may be used to fire a boiler to raise steam
or to fuel a gas turbine for generation of electricity. The product
gas can also be further refined to produce chemicals or liquid
fuels. The cost to produce gas using UCG compared to using a surface
gasifier is much lower due to the fact that mining and coal handling
equipment, as well as, surface gasifiers are not required.
<LI>Developments overseas include industrial scale operation in
the USSR since the 1950's and numerous demonstrations in the USA
to confirm technical feasibility, particularly since the 1972
oil price crisis. Testing has been curtailed in more recent years
due to fuel price declines and increased availability of both
natural gas and petroleum. However, with instability of oil prices
in more recent times, development of this technology could once
again takeoff. There are no commercial operations currently in
the USA or Australia.
<LI>The process has been shown to be technically feasible and
is appropriate where coal is not mineable by conventional means.
Areas have been identified in NSW with coal resources suitable
for UCG. However, a period of up to 10 years may be required to
prove the potential of these specific areas and develop experience
in the technology in Australia.
<LI>2.8 Geothermal Energy
<LI>The flow of heat from within the earth to the surface averages
0.06 W/m2 and is attributable to two factors: the process of the
earth cooling down and newly generated heat as a result of natural
radioactive decay in the earth's crust. Estimates show that the
latter is probably the more significant factor. Since this heat
liberation is not evenly distributed across the surface of the
earth, geothermal anomalies can lend themselves to economic utilisation.
Such anomalies are found mainly but not exclusively in areas with
active volcanoes.
<LI>Figure 2.13 provides a schematic diagram of a geothermal reservoir.
Depending on the temperature of the heat discharged, such reservoirs
may be subdivided into various categories:
<UL>
<LI>hot-steam reservoirs (e.g. the oldest source of this type
in operation is in the Italian town of Larderello operated since
1904);
<LI>hot-water reservoirs (e.g. Wairakei, New Zealand, Cerro Prieto,
Mexico, and in Iceland);
<LI>warm-water reservoirs with temperatures below 100 degrees
Celsius (e.g. Birdsville, Queensland).
</UL>

</MENU>

<P>
Of the energy stored, approximately 25% can be extracted in the
case of hot-steam reservoirs and about 1% in the case of hot-water
reservoirs.
<P>
There are also hot dry rock reservoirs which store by far the
most geothermal energy but have to be developed first by the artificial
creation of crevices and the insertion of water as a heat carrier.
This concept is still in the experimental stage.
<P>
Figure 2.13 - Geothermal Energy for Power Generation.
<H3>Use and Potential</H3>

<P>
Geothermal energy is used for generating electricity and for heating.
In steam and hotwater reservoirs the steam obtained is used directly
for driving turbines. In warm-water reservoirs steam is generated
via a second, closed circuit using low boiling point gases such
as isobutane or ammonia, as the working fluid. The principles
are based on the Rankine cycle; the organic gas being passed through
an expansion turbine/engine. The resulting mechanical energy is
used to generate electricity. Overall design and economy of a
geothermal installation is site specific depending greatly on
the quality and quantity of energy in the reservoir.
<P>
About 1% of the global heat flow is concentrated in geothermal
energy. Geothermal heat is not an immediately renewable source
of energy if a power station extracts more heat from a reservoir
than the adjacent rock can provide.
<P>
Figure 2.14 shows the rated output capacity of major geothermal
facilities currently installed in various countries. The largest
and most successful plant so far is The Geysers in the USA where
several power stations with a total installed capacity of 2000
MW(e) are fed from 250 geothermal sources.
<P>
Figure 2.14 - Number of major geothermal power stations installed
<P>
worldwide (Sept 1986)
<H3>Environmental Considerations</H3>

<P>
The main problem in the use of geothermal energy is that the steam
or water flowing from the artesian bore contains partly aggressive
gases and minerals. Up to a maximum of 26% of the water is made
up of dissolved solids, the average being about 3%. These impurities
cause corrosion and deposits in turbines and heat exchangers and
may also be a burden on the environment.
<P>
General repercussions for the environment include:
<UL>
<LI>the amount of heat discharged is 23 times greater than conventional
power stations;
<LI>the problem of harmful waste waters can be solved in part
by re-injection into the reservoir;
<LI>the amount of sulphur released in the Geysers field by way
of exhaust gases is comparable to the discharge of sulphur by
conventional power stations, a further factor being the unpleasant
smell of other gases including hydrogen sulphide;
<LI>with steam containing a large amount of water, the process
of separation of water from steam may cause significant noise,
requiring good sound insulation.

</UL>

<H3>Nuclear Power in NSW</H3>

<P>
The &quot;Uranium Mining and Nuclear Facilities (Prohibitions)
Act, 1986, No. 194&quot; Section 9 prohibits the Electricity Commission
of New South Wales from constructing, operating or approving a
nuclear reactor for the purposes of generating electricity. This
discussion of nuclear power generation is included for completeness
in the context of alternative and emerging technologies for power
generation.
<H3>The Status of Nuclear Power Fission</H3>

<P>
Electricity was first generated by a nuclear power station in
1951 at the &quot;Experimental Breeder Reactor 1&quot; in Idaho.
Since then nuclear power stations have become a major electricity
source. In 1988, 430 nuclear power stations were in operation,
producing 16% of the world's electrical energy (17 000 TWh). Nuclear
power stations have mostly large units typically 600-1300 MW(e)
in size. The USA has the greatest nuclear capacity, followed by
France, the USSR, Japan and Germany. At over 70%, France has the
greatest proportion of nuclear energy in their generation capacity.
<MENU>
<LI>2.9.1 Types of Nuclear Power Stations
<LI>The fission process which produces the heat required for a
conventional steam cycle occurs when the nucleus of a Uranium
235 atom is split in two after colliding with a neutron. As well
as a large amount of heat being generated, an average of 2.5 neutrons
are released per collision, one of these then moving on to continue
the fission process, and thus sustain the reaction. The 1.5 neutrons
which don't continue in the fission reaction are absorbed by nuclei.
<LI>The heat produced during the fission reaction, is transferred
to a fluid which may be a gas or liquid for example, air, helium,
carbon dioxide, molten salt, water, liquid metal (sodium), or
an organic liquid. This hot fluid then transfers its heat to a
conventional steam cycle from which electricity can be generated.
</MENU>

<H3>Light-Water Reactors</H3>

<P>
There are two forms of light water reactors; pressurised water
reactors (PWR) and less commonly boiling water reactors (BWR).
These reactors use light water as a coolant as opposed to a heavy
water cooled reactor which is also used to supply energy. The
boiling water reactors produce steam in the reactor core, the
saturated steam then passes directly to the turbo-generator where
the energy is recovered. In the pressurised water reactor, high
pressure liquid water is used as the reactor coolant, the water's
heat is then transferred to a secondary steam cycle which supplies
energy to a turbine and generator. Light water reactors are the
most common of the reactor types, and are likely to be for several
decades. They operate with efficiencies slightly less than conventional
fossil fuelled power stations.
<P>
A new design of light water reactor has been developed in the
USA. Known as the 'advanced' light water reactor (ALWR), it operates
with improved passive safety systems and is smaller than other
light water reactors. The reduction in the number of nuclear power
stations being constructed worldwide has slowed the implementation
of the ALWR.
<H3>High Temperature Reactors</H3>

<P>
High temperatures are possible in these reactors as the reactor
core is cooled by compressed helium gas. High temperatures of
up to 950 degrees Celsius result in relatively high efficiencies
of the order of the efficiency of fossil fuelled power stations.
<H3>Fast Breeder Reactors</H3>

<P>
In fast breeder reactors high energy neutrons cause most of the
fission events. This is in contrast to &quot;thermal&quot; reactors
where the neutrons are deliberately slowed down in the moderator,
releasing slow or &quot;thermal&quot; neutrons to the fission
process.
<P>
In the reactor, plutonium 239 is the main fuel. Depleted or natural
uranium (mostly U238) is placed as a blanket around the core.
<P>
High energy &quot;fast&quot; neutrons are necessary in breeder
reactors for the fission of the &quot;fertile&quot; uranium 238.
This in turn produces an increasing amount of plutonium 239. The
rate of production of plutonium 239 is greater than the rate of
consumption, thus the reactor is breeding fissionable fuel. This
reactor utilises the more abundant uranium 238, and could result
in total uranium reserves worldwide being extended.
<P>
Fast breeder technology is currently being promoted above all
in countries without their own uranium resources, such as France
and Japan, but also the USSR. More than 10 fast breeders are now
operating. Considering the low level of uranium prices today,
even proponents of the fast breeder do not believe that this type
of reactor can operate economically in this century.
<P>
This type of reactor is particularly suitable for the extraction
of high temperature heat for chemical processes, the gasification
of coal or the production of steam for electricity generation.
<H3>Radioactive Wastes</H3>

<P>
The nuclear fuel cycle including the production of fuel, its use
in a reactor and its subsequent disposal as waste, produces what
are termed low, medium and high level radioactive wastes.
<P>
Low level wastes are those items and materials used through the
fuel cycle which may have become contaminated. Typically this
may include cleaning equipment, gloves, clothes, tools etc. Low
level waste has similar radioactivity to uranium orebody.
<P>
Medium level wastes include fuel handling equipment, reactor equipment
and parts etc. Both low and medium radioactive wastes are disposed
of in shallow burial sites. Prior to disposal, highly toxic portions
of these wastes are separated and included for disposal with the
high level wastes.
<P>
High level wastes include fission products (spent fuel) and high
atomic mass elements artificially formed by neutron capture. This
waste emits a high level of radiation as well as a great deal
of heat. The heat mainly arising from fission products.
<P>
Quite a few countries have final storage facilities for low and
medium activity waste, however highly active waste is cooled for
years prior to storage, and as yet no final storage facilities
for highly active waste have been implemented. The following brief
descriptions indicate some of the avenues of research in this
area.
<H3>Glass Blocks in Salt Domes</H3>

<P>
The final storage method chosen by Germany is to cast the highly
active material into boron silicate glass blocks, ready for storage
in salt domes. The blocks are placed 850m underground in galleries
drilled in the salt dome. Salt domes have several characteristics
which make them suitable as final storage sites:
<MENU>
<LI>(i) they are located in proven water tight strata, by virtue
of their existence;
<LI>(ii) salt is structurally suitable to protect enclosed waste
from geological upheavals; and
<LI>(iii) salt has a good thermal conductivity allowing efficient
dissipation of heat produced by radioactive decay.
</MENU>

<P>
In spite of the above there are still problems to be considered
with salt domes such as recently small pockets of brine have been
detected in salt domes (in one case a test bore filled with water),
and the resistance of salt domes to high temperatures has been
questioned.
<P>
There is also doubt about the durability of the glass blocks when
subjected to the high temperatures and pressures experienced while
buried deep in geological formations. High temperatures and pressures
cause devitrification of glass and with water present leaching
may occur. Because of these doubts, Britain plans to keep their
glass blocks in air cooled enclosures for at least 50 years.
<H3>Synroc</H3>

<P>
Synroc (which is being developed in Australia) is a synthetic
ceramic crystalline rock, in which it is proposed to dispose of
highly active waste. The waste will be incorporated in synrocs
crystalline structure. Waste on a large scale has not yet been
incorporated in synroc and even after successful incorporation
of the waste, a 50 year testing programme will be required to
ensure the material is secure. If successful, the synroc blocks
would be stored in a stable geological structure such as granite.
Such structures are found in Australia.
<H3>Reprocessing of Fuel</H3>

<P>
Used fuel rods are reprocessed for three main reasons:
<MENU>
<LI>(i) to recover viable fuel for further use;
<LI>(ii) to recycle plutonium for use and destruction in the fission
process of a reactor;
<LI>(iii) to remove fission waste products for final storage.
</MENU>

<P>
The alternative to reprocessing is to store used fuel rods in
intermediate storage until they are cool enough for final storage.
<H3>Nuclear Energy Cost </H3>

<P>
Currently, nuclear power stations are technology intensive, resulting
in very high capital costs. Decommissioning of these power stations
at the end of their useful life is also now being identified as
a major cost. In total, electricity produced by nuclear power
stations costs of the order of three times that of electricity
produced by NSW coal-fired stations.
<MENU>
<LI>2.10 Nuclear Fusion
<LI>The aim of nuclear fusion research is to provide a new source
of energy for the industrialised world which offers significant
advantages:
<UL>
<LI>unproblematic procurement of fuel,
<LI>high energy yield,
<LI>minimum hazard,
<LI>minimum environmental pollution.
</UL>

</MENU>

<P>
Since this type of energy represents a long-term development,
it is currently not possible to make any reliable forecasts as
to the economic viability of nuclear fusion energy.
<P>
Commercial fusion power stations are not expected to be available
before the middle of next century.
<H3>Elementary Process and Fuel</H3>

<P>
The elementary process releasing energy is the fusion of two light
atomic nuclei. Fusion is counteracted by the electrostatic repulsion
of the nuclei, which can only be overcome by making them collide
with a sufficient impact, as is the case at temperatures above
100 million degrees Celsius. The requirement, therefore, is to
heat up the fusion fuel to such temperatures and to maintain it
with adequate density for sufficiently long period.
<P>
Deuterium and tritium have the highest reaction rates for nuclear
fusion. Deuterium can be extracted from water at low cost and
is therefore available in unlimited quantities. Tritium is &quot;bred&quot;
in the reactor itself out of lithium, an element found in large
quantities and well distributed in the earth's crust.
<P>
This would provide a virtually inexhaustible fuel supply, particularly
considering the very small amount of fuel required in nuclear
fusion: generation of 1 million kWh of electricity requires approximately
400t of hard coal but only 40g of lithium and 12.5g of deuterium.
<P>
An important advantage of the fusion reactor is that it does not
pollute the environment with chemically toxic substances. Rather,
the reaction product of the fusion process is helium, a chemically
inactive rare gas. None of the other processes in the fuel cycle
results in the emission of chemical contaminants either. In particular,
there is no emission of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides or carbon
dioxide.
<MENU>
<LI>2.11 Dry Cooling In Power Stations
</MENU>

<H3>Future Power Station Sites in NSW</H3>

<P>
New South Wales power stations have in the past been sited close
to large coal reserves, and water supplies since these raw materials
strongly affect the economics of the electricity generated. Future
power stations may be required to make use of coal reserves which
are remote from sufficient water resources normally required for
cooling purposes. For this reason dry cooling technologies are
being developed such that areas which possess large quantities
of coal but little water become economically attractive as future
power generation sites.
<H3>Power Station Cooling Systems</H3>

<P>
Cooling systems are an integral part of the steam cycle of coal-fired
power stations. Their role can be described as follows:
<H3>The Basic Steam Cycle</H3>

<P>
Water is pumped into the boiler drum at high pressure and then
flows through banks of tubes into a boiler. This water is then
heated (in New South Wales the energy is provided by burning coal),
past its boiling point producing steam at a super-heat condition
of 540 degrees Celsius. When the super-heated high pressure steam
leaves the boiler, it enters an expansion turbine. The steam turns
the fan-like blades of the turbine which is, in turn connected
by a shaft to the electrical generator. This converts the rotational
mechanical power to electricity.
<P>
The spent steam exits the turbine at a low temperature (less than
50 degrees Celsius) and low pressure and is condensed using one
of the cooling systems outlined below. The resulting water is
then ready to be pumped back into the boiler drum to start the
cycle again.
<P>
Figure 2.15 - The Basic Steam Cycle.
<H3>Cooling Systems at NSW Power Stations</H3>

<P>
At present New South Wales power stations are either cooled by
using saltwater from coastal (estuarine), freshwater cooling pond
lake water or wet cooling towers, depending on the availability
of water resources at the particular site.
<P>
Limits have been placed on the maximum temperature (35 degrees
Celsius) at which cooling water can be discharged to prevent high
lake temperatures and avoiding environmental problems. Wet cooling
towers use freshwater and achieve 80% of their cooling by evaporation
of the cooling water. This evaporation represents a loss of millions
of litres of water per year. When the cost of water reaches approximately
70-90 cents/kL (depending on the location), dry cooling may become
the more attractive option for cooling. Current water costs of
Pacific Power Power Stations are of the order of 50 cents/kL.
<H3>Lake Cooling</H3>

<P>
In this system exhaust steam exiting the turbine enters the condenser.
The cooling water from the lake is pumped through a large number
of tubes which pass through the condenser box. The steam is condensed
by the cooling water and is then pumped out from the bottom of
the condenser. The cooling water is heated during this process,
and is then returned to the lake.
<H3>Wet Cooling Towers</H3>

<P>
Wet cooling towers use the same condenser system as in lake cooling,
however, the cooling water comes from a large basin at the bottom
of the cooling tower. In a natural draft cooling tower the heated
cooling water from the condenser is sprayed down the inside of
the cooling tower whilst air, under the effects of natural convection
flows up through the cooling tower. The air draft evaporates some
of the cooling water, lowering the temperature of the remaining
cooling water. The draft can also be produced by fans in an induced
draft cooling tower. A plume of pure water vapour can often be
seen exiting the top of wet cooling towers particularly when the
atmosphere has high humidity.
<H3>Figure 2.16 - Lake Cooling/ Figure 2.17 - Wet Cooling Tower
</H3>

<H3>Dry Cooling Systems</H3>

<P>
There are two main types of dry cooling technology, the direct
system and the indirect system. These systems operate similar
to car radiators, in that they use a flow of air to cool water
flowing inside finned tubes.
<H3>Indirect Dry Cooling</H3>

<P>
Indirect dry cooling towers use the same condenser system as in
lake cooling, however the cooling water is recirculated through
banks of finned tubes over which cooling air flows. The air flow
is induced in a natural draft cooling tower by convection.
<P>
If fans were used instead of the natural draft tower, a large
number of fans would be required to achieve the same heat rejection.
This is because the temperature difference between the air and
the cooling water is relatively small. The natural draft cooling
tower for dry cooling is larger than for an equivalent wet system,
since heat transfer rates are much less.
<P>
Another form of indirect cooling system is that of the 'spray'
condenser. In this system the boiler water acts also as the cooling
water and is circulated through the finned tubes for cooling.
This system is theoretically more efficient than other indirect
systems as heat transfer through tubes from the boiler water to
the cooling circuit is no longer required. In practice these condensers
have not proved to be as efficient as expected and research is
continuing. Water treatment in this case however is more critical
to maintain demineralised water quality for such a large volume.
<H3>Direct Dry Cooling</H3>

<P>
In the direct dry cooling system the turbine exhaust steam is
passed directly through finned tubes. The tubes are finned to
increase their surface area and hence cooling capability. Ambient
air is forced over these tubes with the aid of fans cooling and
condensing the steam.
<P>
The cooling system needs to be located as near as possible to
the turbine, so that the turbine operates efficiently. This also
minimises leaks which can contaminate the steam (steam pressure
is below atmospheric pressure, so leaks will allow air to flow
into the tubes). It is possible to locate a fan forced cooling
system closer to the turbine than a natural draft system. The
tube banks are located directly adjacent to the turbine hall,
minimising piping distance, and the fans are located under the
tubebanks.
<P>
Comparison of Direct vs Indirect Dry Cooling Systems. Indirect
dry cooling systems tend to have a large capital cost (due to
the large cost of the natural draft cooling tower) but low operating
cost. In comparison direct dry cooling has a low capital cost
but high operating cost (due to large power consumption of the
fans). In general, direct dry cooling is favoured at sites with
low fuel cost (the fan power is less costly), whilst indirect
dry cooling is more suitable at sites with high fuel costs.
<H3>Current Status</H3>

<P>
The largest dry cooled power stations have been constructed in
South Africa. Three power stations were built consisting of 6
units, each unit having an output in the range 660-685 MW(e):
Matimba - a direct dry cooled station, Majuba - also a direct
system and Kendal - an indirect dry cooled station. The largest
power station units in NSW are similar in size to the South African
units, hence the technology being developed for South Africa has
particular relevance to NSW developments.
<P>
Pacific Power is currently investigating the site specific nature
of corrosion and fouling of a variety of dry cooling tube types.
Because of the low heat transfer rates of dry cooling, this aspect
of their operation is critical as it may cause heat rejection
rates to vary considerably and hence affect the economics of electricity
produced.

<H3>NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN POWER GENERATION</H3>

<H4>Renewables</H4>

<H5>3.1 Wind Energy</H5>

<P>
For centuries mankind has been harnessing the power of the wind,
to propel sailing ships, pump water and, during this century,
to produce electricity. Today a major focus for wind energy is
the production of electricity for supply into the main electricity
network.
<P>
Wind turbines for producing electricity range from kilowatt sized
machines for use on yachts and at isolated homesteads to a few
machines of several megawatts that are still largely experimental.
Currently, worldwide there are more than 2000 MW(e) of installed
wind turbine capacity, roughly equivalent to about 60% of the
capacity of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Although this is located
mainly in California, Denmark has a total installed capacity of
some 360 MW(e), comprising almost 3000 turbines and providing
about 2% of electricity demand.
<P>
Various designs of wind turbines are available.
<H3>Figure 3.1 - Typical Wind Turbine Performance Data</H3>

<P>
Several countries are operating largescale (1 to 4 MW) experimental
wind turbines. However, the most widely used machines for electricity
production are much smaller. The design concept is relatively
simple and a typical 300 kW(e) machine could have the following
features:
<P>
. three-bladed 30 metre diameter rotor rotating at 40 rpm;
<P>
. blades constructed from fibreglass or wood epoxy and which are
<P>
able to change their pitch to optimise the angle to the wind;
<P>
. hub of the rotor connected to a gearbox and induction generator,
<P>
both placed within an enclosed nacelle;
<P>
. nacelle and rotor placed on a 30 metre tower, and able to rotate
<P>
so that the wind turbine is always facing into the wind;
<P>
. able to replace the combustion of 250 tonnes of coal per year
<P>
which would supply the energy requirements of 70 NSW homes.
<P>
Today, the most economical turbines are about 300 kW - 600 kW
capacity
<P>
and could typically be located as a 'wind farm' of 3 to 6 MW(e)
total
<P>
capacity occupying approximately 2 square kilometres of land.
The wind
<P>
turbines in each farm would be operated as an integrated unit
with
<P>
connection often being into the local electricity transmission
network.
<P>
Several countries have active wind energy programs. In some countries
<P>
the cost of electricity generated by wind turbines is competitive
with
<P>
that from other forms of generation. Other countries desirous
of
<P>
achieving a portion of generation from non fossil fuel sources
have
<P>
embarked upon wind generation programs.
<P>
Proponents of wind energy claim a number of advantages in support
of
<P>
the technology in addition to the value associated with providing
<P>
energy, and some credit for capacity. These advantages include
the
<P>
following:
<P>
. the energy produced displaces combustion of fossil fuels and
hence
<P>
emissions of carbon dioxide, particulates, sulphur dioxide and
<P>
other pollutants;
<P>
. the wind is a renewable resource;
<P>
. diversification of an electricity supply system generally reduces
<P>
risk;
<P>
. some distribution systems may benefit from local generation;
<P>
. local economic and employment benefits may result.
<P>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
The relationship between wind speed, wind power and typical wind
turbine performance follows:
<P>
The power (P) available from a wind swept area (A) with wind blowing
at velocity (V) is given by the following formula.
<P>
P = 0.5 x D x A x V3
<P>
P = Wind Power (watts)
<P>
D = Air Density (kg/m3)
<P>
A = Swept Area (m2)
<P>
V = Wind Speed (m/s)
<P>
It is important to note that power is proportional to the wind
speed
<P>
cubed, and hence for relatively small increases in wind speed
large
<P>
increases in power can be observed.
<P>
Betz Limit of Wind Turbine Efficiency
<P>
There is a theoretical limit to the amount of power which can
be
<P>
extracted from the wind. This is termed the Betz limit. The Betz
<P>
limit stipulates that a perfect wind turbine can at best extract
59.3%
<P>
of the total power available. This limit was originally derived
by A.
<P>
Betz in 1927.
<P>
Modern Wind Turbine Efficiencies
<P>
At their design wind speed, modern wind turbines can extract as
much as
<P>
40% of the available power from the wind.
<P>
The amount of energy produced by a wind turbine per year depends
<P>
strongly on the selected site and the climatic conditions associated
<P>
with that site. An annual average wind speed of above 6 m/s defines
a
<P>
good wind site.
<P>
The wind turbine energy production vs. wind speed curve shows
that most
<P>
of the electrical energy is produced at wind speeds well above
the
<P>
average wind speed.
<P>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
The cost of wind generated electricity is very sensitive to the
available wind resource. For example, wind with a velocity of
8 m/s will provide more than twice the power of 6 m/s wind. In
countries with an established wind turbine manufacturing industry,
and a good wind resource, the cost of electricity from the wind
is about 5 to 7 cents/kWh (or about twice the current cost of
producing coal-fired electricity in NSW).
<P>
Several issues must be carefully assessed when planning to install
wind turbines. Wind energy is not completely environmentally benign,
only relatively so. The choice of a suitable site involves assessment
of the wind and the availability of the necessary electricity
transmission infrastructure. However, other issues must also be
addressed which are particular to wind generation:
<UL>
<LI>visual impact of the wind farm on the local community;
<LI>local noise annoyance;
<LI>electromagnetic interference;
<LI>impact on bird life;
<LI>safety aspects.
<MENU>
<LI>It is anticipated that these issues would be resolved in NSW
with appropriate planning and community consultation. As a first
step in this process Pacific Power is funding a $220,000 study
with the CSIRO Centre for Environmental Mechanics to identify
prime wind farm sites in NSW. Figure 3.2 shows areas that may
contain suitable conditions for wind generation in NSW.
<LI>Figure 3.2 - Wind Generation Study Areas in New South Wales.
<LI>It is difficult to assess the potential for wind energy generation
in NSW other than to say that it is anticipated that it will play
a small, but important role in the future electricity supply mix.
To provide a perspective on this technology and its possible utilisation
in NSW it is interesting to note that supply of just 1% of existing
electrical needs would require the installation of more than twenty
10 MW(e) wind farms.
</MENU>

</UL>

<H5>3.2 Solar Photovoltaic</H5>

<P>
Photovoltaics (PV's) is the technology which uses thin sheets
of semiconductive material to directly transform sunlight into
electricity when illuminated.
<P>
The electricity is generated directly in the cell itself, and
so the process is virtually maintenance free except for cleaning
of the active surface as there are no moving parts in the system.
Another advantage of solar cells over concentrator type solar
thermal systems is that it is still possible for them to operate
in diffuse sunlight and in slightly overcast weather.
<P>
Production of solar photovoltaic cells began 30 years ago, with
cells of approximately 2% efficiency being developed for space
programmes. Now, cell efficiency at market level is approximately
14 - 15%. BP Solar are carrying out research here in Australia
and are now producing cells in a pilot production facility with
efficiencies of between 17 to 18%. Costs per watt have decreased
markedly, and research should see this continue whilst also providing
further increases in efficiency. The installed cost of photovoltaics
is still their major disadvantage, however, they still find practical
application for telecommunications, marine navigation, water pumping,
terrestrial applications and remote area power supplies.
<P>
Solar cells are made of 2 layers of a semiconductor material such
as silicon which is doped with minute quantities of other elements
to give n-type and p-type semiconductors. Sandwiching these together
gives what is termed a pn junction across which current flows.
This sets up an internal electric field which has a potential
difference of approximately 0.5 V.
<P>
Figure 3.3 - Construction of a Solar Photovoltaic Cell.
<P>
The electric current is then drawn by way of metal contacts which
are distributed across the negative and positive faces of the
cell. This necessary distribution of pick-ups also creates a problem
for cell efficiencies because the contacts create an area that
shades the semiconductor material. A great amount of research
goes into the practicalities of getting photons into the material,
quite apart from the movement of carriers within it.
<P>
A number of different forms of photovoltaic technology exist.
For example, there are concentrating and non-concentrating cells,
different cell materials such as silicon, gallium arsenide, and
compounds of copper with trace elements. Within the silicon cell
market, there are mono-crystalline, poly-crystalline and amorphous
silicon cells. Each type is being continually refined, and hence
efficiencies improved.
<P>
Professor Martin Green and his team at the University of NSW presently
hold the world record with a non-concentrating silicon cell at
an efficiency of 24.2%. Theoretically the maximum conceivable
efficiency would be of the order of 30%.
<P>
Professor Green also heads up the 'Centre for Photovoltaic Devices
and Systems'. One of the aims of this centre is to further research
into thin film silicon devices. This presently appears to be the
most promising of cells under research for the future. As well
as continuing with other cell research, part of the aim of the
centre is to look for specific sites within the electricity supply
network where PV's might best be used. Some examples are, preventing
the need for re-conductoring of heavily loaded lines approaching
thermal limits, reducing voltage drop at the end of single wire
earth return lines, and offsetting capital costs for upgrading
of thermally overloaded transformers.
<P>
The second largest application of solar cells in Australia provides
power for water pumping. This represents very good matching of
solar energy with water requirements because, usually, most water
is required when agricultural evaporation is high due to sunny
and hot conditions.
<P>
Solar cells are also being more widely used as Remote Area Power
Supplies (RAPS) where they can be economic in offsetting the cost
of diesel fuel for small communities, or single dwellings not
connected to the main electricity supply grid. PV cells can be
seen providing electricity for navigational aids on waterways,
lighting, electric fencing in remote areas, cathodic protection,
and outback telephone systems.
<P>
Presently, in Australia, solar cells would cost approximately
$6000/kW in large scale use. However, at least this much again
would be required for the balance of system costs, which includes
such items as power conditioning equipment and site installation
costs. By comparison, a coal-fired power station would cost around
$1200/kW for a coastal power station with access to lake or sea
water cooling, plus the cost of developing a coal mine to supply
the power station and bulk transmission cost.
<P>
Even given the dramatic reduction in cell costs over the years,
and the fact that photovoltaic generation would probably be connected
at distribution voltage level, some time would be required before
cells could compete on a large scale grid connected basis. The
availability of electricity would only correspond to the availability
of sunlight, and thus, could not directly compete as a reliable
alternative, without the added expense of storage such as a battery.
<P>
This in no way negates the goal of improving the viability of
solar cells. Specific site application has shown them to be viable,
and their generality of use will only increase as research continues
to reduce costs.
<H3>Types of Cells</H3>

<P>
Silicon is the second most abundant material on earth, and is
the most common material used in solar cells.
<P>
There are three major types of silicon solar cells.
<P>
Amorphous: These cells do not possess a regular crystal structure.
They can be produced in films of 0.3 microns and their production
is relatively simple and cheap. Mass production of these cells
is quite easy, with small amounts of material being deposited
on to a substrate such as glass or aluminium, and can even be
made flexible.
<P>
Their major drawback is their low efficiency and short lifespan.
Presently, efficiencies are only 5-7%, however this drops to 3-4%
in operation due to amorphous silicon instabilities. It is generally
used for small scale applications such as calculators and watches.
<P>
Poly-crystalline: These cells consist of a number of silicon crystals
grown as an ingot from which wafers are cut. Their maximum efficiency
is generally 15% and is standard material for high output applications.
Its layers are of the order of 250-400 microns thick.
<P>
Mono-crystalline: These are the highest efficiency silicon cells
available, however in the past their expense has generally precluded
them from anything except &quot;space&quot; applications where
the sun shines nearly all day. Recent developments in mono-crystalline
cell technology has seen their cost reduced to around that of
the poly-crystalline cell. Mono-crystalline cells consist only
of a single crystal.
<P>
Cells other than silicon are available, and some, such as gallium
arsenide, have efficiencies higher than that of silicon. They
are more efficient because their particular band-gap energies
are closer to the theoretical optimum than silicon. They do however
use materials which are more expensive, less abundant, and can
be environmentally hazardous.
<P>
Because different semi-conductor materials absorb different portions
of the solar spectrum, the possiblility of piggy-backing them
to produce a tandem cell has been investigated. These then absorb
much more of the incident radiation than either material would
alone. Once again, however, their cost is much greater than silicon
cells, even on a unit energy delivered basis.
<H5>3.3 Solar Thermal</H5>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Solar thermal does not create electricity directly as does photovoltaic
technology but rather uses solar collectors to heat a fluid, usually
water. The resulting heat may then be used either directly, as
hot water (e.g. domestic hot water system), or process heat, which
is when solar energy systems are at their most efficient (e.g.
domestic hot water system), or may supply preheating, or indeed
steam, for turning a heat engine and generator.
<P>
The solar collectors are the heart of the system and their design
determines the final application and efficiency. The critical
factors are the amount and temperature of solar energy collection
that they provide.
<P>
Flat plate solar collectors are commonly used for heating water
or air for a range of domestic and industrial applications. This
collector provides no concentration and its maximum operating
temperature is generally around 80 degrees Celsius.
<P>
To reach higher temperatures efficiently, some concentration needs
to be employed. Concentration to give high temperatures offers
advantages of more efficient heat transfer, higher theoretical
steam cycle efficiencies, and subsequently a much wider range
of applications. However higher temperatures require greater emphasis
upon reducing thermal losses. As well as this, the greater the
concentration, the greater can be the detrimental effect of cloud
cover or hazy days.
<H3>Solar Thermal Systems</H3>

<P>
Residential flat plate collectors are presently installed on about
5% of NSW homes. The Pacific Power and Sydney University are collaborating
in the testing of a system using a mildly concentrating trough
with an evacuated tube collector. It can supply not only hot water
but space heating and cooking requirements as well. Investigations
show that with one day's storage, solar collection could supply
up to 90% of the thermal loads of a household. The reason for
this and its inherent advantages over other solar systems, is
that it can be designed to give a winter bias, which is when thermal
energy is most needed. A home in the Sydney region has been retrofitted
with such a system and data is now being collected. In keeping
with the whole concept of energy efficiency, a 12-star equivalent
refrigerator, insulation, and compact fluorescent lighting have
also been installed for evaluation.
<P>
Solar Cogeneration: In terms of solar cogeneration, a practical
study was co-funded by Pacific Power in 1991 to look at the provision
of electrical energy and process heat for applications such as
hospitals and process industries. The energy for the production
of steam would be supplied by high temperature collectors. Though
technically viable, none of the sites studied would presently
be economically viable against gas-fired systems or grid electricity.
<P>
Industrial process heat is the largest single energy sector in
Australia, amounting to some 900 PJ annually. Of this, 15% is
below 200 degrees Celsius and 50% below 500 degrees Celsius. Present
solar collector technology could provide the former, and higher
temperature collectors under refinement could provide much of
the latter. Some estimates predict that low temperature steam
could be provided by mass-produced solar collectors at around
2 c/kWh.
<P>
In terms of solar cogeneration, a practical study was co-funded
by Pacific Power in 1991 to look at the provision of electrical
energy and process heat for applications such as hospitals and
process industries. The energy for the production of steam would
be supplied by high temperature collectors. Though technically
viable, none of the sites studied would presently be economically
viable against gas-fired systems or grid electricity.
<P>
Large-Scale Grid Connection: Electricity generation can be provided
24 hours per day by using a solar and gas system, with the gas
providing super-heat or backup to that steam provided by solar
energy. Sites in NSW such as Cobar could be ideal for this technology
since there is a gas supply available and the number of hours
of sunshine per year are high. The largest solar installations
in the world are the 275 MW solar thermal electricity plants installed
by LUZ in Southern Calfornia.
<P>
The solar array is composed of parabolic trough reflectors which
individually track the sun's movement with microprocessors and
light sensing instruments. The light is concentrated on to evacuated
tubes through which a synthetic oil, heat transfer fluid flows.
Temperatures of nearly 400 degrees Celsius are possible. This
is used to produce super-heated steam via a heat exchanger, with
natural gas fuel as a supplement. The power plant produces electricity
with a peak solar to electric efficiency of approximately 25%.
<P>
Average solar radiation at these LUZ sites is similar to that
at Broken Hill in NSW. SEGS VIII, LUZ's largest project so far,
sized at 80 MW(e), is designed for an annual output of 252.7 GWh.
It has 464 000 square metres of collecting surface area, and occupies
an area of some 300 hectares.
<P>
A small-scale demonstration plant was installed at White Cliffs,
Western New South Wales, using 14 parabolic dishes. The dishes
themselves performed extremely well, however, there were problems
with the steam engine and oil separation system. Larger systems
(greater than 5 MW(e)) which can use steam turbines rather than
engines are expected to give greater overall performance, and
also cost reductions due to economies of scale.
<P>
Central Receiver Systems: These use the heliostats in a reflective
arrangement to generate very high temperatures at a single point.
Though this offers greater turbine efficiency, their capital cost
is higher.
<P>
Solar Ponds: Such a system is most attractive for arid regions
of Australia where there is accompanying high salinity. Technically,
this process is quite feasible. A 250,000 square metres, 5 MW(e)
pond in Israel collects heat at an efficiency of 16%. A demonstration
pond at Curtin Springs in the Northern Territory quotes costs
of around $10,800/kW with energy supplied at 16.6 c/kWh. Further
development is required to make this system viable in the future.
<P>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<H3>Evacuated Tube Solar Water Heaters</H3>

<P>
Convection and conduction losses become more serious as high temperature
applications are attempted, and it became apparent very early
on in research, that evacuating the space between the glass cover
and the absorber surface would yield much improved performance.
<P>
Figure 3.4 - Solar House Retrofit Project.
<P>
Evacuated flat plate collectors have been investigated, however
are unable to withstand atmospheric pressure without costly mechanical
reinforcement. Tubes have been shown that they can withstand such
pressures.
<P>
The combination of the vacuum (which reduces convection and conduction
losses) and a selective surface (which reduces radiation losses)
means that while evacuated tubes do not offer efficiency improvements
over flat plates at temperatures around 80 degrees Celsius, they
do allow higher temperatures to be reached, up to 350 degrees
Celsius.
<P>
Evacuated tubes have solar energy concentrated on them by a reflective
surface. These surfaces range from flat white painted diffuse
reflectors with no concentration and optical efficiencies of 53%
to highly reflective, concentrating, parabolic troughs with optical
efficiencies of greater than 90%.
<H3>Selective Surfaces</H3>

<P>
Solar energy is a form of electromagnetic radiation whose wavelength
ranges from about 0.3 to 2.5 microns. When this strikes a surface,
some is reflected, some absorbed, and the remainder transmitted
through. Materials are then chosen to suit the application. For
example, in the hot, arid regions of the world, houses are usually
painted white to reflect as much of the radiation as possible.
However, in a solar collector, black coatings are used to absorb
as much of the heat as possible. A problem arises here, however,
in that the more heat that is absorbed, the hotter the surface
gets, and thus the more radiation that the surface emits back
to its environment as a loss. This is what prevents standard flat
plate collectors reaching temperatures much above 80 degrees Celsius.
Loss of heat through emittance is especially a problem in areas
with cold, clear nights. It explains for example, why pools are
often warmer after a cloudy night.
<P>
The emittance from a hot surface is at a higher wavelength than
the solar radiation which heats it initially, and this is why
a selective black surface is a more efficient means of collection
than conventional black surfaces. A selective surface uses a specially
selected combination of materials to allow the sunlight portion
of the spectrum in, but which has very low emissivity in the infra-red
range, and therefore lose very little heat through re-radiation.
<P>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<H5>3.4 Wave Energy</H5>

<P>
Waves are not regarded as a large energy source in NSW, as wave
energy is reduced significantly by the existence of the continental
shelf along the coastline. Suitably sited, however, wave energy
may be beneficial to coastal communities remote from the electricity
supply network.
<H3>Wave Formation</H3>

<P>
Energy is transmitted to the ocean from the winds through friction
between the air and the surface of the seas across which they
blow. As winds derive their energy from solar gradients, wave
energy is an indirect by-product of solar energy. Contrary to
popular belief the water in a wave does not actually travel but
merely oscillates while the energy of the wave is translated across
the surface of the ocean.
<P>
The power in a wave is equal to the product of the potential energy
per unit area and the phase velocity of the wave train. The average
power flux in kW/m can be calculated from the expression P = 0.5H2T
(approx) where H is the significant wave height at the location
and T is the dominant wave period.
<P>
Preliminary estimates of some NSW sites yields wave energies of
approximately 12 kW/m of coastline. Thus a 120 kW device would
need to be 10m wide at this location. Ideal on-shore sites yield
wave energies of 25 kW/m.
<P>
A study commissioned by Pacific Power and completed in 1991 investigated
suitability of sites along the New South Wales coastline. The
NSW coast wave power is not high enough for long enough to be
presently viable.
<P>
Costs for a prototype device are estimated to be of the order
of $3000/kW.
<P>
It is estimated that some 1 000 000 GWh of wave energy is dissipated
each year along the southern shores of Australia.
<P>
A number of attempts have been made to harness the perennial motion
of the ocean. These include such devices as the Nodding Duck,
Cockerell Raft, Circular Sea Clam, Bristol Cylinder, the Frog,
and a Swedish Wave Rotor. However the two devices which have shown
the most promise are the Tapchan and the oscillating water chamber:
<P>
Tapchan: The principle here is capital intensive yet very simple.
Waves moving forward through a tapered channel rise and spill
over the sides into an elevated reservoir, from which water can
be released through a turbine as in a hydro system. The advantages
here lie in the buffer storage which dampens the irregularity
of the waves.
<P>
Oscillating Water Chamber: A number of versions of this technology
exist, however essentially as the wave rolls in a column of water
is forced upwards through a cylinder, the pocket of air trapped
above being blown through an air turbine which in turn drives
a generator. As the wave rolls out, air is drawn back through
the air turbine. The profile of the turbine blades are designed
so that they continue to spin the turbine in the same direction
no matter what the direction of airflow. This allows energy to
be extracted from the air as the wave rolls in and also as it
recedes.
<P>
Figure 3.5 - Wave Resonance Power Generation.
<P>
Installation of a number of different sized chambers allows maximum
use to be made of different period waves in resonating chambers.
<H3>Data Collection</H3>

<P>
Wave data is collected using wave-rider buoys. These are large
spherical steel floats which house the electronic processing equipment.
The heart of this equipment, is an accelerometer which responds
to the vertical movements of the buoy. Integration of wave movement
via a microprocessor calculates wave velocities in the vertical
direction, and as a result can calculate wave displacement data.
A solar cell powered transmitter sitting atop the buoy then relays
the data to a shore based receiver. This data is compiled on computer
for processing and assessment.
<P>
Eight wave rider buoys have been deployed along the NSW coast,
and are constantly compiling data which is useful for investigating
wave power potential. This data is used for a variety of engineering
projects along the coast including wharves and jetties, foreshore
developments, storm damage, etc.
<P>
A New Zealand device for wave energy measurement consists of a
seismograph on the shore, monitoring the energy of breaking waves
and correlating this data to wave height.
<H5>3.5 Biomass</H5>

<P>
The extraction of energy from biomass is understood to mean two
processes: first, large-scale production of liquid or gaseous
fuel from plants or crops specially cultivated for this purpose;
second, biological recovery of combustible gas from organic waste
commonly known as biogas.
<P>
The potential and economics of these two processes are clearly
different. The utilization of crops and plants for energy production
purposes is, in general, not practicable on a large scale. In
addition to this, it still has to be proved whether the substantial
input of energy by way of manuring, sowing, tilling the fields,
harvesting and transport can be recovered anyway. Last but certainly
not least, the harmful effect of monocultures on the environment
with large amounts of fertilisers, insecticides, pesticides and
herbicides would be difficult to justify.
<P>
So far, most of the emphasis has been on the useful energy obtained
from organic waste which is considered to be zero cost. The waste
may be used for energy production in many ways. The direct combustion
of such waste for process heat and electricity generation is finding
increasing application. However, such waste must be used within
reasonably close proximity to its point of origin to compensate
for its high collection cost and to avoid the high cost of transportation
to the point of use.
<P>
In principle, many farms could provide themselves with the energy
they need from their own organic waste. One of the main advantages
of biogas is that the gas which is generated is produced where
biomass accumulates as a waste material.
<P>
Biogas systems have been in widespread use for more than 30 years,
especially in Third World countries. India has a few hundred thousand
simple facilities of this kind, whilst in China about 7 million
operate.
<P>
Compared with other energy generation facilities, construction
and operation of a biogas facility is a simple and straightforward
task. Animal excrements and plant waste are the source of energy
used. They are reduced in size and mixed before being placed in
a fermentation tank. The organic waste decomposes under anaerobic
(ie. without oxygen) conditions as a result of its exposure to
microbes naturally present, generating combustible gases in the
process. The only prerequisite for proper fermentation is correct
acidity and operating in a specific temperature range so that
the microbes thrive. Pesticides, disinfectants and antibiotics
must be avoided as they are likely to bring the fermentation process
to a halt.
<P>
Figure 3.6 - Floating Bell Biogas Producer Schematic Diagram.
<P>
The biogas generated in this way consists primarily of 40-70%
methane and 30-60% carbon dioxide. If the gas contains 60% methane,
it has a calorific value of 70% of natural gas. The yield generated
by a biogas facility depends above all on the composition of the
waste material to be fermented and the ambient temperature. If
this temperature is low, up to 50% of the gas generated can be
required afterwards for heating the biomass.
<P>
The other product generated by the process is odourless and hygienic
compost which is ideally suited for use as a fertiliser, provided
the biomass was free of toxic substances such as heavy metals.
<P>
Biogas generation facilities are used mainly by family operated
farms and, in particular, by farms keeping their own livestock.
Using fermentation tanks with a capacity of 6-25 cubed metres,
small and medium-sized farms mainly generate their own energy
for cooking and lighting. The following figures provide basic
orientation on the capacities available. Using the dung of four
head of cattle or 10 pigs, a farm can produce approximately 2
cubed metres of gas and 100 L of sludge manure a day in a 10 cubed
metres facility. This gas is sufficient for:
<P>
. cooking three meals for a family of eight, or
<P>
. running a refrigerator all day and burning a lamp for
<P>
three hours, or
<P>
. generating electricity for one hour with a 3 kW motor
<P>
generator.
<P>
The bright light of gas lamps is generated by incandescent mantles.
Gas operated refrigerators are ammonia absorption refrigerators,
biogas serving merely as the external heating supply. The gas
motors for driving power generators, in turn, are modified diesel
or petrol engines. Any corrosion caused by the hydrogen sulphide
in biogas is kept within limits by changing the oil regularly.
<P>
The production and use of biogas for energy generation has significant
environmental implications. The biogas as it is produced contains
major greenhouse gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide. It
is estimated that methane is 8 times more potent a greenhouse
gas than is carbon dioxide. Therefore by burning the methane gas
produced, which would otherwise have escaped to atmosphere, carbon
dioxide is formed and the overall addition of greenhouse gases
to the atmosphere is less. The environmental benefit is further
enhanced by using the biogas to generate energy, thus reducing
the amount of fossil fuel required to match energy demand. The
utilization of biogas is not only of benefit to the environment,
but has the potential to provide economic returns as well.
<H5>3.6 Waste Incineration</H5>

<P>
In 1989 there were 3.75 million tonnes of solid waste disposed
of in the Sydney region. The quantity of waste being disposed
of is increasing both in total and on a per capita basis. It is
estimated that at these rates, annual waste quantities would increase
to some 5.5 million tonnes by 2001 and by as much as 7.1 million
tonnes by 2011.
<P>
Waste analysis programs carried out by the then Waste Management
Authority (WMA) indicate the average composition of council collected
garbage are those shown in the following table:
<H3>Figure 3.7 - Average composition of council collected garbage
</H3>

<P>
Component of Waste Weight % (as received)
<P>
----------------------------------------------------------
<P>

<P>
food waste 27.5
<P>
garden waste 20.5
<P>
plastics 7.6
<P>
wood, rubber, textiles 4.3
<P>
metals 6.3
<P>
glass 9.3
<P>
fines 3.6
<P>
It is important to note that solid wastes are not homogeneous
in nature but are a mixture of both combustible and non-combustible
materials which vary from location to location and over time.
<P>
Apart from avoiding waste from the very beginning and recycling
the waste produced, one of the best methods of waste management
for the future is to burn it in a refuse fuelled power station.
<P>
An international comparison shows that countries with little space
for waste disposal sites make greater use of incineration technologies.
While the incineration of household waste in the European Community
member countries averages only 20%, the corresponding figures
for Japan and Switzerland are 65% and 80% respectively.
<P>
The energy content of household waste varies greatly. This energy
can be recovered in waste incineration. The relative contribution
of waste incineration to the overall generation of energy is small,
hardly exceeding 1% of the national consumption of primary energy
in any country. However, considered from the perspective of plant
technology, conventional waste incineration is a well-developed
process.
<P>
The technology of waste incineration provides two distinct advantages.
The first is the reduction in volume of disposed wastes to about
5% of the original volume (or about 20-30% of the original weight)
and the second is the utilization of the energy produced for the
generation of electricity.
<P>
The scarcity of landfill sites and the increasing difficulty in
obtaining approval for future disposal sites, particularly in
built-up areas such as the Sydney Basin, is forcing other disposal
options to be considered. Waste incineration whilst it is not
necessarily the whole answer, will be an important consideration
in the assessment of options for future disposal.
<P>
The WMA Strategic Plan has included the use of incineration as
an alternative to the long distance transfer of waste away from
the metropolitan area. The WMA also indicate that a strategy of
progressive implementation of three incinerators (1000 tonnes/day)
during the planning period of 2001 to 2011 would require an investment
of the order of $450 million in 1988 values.
<H3>Technologies</H3>

<P>
The technologies for the incineration of wastes can be divided
in two distinct categories. The first has been developed for the
incineration of domestic refuse and sewage sludge, whilst the
second has been developed for the incineration of industrial refuse
and sludge.
<P>
Domestic incinerators consist of a moving grate, of which there
are numerous designs and onto which the garbage is dumped (some
of the more common designs are known as the roller grate, tilting
grate, step type travelling grate and the inclined grate). Combustion
air is passed from beneath the grate through the burning garbage.
The heat produced is used for the production of steam. Residence
time in the incinerator can be strictly controlled by varying
the grate speed and hence avoiding emission problems caused by
incomplete combustion.
<P>
There are two types of industrial refuse and sludge incineration
plant, namely the rotary kiln and the fluidised bed.
<P>
Both domestic and industrial waste disposal methods rely on the
concept of complete 'burnout' of the waste. This is done to minimise
the pollutants contained in combustion gases. Complete 'burnout'
is best achieved by high temperatures, long residence times and
by good mixing of the combustion gases.
<P>
The heat produced from the combustion of waste material is transferred
to banks of water wall tubes for the production of steam which
in turn is used to drive a steam turbine and electrical generator.
This process of steam raising is similar in design to some of
the other technologies discussed throughout this document, for
instance fluidised bed combustion technologies and combined cycle.
<P>
Once the heat contained in the combustion gases is transferred
to the steam circuit, pollution control equipment is used to reduce
harmful pollutants. Burning of domestic and industrial refuse,
leads to emissions of pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen
oxides, carbon monoxide and particulate matter. Depending on the
nature of refuse, it is expected that the refuse residue should
only contain low levels of organic compounds and heavy metals.
Waste incineration plants can operate with minimum impact on the
environment by employing emission control equipment such as flue
gas desulphurisation for the control of sulphur dioxide and acid
gases, a thermal nitrogen oxides removal system for control of
nitrogen oxides and a high efficiency particulate collection device
such as a fabric filter for removal of solids and heavy metals
carried along by the exhaust gases.
<P>
The size of waste incineration plants is often quoted in terms
of the mass of refuse consumed per hour rather than the maximum
electrical output. This is useful because the energy contained
in the refuse feed can vary substantially with time and hence
the maximum electrical energy generated also varies. Common incinerator
sizes are between 5 and 30 tonnes per hour. Plant sizes are generally
between 15 and 30 MW of electrical output. For waste tonnages
greater than this, it is usual to install a number of these units
in a single facility.
<P>
The energy contained in domestic garbage is approximately 8-10
MJ/kg or 30-40% of the energy content of black coal.
<P>
Industrial refuse incineration generally excludes the burning
of scrap tyres. Because of the nature of manufacture of tyres,
the tyre combustion process releases a significant amount of potentially
toxic air pollutants such as arsenic, cadmium, dioxins, furans
and other trace heavy metals.
<P>
Therefore, tyre combustion requires &quot;Best Available Control
Technology&quot; (BACT) for the control of emissions. To achieve
this level of environmental control a significant amount of expenditure
is required which adds significantly to the total cost of the
incineration plant. For this reason, the current practice of waste
disposal is to separate scrap tyres from other wastes.
<P>
Tyre combustion technology has already proven to be clean, safe,
odourless and virtually pollution free at a power plant constructed
at Modesto, California, U.S.A. The plant can burn up to 6 million
tyres per year. Whole scrap tyres are fed into two identical incineration
plants at a rate of about 6.5 tonnes/hour and burned under carefully
controlled conditions. Combustion is carried out at a temperature
of 1100 degrees Celsius to produce 14 MW of electric power. This
relatively high temperature combustion process ensures the complete
burnout of the tyres. Together with complete air quality control,
the operation of this facility has been claimed to be environmentally
safe.
<H5>3.7 Landfill Gas</H5>

<P>
Landfill gas refers to the formation of combustible gases from
garbage dumps through primarily anaerobic decomposition of organic
wastes (mostly food, garden and paper wastes). The gas produced
consists predominantly of methane and carbon dioxide and contains
40-60% of the energy content of natural gas.
<P>
Some 3.75 million tonnes of solid waste were disposed of in the
Sydney region in 1989, and as much as 7.1 million tonnes annually
are projected by the year 2011. These wastes not only represent
a significant problem in terms of disposal urban areas such as
Sydney but also a large potential energy resource.
<P>
Driven by environmental concerns during the 1950's investigations
were carried out around the world into the characteristics of
landfills over their lifetime and the constituents of the odorous
gases produced. It was found that the wastes decomposed in the
presence of moisture and the action of anaerobic bacteria, producing
methane and carbon dioxide. As well as these gases being produced,
other gases were released including nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen
and traces of hydrogen sulphide (rotten egg gas) resulting in
the foul odours normally associated with garbage dumps.
<P>
Methane as a gas contributes significantly to the greenhouse effect
and contributes 6 times more to global warming than does carbon
dioxide on a molecule for molecule basis. For this reason there
is an advantage in burning this methane to produce energy, which
although producing carbon dioxide has less impact on the greenhouse
effect.
<P>
The decomposition of garbage commences soon after collection with
the initial process being aerobically activated and the gases
produced consisting mainly of carbon dioxide. Once the garbage
has been compacted into the landfill the remaining oxygen is consumed
and anaerobic conditions prevail. This is then suitable, providing
moisture is present, for the production of methane.
<P>
The technology for using landfill gas as a fuel source for power
generation, using gas turbines or engines is well established.
In 1975, the USA started utilising landfill gas at Palos Verdes
in southern California and since then more than 70 sites have
been developed. In Germany more than 50 sites now exploit this
gas and in Britain there are 24 commercial schemes drawing gas
from 18 locations with a further 26 schemes either in advanced
planning stages or under construction.
<P>
In the Sydney region there are two projects presently underway.
The first located at Merrylands was originally the site of an
old brickworks excavation which was filled with approximately
700,000 tonnes of garbage between 1979 and 1985 and now produces
about 700 cubed metres per hour of landfill gas. Most of this
site has now been dressed with soil and landscaped. About 7 years
ago the then Waste Management Authority began selling this gas
to the local brick works for firing its kilns. More recently,
however, the brickworks have ceased operation and a 165kW engine
and generator have now been installed to utilise the gas for generating
electricity. This project has been a joint effort between Prospect
Electricity, Waste Management Authority and Pacific Power and
will provide valuable operating experience for future use of this
technology.
<P>
The second project located at Lucas Heights, south-west of Sydney,
is planned to be larger than the Merrylands project and will be
built, owned and operated by a private company as a commercial
venture. There is estimated to be at least 0.5 PJ per annum (initially
some 3000 cubed metres per hour) of gas at this location which
is sufficient to generate on average 5 MW of electricity over
the next 15 years.
<H2>CHAPTER FOUR</H2>

<H3>ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS</H3>

<H4>4.1 Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES)</H4>

<P>
Compressed air energy storage (CAES) offers a means of storing
excess electrical energy available during 'offpeak' periods, usually
during the night, for recovery during the 'peak' demand periods
of early morning and evenings. By storing energy, utilities can
avoid the installation of more power stations to cover the peak
electricity demand.
<P>
There are five above-ground components required by the basic CAES
installation.
<MENU>
<LI>1. The motor/generator which employs clutches to provide for
alternate engagement to the compressor or turbine trains.

</MENU>

<H3>Figure 4.1 - Compressed Air Energy Storage</H3>

<P>
In the power generation mode, compressed air is mixed with fuel
and expanded through a modified gas turbine driving the electrical
machine as a generator. In storage mode the electrical machine
is used to drive the compressor which compresses the air into
the underground storage for later use.
<P>
The introduction of natural gas in the generating mode of the
CAES cycle allows increased 'peak' power production, than would
otherwise be available from the recovery of compressed air.
<P>
The CAES system is similar in principle to a 'pumped' hydro scheme.
A pumped hydro scheme is basically conventional hydro where by
the water is passed through a water turbine to produce electricity.
During 'offpeak' times, however, the water can be pumped back
to a high elevation in preparation for the next 'peak' period.
<H3>Siting of CAES Plants</H3>

<P>
Compressed air for CAES plant is stored underground either in
man made excavations or in naturally occurring porous rock media.
Plant siting requires favourable geology for the air storage reservoir
as well as suitable location near transmission lines and fuel
supplies.
<P>
Geological/Geotechnical criteria in the selection of potential
sites for underground storage are grouped into three categories.
<UL>
<LI>Underground rock caverns created by excavating comparatively
hard and impervious rock formations.
<LI>Salt caverns created by solution or dry mining of salt formations.
<MENU>
<LI>There are no potential locations in NSW where large salt caverns
could be created.
</MENU>

<LI>Porous media reservoirs made by water bearing aquifers or
depleted gas or oil fields e.g., sandstone, fissured limestone.
</UL>

<P>
In a gas turbine 50-60% of the energy produced by the power turbine
is consumed by the compressor. If compression is carried out at
a different time to when power generation is needed, ie, by CAES,
the peak power which the gas turbine can generate is increased
by this amount, and hence additional plant is not required to
be installed.
<P>
Rock caverns may be operated either with 'hydraulic compensation'
(an interconnected surface reservoir) which provides constant
pressure as the water level and hence volume of the cavern varies
as air is released or stored, or, dry where the pressure varies
because the cavern maintains the same volume. Water curtains surrounding
the caverns may be used to control air leakage. The principal
geotechnical criteria for rock caverns are rock mass, strength
and stability, depth, and structure such that they will contain
air with minimal losses.
<P>
Principal requirements for an aquifer to be a candidate for CAES
include:
<UL>
<LI>Structure which entraps the air. Strata is porous enough to
contain sufficient air at the desired pressure and permeable enough
to allow the flow of air which is required by the facility.
<LI>Overlain by an impermeable rock strata which will prevent
vertical movement of the fluid from the storage zone.
<LI>Mineralogy which will not result in oxidation reactions and
reaction products which would consume the oxygen contained in
the stored air.
<LI>Be located at sufficient depths to allow safe operation at
required pressures.
</UL>

<P>
Future developments of CAES include the addition of recuperators
to extract heat from the compressed air during the charging cycle
and to heat the air on discharge. This will substantially improve
efficiency of the CAES system but still requires advances in materials
of construction for recuperators.
<P>
The Huntorf plant in West Germany rated at 290 MW(e) operated
from 1978 and over 10 years showed 90% availability and 99% starting
reliability. In Alabama USA a 110 MW(e) plant is scheduled for
operation in 1991 and a 1050 MW(e) plant is being proposed for
the Donbass region in the USSR.
<P>
Italy has operated a small 25 MW(e) CAES research facility based
on aquifer storage. It is also understood that Israel is interested
in building a 3 x 100 MW(e) CAES facility using fractured hard
rock aquifers.
<H4>4.2 Batteries</H4>

<P>
Demand for electricity varies according to time of day, leading
to corresponding peaks and troughs in the amount of electricity
being generated. Load levelling by matching customer needs to
system capability can be achieved by a variety of means. Through
'demand-side' planning and management, load patterns can be controlled
by influencing the electricity demands of customers. Although
this planning is very effective, removing the peaks and troughs
totally from energy demand is not feasible. For this reason energy
storage facilities find application in the storing of 'offpeak'
energy during periods of low demand (for example overnight) for
use during 'peak' periods (morning and evenings) as the customer
requires. One energy storage technology receiving a great deal
of attention worldwide is that of the so-called 'giant' battery.
<P>
As well as providing an excellent source of energy storage, batteries
can also provide a number of other significant benefits to the
electricity industry. They have been found useful for assisting
in maintaining the stability of electricity transmission networks,
particularly during fault conditions, whilst also providing instantaneous
replacement power, should a power generating unit trip off line
for any reason.
<P>
Batteries are generally named after the chemical components which
in combination produce the electrical energy. Typical battery
systems being investigated worldwide are included in the Table
below:
<P>
Figure 4.2 - Typical Battery Systems.
<P>
The conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy is a
well established science and in some cases has been performed
with energy conversion efficiencies quoted at greater than 90%.
Whilst not all battery systems can claim such high energy conversion
efficiency, it is not unusual for efficiencies to exceed 70%.
Power conversion to convert DC to AC would typically be around
95% for large convertors.
<P>
In 1988, in the United States, Southern California Edison installed
a 10 MW(e), 4 hour capacity lead/acid battery. Known as the Chino
plant it was constructed for demonstration purposes and to investigate
operational and maintenance characteristics. As a grid connected
power station this battery has been quoted as being the largest
in the world, although it actually consists of more than 8200
individual battery units.
<P>
With continued investigations and development of battery construction,
materials and electrolytes, batteries may play an increasing role
in the supply of electricity and electricity supply management.
<H2>CHAPTER FIVE</H2>

<H3>TRANSMISSION TECHNOLOGIES</H3>

<H4>5.1 Superconductivity</H4>

<P>
The prospect of obtaining &quot;zero loss&quot; electrical conductors
has produced a great deal of interest since superconductivity
was discovered by Onnes in 1911 and for which in 1913, he received
the Nobel prize for physics.
<P>
The transmission of electricity to load centres ultimately leads
to energy losses and hence reduces the overall efficiency of electricity
supplied to consumers. Superconductivity refers to the transmission
of electricity with no losses.
<P>
Until recently superconductivity was only possible at temperatures
approaching absolute zero (-273 degrees Celsius) and in the case
of metallic elements the highest temperature achievable has been
for niobium at -266 degrees Celsius. Recent discoveries using
complex chemical compounds has increased this temperature to -148
degrees Celsius and has led to new speculations about the potential
impact on the operation of the electricity supply industry.
<P>
It is useful to note some limitations of superconducting materials.
<MENU>
<LI>(i) They have some losses for alternating current applications.
<LI>(ii) They maintain their superconductivity only while operated
below certain temperature limits, current density and magnetic
field.
<LI>(iii) The cost of cooling is considerable.
<LI>(iv) The new, high temperature superconductors are made from
ceramic materials, not easily formed into wires.
</MENU>

<P>
Helium-cooled (&quot;low temperature&quot;) superconducting materials
have been widely used, particularly in large magnets. Of more
direct relevance to the electricity supply industry are demonstration
models of high voltage cables, generators and magnetic energy
storage devices which have been developed, but of which none are
in regular service.
<P>
With lower refrigeration requirements, the new liquid nitrogen
cooled high temperature superconductors may find a number of applications,
but much development work is still required.
<H4>5.2 High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC)</H4>

<P>
Some very early power supply systems used direct current (DC).
Now, throughout the world, electricity supply is almost always
done with alternating current (AC) systems. This is because AC
allows simple transformers to be used to change the supply voltage
from the very high levels required for bulk transmission, to the
lower levels required for distribution systems and the even lower
levels at which power is supplied to consumers.
<P>
In the past few decades, High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) connections
have been built in some countries between AC supply systems. HVDC
systems can be used to transmit large amounts of power over long
distances more economically than AC transmission. However, the
relatively high cost of AC to DC converter equipment has meant
that it has not yet been applied in Australia.
<P>
One consideration with very large AC systems (such as that which
connects New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia) is that
all the generators connected must rotate at exactly the same rate
for the whole system to &quot;remain in synchronism&quot;. The
connection of separate systems via a HVDC link avoids this necessity
and the power that it transmits can be rapidly regulated to enhance
the stability of the connected systems.
<P>
A HVDC link is being considered for a possible interconnection
between the New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian systems
and the Queensland system. Options being considered include the
conversion of existing 330 kV AC transmission lines to HVDC lines.
<H2>CHAPTER SIX</H2>

<H3>TECHNOLOGY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL</H3>

<P>
Pacific Power is highly committed to the development and implementation
of technologies which improve the environmental acceptability
of power stations. To date Pacific Power's concern for the environment
has seen significant firsts in emission control and in the reduction
to the point of 'zero discharges' of waste water from power station
sites.
<P>
Combustion of fossil fuels inevitably generates carbon dioxide
which is a highly significant greenhouse gas and there are no
reasonable procedures or technologies for retaining carbon dioxide
within the power station. There are, however, new power station
technologies which help to provide an improvement through higher
efficiency and hence smaller output of carbon dioxide per unit
of energy generated.
<P>
In addition to this, fuel selection can influence the amount of
carbon dioxide produced. Carbon dioxide emissions decrease with
decreasing carbon to hydrogen ratio in the fuel; accordingly from
coal to oil to gas and ultimately hydrogen. Consequently, moisture
in the combustion gases is increased for higher hydrogen content
fuels. Naturally this is one factor which favours the use of natural
gas as a replacement fuel for coal and oil and the development
of hydrogen as a fuel for transport.
<P>
Another serious but technically manageable factor is the emission
of pollutants into the atmosphere. Each year consumption of fossil
fuels worldwide releases an estimated 80 million tonnes of nitrogen
oxides, 140 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide, 300 million tonnes
of dust and similarly large amounts of hydrocarbons.
<P>
With the burden on the environment, industrialised countries are
implementing counter measures and it is the introduction of new
technologies, improved efficiencies and government policies that
the problem is now being addressed.
<H4>6.1 Flue Gas Desulphurisation</H4>

<P>
Acid rain is the subject of considerable concern throughout the
world, particularly in Europe where it is now regarded as fact
that pollutants play a major part in the current damage to lakes
and forests. In New South Wales, however, the low sulphur content
of locally mined coal, which the Commission uses, significantly
reduces missions of sulphur dioxide in flue gases. Pacific Power
has participated in a study under the National, Energy, Research,
Development and Demonstration programme to analyse the acidity
of precipitation in the Hunter region. The study concluded that
precipitation acidity was equivalent to or slightly greater than
background.
<P>
Pacific Power maintains a watching brief on technologies for sulphur
control as well as the associated capital and operating costs
of such facilities. The most common flue gas desulphurisation
technology available (scrubbing devices) can add up to 40% to
the investment value of a conventional coal fired power station.
A brief description of the more relevant technologies follows.
<MENU>
<LI>6.1.1 Wet Scrubbing
<LI>Perhaps the most widely used technology for the desulphurisation
of flue gases is 'Wet Scrubbing'. The technology employs an alkaline
sorbent slurry which is predominantly lime or limestone based.
A 'scrubbing vessel' or scrubber is located downstream of the
boiler in which intimate contact between gas and sorbent is carried
out, a process which readily removes over 90% of sulphur dioxide
from the flue gases. The resulting solid is predominantly calcium
sulphite which can be further oxidised to be sold as a by-product
to the building industry where it finds application as plaster
board. Wet scrubbing technology is currently in place in over
300 coal-fired installations worldwide with at least another 100
units planned to be constructed in the foreseeable future.
</MENU>

<H3>Figure 6.1 - Flue Gas Desulphurisation Wet Scrubbing</H3>

<P>
The capital cost of new ($250/kW) or retrofitted ($400/kW) equipment
is considerable and is a function of the sulphur content of the
fuel source, chlorine levels (which may require an additional
pre-scrubber) and often land space available. Design considerations
which lead to such high costs include:
<P>
. size of equipment (e.g. 'scrubber') in order to handle voluminous
<P>
quantities of flue gas;
<P>
. material selection to handle the wet and corrosive nature of
<P>
material;
<P>
. incorporation of equipment into the boiler flue gas path;
<P>
. ancillary equipment which must also be of high quality to handle
<P>
corrosive sorbent and by-product;
<P>
Operating cost components include:
<UL>
<LI>purchase of sorbent materials
<LI>maintenance
<LI>disposal of wastes
<LI>additional cost of fuel to account for reduced overall plant
efficiency by 3.8% of total electrical output
</UL>

<P>
Modern 'wet scrubbers' use sorbents efficiently which they purchase
for reasonably low prices. The by-product produced is potentially
saleable although it is expected that in European countries the
construction/building industry may become flooded with gypsum
reducing its saleable value. Finally, recent developments in this
technology for example, regenerative flue gas reheating and natural
draft cooling towers are looking at increasing overall efficiency
to minimise operating costs.
<MENU>
<LI>6.1.2 Spray Dry Scrubbing
<LI>This technology as with 'wet scrubbing' employs a sorbent
slurry or solution, however, the by-product produced is 'dry'.
The slurry of sorbent, again alkaline based, is sprayed into the
scrubbing vessel in very fine droplets and dries as it contacts
the flue gas. At this point the sorbent reacts with the sulphur
dioxide.
<LI>The dry sorbent is picked up by the gas stream and carried
into the dust collection plant (e.g. fabric filters) for removal.
<LI>Spray dry scrubbing has been installed in over 80 power station
installations worldwide making it the second most popular flue
gas desulphurisation technology available. Currently capital costs
are only slightly less than for wet scrubbing systems, whilst
removal efficiencies of up to 90% have been quoted.
<LI>Operating costs are noticeably higher than for 'wet scrubbers'
because of the reduced contact between sorbent and gas. Lime rather
than limestone is the preferred sorbent although more costly.
Because of the cost structure of this technology it is more suited
when burning low to medium sulphur coals. Another disadvantage
with 'spray dry scrubbing' is that there is no commercial use
for the by-product produced, since it is mixed with the dust originating
in the coal and collected in the dust collecting plant. Of course
this may also prevent the sale of fly ash to existing markets
such as for concrete.
<LI>6.1.3 Sorbent Injection
<LI>The technology of calcium sorbent injection is a more recently
developed technology and is the lowest in terms of capital outlay
of all the available sulphur dioxide removal technologies.
<LI>The sorbent can be added dry into one of three locations;
</MENU>

<UL>
<LI>with the fuel, thus into the furnace (gas temperature 850-1250
degrees Celsius)
<LI>into the economiser region (gas temperature 950-550 degrees
Celsius)
<LI>after the air heaters (gas temperature close to saturation).
<MENU>
<LI>However, because of relatively poor contact between the sorbent
and sulphur dioxide, efficiency is generally in the range 30-60%
and hence, sorbent use is much higher. The residual sorbent and
ash mixture is not a commercial product as with 'wet scrubbing'.
<LI>The technology has found a niche market for small boilers
with less stringent environmental controls than are imposed on
large utilities, or where the ash content of the coal is sufficiently
alkaline in itself to assist in the sulphur dioxide removal process.
<LI>Considerable research of the technology is underway with efficiencies
expected to reach as high as 80% should techniques like humidification
of the flue gas or other additives into the gas stream prove successful.
<LI>Due to Pacific Power's commitment to the use of fabric filter
technology for particulate control on coal-fired power stations,
direct sorbent injection was identified as being an attractive
alternative to more complex wet flue gas desulphurisation systems.
A study is currently deing conducted by Pacific Power to investigate
the feasibility of the large scale use of direct sorbent injection
upstream of fabric filter plant for sulphur dioxide reduction.
<LI>A pilot has been constructed which utilises flue gas diverted
from an operating 660 MW(e) power station boiler into a 160 bag
fabric filter pilot test plant. The plant consists of a sorbent
storage silo, volumetric feeder, pneumatic conveying and injection
equipment along with oxygen and sulphur dioxide monitoring equipment
upstream of the sorbent injector, immediately prior to the bags
and downstream of the filter bags.
<LI>Preliminary testing has been conducted using industrial grade
Calcium Hydroxide as the sorbent material, no flue gas humidification
and 'as-found' inlet sulphur dioxide concentrations. The results
have demonstrated removal efficiencies in excess of 60% at high
dosing rates are possible.
<LI>Although the previously discussed sulphur removal technologies
are proven, new technologies such as pressurised fluidised bed
combustors as well as integrated gasification and combined cycle
plants (as discussed earlier in sections 2.1.4 and 2.3.2 respectively)
provide similarly clean exhaust gases by reducing sulphur dioxide
formation prior to or during the combustion process.
</MENU>

</UL>

<H4>6.2 Control Of Gaseous Oxides Of Nitrogen</H4>

<P>
In coal and oil-fired power stations with conventional combustion
systems, the measures to reduce emissions must be taken largely
by cleaning the flue gas. Environmental measures for removing
pollutants from the flue gas can be very expensive and depending
on the quality of the coal and location of the plant can increase
overall investment by up to 40%. The principal measures carried
out to control nitrogen oxides in the combustion chamber of a
power station involves strict control of air and fuel supply to
the burners. Up to a 50% reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions
can be achieved in this way and at relatively low cost.
<P>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
There are as many as five stable gaseous oxides of nitrogen but
of these the only ones present in the atmosphere in significant
amounts are nitrous oxide, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide.
These three gases are potential atmospheric pollutants.
<P>
Nitric oxide is a colourless gas. Its ambient concentration is
usually much less than that which leads to biological toxicity
in terms of human health. Nitric oxide is, however, a precursor
to an active gaseous compound in the formation of photochemical
smog, nitrogen dioxide. Nitrogen dioxide is a reddish-brown gas
and in sufficient concentration visible to the eye. The toxicological
and epidemiological effects of nitrogen dioxide are not fully
understood and unless present in extremely high concentrations
does not affect human health. Environmental emission standards
for this gas are often based on visibility effects.
<P>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
Where environmental limits cannot be achieved using this method,
DENOX units are required as secondary measures. The only process
applied so far on a large scale, has been selective catalytic
reduction (SCR) using ammonia or ammonia compounds in the presence
of a catalyst. A schematic of this process is shown in Figure
6.2.
<P>
Figure 6.2 - Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for Reduction
of
<P>
Oxides of Nitrogen Emissions
<P>
The ammonia is injected at about 450 degrees celsius in the presence
of a vanadium pentoxide catalyst (titanium dioxide catalysts have
also been used successfully). Reduction of nitrogen oxides in
the flue gas of more than 80% is possible and in conjunction with
burner management systems can be increased to over 90% removal.
The cost of employing this technology can be up to 10 times greater
than burner control and efficiency management systems however
removal efficiency is much higher.
<P>
The amount of nitrogen oxides produced from the combustion of
two different fuel types can vary significantly if the nitrogen
content of the raw fuel is different. As shown in Figure 6.3,
fuel oil which contains nitrogen chemically bound into its molecular
structure gives rise to higher levels of nitrogen oxides emissions
than does natural gas which contains none.
<H3>Figure 6.3 - Gas Turbines - Oxides of Nitrogen Emissions</H3>

<P>
SCR has been applied in Japan and throughout Europe and is fast
gaining acceptance in industrialised countries worldwide. In Germany
alone, over 25 000 MW of coal-fired power stations are expected
to be using this technology by the early 1990's.
<H4>6.3 Fabric Filter Gas Cleaning</H4>

<P>
The flue gas discharged from a power plant boiler carries fly
ash (residue from the coal burned in the boiler). The amount of
this residue (in the form of solid particles which can be discharged
in to the atmosphere) with the flue gas is limited by the Regulations
of The Clean Air Act.
<P>
The Clean Air Act makes it necessary to provide plant between
the boiler and the stack to remove the fly ash from the flue gas
so that the total mass of solid particles actually passing into
the atmosphere is not greater than the amount permitted by the
Act.
<P>
Flue gas cleaning plant may consist of either fabric filters or
precipitators. The plant extends from the boiler discharge flanges
(located after the air heaters), to the inlet flange on the stack.
The fabric filter or bag house operates in a similar manner to
a domestic vaccuum cleaner.
<P>
There are three basic types of fabric filters designated by the
cleaning mode adopted. They are:
<MENU>
<LI>(i) Mechanical Shaker
<LI>(ii) Reverse Gas
<LI>(iii) Pulse Jet
</MENU>

<P>
For all of these types, the fabric is installed in the form of
tube like bags.
<H5>6.3.1 Mechanical Shaker Fabric Filters</H5>

<P>
Mechanical Shaker cleaned units operate on the principle of the
bags being suspended from a shaker frame with the open end of
the bags facing down. These are attached to a cell plate which
separates the 'dirty' gas side from the 'clean' gas side of the
fabric filter compartment.
<P>
As dirty gas is filtered in the bags, the differential pressure
across the plant will gradually rise, requiring the bags to be
cleaned. This is accomplished by sequentially isolating the individual
cells and energising the associated shaker mechanisms, shaking
the bags and causing the ash to fall into the hoppers. The ash
is continually discharged from the hoppers into the disposal system.
<P>
The gas enters from below the cell plate, (through thimbles protruding
through the cell plate) passes up through the centre of the bags
and deposits fly ash on the inside of the bags. The clean gas
passes through the bags and discharges through outlet dampers
at the top of the cell. The filtered flue gas enters an outlet
manifold that joins other similar ducts and is discharged through
induced draft fans to the stack.
<P>
Fabrics used in shaker plants are normally woven from synthetic
polymer fibres such as acrylics, polyesters, etc. Pacific Power
plant of this design characteristically have between 47 360 and
52 480 bags per (660 MW) unit divided into 40 individual cells.
<P>
The bags are 5.5 m long and 165 mm diameter and handle between
890 and 1090 m cubed metres per second of flue gas. Inlet burdens
average 25 g per cubed metre while outlet emissions range from
20 to 30 mg per cubed metre.
<P>
This type of plant is often described as a low-ratio filter as
it has a relatively large fabric area compared to the amount of
gas being cleaned.
<H5>6.3.2 Reverse Gas Fabric Filters</H5>

<P>
Reverse Gas cleaned fabric filters are very similar to mechanical
shaker plant. The cleaning method differs when a cell is taken
off line for cleaning. Instead of activating a mechanical shaker
mechanism, 'clean' gas from the discharge side of the filter is
drawn into the clean side of the cell undergoing cleaning. This
gas passes from the 'clean' to the 'dirty' side of the bags, dislodging
the collected fly ash in a 'back washing' operation. This type
of filter is also known as a low-ratio filter and is usually designed
along similar sizing parameters to shaker plant. The cleaning
operation is much more gentle relative to shaker plant. The fabric
traditionally used in reverse gas units is woven fibreglass.
<P>
Reverse gas plants are widely used in American power stations
as the fibreglass bags are suitable for gas at a higher temperature
than generally expected in New South Wales power stations. This
is due to the high sulphur coal in the USA and the necessity to
reduce corrosion caused by the formation of acid if condensation
occurs.
<H5>6.3.3 Pulse Jet Cleaned Plant</H5>

<P>
Pulse jet plants have a cell plate located above the bags and
the gas passes through the bags from outside to inside. The fly
ash is deposited on the outside of the bag.
<P>
Cleaning of the bags is carried out by passing a short burst of
compressed air down the centre of the bags which causes them to
flex, dislodging the fly ash from the outside of the bag.
<P>
As this plant cleans bags on-line it is not necessary to provide
equipment for cell isolation to clean the bags.
<P>
Pacific Power plant of the pulse jet design are characteristically
equipped with between 9120 and 14664 bags, varying in length from
6 m to 8 m, and a nominal diameter of 130 mm. Gas volumes range
from 480 cubed metres per second to 550 cubed metres per second
with similar inlet burdens and emission figures to low-ratio plants.
<P>
Because of the much smaller amount of fabric area required to
clean a given amount of gas, these plants are known as high-ratio
and are significantly cheaper to build and to run.
<P>
All power stations which have been commissioned in NSW since 1981
have fabric filters installed for particulate emission control.
Retrofitting of fabric filters to a number of older boilers in
our system is currently taking place. In all of the fabric filters
currently used by Pacific Power, the concept of Best Available
Control Technology has been vital. All of the installations to
date and those in progress have been very effective in the elimination
of visible emissions from power station chimneys. This is a significant
factor in the public acceptance of power stations as part of this
local community.

<P>
Pacific Power Corporate provides one of the state's most vital public services.
<P>
There would be few people who don't turn to electricity at least
sometime during a normal day.
<P>
With a safe and reliable electricity supply now a common expectation,
few people take the time to consider just what it is we rely on
when we turn a power switch. This is the right place to visit for 
an overview of Pacific Power, explaining <A HREF="/pacpow/docs/ppinfo.html"> 
what electricity is, and how it is brought to the home and the workplace.</A>

<H3>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE<BR>
DAILY PRESS BRIEFING</H3>
<H2>DPB #204</H2>
<P><H4>FRIDAY, DECEMBER 20, 1996, 1:00 P. M.</H4>
<H4>(ON THE RECORD UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED)</H4>
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Good afternoon.  Welcome to the State Department briefing.  I
have a press statement today, which is another in our series - I know
you're all very interested in this - &quot;On This Day in Diplomacy."  This is
very interesting.  I really commend it to you.
<P>This week, the City of Naples, commemorated the 200th Anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the
Bourbon Kingdom of the two Sicilys, of which Naples was capital.  In the
early days of the American Republic, this was a major diplomatic priority
for the United States to have diplomatic relations with Naples because of
the maritime traffic and because of the importance of that to the United
States.
<P>So this very well-written public statement gives you everything you always
wanted to know about this issue; and the major point here is that it tells
you a lot about the importance of diplomacy in our national security, which
we in the State Department never tire of telling you about.  So I just
wanted to, before the holidays, offer this little present to you.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Might we ask who wrote it?  (Laughter)
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Yes.  It wasn't me. (Laughter.)  It was written by our Chief
Historian, Bill Slany, in the Office of the Historian in the Bureau of
Public Affairs.  These are people who don't get a lot of press attention
but who do great work.  And I wanted to call attention to this as part of
our never-ending effort to make all of you realize that diplomatic
readiness and diplomacy are really important.  How's that?
<P><STRONG>A</STRONG> Very good.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Good.  Thank you, thank you.
<P>George.  I'd be glad to go to the lesser important issues of the day.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Well, could you give us an update on the situation in Peru, or
do we have to go to Bill Slany for that?  (Laughter)
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: If you wanted to talk about perhaps the beginning of our
relationship with Peru, you'd go to Bill Slany.  I can tell you about our
situation today.
<P>There really is nothing new to add -- at least from an American point of
view -- to what we've said over the last couple of days.  We continue to be
very, very concerned by the situation of the hostages, many hundreds of
them, being held in the Japanese compound in Lima.  We continue here at the
State Department to monitor this through a Task Force up on the Seventh
Floor and through the really brilliant efforts of our American Ambassador,
Dennis Jett, in Lima.
<P>President Clinton and Secretary Christopher both spoke to this issue
yesterday.  We remain in very close contact with the Peruvian Government
and with the Japanese Government and a variety of others.  Our position is
that these terrorists ought to release these innocent people swiftly and
unharmed.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: The team of advisors that went down yesterday.  Is it correct
that they are there to advise Ambassador Jett on security for Americans and
not to consult with the Peruvian Government?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Their primary responsibility is to be available to Ambassador
Jett to advise him on the security situation.  Obviously, in a situation
like this, you want to prepare to be able to handle any contingency that
would affect American citizens; and we have l0, 000 of them in Peru.  So
that's the reason they were sent down, and that's why they're there; and
they're carrying out their duties.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: If the Peruvian Government would ask, would they be available
for rendering whatever advice and assistance&amp;#133;.?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I don't believe the Peruvian Government has asked.  I think
there's been some contact with the Peruvian Government on this issue, but I
don't believe they've asked. As you know, the Peruvian Government is
handling this issue on its own, as it should.  It's bearing its responsibilities.
It's also spent a lot of time talking to the Japanese Government, which is
appropriate, given the fact that this incident is taking place on Japanese
territory.
<P>Betsy.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: There is a report - I realize it may not be coming from this
building -- that Delta Force troops or others, sort of covert troops, have
gone down either within this contingent of security people or separately to
Peru to be available in case they are needed.  Can you verify that or speak
to that?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I am not going to discuss any troop deployments.  That's not
the job of the State Department.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Did the U.S. Government pass on any warnings or hints that such
a spectacular terrorist event might take place?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I don't know.  I don't know the answer to that question.  You
know we have an active watch around the world on terrorist groups and their
activities.  I just can't say whether or not we exchanged information with
the Peruvian Government in advance of this hostage-taking about this
particular group.
<P>In general, I should say, this is really not the time - at least for those
of us standing up talking, representing the U.S. Government -- to try to
play the Monday morning quarterbacking role.  We're giving our full support
to the Peruvian Government here to resolve this situation expeditiously so
that all these innocent people can be released.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Nick, there are wire reports that Ecuador has offered asylum to
the terrorists.  If that did occur, can you just give us some indication as
to what the United States' reaction might be?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: First of all, I cannot confirm those reports.  I've seen the
same one, but I can't confirm it.  You'll have to direct that question to
the Ecuadorian Government.
<P>Secondly, I think all of us around the world who have an interest here, who
have citizens in that capital in that country - obviously, we all desire to
play a role.  We all want to be helpful.  We've got to allow the Peruvian
Government some room for maneuver here.  We've got to allow the Peruvian
Government to have the capability to resolve this crisis, and we're not
going to be giving any free advice - certainly, not publicly - to the
Peruvian Government.  We don't want to make their life more difficult.
They've got a terrible crisis on their hands.
<P>David?
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: In order to better understand the relationship between the
Japanese and Peruvian Governments on this, what is your understanding of
what the rules of the game are in this situation?  Is it Japanese territory,
this Ambassador's residence?  And, if so, does that mean that it would be a
Japanese decision as to whether there were any use of force by the Peruvian
Government or not?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I understand the Japanese do consider it to be Japanese
territory, much as the United States considers our Embassies and Consulates
overseas to be American territory.
<P>David, I can't define whatever agreement that the Japanese and Peruvian
Governments have worked out about jurisdiction, about a clearance, about
who's responsible for the contacts with the terrorists.  That's up to them,
and I don't want to prejudge that for them.  I don't know what kind of
conversations they've had.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Is there a general kind of diplomatic practice in this kind of
situation?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I can only speak from an American point of view.  I think
various countries have various interpretations of this general principle.
The United States has a very clear one about our own facilities overseas,
and that is that the United States Embassy in Lima, for instance - the
United States Embassy - is American territory.  But I really don't want to
get into this in trying to interpret what the Japanese and Peruvians may or
may not have agreed upon.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: But Japan could offer them diplomatic immunity and get them out
of there under the guise of Japanese diplomatic immunity, totally bypassing
the Peruvians.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Offer who?
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: The terrorists.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Oh, I don't know about that.  I wouldn't know, and I wouldn't
ascribe that motive to the Japanese Government.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Do you plan any meetings in Washington with (inaudible)
countries in this issue?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: We've had a couple of meetings with some of the embassies here
in Washington of the countries that have been affected -- we started that
two days ago, and we've continued it - just to make sure that we keep in
contact with countries around the world to make sure we all have the same
information and we can share perspectives on this.  We have a very, very
active interest in this, as you can imagine.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Are you saying that you've had meetings with diplomats from all
of the countries who have captives?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: No, I didn't say all the countries.  I think some of the
countries.  I don't believe we've had meetings here in the State Department
with all of them.
<P>Ambassador Jett, of course, has been very active in Lima, talking to all of
the embassies about this issue.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Can you tell us how many countries, approximately, you have
contacted with this issue?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I think we've contacted in Lima a great majority of the
countries that have been affected.  We've been in contact, as you would
imagine, and we've had some contact back here.  I don't have an exact
figure for you, however.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Does that include Cuba?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I don't know.  I don't know if we've had conversations with
Cubans or not.  It's certainly possible.  I just don't know if we
have.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Are you discouraging countries from offering asylum to the
terrorists?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: The position of the United States, when we are affected - when
there's a terrorist incident, for instance, on our soil, where we're the
primary point of contact with a terrorist group -- is that we don't offer
concessions, and our advice to foreign governments is to follow that
practice.  That's our very strong view.
<P>On the question of Ecuador, I think it just stands to reason that we ought
to let the Peruvian Government make these decisions about how it deals with
these terrorists, these killers, this nihilistic organization that has
taken these people hostage, and we ought not to try to second-guess the
government or make the life of the Peruvian Government more complicated.  I
think, as the President said yesterday, probably the less said the better
about issues like this.  We ought to refrain from the temptation, perhaps,
to offer a lot of public advice.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Could I ask on another subject?  Is Dennis Ross taking anything
substantive in the way of a negotiating instrument when he goes to
Israel?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I spoke with Dennis just a couple of minutes ago, and I also
spoke to Secretary Christopher about his trip.  The President and Secretary
Christopher have asked Dennis to undertake this trip because they're very
concerned about the drift in the Middle East peace negotiations, and
specifically we're particularly concerned that the negotiating momentum on
Hebron itself has pretty much come to a halt.  We hope that Dennis' trip
will create a new dynamic, rejuvenate, if you will, the Hebron negotiations
for the redeployment of the Israeli Defense Forces from the City of
Hebron.
<P>Dennis is the primary intermediary between the two - the Palestinians and
the Israelis.  He certainly has some ideas of his own - American ideas -
that he will be offering on this trip.  But it's a very quick trip.  He'll
be back by the twenty-fourth, by next Tuesday.  I think that perhaps the
best we can hope for here is that he's able to convince Chairman Arafat and
Prime Minister Netanyahu that they've got to re-engage seriously on Hebron.
I think that's a very, very important goal.  It may take some more time,
however, for any final agreement to be reached.
<P>I want to take the opportunity to clarify some misinterpretations of the
American position that were quite evident in a couple of the major American
newspapers this morning.  First, I think Secretary Christopher spoke very
clearly yesterday about our perception of where the Hebron negotiations are
and about the fact that there have been some Israeli moves in the past
couple of days that we believe now ought to be reciprocated.
<P>It is not right to conclude from that statement, however, that somehow the
United States, and specifically the State Department, have watered down the
very clear - very clear - statements made by the President on settlements a
couple of days ago.  There was an interesting juxtaposition in some of the
newspapers this morning, saying because the United States had made these
statements on Hebron, it's trying to walk away now from the statements
we've made on settlements.  It's absolutely untrue.
<P>The President of the United States spoke for this government very clearly
on Monday about our position on settlements, and, frankly, about the
problem we have with some of the decisions that have been made on subsidies,
because they effectively pre-empt the negotiations, and they make it very
difficult to achieve progress on that issue in the negotiations.  These are
separate issues.  They haven't been combined by us. I wanted to be
absolutely clear about that.
<P>One of the papers, the <STRONG>Washington Times</STRONG> -- even ran the lead story in the
paper -- essentially tried to link these two issues and infer that somehow
the United States is backing down on this very important issue of
settlements, and that's not the case.  The President spoke for all of us,
and we are all firmly behind the President, as you imagine.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Nick, though, leaving aside the linkage, which you're not going
to deal with; the issue of settlements - the President was asked if
settlements are an obstacle, and he said absolutely, absolutely.  When you
were asked that question Tuesday - when you were invited to use the word
&quot;obstacle," you declined, and I think that that has contributed to the
problem.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I did not decline.  As I remember - I mean, I'll take it out
of the transcript, if you like, and read it to you.  It's hard for someone
like me to improve upon the words of the President of the United States.
He's the boss. He enunciates American foreign policy.  He was clear as a
bell on Monday, and everything that we've said since then stands behind him,
as you would expect.  I just wanted to make that perfectly clear today.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Help us to understand.  Is it fair to say that the U.S.
Government now calling settlements - the existence of settlements or the
Israeli subsidy to settlers -- an obstacle to peace is a ratcheting up of
the language, is it not?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I think that the real importance of what the United States has
been saying for a week now - it began late last week in this room, and it
continued, much more importantly, at the White House on Monday, and
Secretary Christopher continued it yesterday - we're concerned by actions
or statements that make progress in the negotiations more difficult.  I
wanted to make that clear.  It couldn't be more clear in our minds, and we
were very disappointed to see this juxtaposition, because it does not exist
- the juxtaposition to which I referred in the newspapers this morning.
<P>Yes, David.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: There's been a certain amount of editorial comment in the
newspapers today I wonder if you'd like to react to.  Do you disagree, by
any chance, with - I'm sure you read them - a couple of editorials that
suggested that the Administration should now get much tougher with Israel
on the subjects of settlements; that the policy of nudging Israel along
isn't working?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: First of all, America's policy is working.  Secondly, our
position on the settlements could not be more clear, and the President
spoke to that on Monday.  Third, I find it very curious that editorial
writers seem to want to ditch a policy that has in four years produced more
success than at any time in the last 48 years.  I find that very curious,
indeed.  All you've got to do is remember where this situation was four
years ago today, before President Clinton took office in the last months of
the Bush Administration.
<P>The Israelis and Palestinians weren't talking.  There was a military
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  We didn't have the September
'93 or September '95 agreements.  There was no peace treaty with Jordan and
Israel.  None of this had occurred.
<P>Why in the world would we want to ditch that policy that has worked - a
very patient, clear-sighted American diplomacy.  So, obviously, we don't
agree with that kind of editorial comment which, respectfully, we would say
doesn't seem to be informed by the history of the last four years.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: The editorials, as I read them, weren't necessarily critiquing
the last four years' policy.  They were saying that it is now time --
without regard to whether the policy has been right or wrong for the last
four years, it is now time to be much tougher on the issue of settlements,
vis-&amp;agrave;-vis Israel; to call a spade a spade and tell them they cannot
have it both ways.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: All I can say -
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: And I wonder what your comment is on that suggestion.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: My comment on that suggestion is look at what the President
and Secretary Christopher have said over the last week.  It's a very clear
enunciation of our policy, and it's the right place for us to be.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: These ideas that Dennis is taking with him, do they go to the
process of the negotiations, or does he have some new negotiating language
that he thinks might break the logjam?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Of course, I don't want to go into the ideas, because he
hasn't arrived, and he'll want to float these privately, not publicly, but
they encompass the breadth of the negotiations in, I think, both of the
aspects that you talked about, Jim.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: New subject.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Still on the Middle East?  Any on the Middle East before we
leave the Middle East?  Yes, Patrick.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Do you know when he's going exactly, today or tomorrow?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Dennis leaves tonight with his small team of assistants, and
he'll be in Jerusalem, I believe, tomorrow - tomorrow evening, and he'll be
coming back on Tuesday.  He'll be meeting with both the Israeli and
Palestinian delegations.  I want to make clear, Dennis' trip is focused
solely on the Israeli- Palestinian talks.  He's not going to be going to
Syria.  He won't be going to Jordan.  He won't be going outside of meetings
with the Israelis and Palestinians.  It's a focused trip.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: The Foreign Minister of Colombia just finished several meetings
with State Department officials.  Can you tell us basically what was
discussed and where the U.S.-Colombian relationship stands?  Several issues
- extradition, human rights abuses, using U.S. weapons, or allegations of
it anyway.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I don't have a specific report on Foreign Minister Mejia's
meetings here, but, if you're interested, we can get that from our Inter-
American Affairs Bureau.  I know she's here.  I know there have been
meetings, and, of course, we've got a well known policy on Colombia, which
I'm sure that our diplomats were enunciating today in the meetings.  But I
don't have any specific report for you.  Let's ask Tom Casey and his
associates to try to get that for you.
<P>Same issue?
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Yes, please.  The Colombian Government recognized a few days
ago that the Cali Cartel leaders are threatening and bribing some
congressmen from the jail.  Do you have any comment about it?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: We've known for a long time that the drug kingpins, specifically
from the Cali Cartel, continue to run their drug empires from jail.  These
are extremely lax prison conditions which allow criminals to run multi-
billion dollar financial empires from a jail cell, and we've repeatedly
told the Government of Colombia about it, and we expect the Government of
Colombia to take appropriate measures - tough measures - to toughen the
conditions for criminals.
<P>The reason you put people behind bars is to make them pay a penalty.
They're not paying much of a penalty if they continue to run their empires,
earn money and set themselves up when they're released from jail.
<P>In a few weeks, the United States will begin again our annual certification
about Colombia and other countries' performance on anti-narcotics measures,
and we're going to have to evaluate the Government of Colombia, and this
will be a factor.  I can't anticipate the outcome of the decisions that the
President and Secretary-designate Madeleine Albright will have to make this
winter.  But I can tell you, this is going to be an issue, and we are
looking for stronger measures by the Government of Colombia.  Nothing
outrages, I'm sure, average Colombians as well as average Americans more to
see someone who puts drugs on the streets that kill kids prosper in jail -
live the high life, be able to run a drug empire from jail.  It's wrong,
and it's also no way to fight the narco-traffickers.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Regarding to the relationship between both countries, it is
getting better?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: The relationship between the two countries?
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: The relationship between both countries, the U.S. and Colombian
Government.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Our relationship is what it is.  We have one issue that tends
to dominate the relationship, and the fortunes of the relationship ebb and
flow, depending on how well we're doing on that issue.  We can certainly
point to some efforts by the Colombian Government, and particularly by
elements of the Colombian Government over the past year to improve the
effectiveness of the Colombians in fighting narcotics trafficking.  But we
are going to have to undergo this evaluation under our own law, and we hope
very much that the end result will be more positive than last years, but I
can't anticipate exactly which decision is going to be made.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Nick, does the U.S. Government still hold that Colombia might
implement extradition?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: We're always interested in bringing convicted drug kingpins,
narco-traffickers, to justice.  When they've committed crimes in the United
States or crimes that affect Americans, it is sometimes appropriate for us
to extradite.  So that's another issue in the relationship.
<P>Yes, ma'am.  Ladies first, Mr. Lambros, and then we'll be glad to go to
you.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: What can you tell us about the reports from Iraq in terms of
them holding allegedly CIA spies that they're going to be airing on Iraqi
television tonight?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: We've seen the reports, and, frankly, if anybody believes
these reports, they ought to have their heads examined.  Saddam Hussein has
made a history, as has other members of his corrupt regime, of lying to
their own population as well as to the rest of us around the world about
what's going on.
<P>This is a well noted and tired propaganda ploy.  We saw this authoritarian
regime, the Soviet Union certainly, practice this kind of thing.  We saw
fascist regimes in Europe practice this kind of thing.  There's always got
to be a scapegoat for the problems of a corrupt authoritarian dictatorship
like Saddam's.  He's not accountable to his own people.  He doesn't admit
that he's destroyed the country's economic base and made it an international
pariah, so he looks on the outside.  What more convenient target than the
Central Intelligence Agency.  This is laughable propaganda, and I'd
strongly advise you not to pay any attention to it.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: (Inaudible) any of the accusations about spying?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: We don't trust Saddam Hussein; and, if Saddam Hussein wants to
parade a bunch of people in front of television cameras and say they're CIA
spies, as journalists I'd look very hard at that.  I'd look very hard to
see if you can confirm any of these accusations against these poor people -
poor Iraqis.  These are not going to be Americans, as far as we can tell
from the press reports.  He's going to parade a bunch of Iraqi citizens.
They probably picked them up off the street and they didn't like their
looks, didn't like their politics - (laughter) - and they shove them in
front of TV cameras, and they throw them in jail to rot.  It's a terrible
thing.  Baghdad's a very cruel place to live these days, and some members
of the regime are even finding that out.  So I would encourage you not to
trust Saddam Hussein, not to give it any credence.  It's propaganda, and
he's doing this just to get attention - to divert the attention of his
suffering people - and they are truly suffering in Iraq - from his corrupt
regime.
<P>Mr. Lambros, you want to talk about - excuse me, did you have a follow-
up?
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Yes, just a quick follow-up.  There was a report that there was
a letter delivered to the State Department, an official letter from the
Government of Iraq.  Can you tell us anything about -
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I don't know anything about it, but I talked to our official
in charge of our Iraq policy.  He didn't mention it to me.  We communicate
with the Government of Iraq in mysterious ways.  We have to send faxes to
New York which can't be read by the people in New York.  They can only be
read by the ringleaders in Baghdad or the criminal gang there, and it's
very hard to know who's writing and whether it's authoritative and frankly
even when it's authoritative, they lie, as they admitted in their
conversations with Ambassador Ekeus.  They said, &quot;We've been lying for five
years about our efforts to build a nuclear weapons capability and a
chemical weapons capability.  So, frankly, even if they sent us a letter,
we don't take them very seriously.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Are there any Kurds that helped the United States in this
lineup that they're suggesting?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I have no idea who's going to appear in this lineup.  We have
no advance information.  We have no diplomats in Baghdad.  We just have a
lot of pity for the people who are going to be lined up, because most
likely they're innocent.
<P>Yes, Mr. Lambros.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: I have a question on Germany.  According to -
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Excuse me, Mr. Lambros.  David would like to stay on Iraq.
Then we'll go to Germany.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: There was a report I heard this morning on the radio - BBC, I
think - saying that Mr. Erbakan, the Prime Minister of Turkey, has
announced that Turkey will not renew the ground-based portion of &quot;Operation
Provide Comfort&quot;; that it is going to be allowed to expire, I believe, in
January.  Is that accurate?  Has the Turkish Government so informed the
U.S. that there's going to be nothing left except the overflying?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: First, we are currently discussing with the Turkish, French
and British Governments &quot;Operation Provide Comfort" - so-called "Operation
Provide Comfort.&quot;  We have not yet come to an agreement with those three
governments about the future operations in northern Iraq that are designed
to contain Saddam Hussein.
<P>But I can tell you this: I think we can confidently predict that as a
result of these negotiations, in a week or two or three, we'll be able to
announce to you that we intend, all of us, to maintain the &quot;no-flight"
zones in the north and south.  We intend to maintain the strategic
containment of Saddam Hussein, first.
<P>Second, as you know, we had to pull out of northern Iraq a couple of months
ago most of our ground-based effort, which provides humanitarian relief -
U.S.-directed humanitarian relief to the populations of northern Iraq, Kurd,
Assyrian and otherwise.  The operations to provide relief will go forward.
The United Nations and other non-governmental organizations are going to be
running relief efforts, and we are currently contributing money to them.
That will continue.
<P>I think our great suspicion about Iraq's motives in particular will also
continue as part of this strategic deterrent effort.  So I think this
report is probably a little bit ahead of the issue, because there have been
no firm decisions made, no written agreement, but I would anticipate that
those elements - the &quot;no-flight" zones and humanitarian relief operations -
would stay in place.
<P>Mr. Lambros, yes.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: I have a question on Germany.  According to dispatches from
Associated Press and Reuters, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in an unusual
move announced yesterday the creation of a federal government committee as
a solution to keeping people affiliated with the U.S.-based Church of
Scientology out of public jobs.  And today, actually, Chancellor Kohl's
political party expelled three members.  Could you please clarify the U.S.
position vis-a-vis to these actions against a religious group?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Thank you, Mr. Lambros.  I understand that - I've just seen a
brief report from our Embassy in Bonn just in the last hour that the German
Government has made a basic decision to form a group to take a look at the
issue of Scientology in Germany.  The report I saw was quite straightforward
but did not have a lot of detail, and it essentially said that Chancellor
Kohl and his Ministers had decided to study the issue in all of its
aspects.
<P>It did not, as far as I saw, announce any Draconian or repressive measures
against the Church of Scientology.  In fact, I think the German Interior
Minister said in a press conference in Bonn two days - on the 16th of
December - that Germany would not try to shut down the Church of Scientology
in Germany, and that's good news, indeed.
<P>As you know, the United States for four years running has had some concerns
about the treatment of Scientologists, including Americans, in Germany.
We've expressed them to the German Government.  We've put it in our Annual
Human Rights Report.  We've spoken about it from this podium, and we
believe that the religious freedom of the Scientologists ought to be
respected.
<P>I think the German Government has said things this week which are positive
and has taken an action today which appears to be constructive.  We need to
study it in greater detail, and that is pretty much what I have to say
about that issue.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: One follow-up.  I'm wondering if your recent established
committee on religious freedom here at the State Department will look into
this case in Germany?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I don't know if the new committee established by Assistant
Secretary Shattuck, which looks at the idea of religious freedom on a
global basis, will be concentrating on Scientology in Germany.  I can ask,
but that committee is intended to represent the well known American support
for religious freedom, of whatever stripe, worldwide.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: One question on this.  According to reliable sources, your
government is ready to announce the long-awaited U.S. initiative for a
solution on the Turkish claims against Greece in the Republic of Cyprus in
the first days of January.  I'm wondering if it would be unilateral or
collective announcement involving the Governments of the U.S., Greece,
Turkey and Cyprus?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Mr. Lambros, I'll have to check.  I'm not aware of any
impending, imminent American announcement on that issue.
<P>George.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: A question on southern Sudan.  I understand the NGOs in
southern Sudan have reason to believe that the warlords may strike again in
the sense of capturing some NGO representatives, and they're concerned
about the precedent which was set about 10, 12 days ago by Congressman
Richardson's negotiations which in effect rewarded the hostage-takers with
rice and jeeps and so forth.  The U.S. has come out with a strong stand
against negotiations concerning the events in Lima, and I just wonder what
you might have to say about the situation in southern Sudan.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: First of all, George, let me just say I don't believe that
Congressman Richardson engaged in any kind of improper activity or any
activity that would be inconsistent with general policies and principles
that we have followed in the United States Government for a long, long
time.
<P>As you remember, he was actually basically an intermediary between the Red
Cross and other organizations and these hostage-takers, and this was an
agreement between the ICRC and Kerubino, and I think it should be seen in
that context.  He was not negotiating on behalf of the United States
Government.  He was not representing positions of the U.S. Government.  He
facilitated the release of hostages, and he did it on behalf of an
international organization - the International Committee of the Red
Cross.
<P>So I think there's a basic difference between that situation in Sudan nine
or ten days ago and the situation today in Peru.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: But it has the U.S. Government endorsement, because the
Ambassador was there almost as a party to what was going on.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Our Ambassador was there, because we wanted to seek the
release of the American and also the other foreigners being held, and we
did so.  I'm just saying I don't equate what happened there with what's
happening now in Peru.  I think they're entirely different situations.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Nick, tomorrow China is expected to appoint the Provisional
Legislature for Hong Kong.  British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind has
already chimed in with some warnings to China.  Does the U.S. Government
have any words of advice for Beijing and how it proceeds?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: We're aware of this very worrisome development.  Let me just
say the United States supports open, accountable and democratic government
in Hong Kong.  It is an essential part of Hong Kong's successful business
and political environment.  The United States has frequently expressed,
both publicly and privately, our view that disbanding the current elected
legislature in Hong Kong is unjustified and unnecessary.
<P>Assistant Secretary Win Lord made this point recently to the Chinese.  He
made this point to leaders in Hong Kong earlier this month. Secretary
Christopher has made this point very clear to the Chinese leadership.
<P>In the Joint Declaration, China made a commitment that Hong Kong's
Legislative Council shall be constituted by elections.  China has said
subsequently that a Provisional Legislature will not operate for more than
one year.  The United States believes a legislature elected on the basis of
open and fair elections should be put into place as soon as possible after
reversion.  This would enable China to fulfill the commitment it made in
the Joint Declaration.
<P>We believe that stability in Hong Kong's governing structures is vital to
insure the continuing growth and success and prosperity of Hong Kong after
1997.  The United States will watch closely what action the Provisional
Legislature takes and how long that legislature lasts.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: (Inaudible)
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I don't have a copy.  Those are my words.  I'm not issuing a
written statement, but I've just said them, and I suppose you've all
recorded them.  I hope you have.  I know the cameras have recorded
them.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Anything new on the situation in Afghanistan?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I'm not aware of any new developments that would have an
impact upon the United States, except to say that we do follow events in
Kabul closely from our Embassy in Islamabad in Pakistan.  We do continue to
hope that outside countries beyond Afghanistan will not try to contribute
to the instability by supplying weapons, and we seek to promote, along with
the United Nations and others, a peaceful and negotiated outcome to the
basic differences that exist among the various militia in Afghanistan.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Could you tell us how New York meetings with North Korea is
going?  How long Mr. Li will stay in New York, and is the U.S. close to
agreement on the submarine issue?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I think that the talks between the United States and North
Korea in New York that began yesterday and are continuing today have been
serious and useful.  They reviewed the major issues.  They include, of
course, Mr. Li Hyong Chol who is visiting New York - the North Korean
official - and they include Mr. Mark Minton, who's our Director of Korean
Affairs here in the Department of State.
<P>We are still awaiting action by the North Koreans on some of the issues
that we've publicly identified, including the provocation of the breach of
South Korea's sovereignty in the submarine incident a couple of months
back.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Do you know the schedule of Mr. Li?  He will stay in New York
next week, or are you going to -
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Mr. Li seems to be enjoying New York. He's been there quite a
while.  I don't anticipate that he'll be coming to Washington.  I think
he'll probably be spending Christmas in New York, and we will probably see
him again.  He is a senior official in the North Korean Government, and
we've been able to have serious and useful talks with Mr. Li.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: What do you think about the Chinese aggressive military and
arms sales in the Middle East, especially Iran, Iraq, Syria?  They are
establishing some corporation to deal in helicopters and missiles
(inaudible).  Do you have any concern on this subject, or are you just
watching that?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Savas, I think we've spoken quite frequently about that issue
here at the State Department Briefing, and I have nothing new to add to
what I've said and what Glyn Davies has said many, many times.  Glyn, of
course, has in a much more articulate than I could have said it, but we've
both spoken about this issue.  (Laughter)
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Nick, two questions back on Peru.  First, of your group of
experts that went down there, have they advised or are they looking to ways
of suggesting for businesses - U.S. businesses working down there to scale
down their presence in Peru?  How is this going to affect the warning that
the U.S. Government and the Department of State puts on Peru?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: As you know, we issued the other night - two nights ago - a
travel advisory for Americans living in Peru and visiting Peru.  This is a
very, very dangerous situation underway in Lima, as you know.  It's an
extraordinary situation, given the number of people who have been taken
hostage and given the record of this terrorist group, which is quite
brutal.
<P>We've advised American citizens to take every precaution, to think twice
about what they do in Peru, and that's primarily the reason we sent this
team down there to help the American Embassy and Ambassador Dennis Jett
prepare for any eventuality that might involve American citizens.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: In light of the new anti-terrorist law here in the U.S., how
would this affect alleged members of MRTA or Shining Path living in the
U.S.?  Will this have any consequences?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I don't have anything specific to say about that, except that
when people break our laws, they have to be held accountable for them, and
they ought to know that.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: How long can this situation go on in Peru?  I mean, they're
getting water, food.  This could drag on.  We could be here three weeks
from now talking about the same subject.  How long do you think something
like this could go on?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: No one knows the answer to that.  We just have to hope and
pray that the Peruvian Government is successful in its contacts with the
terrorist, so that all these people can be released safely.  That's the
primary objective here, and I think patience and vigilance are probably the
two watchwords for all of us.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Nick, do you know why Mr. Evan Hunziker committed suicide?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: No, we do not.  And let me just say, this is a private matter.
It concerns, obviously, his family.  We have the greatest sympathy for his
family.  We've expressed our condolences to his family.  It's a very, very
sad case.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Thank you.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Thank you.

DAILY PRESS BRIEFING</H3>
<H2>DPB #204</H2>
<P><H4>WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1996, 1:29 P.M.</H4>
<H4>(ON THE RECORD UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED)</H4>
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Good afternoon. Welcome
to the State Department. As you can imagine, we have been following the
situation in Lima quite closely since about 10:00 p.m. last evening. I can
tell you this, the United States condemns in the strongest possible way the
brutal hostage-taking at the Japanese Embassy residence in Lima last
evening which has continued to the present moment.
<P>We call upon the terrorists who are holding these hostages to release them
quickly and safely and unharmed. There can be no justification for this
shameful act of violence and terrorism. Our concerns are with the hostages,
who are numerous, and our concerns are with their families.
<P>In the last hour, I've spoke twice to the United States Ambassador in Lima,
Dennis Jett. He is an experienced, career, professional diplomat. He was at
the reception last evening along with his Deputy Chief of Mission. They
left about a half hour before the terrorists took over the compound.
<P>Since last evening, Ambassador Jett has been at either his Embassy or his
residence in constant contact with the Peruvian Government and with State
Department officials here in Washington. Ambassador Jett has established a
Task Force at the Embassy. There's also a Task Force that has been
established upstairs on the Department's Seventh Floor.
<P>We remain in close touch with the Peruvian Government. Obviously, the
United States will give - extend - whatever support necessary to the
Peruvian Government in this crisis. Secretary Christopher, of course, has
paid very close attention to this. He's been briefed on several occasions,
beginning very, very early this morning. He will remain in close touch with
our Embassy.
<P>For those of you who follow our global reports on terrorism, you know that
the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement - the MRTA - is a Marxist-Leninist
organization that has spent much of the last 12 or 13 years involved in a
different variety of terrorist actions around the world - kidnappings,
extortions, hostage-takings. This group attacked the American Embassy in
Lima in 1990 during the Gulf War with a rocket-propelled grenade. We know
this group. Obviously, we have been doing what we can throughout the
last decade to use our influence along with the Peruvian Government
to try to shut this group down.
<P>That's about all I have to say in terms of our reaction here. But, Barry,
I'll be glad to go to your questions.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: It's been described, this group has, as Cuba-linked. Is it
still so as far as the State Department knows?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Barry, it's a Marxist-Leninist group. It has had ties with, I
think, forces outside of Peru. I cannot link it formally to the Cuban
Government. But, as you know, one of our long-standing concerns has been
the Cuban Government's support for terrorist groups, in general. But I
can't link this group specifically to the Cuban Government.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Would you endorse an effort by Lima to negotiate an end to this
crisis?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Sid, you know we have a long-standing policy. The United
States does not make concessions to terrorists, and we encourage others to
follow that practice as well.
<P>Obviously, in a situation like this, where a great number of people are
being held hostage - hundreds of people, innocent people, all of them being
held hostage - it's obviously prudent for the Peruvian Government to have
some contact with the hostage-takers. I believe that they've had some
sporadic contact, you know from the press reports, about a variety of
communications that have been sent from the compound to the Peruvian
authorities in Lima.
<P>But our general policy is this: Terrorists should not be rewarded for their
crimes. Terrorists should not succeed in their crimes. Our policy is, we
don't make concessions, and that's our very strong advice to foreign
governments.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: If the price of that policy is the loss of American/Peruvian/Japanese
lives?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: This is a very difficult situation, as are all hostage-
takings. We, above all, because we're a nation that believes in human
rights, that believes that terrorist groups should not take innocent life,
above all the United States wants to win this fight against international
terrorism. We're going to have to leave it to the Peruvian authorities to
handle this situation as best they can.
<P>The United States is not inclined to try to micro-manage this process from
Washington. We're not centrally involved, as you know. But we certainly
have a very strong view that terrorists cannot be rewarded. If you reward
terrorists, they just go on killing people in the future. That's the bitter
lesson that we've learned over the past several decades.
<P>Betsy.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: One of the things that the terrorists seem to be asking for is
the release of their comrades that are being held in jail. One of those who
was tried and convicted was an American - a woman named Lori Berenson. Does
the U.S. have any information on whether she could potentially be released -
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I just have no way of knowing that. As you know, Lori Bereson
is an American citizen. She's currently serving a very harsh sentence in a
Peruvian jail. She was convicted by a Peruvian military tribunal about six
months ago. This is a case that we've continued to raise with the Peruvian
Government. The allegations against her were quite serious. The allegations
had to deal with possible involvement with a terrorist organization.
But I must say that Ms. Bereson has not signed a Privacy Act Waiver, so
under our own law here in the United States, I'm not able to say much about
her particular case beyond what I've already disclosed.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: She denies it. She denies it, of course.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I said these are allegations that have been made; exactly,
exactly Barry..
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Right now she's been in a terrible prison for a long time. What
is it exactly that you're raising with the authorities?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: We are raising the conditions of her imprisonment. We have
raised and will continue to raise the conditions of her imprisonment and
the fact that she was tried by a military tribunal. We would have preferred
a civil court.
<P>George.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: What can you say about those inside the Ambassador's residence,
especially the Americans?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: There's not much that I can say. As you know, there was a very
large international reception being held by the Japanese Ambassador to Peru
last evening to honor the birthday of the Japanese Emperor. We understand
that there were hundreds of people inside. A great number have been
released but still hundreds inside. Among them are a great many diplomats
from a great many nations.
<P>Yes, Judd.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Has the Peruvian Government asked for any U.S. assistance, and
is the U.S. prepared to give any?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Of course, the United States is prepared to assist the
Peruvian Government in whatever way the Peruvian Government deems necessary
and effective to try to end this situation peacefully so that the hostages
are unharmed.
<P>The Peruvian Government, to the best of my knowledge, has not made any
specific request to the U.S. Government. Of course, we are in constant
contact with them through Ambassador Jett.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: There's no request for intelligence assistance or anything of
that kind that you know?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Judd, I'm not aware of any kind of request of that nature.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Is it plausible to the Administration that a country that was
on the mark as far as protecting foreign embassies and watching out for
terrorists was doing its job by allowing this group to take over such a
huge, well attended party?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Frankly, Sid, I don't think this is the time to play the
Monday morning quarterbacking game and to second guess the Peruvian
Government. They have got a major problem on their hands, a major crisis. I
think we prefer to give them our support at this time. There will be plenty
of time after this is over to try to assess what went wrong and what needs
to be done in the future to protect all of the diplomats present in Peru,
but now is not the time to do that.
<P>The Peruvian Government ought to have our support to try to end this
situation peacefully so that people aren't killed and the terrorists do not
succeed. Those have to be the goals in the forefront of the government's
mind.
<P>Betsy.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Nick, I understand that you can't comment on what of the
Americans who may be held might be official Americans or not. But can you
give us a number of Americans who are non-official Americans who are living
in Peru?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: First of all, Betsy, as you know, as a matter of policy, the
United States does not discuss the possible involvement of Americans in
hostage-taking and terrorist incidents like this. Secondly, we do have a
rather large American community in Peru. There are approximately 10,000
Americans in Peru, most of them, of course, private Americans. We have a
large Embassy staff, but the numbers there are relatively small compared to
the private Americans.
<P>Ambassador Jett, quite energetically last evening and again this morning,
activated what we call our warden network. This is our attempt through our
Embassy in Lima to contact as many of the Americans as we can through the
companies for which they work or the non-governmental organizations with
which they are affiliated to make sure that they're all right, to make sure
that they are apprised that there is a terrorist incident underway in a
section of Lima, and, obviously, to advise them to keep away from
that section of town and to take all necessary precautions.
<P>We have had a long-standing travel advisory - Consular Information Sheet, I
should say - in effect for Peru, and it advises American citizens that
there have been a number of terrorist actions taken over the last decade or
so by the two principal terrorist groups operating in Peru. I think it's
fair to say that most Americans living there are mindful of the fact that
they live in a country that has been a major victim of terrorism in the
last decade or so.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: A clarification. You declined to link this group to Cuba. You
didn't know if that was still true. Is this group linked to any foreign
country as far as you know, or to an outside extra Peru terrorist
group?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I think we know enough about terrorism worldwide and this
group, in particular, to understand that oftentimes groups like this do
receive assistance from foreign governments and from organizations outside
the country. But I'm not in a position to say that any particular
government is formally tied to this group. It's a Marxist-Leninist
organization. It has followed that kind of radical outdated, nihilistic
agenda for the past 12 to 13 years. It's obviously an agenda that ought to
be condemned by people who believe in freedom and people who believe that
the human rights of innocent people should not be violated. That's exactly
what's happening here.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: If it's not foreign linked and if it's Marxist-Leninist, could
it in some way be prompted or be routed in the terrible economic conditions
in Peru which has a huge disparity between the vast majority of the
population who are dirt poor and a small group of extremely wealthy
people?
<P>Does Peru's economic situation in any way contribute to the flowering of
Marxist-Leninist groups, apart from the horrible thing of hostage-taking?
Could a group like this exist that easily in America, for instance?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: There is no justification whatsoever for terrorism. There's no
justification whatsoever for taking people hostage and threatening their
lives or killing them, which this group has done in the past. No justification
whatsoever.
<P>Frankly, we've learned enough about Marxist-Leninism in this century to
understand that all the people who practice it never should have used that
excuse - the excuse of economic impoverishment as an excuse for their
violent and terroristic behavior.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Not all Marxist-Leninism is violent. Some are philosophically
left-wing and because of horrible economic conditions -
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: We can an historical debate about this. But just look at the
states that have practiced Marxism-Leninism and look at this particular
group. They always seem to resort to violence to achieve their ends. I very
much reject your point.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Nick, is there anything that you would recommend that be
offered to these guerrillas short of what they're demanding - the release
of people from jail? Is there any sort of counter-offer you're thinking of
making, some sort of assistance or economic aid or any sort of carrot to
buy them out?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Ben, just let me make one thing clear, if it hasn't been clear
already. The United States Government is not negotiating with this group.
The Peruvian Government is the responsible authority in Lima. The Peruvian
Government is in a very difficult situation. It's trying to work with this
hostage-taking group and trying to resolve the situation peacefully.
<P>But, in general, terrorists should not succeed. They should not be rewarded
for their nihilistic behavior. That is something that we Americans feel
very strongly about.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Is the United States advising the Peruvian Government on its
decisions at this point?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: The United States is not advising the Peruvian Government on a
minute-by-minute or hour-by-hour basis on how to resolve this situation.
The Peruvian Government has the responsibility here to resolve this
situation.
<P>We have offered our support and our assistance, should that be necessary.
As I said, after having talked twice in the past hour to Ambassador Jett,
I'm not aware that the Peruvian Government has asked for that assistance.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Do you know anything about the makeup of this group - where
they draw their membership from, approximately how many members?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: As you know, if you read our Annual Terrorism Report, this
group was founded in 1983. It's been responsible for bombings, political
assassinations, kidnappings, and terrorist activities. As I said, it's
believed to have been responsible for the attack on the United States
Embassy in 1990.
<P>I can't tell you much about the composition of the group, who they are,
where they come from. But, again, I want to very clearly reject this line
of argumentation that somehow because there may be income inequality in
Peru, that's a justification for a group to form itself as a terrorist
organization and inflict their behavior on innocent people.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Nick, I know you can't give us names and numbers and all that,
but can you at least tell us if you received a list of who was at the party
last night or if you're going to get a list of who's still inside?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I'm not aware of any such list. Perhaps the Peruvian
Government has compiled it over the evening. It was obviously a very
confused situation, because you had a reception of many hundreds of people.
Some people left before the terrorists took over the compound. Some people
were trapped inside. Some people may not have shown up who were supposed to
have attended. So we don't have a list.
<P>Our concern is the safety and security of American citizens here and also
to render any possible support to the Peruvian Government. As I said,
Ambassador Jett is attempting to make sure that we're in contact with all
of the Americans to advise them of this problem.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Do you expect to get a list shortly later on today of just you
know - hard numbers of how many are inside?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I don't know if we'll get a list at all. The Peruvian
Government obviously has a lot on its hands, and I don't know if there's
going to be an accurate list developed.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Nick -
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Excuse me, Sid, won't you be able to determine which Americans
are there and which are not?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: The Warden System is being used in this instance to warn the
American community about this incident and to apprise them of what we
believe they should be doing to keep away from it and to keep separate from
it.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: But you'll also discover who's unaccounted for, won't
you?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: As I said, I'm just not going to get into that question.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Nick, is the Ambassador nominated for the United Nations, Bill
Richardson, who's been involved in several releases of hostages recently -
has he been involved in this at all? Is he going to be sent down there?
(Laughter)
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: No, I think he's got the day off or the week off. No, I don't
believe he's been involved in any way. This situation is being handled by a
very able career diplomat, Dennis Jett, and, of course, he's receiving
instructions and advice from Secretary Christopher and Under Secretary
Peter Tarnoff and Assistant Secretary Jeff Davidow of our Inter-American
Affairs Bureau.
<P>Sid.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Different subject.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Any more on this one? Yes.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Nick, could you give some sense of what help the United States
might be prepared to offer, what the Ambassador is doing down here at this
point?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Steve, I'm just not in a position to go into that. I think
you'll understand the reasons why.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Did you have some communication with the Japanese Government on
this incident?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: We have been in touch with the Government of Japan. In fact,
we will be in touch here at the State Department with a variety of
governments over the course of the afternoon, essentially just so we can
compare notes and make sure that all of us have the information we need to
have and make sure that all of us are in a position to be as supportive as
we can to the Peruvian Government.
<P>Still on this issue? Okay.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Just one more. Back to identification of affiliates overseas,
beyond Peru, you have denied or at least not been able to comment about
Cuba. Can you say that there are known links to various terrorist groups
but you're unable to state them publicly. Is that accurate?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: That's fair to say.
<P>` Okay, Sid.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: On the Middle East. Ben Gilman and Jesse Helms have written a
letter to the Prime Minister of Israel. Have you seen it?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I've not seen it, no. I've seen the press reports.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Okay, well, it's a fairly effort to separate at least those two
gentlemen from the Clinton Administration's new rhetorical effort regarding
the Middle East peace process.
<P>Do you have any comment on it?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I haven't seen the letter, so I can't comment on it.
<P>Judd.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Any comment on the apparent suicide of Mr. Hunziker?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Just to say that we saw the press reports of the tragic death
of Mr. Hunziker in Tacoma, Washington, this morning. Obviously, our
condolences go out to his family and to his friends. It's a very, very sad
case. He went through a lot. He went through a lot in his imprisonment in
North Korea. I can't account, obviously, for the circumstances surrounding
his death. That's a matter for the local law enforcement authorities and
certainly it's a matter for his family, and we should not intrude in their
privacy. But we do know a lot about him. We have an enormous amount of
sympathy for what he went through, and we just want to extend our
sincere condolences to his family, with which we worked very closely
throughout the period of his confinement.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Are you suggesting something happened to him in North
Korea?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Not at all, Judd. I can't make that link. I'm just suggesting
that we all say a prayer for him, and we're very, very sorry to hear this
news.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Are you blaming the North Koreans for somehow contributing to
his death?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I am not making that link, because I'm not in a position to do
so. The young man died this morning, and I'm not in a position to know -
none of us are here in Washington - how he died, the conditions of his
death. It's a matter for the law enforcement authorities. Therefore, it's
not possible at this point to link it to any other factor, but we
remember the conditions of his confinement. We remember what he went
through. He went through a terrible ordeal, and this is a very, very
sad day for his family.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Do you have any comment on the arrest today involving an FBI
agent who supposedly was working for the Soviets/Russians?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I think there will be a press conference by another government
agency, the Justice Department, about that in just about 40 minutes.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Meanwhile, the State Department has nothing to say about
it?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Right.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: But, Nick, the broader question: There have been a couple of
instances now involving Russian spying. Is that any way - I mean, this is
sort of an ostensible ally of yours. This is someone you're trying to bring
into a special relationship with NATO. Is there anything you can say about
that?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: First of all, I am not saying anything about the incident that
George asked about. It's not my domain.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: On the issue of Russian spies.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: On the issue of Russia, we have developed over the last five
years - five-and-a-half years - a very positive relationship with Russia
that has done a lot to diminish the fear of war in Europe and to lower the
nuclear threshold. These are the most vital concerns of the United States
Government, and President Bush and President Clinton have emphasized
relations with Russia, because we need to have a cooperative, constructive
relationship with Russia to preserve peace and to make sure that the
21<SUP>st</SUP> century is more peaceful than this century has been.
<P>That is the strategic justification for the basis of U.S.-Russian
relations. We don't always agree with the Russian Government. From time to
time, as in the case of Mr. Ames and Mr. Nicholson, we certainly have
profound disagreements with the actions of the Russian security services,
and we let the Russians know about that - you can believe it - in private
as well as in public. This is not a government with which we have in all
respects shared values or shared ideas, but it is a government with which
we have constructed the type of relationship that can best secure
the future and the security of the American people, which is <I>the</I>
most fundamental responsibility that any American President has.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: I believe after the Nicholson arrest there was a comment from
the podium to the effect that the U.S. reserves the right to take an
appropriate response.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: That is always our right, and we reserve that right.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: But you haven't made any response since the Nicholson
arrest.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: No. Not that I can talk about. But, when we can talk about it,
I'll let you know. Obviously, it's disturbing in the case of Mr. Nicholson
and Mr. Ames to see this type of behavior on the part of the Russian
Government, certainly.
<P>Steve.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Can I go back to the Middle East for a second?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Yes.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: We've been in and around on this on other days, but would you
say that there has been a change in the American policy or attitude towards
Israeli settlement policy?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I would say that there has been a change in the Israeli
Government's actions, and that was the action taken last Friday to increase
the subsidies to the existing settlements in the West Bank. That was a
change. That made a qualitative difference, and that certainly led to the
remarks that the President made two days ago over at the White House, and
those remarks obviously don't need much elucidation from me.
<P>That was a very clear enunciation of our belief, basically, that in a
negotiation, when one party takes a measure that is essentially pre-emptive
in those negotiations, it disrupts the negotiations, and it makes it much
more difficult to achieve progress in those negotiations.
<P>Settlements are a final status issue, and the designation of settlements as
a final status issue is a very important fact for both the Palestinians and
the Israelis. The other issue that we're concerned about is the Hebron
negotiations, and there you heard Secretary Christopher say how disappointed
he was that there hasn't been the type of progress that we had anticipated
in late September when Chairman Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu came to
Washington.
<P>I would just say this: It's paramount for both of them to make progress on
Hebron. It is very important for the Palestinian Authority to reciprocate
some of the gestures that have been made by the Israeli Government
recently. We believe a Hebron agreement is possible. We believe it must be
achieved in order to continue this historic process of peace between the
Palestinians and the Israelis, and there have been some gestures made by
the Israelis recently in private that ought now to be reciprocated. Both
are responsible for the success or failure of these negotiations,
and we believe they can succeed, but there needs to be a renewed effort to
have them succeed.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Can I follow up just briefly, Norm. I'm sorry. In this reaction
to the new Israeli step, which is basically how you characterized it, have
you coordinated this action with the nominee to be Secretary of State and
current UN Ambassador, Mrs. Albright?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Steve, this, you know -
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: That's not how it's done. I mean, I'm just -
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: The way in which we responded, of course, was directed by the
President and by Secretary Christopher, and Secretary Christopher in
particular, as you know, given his interests and involvement in the Middle
East over the last four years, has been very, very closely involved in the
formulation of our policy and what we said about this issue just in the
past week.
<P>Of course, he and others have communicated this to Ambassador Albright. But
Ambassador Albright has a lot of work to do right now. She's busy preparing
for her confirmation hearings. She's been very busy up at the United
Nations. As you know, she was present at the United Nations yesterday when
there was a unanimous vote and very welcome vote for Kofi Annan to become
Secretary General.
<P>So we have one Secretary of State at a time, and I think you ought to look
at Secretary Christopher as having been the primary motivator behind this
policy.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Nick, on the settlements, is it helpful for Chairmen of key
congressional committees to take the opposite position from the Administration?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: The great thing about the United States is that we have this
system of a balance of power where the Congress has an absolute right to
speak out publicly and to enunciate a position, and certainly the Chairman
of the House International Relations Committee has the right and probably
has the obligation to speak publicly about what his views are. We recognize
that right. We respect it. We respect Chairman Gilman.
<P>We may have a difference of opinion slightly on this issue, but I don't
think you ever want to see the day come in America when any Administration -
and specifically this Administration - is antagonistic towards public
remarks by members of Congress. They have a right to make them. We don't
always see eye to eye, and particularly when you have a situation where you
have a President in one party and the House and Senate controlled by
another party. But they have a fundamental right and obligation to say what
they want.
<P>Also in our system of government, of course, the President is the prime
executor, has the prime responsibility for carrying out American foreign
policy, and we will continue to do that, serving our President in the best
way we can. I think that this Administration has made its views very, very
clear over the last week on this issue of settlements.
<P>Betsy.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: On a different subject. On the talks with the North Koreans in
New York, is there any more that you can say? Did they continue into today?
Have they made any gesture towards South Korea on the question of the sub
incident?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: The talks have continued. As you know, they've addressed a
very wide range of issues. We got into some of those issues yesterday
involving the submarine incident, the Agreed Framework, the Four-Party
talks and some bilateral issues. I don't have much to add to what I said
yesterday. We have not yet seen the type of gesture that we must see from
the North Koreans that would effectively allow the Republic of Korea and
the United States to close this chapter of the submarine incident, which is
a fundamental violation of South Korea's sovereignty.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Do you know how long these talks will go on?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I don't. Mr. Li's departure date has not been set. He remains
in New York. He has not yet returned to Pyongyang, so I suppose we'll be in
contact for a while, which is not surprising, given the number of issues
that we have in front of us.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Can you say that you are making headway on some of these
issues?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I think the talks have been constructive, but I think
particularly with the North Koreans, you always want to be careful about
not predicting success before the talks have finished. We haven't achieved
satisfaction on the submarine incident. We certainly have not achieved our
goal of involving the North Koreans in Four-Party talks so that a final
peace agreement might be reached to end the Korean War.
<P>We have achieved, I think, a relative degree of satisfaction -- we have --
on the Agreed Framework, which is in place. The North Koreans are meeting
their commitments. The United States and our partners are meeting our
commitments.
<P>Charlie.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Serbia. Has Dick Miles met with Milosevic more recently than we
know about, and can you bring us up to date as to whether you think there's
any progress on that front?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I don't believe that Dick Miles, our Charge d'Affaires in
Belgrade, has seen Mr. Milosevic recently, but I can tell you this.
Secretary Christopher had a meeting this morning with Ambassador Max
Kampelman, who many of you will remember is a distinguished American
diplomat who served in many Administrations. Ambassador Kampelman has been
asked to join the OSCE delegation, which is to be headed by the former
Spanish Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez. That delegation will be departing
very shortly for Belgrade.
<P>The original suggestion for this delegation was made by the United States
way back on November 18<SUP>th</SUP>, the day following the elections when
it was abundantly clear to us that the elections had been stolen by the
Serbian Government.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Serbia.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Serbian Government. Thank you, Sid. This delegation will look
into the present crisis. It will review the basis of the November
17<SUP>th</SUP> election. It will review the vote counting in the 15 of the
18 constituencies where we strongly suspect there was foul play. It's a
very important delegation. We expect that Mr. Milosevic will deal with this
delegation fairly and openly, and that he will be respectful about the
conclusions of this delegation, and that he will be inclined to follow
the recommendations that this delegation makes.
<P>We felt it important to have a senior-level figure head the delegation. Mr.
Gonzalez is that. We also felt it important to have an experienced American
diplomat be the American representative, and Secretary Christopher has a
lot of confidence in Ambassador Kampelman. That's why they met this
morning.
<P>We believe this delegation will be independent and objective and fair. But,
as you know, the United States starts with the presumption that the people
in the streets have a grievance that has directed them to the streets, and
that something has got to be done to make sure that these votes are counted
fairly.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Nick, a follow-up. Let me see if I understand you correctly.
You expect that Milosevic will be inclined to follow the recommendations,
or you hope he will be inclined to follow?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: We hope he will be inclined to follow these suggestions, and
we hope he's inclined in that direction. But we've had enough experience
with Mr. Milosevic to understand that what he says publicly is not always
consistent with his private actions. You saw him meet some student
demonstrators from Nis yesterday. He made a number of very, I guess on
appearance, constructive statements there about how people who had
interfered with the elections were going to be punished. It will be very
interesting to see if that happens. It would be interesting to see if
these fine words are backed up by good actions.
<P>Chris.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: A couple of questions on Zaire. Now that President Mobutu is
safely installed back in one of his many homes, what does the United States
expect from him in the coming weeks?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: It's hard to know what to expect from President Mobutu. He's
been away so long. He's had a very serious illness. I can say this: The
United States, as you know, has spoken very clearly over a long period of
time about the problems in Zaire, the lack of accountability in the
government; the wasted resources by the government; the incredibly lavish
lifestyles in a country where so many people are suffering.
<P>We continue to believe that some kind of transition to a more democratic,
more just system, ought to be the future for the Zairian people. We believe
that free and fair elections remain the best hope for addressing the
legitimate political aspirations that many Zairians have. We have had an
effective relationship with Prime Minister Kengo, and I know that our
Ambassador has been in touch with him quite often.
<P>We're currently funding Zairian non-governmental organizations to promote a
respect for human rights, to promote those who believe that democracy ought
to be the future of Zaire, and to promote civic programs that we think will
make Zaire a more just society. That's where we're putting our money.
<P>We believe that the leadership of Zaire ought to be determined by the
people of Zaire. So we'd like to see upon President Mobutu's return some
kind of effort to make a transition to democracy in a very troubled
country.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Do you think that free and fair elections can be held under the
current conditions of security in Zaire, and could those conditions of
security be improved without some form of external intervention?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: They're two separate questions. First, I think it would be
very difficult to hold free and fair elections today in Zaire, given the
nature of that society and the nature of the government. The second, the
United States does not currently support, as you know, any kind of
intervention force in Zaire. I think the Canadian Government concluded
quite properly that with this dramatic exodus of the Rwandan refugees back
to Rwanda from Zaire and also now from Tanzania, where we believe 250,000
people have returned just in the last three or four days - that situation
was effectively resolved by the refugees themselves.
<P>There has been some talk internationally, as you know, about an intervention
force to try to stabilize the situation in Eastern Zaire, which now is
characterized by a dramatic extension of the authority of the rebel
alliance in Eastern Zaire, and the United States does not support such a
mission. Frankly, we don't know what the framework of such an intervention
force would be, what the goal would be, or how any objectives could be
successfully carried out.
<P>The sovereignty of the Government of Zaire is important. The borders of the
country are important. We do not agree, as a major American paper said
today in an editorial, that somehow the borders don't make a difference.
They do make a difference in a continent with over 50 states and a
continent whose borders were drawn not by the people themselves but by the
former colonial powers. It does make a difference to respect those borders.
We think the borders ought to be respected. It's an important international
principle that we believe adds to stability.
<P>So we hope that the Government of Zaire is able to hold things together,
extend its influence, and we hope that the Government of Zaire and the
rebel alliance can enter into some kind of political dialogue that will
allow them to resolve their differences.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Mobutu's got to be the man to impose security then.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Excuse me?
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: President Mobutu is the only person, as far as you're concerned,
who can impose security -
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: The Zairian Government is responsible for security within
Zaire and for the protection of the borders of Zaire, and it's currently
headed by President Mobutu and Prime Minister Kengo. We cannot appoint a
new leadership for Zaire. We do hope that there might be some kind of
democratic transition that would give people greater rights.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: But, Nick, aren't there elections already scheduled for May,
and are you saying that they should be postponed, given the circumstances?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I didn't say anything of the sort. In fact, everything that
I've been saying would lead you to believe that the United States hopes
that elections will be held and should be held.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: But it's very difficult to hold free and fair elections at the
present time in Zaire.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Today in Zaire. We would hope very much that the government
would want to hold elections, and that they could be free and fair. A lot
of work would have to be done to make them free and fair, given the
conditions in that society.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Your hopes for transition away from Mobutu, is that hope shared,
would you say, by the European allies, particularly France?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I want to be clear about something, Barry. I have not said
anything about a transition away from Mr. Mobutu. That's not our choice.
That is not our business to say that h should go or he should remain.
That's not our business. We hope for a democratic transition, and we would
hope that the current government would lead that transition. But we are
putting our money into programs that encourage civic groups that are
democratic, that believe in human rights, and that believe in elections.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Then you haven't lost hope that Mobutu can lead Zaire into a
democratic transition?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I choose not to make a comment about the political future of
Mr. Mobutu. I'm not making a comment about that. It's not our business to
make a public comment about that. I don't know where he's going to lead the
country, frankly. He's just returned. He's obviously got a lot of problems
on his hands - a major rebel offensive underway in Eastern Zaire. He's got
a lot of business on his plate. It's not the position of the United
States to give that kind of advice - a government should stay, a government
should go. But we do believe in general there should be a transition to
democracy.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: You have no position on Mobutu himself.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: We have a lot of positions on Mobutu, but sometimes we don't
advertise them in public.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: No, in the old days you carried out our policy through other
forms and parts of this government, and Mobutu was well rewarded by the
United States for many years, and then you didn't like him any more for
various reasons - most of them good - and the question now is this is the
biggest man in Zaire. He's come home. And the question is, does he have
America's support or not?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Our hopes are centered in a future that we hope will be
democratic in Zaire. We will judge Mr. Mobutu by his success or failure in
meeting that objective. That's the objective that the United States thinks
is a fair one and a just one for the people of Zaire, and speaking more
broadly, the people of Central Africa. But I'm not going to - I can't put
myself in the position of giving a lot of advice to him publicly. We'll
reserve our advice for our private discussions with him.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Related issue. The French Foreign Minister, Mr. De Charette -
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Who said some very nice things about Secretary Christopher, by
the way, here in Washington two days ago - some very nice things. He said
the Secretary was a great Secretary of State. He said the Secretary had
been very active and creative in the Middle East, and I just wanted to
repeat for everybody what Foreign Minister de Charette said so kindly about
Secretary Christopher.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: He also said he was -
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Would you say &quot;better late than never"?
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: He also said he was deeply pained by some comments that
actually came from you, and one of them was -
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I can't imagine I would say anything that would pain anyone. I
try to be, you know, objective up here, Ben.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: For example, I man, I'd just like to check what you say about
this. He said that he left this meeting at NATO unaware that a toast was
about to be begun or had begun in honor of Mr. Christopher. He also said
that Mr. Rifken and Mr. Dini of Italy and England also left the meeting to
talk to the press, but nobody blamed them; that somehow he was singled out
for having left this meeting as a grave insult to Mr. Christopher. Is
that how you see it?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: This story is now - let's see - Wednesday. This story is eight
days old, and I think your paper did a story or several stories on this - I
know that other papers did last week - it's last week's story. I said a lot
of things last week, and I stand by everything I said. There was a snub,
and I stand by that.
<P>But the good news is - the good news is - that the French Government came
to Washington this week and they said some nice things about the Secretary
of State which were well received. I understand that Secretary Perry and
Minister Millon had a similarly positive discussion in Brussels. We stand
by what we said. But this story has a more positive element to it this week
than last week.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: The Lebanese Prime Minister, Mr. Hariri, yesterday at the
National Press Club, he stated Syrian troops at the northern part of
Lebanon - especially in the Bekaa Valley - they give them some kind of
security - in the Bekaa Valley, especially. Other than Syria, there arises
a lot of problems in all the neighboring countries. It's a terrorist base
and counterfeiting and poppy-growing.
<P>When you met with Prime Minister Hariri on this Bekaa issue, did you raise
this issue?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Just over the last couple of days?
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Yes.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: The focus of our discussions with him were on economic
reconstruction in Lebanon. The Lebanese Government is very well aware of
our views about the terrorist bases in the Bekaa Valley.
<P>By the way, the Syrian Government is also aware and is mentioned in our
Annual Terrorist Report on Syria.
<P>There are a couple of things I want to tell you before we all separate
today. First of all, I had a phone call from Abdulsalam al-Massarueh
yesterday. He asked me just to pass on to everybody his greetings. As you
know, he's been very ill but he's hopeful he'll be released from the
hospital very shortly. He has received a lot of calls from a lot of people
on both sides of this lectern. He appreciates them very much, and he just
wanted me to say this at the briefing. I think we all just hope that he
makes a full recovery. He's a wonderful man. He usually sits in that chair,
and we can't wait for the day when he comes back to join us. I know that
day will be soon.
<P>Second, we had a very significant retirement party here at the Department
this morning. Some of you may have been there at 11:45. Ambassador Tom
Pickering, as you know, retired the last day of November. Secretary
Christopher wished him well today in a very elegant retirement ceremony.
<P>Ambassador Pickering had seven Ambassadorships, culminating in his role as
U.S. Ambassador to Russia. In my view, he is the most outstanding career
diplomat that this country has produced, certainly, in the last several
decades. All of us here at the State Department want to wish him the very
best in his new role as head of the Eurasia Foundation, which is a very
good organization that funds development projects in the former Soviet
Union.
<P>Second, Secretary Christopher, later on today at 4:00 p.m. - Secretary
Christopher, I think around 4:00 p.m. will be presenting the Hammer Awards.
This is open to all of you. These are awards to people in the Department
who have been involved in the Vice President's initiative to reinvent
government, to try to take this vast bureaucracy and make it more efficient
and make it more responsive to the American people. We'll have a lot of
people at the State Department receiving awards today, and I encourage all
of you to come and see that event.
<P>Last, I want to invite all of you publicly to the Bureau of Public Affairs
Christmas party which takes place in Room 6800 tomorrow between 3:00-5:00
p.m. You're all invited. We'll be taking attendance. Those who come will
get major scoops about all the issues of the day. Those who don't, we won't
talk to for a while. You have to come to our Christmas party. We'll have a
lot of fun. If you don't want to talk to us, just don't show up. It's going
to be a good party. It's being organized by Jamuna Broadway who has quite
a flair for these productions. So I think you're going to enjoy
yourself.
<P>I'm done with my announcements.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: I'd like to go back to Syria. Are the Syrian troops in Lebanon
an occupying force as the Lebanese Prime Minister described the Israeli
troops in the South? He said they're different. Are they different?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I saw what Prime Minister Hariri said. The United States, of
course, hopes for the day when all foreign forces leave Lebanon. That will
be a positive day because that will mean that the Lebanese Government is
able to extend its sovereignty throughout the country as it should. We hope
it will set up an environment in which the Lebanese Government can make a
peace treaty with Israel.
<P>We have said a lot of things in the past about the Syrian military
presence. We're concerned about the support of the Government of Syria for
terrorist groups. Both the groups that are based in Damascus and groups
that may operate out of regions in Lebanon where the Syrian army has
control. We've made that concern public many, many times.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Nick, over the weekend the First Deputy Prime Minister of
Russia, Mr. Aleksey Bol'shakov, met in Beijing with his counterparts. This
was about expanding economic ties to a more significantly military
cooperation, Nick. Is there a concern on the part of this government of the
growing ties and the sale of high-tech, sophisticated multi-hardware from
Russia to the Chinese?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: It is not surprising to see that the Chinese and Russian
Governments are talking. They do have diplomatic relations. They have
embassies in each other's capitals. I'm sure there are meetings that go on
everyday between Chinese and Russian officials. Surely, the United States
Government cannot object to that.
<P>We are trying to build a good relationship with both countries. In the
interest of peace in Eurasia, we ought to hope that Russia and China can
keep their border quiet and diminish the kind of tension that was evident
throughout much of the Cold War on the Sino-Russian border.
<P>As to sales of military equipment, obviously, there are international
regimes in place - specifically, the Missile Technology Control Regime -
which do place limits on the type of weaponry that can be transferred from
one country to the next. We expect that all countries will obey those
limits.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Are we confident that the Russians are doing so?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: It's a very, very big and general question. I would have to
have a specific question. We don't have time because the journalists are
all leaving and they've got to go file their stories.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Hebron: Yesterday, you gave a bleak assessment of where things
stood on Hebron. Of course, it was a departure from the optimism that we've
been hearing. When I got home and saw some of the foreign accounts on ITN
Television, for instance. They were very optimistic that a deal might be
imminent in a few days. I'm a little baffled. Where do you stand today? And
could that have been sort of a little bit of a nudge to the parties
to get it done; that things really aren't as bad as maybe you made them out
to be yesterday? This has been done before, you know.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Has it, really?
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Yeah.
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: I'm shocked. Actually, Barry, the United States has been
optimistic from the beginning of the talks that they would one day succeed.
But I think what you heard from Secretary Christopher yesterday was a
little bit of frustration that the talks have not succeeded as of today.
They should have succeeded. The outlines of the deal are there.
<P>We just want to call on Israel and the Palestinians to make every effort to
close this because there is a lot going on. The environment has not been
conducive for forward movement on a lot of issues. It has been a negative
environment in may ways, and we would like to see them get this agreement
because it would help to add some momentum to the peace negotiations.
<P>We believe this deal will be reached in the end. We'd like them to move
faster. Today, I've said that in return for some of the gestures that have
been made by the Israeli Government in these negotiations just recently, we
think the Palestinian Authority should now put itself in a position to
reciprocate some of those gestures on the specific issues that are in play
in these Hebron talks.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: Nick, a follow-up to what Bill said about the Russia-China
relationship. There's been something of a drumbeat in certain newspapers in
this city warning about the increasing collaboration between Russia, China,
India, and Iran. Obviously, there are a lot of things going on in that area,
including plans for the development of a land bridge - that is, rail
connections going from Europe all the way to the coast of China.
<P>In many respects, it seems to me that since the United States is in a good
relationship with most of these countries - with India, with Russia,
growing engagement with China - that the only problem there would be with
Iran. I ask, if in light of this growing collaboration, if we're not better,
or is not discussion here as to how one would engage a country like Iran,
which obviously is becoming a player in this region?
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: Just to be fair to your question, if this were 1966 or 1976, I
might understand the concern about rail links between China and Russia. But
it's 1996. The basis of our policy towards both China and Russia is, we
want them to be engaged in the world connected to the rest of the world. We
do not wish to see China or Russia isolated.
<P>We have no objections to Russia and China having a positive, constructive
relationship. We ought to have a lot of fears about the reverse. It's not
good for the United States to see Russia and China at odds with each other.
It is good for us to see them making peace with each other as they have
over the last couple of years.
<P>Now, Iran is a completely different case. We believe that Iran should be
isolated by Russia, by China, by Western Europe, and we are isolating Iran
ourselves.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: They obviously are not. And then the question arises -
<P><STRONG>MR. BURNS</STRONG>: We disagree with them on that issue. We have been very open
for many years about our disagreement with the Russian Government and the
Chinese Government on Iran. But in terms of Russia-China ties, we ought to
hope that they build those roads and railroads and communication link so
that Russia and China can take part in what's happening in Europe and Asia
that is so positive economically and socially.
<P>Thank you.

<STRONG>VOICED AT</STRONG>: 12/20/96  12:58 P.M.
<P><STRONG>INTRO</STRONG>:  OF ALL THE ISSUES THAT PLAGUE THE INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO
BRING PEACE TO BOSNIA, ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT HAS BEEN FINDING
HOMES FOR THE TWO MILLION PEOPLE DISPLACED BY THE 43 MONTH WAR.
DESPITE THE PROMISES OF THE DAYTON PEACE AGREEMENT, AND THE
PLEDGES OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, MANY REFUGEES SEE LITTLE
PROSPECT OF A RETURN TO HOMES THAT NOW LIE IN AREAS CONTROLLED BY
OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS.  FROM SARAJEVO, VOA'S KYLE KING HAS A LOOK
AT THE PROBLEM AND WHAT IS BEING DONE.
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:  DRIVEN FROM HER HOME BY THE FIERCE FIGHTING WHICH ONCE
RAGED AROUND THE SARAJEVO AIRPORT, 43-YEAR-OLD MIRHUMISA KOMARICA
BECAME ONE OF THE FIRST REFUGEES OF THE BLOODY WAR IN BOSNIA
HERZEGOVINA.
<P>SHE IS NOW ONE OF MORE THAN TWO MILLION PEOPLE WHOSE HOMES WERE
DESTROYED, OR WHO WERE FORCED TO FLEE THE BRUTAL CAMPAIGNS OF
ETHNIC CLEANSING IN THE 43 MONTH WAR.
<P>MS. KOMARICA, WHO HEADS A PRIVATE ASSOCIATION OF REFUGEES AND
DISPLACED PEOPLE, SAYS LITTLE MORE THAN PRELIMINARY WORK HAS BEEN
DONE TO FIND HOUSING FOR PEOPLE.
<CENTER><H4>// KOMARICA -BOSNIAN LANGUAGE- ACT //</H4></CENTER>
<P>SHE SAYS IT HAS BEEN THE GENERAL OPINION OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT
THE REFUGEES ARE A PROBLEM OF EUROPE AND  NOT  OUR PROBLEM.  WE
UNDERSTAND IT IS A COMPLEX SITUATION, BUT WHEN OUR ASSOCIATION
TRIES TO EXPLAIN THAT EUROPEAN NATIONS HAVE ALREADY DONE MUCH TO
HELP OUR PEOPLE AND IT IS TIME FOR THEM TO COME HOME, THE
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T ACCEPT THAT.  THE REFUGEES, SHE SAYS, HAVE
BECOME AN INSTRUMENT OF POLITICS.
<P>BUT THE ISSUE IS EXPECTED TO BECOME MORE URGENT WHEN ABOUT
ONE-HALF A MILLION REFUGEES NOW LIVING IN EUROPE BEGIN SLOWLY
RETURNING HOME IN THE SPRING.
<P>ARIANE QUENTIER, A SPOKESMAN FOR THE U-N REFUGEE AGENCY IN
BOSNIA, SAYS SHE EXPECTS REFUGEE ASSISTANCE WILL SPEED UP NOW,
ALTHOUGH SHE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MISTAKES WERE MADE IN THE FIRST
YEAR.
<CENTER><H4>// QUENTIER ACT //</H4></CENTER>
<P>I THINK WHAT WE HAVE DONE AFTER THE DAYTON ACCORD WAS
         SIGNED MIGHT BE CRITICIZED, BUT WAS  NOT  THAT BAD.  YOU
         HAVE TO REMEMBER THE CONDITIONS AT THE TIME THE
         AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED.  AT THAT TIME EVERY OPTION WAS
         AVAILABLE AND WE HAD TO TRY EVERY OPTION, EVEN THOSE
         THAT LOOK NOW AS VERY NAIVE.  BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
         THAT AT THE TIME OF DAYTON, AFTER FOUR YEARS OF BLOODY
         WAR WE HAD TO TRY ALL THESE OPTIONS.  NOW IT MIGHT LOOK
         A BIT TO IDEALISTIC TODAY BECAUSE THINGS HAVE PROVEN
         NOT  TO WORK, AND WE FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.  BUT ONCE
         AGAIN IN JANUARY OF 1996 WE HAD TO GO THROUGH THESE
         STEPS THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE MISTAKES TODAY BUT THAT HAD
         TO BE TAKEN BEFORE WE COULD SET UP ANOTHER STRATEGY,
         MORE REALISTIC MAYBE.
<CENTER><H4>// END ACT //</H4></CENTER>
<P>SURROUNDED IN HER OFFICE BY MODELS OF HOUSING PROJECTS HER
ASSOCIATION HAS PROPOSED, MS. KOMARICA SAYS SHE HAS HAD A BETTER
RESPONSE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAN FROM HER OWN
GOVERNMENT.
<P>BUT DESPITE THE PROBLEMS SHE HAS ENCOUNTERED, THE STYLISH LOOKING
FORMER PROFESSOR AND MOTHER OF TWO SAYS SHE IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT
THE FUTURE.
<CENTER><H4>// SECOND KOMARICA ACT AND FADE //</H4></CENTER>
<P>EVEN THOUGH WE LOST EVERYTHING SHE SAYS, I'M HAPPY BECAUSE MY
CHILDREN ARE HEALTHY AND NORMAL.  LIKE ALL THE KIDS OF BOSNIA
HERZEGOVINA THEY REALLY ENDURED.  EVEN IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER
AGAIN, I WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT, BECAUSE AS LONG AS I
HAVE MY CHILDREN WITH ME, I REALLY HAVE SOMETHING PERMANENT.
<P>THE QUESTION NOW IS WHETHER THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES
WAITING FOR HOUSING WILL CONTINUE TO BE AS PATIENT AND GRATEFUL
AS MS. KOMARICA.  (SIGNED)

<P><STRONG>INTRO</STRONG>:  BULGARIA'S SOCIALIST PRIME MINISTER ZHAN VIDENOV, WIDELY
BLAMED FOR TWO YEARS OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP, SATURDAY PRESENTED HIS
RESIGNATION AND THAT OF HIS ENTIRE CABINET.  FROM BUDAPEST,
STEFAN BOS REPORTS THAT MR. VIDENOV'S RESIGNATION WAS ANNOUNCED
AT THE OPENING OF A SPECIAL PARTY CONGRESS IN SOFIA, BULGARIA'S
CAPITAL.
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:  THE RESIGNATION OF HIS GOVERNMENT CAME AS A SHOCK TO
DELEGATES ATTENDING THE CONGRESS OF THE FORMER COMMUNIST PARTY,
NOW RE-NAMED THE BULGARIAN SOCIALIST PARTY.
<P>MR. VIDENOV SAID HE DID  NOT  INTEND TO RUN FOR ANY FUTURE POST
IN THE SOCIALIST PARTY'S LEADERSHIP OR THE GOVERNMENT.
<P>COLLEAGUES, OPPOSITION PARTIES AND TRADE UNIONS BLAMED THE
VIDENOV GOVERNMENT FOR BULGARIA'S WORST ECONOMIC TROUBLES SINCE
THE FALL OF COMMUNISM IN 1989.
<P>EARLIER THIS MONTH SOME 400-THOUSAND BULGARIANS JOINED A NATIONAL
STRIKE TO DEMAND A NEW GOVERNMENT AND BETTER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.
FAILURE TO MEET ECONOMIC REFORMS MEANT THAT INTERNATIONAL
ECONOMIC AID PROGRAMS WERE SUSPENDED.  ANNUAL INFLATION HAS
EXCEEDED 250 PERCENT AND THE MAJORITY OF BULGARIA'S EIGHT AND
ONE-HALF MILLION PEOPLE LIVE AT OR BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL.
<P>MR. VIDENOV HAS ALSO COME UNDER FIRE FOR HIS ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT
IN CORRUPTION.  PARTY OFFICIALS SAY FORMER PRIME MINISTER ANDREI
LUKANOV WAS ABOUT TO REVEAL HIGH LEVEL GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION WHEN
HE WAS SHOT DEAD IN OCTOBER.   (SIGNED)

<P><STRONG>INTRO</STRONG>:  A HIGH-LEVEL DELEGATION FROM THE EUROPEAN SECURITY
ORGANIZATION HAS BEGUN A MISSION TO BELGRADE TO INVESTIGATE
CLAIMS OF FRAUD IN LAST MONTH'S SERBIAN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.  THE
DELEGATION, LED BY FORMER SPANISH PRIME MINISTER FELIPE GONZALEZ,
ARRIVED IN THE SERBIAN CAPITAL AMID CONTINUING ANTI-GOVERNMENT
DEMONSTRATIONS BY OPPOSITION GROUPS AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.
FROM BELGRADE, VOA'S DOUGLAS ROBERTS REPORTS.
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:  THERE WAS NO SUBSTANTIVE COMMENT FROM THE O-S-C-E
OFFICIALS AS THEY ARRIVED IN BELGRADE FRIDAY EVENING.  FORMER
PRIME MINISTER GONZALEZ SAID HE WOULD MAKE NO STATEMENTS UNTIL HE
HAS CONCLUDED HIS TALKS HERE.
<P>THE DELEGATION WENT STRAIGHT FROM THE AIRPORT TO A MEETING WITH
SERBIA'S PRESIDENT SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC.  AND AFTERWARDS, THE
O-S-C-E OFFICIALS HELD TALKS AT A LOCAL HOTEL WITH THE LEADERS OF
SERBIA'S THREE MAIN OPPOSITION PARTIES.
<P>ONE OF THOSE LEADERS, VUK DRASKOVIC, TOLD REPORTERS HE EXPECTS
THE O-S-C-E TO STRONGLY URGE THE BELGRADE GOVERNMENT TO RECOGNIZE
OPPOSITION VICTORIES IN LAST MONTH'S MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.
<P>THE OPPOSITION SAYS ITS CANDIDATES WON A MAJORITY OF THE COUNCIL
SEATS IN MORE THAN A DOZEN MAJOR TOWNS AND CITIES, INCLUDING
BELGRADE, BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT ANNULLED THE RESULTS.
<P>EUROPEAN OFFICIALS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THE O-S-C-E MAY RECOMMEND
A NEW ROUND OF VOTING, MONITORED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.
THE SERBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS INDICATED IT MIGHT ACCEPT SUCH A
PROPOSAL. BUT THE OPPOSITION HAS REACTED COOLY.
<P>OPPOSITION LEADERS SAY THE MASS DEMONSTRATIONS WILL CONTINUE HERE
UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZES THE RESULTS OF NOVEMBER'S VOTE.

<P><STRONG>INTRO</STRONG>: FOR MORE THAN A MONTH NOW, OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS AND
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HAVE BEEN STAGING MASS ANTI-GOVERNMENT
PROTESTS IN SERBIA'S MAIN TOWNS AND CITIES.  THE OPPOSITION
CHARGES THAT THE GOVERNMENT ROBBED THEM OF ELECTION VICTORIES
DURING NOVEMBER'S MUNICIPAL VOTING.  THE BELGRADE GOVERNMENT
DENIES THE ACCUSATION, AND THE RULING SOCIALIST PARTY HAS BEGUN
TO ORGANIZE COUNTER-DEMONSTRATIONS.  SERBIAN OFFICIALS HAVE LONG
CONTENDED THAT A SILENT MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION, ESPECIALLY IN
THE COUNTRYSIDE, SUPPORTS THE GOVERNMENT.  VOA'S DOUGLAS ROBERTS
REPORTS FROM THE VILLAGE OF RAZANJ, TWO HUNDRED KILOMETERS
SOUTHEAST OF BELGRADE.
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:  THE MASS PROTEST MOVEMENT IN SERBIA'S MAIN TOWNS SEEMS TO
HAVE HAD LITTLE IMPACT ON THIS RURAL COMMUNITY.
FARMERS, WITH TIME ON THEIR HANDS (WHO HAVE LITTLE TO DO) DURING
THE LONG BALKAN WINTER, GATHER ONCE A WEEK IN THE CITY CAFE,
SMOKING, DRINKING AND CHATTING WHILE THEIR WIVES SHOP IN THE
LOCAL OUTDOOR MARKET.
<P>THE CONVERSATION THERE IS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO FOCUS ON PRICES
THAN ON POLITICAL PROTESTS.  BUT WHEN ASKED BY A VISITING
REPORTER, MANY LOCAL RESIDENTS MADE IT CLEAR THEY HAVE NO
SYMPATHY FOR THE DEMONSTRATORS.
<CENTER><H4>/// DRAGOMIR ACT, IN SERBO-CROAT ///</H4></CENTER>
<P>I AM AGAINST THESE PROTESTERS, SAYS DRAGOMIR, AN ELDERLY FARMER
IN A LONG GRAY COAT AND CLOTH CAP.  THEY SHOULD ALL BE PUT INTO A
MEAT GRINDER, HE ADDS, AND USED FOR STUFFING PEPPERS.
<P>DRAGOMIR IS A PROUD VETERAN OF THE WORLD WAR TWO CAMPAIGN BY
YUGOSLAVIA'S PARTISANS AGAINST NAZI OCCUPATION.  HE WAS AN ARDENT
SUPPORTER OF LONG-TIME YUGOSLAV LEADER, JOSEF BROZ TITO, AND HE
BELIEVES SERBIA'S CURRENT PRESIDENT SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC IS
CARRYING TITO'S MANTLE.
<CENTER><H4>///DRAGOMIR ACT, IN SERBO-CROAT///</H4></CENTER>
<P>THE WHOLE WORLD RESPECTS MILOSEVIC, HE SAYS, AND THESE STUDENT
PROTESTORS ARE STAINING YUGOSLAVIA'S INTERNATIONAL IMAGE, AND FOR
NO GOOD REASON.
<P>OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS CONTEND THAT PEOPLE LIKE DRAGOMIR ARE
SIMPLY MIS-INFORMED ABOUT THE REASONS BEHIND THE PROTEST MOVEMENT
 VICTIMS, AS THEY PUT IT, OF SERBIA'S STATE-CONTROLLED MEDIA.
<P>RURAL SERBS HAVE NO ACCESS TO THE FEW INDEPENDENT BROADCASTERS IN
THE COUNTRY.  BUT SOME BALANCED ACCOUNTS OF THE PROTEST MOVEMENT
ARE GETTING THROUGH HERE, WITH MANY RAZANJ RESIDENTS WATCHING
TELEVISED REPORTS ON THE SITUATION BEAMED FROM NEIGHBORING
BULGARIA.
<P>NO ONE UNDER SIXTY BELIEVES THE RHETORIC ON SERBIAN TEEVEE, SAYS
A LOCAL MUNICIPAL WORKER.  HE QUICKLY ADDS THAT HE HAS NO RESPECT
FOR THE COUNTRY'S OPPOSITION POLITICIANS, BUT HE SAYS HE DOES
SYMPATHIZE WITH THE DEMONSTRATORS BECAUSE THE RULING SOCIALISTS
HAVE LOST ALL CREDIBILITY.
<P>I HAVE NOT BEEN PAID FOR THREE MONTHS, SAYS THE WORKER.  AND THE
ONLY HELP WE GOT FROM BELGRADE, HE ADDS, WAS A SHIPMENT OF
PENCILS EMBLAZONED WITH SOCIALIST PARTY SLOGANS.
<P>DISCONTENT OVER SERBIA'S ECONOMIC WOES AND FALLING LIVING
STANDARDS IS RIFE HERE, NO MATTER WHAT LOCAL RESIDENTS THINK
ABOUT THE CURRENT PROTEST MOVEMENT.
<CENTER><H4>///DRAGAN ACT, IN SERBO-CROAT///</H4></CENTER>
<P>I AM NOT INTERESTED IN POLITICS, SAYS THIS MAN, BUT LIFE FOR
SERBIA'S POOR PEOPLE JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE.
<CENTER><H4>///DRAGAN ACT, IN SERBO-CROAT///</H4></CENTER>
<P>THERE IS GREAT INJUSTICE HERE, HE ADDS.  A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE
ARE GROWING RICH AT THE EXPENSE OF ALL THE REST.  THE MIDDLE
CLASS DOES NOT EXIST ANYMORE.  THERE ARE ONLY THE POOR AND THE
CORRUPT.  SO WHO KNOWS, HE ADDS, MAYBE THESE PROTESTS ARE
JUSTIFIED.
<P>BELGRADE'S ATTEMPTS TO RALLY ITS SUPPORTERS HAVE SO FAR MET WITH
ONLY LIMITED SUCCESS.
<P>EVEN THOUGH THE AUTHORITIES PROVIDE TRANSPORT, THE CROWDS AT
PRO-GOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATIONS HAVE BEEN FAR SMALLER THAN THOSE AT
THE OPPOSITION RALLIES.
<P>THE GOVERNMENT IS ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT ITS SILENT MAJORITY OF
SUPPORTERS, SAYS ONE OPPOSITION SYMPATHIZER.  BUT IT WAS REALLY A
HELPLESS MAJORITY, HE ADDS, AND IT NO LONGER SUPPORTS THIS
GOVERNMENT. (SIGNED)

<P><STRONG>INTRO</STRONG>: IRANIAN PRESIDENT HASHEMI RAFSANJANI HAS ENDED A FOUR-DAY
OFFICIAL VISIT TO TURKEY THAT HAS RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT TURKEY'S
RELATIONS WITH THE WEST.  FROM ANKARA, REPORTER AMBERIN ZAMAN HAS
THE DETAILS.
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:  IT WAS THE IRANIAN PRESIDENT'S THIRD VISIT TO TURKEY AND,
BY FAR, THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL.  OVER THE COURSE OF THE FOUR DAYS
HE SPENT TOURING TURKEY WITH A HUGE ENTOURAGE -- INCLUDING HIS
WIFE AND ALL HIS CHILDREN -- PRESIDENT RAFSANJANI MADE NO SECRET
OF HIS PLEASURE TURKEY IS NOW BEING RULED BY AN ISLAMIST-LED
COALITION.
<P>PRESIDENT RAFSANJANI DESCRIBES THE ISLAMIC MOVEMENT IN TURKEY AS
&quot;FLOURISHING" AND SAYS HE IS PLEASED AT THE NUMBER OF MOSQUES HE
HAD SEEN DURING HIS TRIP.
<P>MAINSTREAM TURKISH NEWSPAPERS SAY MOST TURKS ARE FIRMLY ATTACHED
TO THE SECULAR, PRO-WESTERN PRINCIPLES LAID DOWN BY THE FATHER OF
MODERN TURKEY, KEMAL ATATURK.
<P>OFFICIALS SAY TURKEY WILL BENEFIT FROM SEVERAL TRADE AGREEMENTS
PRODUCED BY THE RAFSANJANI VISIT.    THE TWO COUNTRIES UNDERTOOK
GRANTING EACH OTHER MOST-FAVORED-TRADING-NATION STATUS AND
ESTABLISHING A JOINT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.  THEY HOPE TO
EVENTUALLY DOUBLE THEIR VOLUME OF TRADE TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS.
IRAN HAS ALSO PLEDGED TO FACILITATE TURKEY'S LAND ACCESS LAND TO
CENTRAL ASIA AND AZERBAIJAN.
<P>THE NEW ECONOMIC TIES COME AT A TIME WHEN THE UNITED STATES IS
TRYING TO ISOLATE TEHERAN -- BOTH POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY.
FOR THAT REASON, ANALYSTS SAY IT IS HARDLY SURPRISING WASHINGTON
HAS OPENLY EXPRESSED DISPLEASURE OVER THE COURSE TURKEY'S NEW
PRO-ISLAMIC GOVERNMENT IS TAKING.
<P>BUT TURKISH OFFICIALS COUNTER IMPROVED ECONOMIC TIES WITH IRAN
ARE CLEARLY IN TURKEY'S INTEREST AND THAT THIS DOES NOT REFLECT
CHANGE IN TURKEY'S FUNDAMENTALLY-PRO-WESTERN STANCE.
<P>MANY TURKISH OFFICIALS ALSO BELIEVE STRONGER COMMERCIAL TIES
BETWEEN TURKEY AND IRAN WILL HELP DISCOURAGE TEHERAN FROM
SUPPORTING REBELS OF THE SEPARATIST KURDISTAN WORKERS' PARTY.
THE REBELS HAVE BEEN WAGING A 12-YEAR ARMED CAMPAIGN FOR AN
INDEPENDENT KURDISH STATE AND ARE WIDELY BELIEVED TO HAVE BASES
IN IRAN, IRAQ AND SYRIA.  (SIGNED)

<P><STRONG>INTRO</STRONG>:   TERRORISM IN PERU AND MORE PROBLEMS IN RUSSIA'S
         BREAKAWAY CHECHNYA REGION ARE AMONG THE MANY EDITORIAL
         TOPICS DISCUSSED IN TODAY'S U-S NEWSPAPERS. OTHER
         SUBJECTS GETTING A LOOK ARE: A NEW CONTENT RATINGS
         SCHEME FOR TELEVISION PROGRAMS; ISRAELI SETTLEMENT
         POLICY CHANGES; ANOTHER COUNTERSPY UNMASKED, AND
         TEXACO'S INSTITUTIONAL RE-BIRTH.  NOW, HERE WITH A QUOTE
         OR TWO IS __________________AND THE U-S EDITORIAL
         DIGEST.
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    TODAY'S WASHINGTON TIMES IS WATCHING DEVELOPMENTS AT THE
         JAPANESE AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE IN LIMA, PERU, TAKEN
         OVER BY TUPAC AMARU TERRORISTS, WHERE ABOUT 400
         DIPLOMATS AND OTHERS ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE.  THE PAPER
         SAYS IN PART:
<P><STRONG>VOICE</STRONG>:   &quot;THE BIGGEST ITEM ON THE TERRORISTS' AGENDA IS THE
         RELEASE OF HUNDREDS OF THEIR COMRADES HELD IN PRISON.
         BUT ALONG WITH THAT, THEY ARE DEMANDING NOTHING LESS
         THAN A TOTAL CHANGE IN THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC MAKEUP
         OF PERU, ALONG WITH THE OUSTER OF MR. FUJIMORI... UNTIL
         RECENTLY MR. FUJIMORI WAS CLAIMING VICTORY OVER
         MARXIST-TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS IN PERU.  UNFORTUNATELY,
         IT SEEMS, HE SPOKE TOO SOON.&quot;
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    THE WASHINGTON POST TODAY DECRIES ACTS OF TERRORISM BOTH
         IN LIMA AND RUSSIA'S CHECHNYA REGION, WHERE SIX RED
         CROSS WORKERS WERE SHOT TO DEATH IN THEIR SLEEP INSIDE A
         RED CROSS HOSPITAL. SAYS THE POST:
<P><STRONG>VOICE</STRONG>:   &quot;IT'S A LONG WAY, AND NOT ONLY IN MILES, FROM THE
         PRIVATIONS AND DANGER OF A PRIMITIVE VILLAGE HOSPITAL IN
         CHECHNYA TO A GLITTERING RECEPTION AT THE JAPANESE
         EMBASSY IN LIMA, PERU.  BUT THE TWO LOCATIONS WERE SADLY
         UNITED THIS WEEK AS INNOCENT PEOPLE BECAME VICTIMS OF
         TERROR.  IT IS IN THE NATURE OF TERRORISM, OF COURSE, TO
         CHOOSE THE MOST BLAMELESS AND DEFENSELESS AS TARGETS...
         THE FURY UNLEASHED BY A WAR AS SAVAGE AS THAT WAGED BY
         THE RUSSIANS AGAINST CHECHNYA CANNOT BE EASILY RETHERED.
         THE MESSAGE OF THE TUPAC AMARU REBELS ... IN PERU MAY BE
         CLEARER.  THESE ARE RUTHLESS MARXIST REVOLUTIONARIES
         SEEKING TO REVIVE THEIR FADING MOVEMENT... THE EFFECT OF
         THEIR CRIME, NO MATTER HOW IT TURNS OUT, WILL BE TO
         DISCOURAGE FOREIGN INVESTMENT, THUS DEEPENING THE
         POVERTY AND INEQUALITY THAT FEED MOVEMENTS SUCH AS
         THEIR'S.&quot;
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    AND ONE LAST WORD ON THE PERUVIAN SITUATION FROM THE
         PORTLAND [MAINE] PRESS HERALD:
<P><STRONG>VOICE</STRONG>:   &quot;THE TERRORISTS CLAIM TO SPEAK FOR THAT HALF OF PERU'S
         POPULATION THAT IS QUECHUA AND AYMARA INDIAN, BUT IT IS
         THE INDIANS, IN FACT, WHO SUFFER MOST FROM THE TERROR.
         THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT BRINGS DISHONOR ON THE INDIAN
         LEADER FOR WHOM IT IS NAMED.  SLAUGHTERING MORE
         INNOCENTS WILL ONLY ADD TO THAT DISHONOR.&quot;
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    A FAVORITE DOMESTIC TOPIC TODAY IS THE NEW TELEVISION
         RATINGS SYSTEM UNVEILED YESTERDAY TO HELP PARENTS GUARD
         THEIR CHILDREN AGAINST UNDUE SEX, VIOLENCE AND ROUGH
         LANGUAGE ON TELEVISION.  SAYS THE LOS ANGELES TIMES:
<P><STRONG>VOICE</STRONG>:   &quot;MODELED AFTER THE MOTION PICTURE RATINGS SYSTEM ...
         DEVISED IN 1968 TO PREVENT STATES FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE
         OF A SUPREME COURT RULING PERMITTING THEM TO ESSENTIALLY
         CENSOR MOVIES BASED ON LOCAL STANDARDS... [THE] PROPOSAL
         WOULD RATE SHOWS ON THE BASIS OF AGE LEVELS OF CHILD
         VIEWERS... WHILE THE NEW SYSTEM IS BETTER THAN WHAT
         EXISTS NOW  --  LARGELY NOTHING - - IT STILL FALLS SHORT

<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    THE ARREST OF A TRUSTED, VETERAN F-B-I AGENTS AS AN

<P><STRONG>VOICE</STRONG>:   &quot;IT WOULD BE UNREALISTIC AND NAIVE TO EXPECT THE UNITED
         STATES AND RUSSIA TO CEASE ALL SPYING ON EACH OTHER ...
         [BUT] AT A TIME WHEN THE UNITED STATES IS ASSISTING
         RUSSIA WITH THE DISMANTLING OF ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS,
         BUYING HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM FROM RUSSIAN WARHEADS AND
         SUPPORTING INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO MOSCOW,
         IT IS BAFFLING THAT THE C-I-A AND ITS RUSSIAN
         COUNTERPART ARE STILL TRYING TO OUTFOX [OUTMANEUVER] ONE
         ANOTHER AS IF THE COLD WAR HAD NOT ENDED.  THE GAME

<P><STRONG>VOICE</STRONG>:   &quot;MEXICO IS NOT DOING VERY WELL ... FOR IT, POLITICAL
         REFORM OPENS A WAY FOR THE EXPRESSION OF THE EXISTING

         MEXICO, NONETHELESS, IS A VALUE THAT CANNOT BE DENIED.
         IT IS COMING, AND MEXICAN POLITICIANS WHO REACH FOR THE

<P><STRONG>INTRO</STRONG>:   THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION -- OR NATO -- IS
         TRYING TO REDEFINE ITS ROLE IN A CHANGING WORLD
         ENVIRONMENT  NO  LONGER POLARIZED BY SUPER-POWER
         RIVALRY. IN THIS REPORT FROM LONDON, V-O-A'S ANDRE DE
         NESNERA LOOKS AT NATO'S UPCOMING CHALLENGES AS IT MOVES
         TO ENLARGE ITS MEMBERSHIP TO INCLUDE EAST AND CENTRAL
         EUROPEAN COUNTRIES FORMERLY PART OF THE SOVIET BLOC.
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION -- OR NATO -- WAS
         CREATED SHORTLY AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR AS A WESTERN
         MILITARY ALLIANCE AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION. AT THAT TIME
         NATO'S ROLE WAS CLEARLY DEFINED -- PROVIDE ITS MEMBERS
         WITH DEFENSIVE CAPABILITIES IN THE EVENT OF A SOVIET
         ATTACK.
<P>BUT THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE SOVIET UNION COUPLED WITH
         THE DISSOLUTION OF ITS NATO EQUIVALENT -- THE WARSAW
         PACT -- HAS FORCED THE 16-MEMBER WESTERN ALLIANCE INTO
         WHAT DEFENSE EXPERTS CALL A &quot;RETHINK" -- IN OTHER WORDS
         A REDEFINITION OF ITS ROLE NOW THAT ITS ARCH-ENEMY  NO
         LONGER EXISTS.
<P>EUROPEAN DEFENSE EXPERTS SAY NATO HAS HAD A TOUGH TIME
         REINVENTING ITSELF AND SOON AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF
         COMMUNISM, IT SEEMED TO DRIFT. THEY SAY THE CATALYST HAS
         BEEN THE EXPERIENCE IN BOSNIA, SHOWING NATO CAN BE
         FLEXIBLE AND ADAPT TO PEACE-KEEPING OPERATIONS --
         SOMETHING THE UNITED NATIONS WAS UNABLE TO DO.
<P>NATO'S CHIEF SPOKESMAN, JAMIE SHEA, SAYS THE
         ORGANIZATION'S ROLE IN BOSNIA WAS MILITARILY A SUCCESS
         IN TERMS OF STOPPING THE WAR.
TAPE :   CUT # 1     -     SHEA
         &quot;WE HAVE MANAGED TO DO THAT: SEPARATING THE FORCES,
         HANDING OVER THE TERRITORY, CREATING THE ZONE OF
         SEPARATION, DEMOBILIZING THE FORCES, SO THAT TODAY THE
         PROSPECT OF WAR IS QUITE REMOTE. BUT OF COURSE,
         UNFORTUNATELY FOR US AND FOR THE INTERNATIONAL
         COMMUNITY, THERE IS MORE THAN CREATING PEACE THAN IN
         STOPPING A CONFLICT. THERE IS A WHOLE ELEMENT OF
         RECONSTRUCTION AND RECONCILIATION THAT HAS TO TAKE PLACE
         AND UNFORTUNATELY, AS YOU WELL KNOW, WE ARE FINDING OUT
         THAT GIVEN THE HATREDS AND BITTERNESS THAT REMAIN, THIS
         IS PROVING A VERY, VERY SLOW AND FRUSTRATING JOB,
         INDEED. AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY INSTEAD OF
         LEAVING NOW AS WE HAD ORIGINALLY PLANNED TO DO, NATO IS
         GOING TO STAY ON FOR A FURTHER 18 MONTHS.&quot;
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    THE NEW NATO CONTINGENT WILL HAVE 30-THOUSAND TROOPS --
         HALF THE NUMBER CURRENTLY IN BOSNIA.
<P>IN ADDITION TO FACING THE MILITARY CHALLENGES IN THE
         FORMER YUGOSLAVIA, NATO IS MOVING POLITICALLY INTO
         UNCHARTERED WATERS. THE ALLIANCE PLANS TO EXPAND ITS
         MEMBERSHIP TO INCLUDE COUNTRIES IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN
         EUROPE -- COUNTRIES FORMERLY PART OF THE SOVIET BLOCK.
<P>A FIRST GROUP OF NATIONS IS EXPECTED TO BE INVITED TO
         JOIN NATO DURING THE ORGANIZATION'S SUMMIT NEXT JULY.
         DEFENSE EXPERTS BELIEVE THE GROUP WILL INCLUDE POLAND,
         HUNGARY AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC -- AND MAYBE EITHER
         SLOVAKIA OR SLOVENIA.
<P>NATO'S EXPANSION EASTWARDS IS STRONGLY OPPOSED BY THE
         RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT.  PRIME MINISTER VIKTOR CHERNOMYRDIN
         -- SPEAKING THROUGH AN INTERPRETER -- MADE THAT CLEAR
         DURING A RECENT SUMMIT OF EUROPEAN LEADERS IN LISBON,
         PORTUGAL.
<P><STRONG>TAPE</STRONG>:    CUT # 2     -     CHERNOMYRDIN
         &quot;WE HAVE CLEARLY STATED, AND WE STATE ONCE AGAIN, THAT
         WE ARE FIRMLY OPPOSED TO PLANS TO MOVE UP TO OUR
         TERRITORY THE NORTH ATLANTIC ALLIANCE AND ITS MILITARY
         INFRASTRUCTURE. IT IS SURELY OBVIOUS THAT THE EMERGENCE
         IN EUROPE OF NEW LINES OF DIVISION WOULD LEAD TO A
         WORSENING OF THE ENTIRE GEO-POLITICAL SITUATION OF THE
         WORLD.&quot;
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    MANY WESTERN DEFENSE EXPERTS BELIEVE RUSSIA'S OPPOSITION
         TO NATO ENLARGEMENT IS IN PART DUE TO LINGERING COLD WAR
         PERCEPTIONS.  PAUL BEAVER, SENIOR DEFENSE ANALYST WITH
         THE BRITISH PUBLICATION &quot;JANE'S DEFENSE WEEKLY",
         EXPLAINS.
<P><STRONG>TAPE</STRONG>:    CUT # 3     -     BEAVER
         &quot;I AM AFRAID THAT MOST OF THE RUSSIAN MILITARY AND
         KREMLIN FIGURES HAVE  NOT  YET GOT OVER THE FACT THAT
         RUSSIA IS  NOT  THE SOVIET UNION. THEY STILL BELIEVE
         THAT THEY ARE A MIGHTY WORLD POWER.  YOU JUST HAVE TO
         LOOK AT THE COMPLETE DEBACLE OF THEIR OPERATION IN
         CHECHNYA TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE RUSSIAN MILITARY IS  NOT
         WHAT IT USED TO BE.  IT IS STILL IMPORTANT, WE SHOULD
         NOT  BY ANY MEANS DISCARD THEM -AND WE MUST ALSO GIVE
         THE RUSSIANS THE CREDIT AND I THINK WE MUST UNDERSTAND
         THEIR POSITION. BUT THE RUSSIANS FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT
         NATO IS AN OFFENSIVE ORGANIZATION.  IT IS  NOT. I THINK
         IT HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT OVER THE LAST 47 YEARS  -- IT
         IS DEFINITELY WITHOUT DOUBT A DEFENSIVE ORGANIZATION.&quot;
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    MR. BEAVER SAYS RUSSIAN OFFICIALS ALSO SEE NATO
         ENLARGEMENT AS BRINGING ABOUT A NEW IRON CURTAIN IN
         EUROPE.
<P>FRANCOIS HEISBOURG -- NATO EXPERT WITH THE LONDON-BASED
         INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES -- SAYS
         RUSSIA'S OPPOSITION TO NATO ENLARGEMENT MAY BE PARTLY
         DUE TO PSYCHOLOGICAL REASONS.
<P><STRONG>TAPE</STRONG>:    CUT # 4     -     HEISBOURG
         &quot;PRACTICALLY THE WHOLE RUSSIAN BODY POLITIC CONSIDERS
         THIS AS A HUMILIATING SETBACK FOR RUSSIA.  SO WHAT I
         FEAR IS  NOT  THE SHORT-TERM CONSEQUENCES WHICH WILL BE
         VERY WEAK, BUT THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES THAT THIS WILL
         NOURISH A 'VERSAILLES TREATY TYPE SYNDROME' IN RUSSIA
         WHICH WILL COME BACK AND HAUNT US IN FIVE, TEN OR 15
         YEARS TIME.  THAT IS MY CONCERN -- AND IT IS VERY
         DIFFICULT TO FIND ANY RUSSIAN OF POLITICAL SUBSTANCE WHO
         WILL SAY OTHERWISE.&quot;
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    MANY DEFENSE ANALYSTS SAY NATO'S ENLARGEMENT IS
         INEVITABLE AND WILL COME ABOUT SOONER OR LATER WHETHER
         RUSSIA WANTS IT OR  NOT.  CHIEF NATO SPOKESMAN JAMIE
         SHEA SAYS NATO HAS  NO  CHOICE BUT TO EXPAND BECAUSE
         FORMER SOVIET BLOC COUNTRIES ARE DEMANDING TO JOIN.
<P><STRONG>TAPE</STRONG>:    CUT # 5     -     SHEA
         &quot;TODAY, THE RATIONALE FOR ENLARGING NATO IS  NOT BECAUSE
         WE WANT TO EXPAND, BUT BECAUSE THE COUNTRIES OF THE EAST
         WANT TO GO WEST -- THEY WANT TO JOIN US IN THE WEST. IT
         IS BEING DONE MORE FOR POLITICAL AND SOCIAL REASONS IN
         TERMS OF UNDERPINNING DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC REFORM AND
         A SENSE OF BELONGING RATHER THAN FOR STRATEGIC REASONS.
         THANK GOD: THAT IS THE SIGN OF THE NEW EUROPE WE ARE IN.
         SO AS A RESULT, UNLIKE IN THE PAST, ENLARGEMENT OF NATO
         DOES  NOT  HAVE TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE SAME MILITARY
         CONSEQUENCES OF DEPLOYING FORCES, BUILDING BARRACKS AND
         BASES, HAVING HUGE EXERCISES OR DEPLOYING NUCLEAR
         WEAPONS.&quot;
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    IN AN EFFORT TO REASSURE THE RUSSIANS, NATO HAS OFFERED
         TO BEGIN DISCUSSIONS WITH MOSCOW ON A DOCUMENT SPELLING
         OUT A NEW SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NATO AND RUSSIA.
         NATO MINISTERS HAVE ALSO PLEDGED  NOT  TO STATION ANY
         NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON THE TERRITORIES OF NEW MEMBER STATES.
<P>DEFENSE ANALYST PAUL BEAVER SAYS THAT PLEDGE IS PURELY
         SYMBOLIC BECAUSE NATO RELIES ESSENTIALLY ON
         SUBMARINE-BASED NUCLEAR MISSILES FOR ITS DEFENSE.
<P><STRONG>TAPE</STRONG>:    CUT # 6     -     BEAVER
         &quot;TACTICAL, GROUND-BASED NUCLEAR WEAPONS LIKE CRUISE
         MISSILES ARE OUT OF VOGUE ANYWAY - NOBODY HAS GOT THEM
         ANYMORE. NOW THERE ARE VERY FEW ARTILLERY SHELLS. THE
         RUSSIANS MAY HAVE HUNDREDS OF THEM, THOUSANDS OF THEM
         STORED AWAY -- NATO DOES  NOT. NATO HAS GONE PAST THAT.
         ANYWAY, IT DOES  NOT  NEED TO: IT HAS GOT TRIDENT
         SUBMARINES - THE BRITISH AND THE AMERICAN DETERRENT AND
         THE FRENCH AS WELL HAVE GOT POWERFUL SUBMARINES. THEY DO
         NOT  ACTUALLY NEED THIS STUFF ON THE LAND ANYMORE. SO
         THERE IS ABSOLUTELY  NO  POINT IN HAVING IT THERE.&quot;
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    NEW MEMBERS WILL BE INVITED TO JOIN NATO NEXT JULY AND
         WILL OFFICIALLY BECOME PART OF THE WESTERN ALLIANCE IN
         APRIL 1999 MARKING NATO'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY.  WHILE
         AGREEING THAT NATO EXPANSION IS INEVITABLE, SOME DEFENSE
         ANALYSTS BELIEVE THE PACE IS TOO FAST.
<P>FRANCOIS HEISBOURG -- FROM LONDON'S INTERNATIONAL
         INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES -- SAYS THE WEST MAY
         HAVE RAISED ENORMOUS EXPECTATIONS AMONG THOSE COUNTRIES
         WANTING TO JOIN.
<P><STRONG>TAPE</STRONG>:    CUT # 7     -     HEISBOURG
         &quot;IT WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS DISAPPOINTMENT TO POLAND,
         HUNGARY, THE CZECH REPUBLIC AND A FEW OTHERS IF THE WEST
         WERE ALL OF A SUDDEN TO SIGNAL A SLOWING DOWN IN THE
         PACE -- AND INDEED THAT WOULD BE A MAJOR DOWN SIDE IN
         TERMS OF RELATIONS WITH THE NEW DEMOCRACIES. THAT BEING
         SAID, IF PRESIDENT CLINTON, NOW THAT HE HAS THE
         ELECTIONS BEHIND HIM, DECIDED THAT AFTER ALL MAYBE 1999
         IS  NOT  A DATE CAST IN STONE, I AM QUITE CONVINCED THAT
         IN PARIS, IN LONDON AND EVEN IN BONN, THERE WILL BE A
         COLLECTIVE SIGH OF RELIEF AND THERE WILL BE  NO
         COMPLAINING BY THOSE GOVERNMENTS ABOUT THE SLOWING DOWN
         OF THE PACE.&quot;
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    EXPERTS AGREE NATO FACES A DIFFICULT TASK AS MOMENTUM
         BUILDS TO MAKE ENLARGEMENT IRREVERSIBLE. THEY SAY NATO
         MUST CONVINCE NEW MEMBER STATES IT IS SERIOUS ABOUT
         DEFENDING THEM IF THE NEED ARISES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME
         REASSURE RUSSIA THAT ENLARGEMENT POSES  NO  THREAT TO
         MOSCOW'S INTERESTS. AS ONE EXPERT PUT IT: &quot;NATO IS FACED
         WITH A DELICATE BALANCING ACT.&quot; (SIGNED)

VOA'S DOUGLAS ROBERTS IN BELGRADE REPORTS SERBIAN OFFICIALS
INDICATE THEY MIGHT AGREE TO A NEW ROUND OF VOTING, BUT THE
RESPONSE FROM OPPOSITION LEADERS IS NOT YET CLEAR.
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:   IT WAS PRESIDENT MILOSEVIC WHO INVITED THE O-S-C-E
MISSION  HERE, SAYING HE WANTS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO
LEARN THE TRUTH ABOUT LAST MONTH'S MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.  ON THAT
ONE POINT, AT LEAST, MR. MILOSEVIC AND THE OPPOSITION LEADERS
AGREE.
THE &quot;ZAJEDNO" COALITION OF OPPOSITION PARTIES SAYS IT WILL GIVE
THE O-S-C-E DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF ITS ELECTION VICTORIES IN
MORE THAN A DOZEN OF SERBIA'S MAIN TOWNS AND CITIES -- INCLUDING
BELGRADE.
<P>THE GOVERNMENT ANNULLED THE RESULTS, CITING IRREGULARITIES,
TOUCHING OFF THE MASS DEMONSTRATIONS BY OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS AND
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, NOW IN THEIR FIFTH WEEK.

<P>SERBIAN OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO DENY THE CHARGES OF ELECTORAL

<P>O-S-C-E OFFICIALS SAY THEY WILL EXAMINE ALL RELEVANT DOCUMENTS,
BUT THEY HAVE INDICATED THE MISSION WILL  NOT  TRY TO MAKE A
DEFINITIVE JUDGMENT ABOUT NOVEMBER'S VOTING.
<P>SOME EUROPEAN OFFICIALS HAVE SUGGESTED IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT THE
MISSION WILL RECOMMEND A NEW ROUND OF ELECTIONS, MONITORED BY THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  AT A NEWS CONFERENCE HERE THURSDAY,
FOREIGN MINISTER MILAN MILUTINOVIC SAID BELGRADE WILL CONSIDER
ANY SUGGESTION, INCLUDING NEW  ELECTIONS.  BUT HE SAID THE
GOVERNMENT WILL  NOT  BE BOUND BY THE O-S-C-E RECOMMENDATIONS.
<P>OPPOSITION LEADERS HAVE  NOT  YET EXPLICITLY DEFINED THEIR
POSITION ON A POTENTIAL NEW ROUND OF VOTING.  BUT THEY HAVE SAID
THAT THE O-S-C-E'S RECOMMENDATIONS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED MANDATORY
FOR THE SERBIAN GOVERNMENT.
<P>AMID THE ONGOING CONFRONTATION, SERBIA'S STATE-CONTROLLED MEDIA
IS CONTINUING A VITRIOLIC CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE OPPOSITION.  IN A
COMMENTARY PUBLISHED HERE FRIDAY, THE SERBIAN PRESIDENT'S

IS FOMENTING CIVIL WAR, AND TRYING TO PROVOKE FOREIGN

THE GOVERNMENT IS PREPARING TO CRACK DOWN ON THE PROTESTERS.
OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, THE RULING SOCIALIST PARTY HAS BEGUN TO
ORGANIZE COUNTER DEMONSTRATIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT.
AND SOME OPPOSITION OFFICIALS SAY THEY FEAR THE AUTHORITIES MAY
ATTEMPT TO ORCHESTRATE CLASHES BETWEEN THE RIVAL GROUPS OF
PROTESTERS, TO JUSTIFY INTERVENTION BY THE SECURITY FORCES.
<P>SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SAY THE POLICE WILL  NOT  INTERVENE,

<P><STRONG>INTRO</STRONG>:  U-S DEFENSE SECRETARY WILLIAM PERRY SAYS THE ARREST OF
INDICTED WAR CRIMES SUSPECTS IS CRITICAL TO HOPES FOR LONG-TERM
PEACE IN BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA.  THE UNITED STATES AND ITS NATO
PARTNERS ARE DISCUSSING FORMATION OF A SPECIAL POLICE FORCE TO
HUNT DOWN AND ARREST THEM.  V-O-A'S DAVID GOLLUST HAS DETAILS
FROM THE PENTAGON.
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:  THE ISSUE OF THE PROPOSED POLICE FORCE FIGURED HEAVILY IN
THE DISCUSSIONS AT THIS WEEK'S NATO DEFENSE MINISTERS MEETING IN
BRUSSELS. AND MR. PERRY SAYS THE DEFENSE CHIEFS BELIEVE IT IS
&quot;CRITICALLY IMPORTANT" TO LONG-TERM PEACE IN BOSNIA TO BRING THE
INDICTED WAR CRIMINALS TO JUSTICE.
<P>ONLY A HANDFUL OF THE MORE THAN 70 PEOPLE INDICTED FOR WAR CRIMES
DURING THE BOSNIAN WAR HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN HANDED OVER OR
SURRENDERED TO THE U-N WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL IN THE HAGUE.
<P>IN A TALK WITH REPOPTERS HERE, MR. PERRY SAID NATO MINISTERS ALL
AGREE THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND THAT THEY WOULD -- AS HE PUT IT --
&quot;MORE THAN JUST URGE" THEIR RESPECTIVE GOVERNMENTS TO CREATE THE
SPECIAL POLICE FORCE.
<P>THE DEFENSE SECRETARY SAID THE ISSUE IS UNDER STUDY BY AN
INTER-AGENCY TEAM IN WASHINGTON, BUT DECLINED TO GIVE DETAILS ON
HOW THE POLICE FORCE MIGHT BE SET UP OR WHAT THE AMERICAN ROLE
MIGHT BE.
<P>AT THE WHITE HOUSE, SPOKESMAN MIKE MCCURRY SAID THE
ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THERE SHOULD BE AN &quot;ENHANCED EFFORT" TO
FULFILL OBLIGATIONS TO THE WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL. BUT HE SAID THE
APPREHENSION OF SUSPECTS SHOULD NOT BE A JOB FOR THE NEW NATO-LED
STABILIZATION FORCE IN BOSNIA, KNOWN AS S-FOR:
<CENTER><H4>/// MCCURRY ACTUALITY ///</H4></CENTER>
<P>THAT IS NOT A MISSION OBJECTIVE OF THE STABILIZATION
         FORCE THAT NOW, AS OF TODAY, TAKES OVER SOME OF THE WORK
         THAT'S GOING ON IN BOSNIA.  BUT THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL
         DISCUSSIONS OF HOW TO MAKE MORE EFFECTIVE THE EFFORT TO
         BRING TO PROSECUTION THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR WAR CRIMES.
<CENTER><H4>/// END ACT ///</H4></CENTER>
<P>U-S OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THE POLICE FORCE COULD BE A PART OF THE
WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL AT THE HAGUE OR UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE
EUROPEAN UNION OR THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION
IN EUROPE.
<P>MR. PERRY SAID ANY POLICE OPERATION WOULD, BY NECESSITY, WORK
CLOSELY WITH S-FOR, WHICH WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH CIVIL UNREST
THAT MIGHT BE UNLEASHED BY EFFORTS TO HUNT DOWN THE WAR CRIMES
SUSPECTS.
<P>THE MOST PROMINENT OF THOSE INDICTED ARE FORMER BOSNIAN SERB
LEADER RADOVAN KARADZIC AND HIS FORMER MILITARY CHIEF, RATKO
MLADIC -- BOTH OF WHOM RETAIN BROAD PUBLIC SUPPORT AND MOVE ABOUT
FREELY IN THE SERB-CONTROLLED AREAS OF THE COUNTRY. (SIGNED)

         LAST MONTH [11/17/96], ACCORDING TO MANY POLITICAL

         EAST EUROPEAN SPECIALIST DANIEL NELSON, WHO JUST
         RETURNED FROM ROMANIA, AND WITH EAST EUROPEAN ANALYST
         DAVID BINDER [BYN-DER] ABOUT THE 1989 REVOLUTION IN
         RETROSPECT.  ________ HAS A REPORT, AS ROMANIA
         CELEBRATES THE BEGINNING OF A NON-COMMUNIST ERA.
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    DANIEL NELSON, PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES AT OLD
         DOMINION UNIVERSITY IN VIRGINIA, SAYS THE POPULAR
         CHARACTERIZATION OF THE RECENT ELECTION OF ROMANIA'S
         FIRST NON-COMMUNIST PRESIDENT AS A COMPLETION OF THE
         REVOLUTION OF 1989 IS AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION.
TAPE A:  CUT ONE -- NELSON (1:14)
         &quot;THE EVENTS IN 1989 WERE VERY, VERY SIGNIFICANT IN
         ROMANIA AND SHOULDN'T BE CONSIDERED ONLY HALF OF THE
         CHANGE, GIVEN FROM WHENCE ROMANIA WAS COMING.  ONE OF
         THE PROBLEMS WITH THESE COMPARISONS IS THE FAILURE TO
         RECOGNIZE THAT ROMANIA, AND I MIGHT ADD BULGARIA AND
         ALBANIA, HAD HAD NONE OF THE PRIOR CHANGES THAT WERE
         EVIDENT IN MUCH OF THE REST OF EASTERN EUROPE.  THERE
         WAS OF COURSE SOLIDARITY IN POLAND.  AND THERE WERE
         WORKERS' UPRISINGS IN THE EASTERN PART OF GERMANY IN
         '53.  AND, OF COURSE, THE PRAGUE SPRING AND CHARTER 77
         [IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA] AND 'GOULASH COMMUNISM' AND JANOS
         KADAR FOR MANY YEARS IN HUNGARY.  SO TO COMPARE THEM
         WITH ROMANIA'S CHANGE IN 1989 WOULD BE VERY MISTAKEN.
         IT WOULD BE VERY UNFAIR TO SAY THAT 'ROMANIA ONLY
         CHANGED A LITTLE BIT -- HALFWAY -- IN 1989.'  FOR
         ROMANIA IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE.  [OPT] EVEN IN
         POLAND, HUNGARY, AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC, THE PROCESSES
         OF TRANSFORMATION CAN'T BE SAID TO HAVE BEEN COMPLETED
         SUDDENLY IN 1989. THEY'RE STILL STRUGGLING WITH
         DEVELOPING POLITICAL PARTIES, COMPLETING PRIVATIZATION.
         ROMANIA MAY BE A LITTLE FURTHER BEHIND IN THIS, BUT
         THAT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T CHANGE A LOT IN 1989.
         IT'S RATHER THAT THEY HAD A MUCH STEEPER CLIMB AND A LOT
         FURTHER TO GO.&quot; [END OPT]
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    &quot;NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTER DAVID BINDER HAS BEEN
         TRAVELING TO ROMANIA SINCE 1963.  HE SAYS HE SEES THE
         EVENTS OF THE PAST SEVEN YEARS AS MORE EVOLUTIONARY THAN
         REVOLUTIONARY.
TAPE A:  CUT TWO -- BINDER (1:04)
         &quot;I WAS THERE JUST AFTER THE ROMANIANS MARCHED IN
         TIMISOARA AND THEN MARCHED IN BUCHAREST AND SOME OTHER
         CITIES AND WERE FIRED UPON BY MILITARY AND SECURITATE
         FORCES.  AND I'M A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH PHRASES
         LIKE 'REVOLUTION,'  BUT IT CERTAINLY WAS AN UPRISING OF
         ALMOST NATIONWIDE PROPORTIONS. BUT THE IDEA THAT ONLY
         NOW IS THE REVOLUTION COMPLETED, I JUST FIND THAT
         SOMEWHAT AN OVERDRAMATIZED DESCRIPTION.  THE GOVERNMENT
         RUN BY ION ILIESCU FROM THE MOMENT CEAUCESCU LEFT THE
         CENTRAL COMMITTEE BUILDING IN DECEMBER 1989 WAS FROM THE
         BEGINNING A TRANSITION GOVERNMENT. THE ONLY QUESTION WAS
         HOW LONG THE TRANSITION WOULD LAST.  [OPT]  AND YOU HAVE
         TO KEEP IN MIND THAT AT THE TIME THAT CEAUCESCU FELL, OR
         WAS DRIVEN FROM POWER BY THE PEOPLE IN THE STREETS, THAT
         THE OTHER POLITICAL FORCES OF ROMANIA HAD BEEN ALMOST
         EXTINGUISHED, THAT THEY WERE PRACTICALLY NON-EXISTENT.
         SO THE COMMUNISTS TURNED SOCIALISTS TURNED, QUOTE,
         'DEMOCRATS,' UNQUOTE, WERE SORT OF THE NATURAL
         SUCCESSORS OF CEAUCESCU.&quot; [END OPT]
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    DAVID BINDER SAYS THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN ALL THE
         COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE WAS THAT THE
         COMMUNIST SYSTEM SIMPLY COLLAPSED, SOMETIMES WITH THE
         HELP OF A PUSH FROM THE STREETS.  HE SEES THE FALL OF
         CEAUCESCU AS ONE IMPORTANT EVENT, IN A CHAIN OF MAJOR
         EVENTS, IN 1989.
TAPE B:  CUT THREE -- BINDER (1:03)
         &quot;IT WAS A GREAT MOMENT IN ROMANIAN HISTORY, AND IT WAS A
         VERY CONFUSING MOMENT.  AND THERE HAVE BEEN CHARGES EVER
         SINCE THEN THAT THE PEOPLE WHO SUCCEEDED CEAUCESCU AND
         HIS PEOPLE AND THE SECURITATE OF THAT TIME STOLE THE
         SO-CALLED 'REVOLUTION' FROM THE PEOPLE WHO HAD BROUGHT
         ABOUT HIS DOWNFALL BY MARCHING AGAINST HIM IN THE
         STREETS.  I DON'T SEE IT IN THAT SIMPLISTIC A FASHION.
         I THINK THAT HISTORY TENDS TO MOVE, NOT IN SUDDEN FLOODS
         OF RIVERS, BUT RATHER IN A SLOW, STEADY FLOW, AND WHAT
         WE SAW HAPPENING IN DECEMBER 1989 AND THEREAFTER WAS A
         MOMENTARY QUICKENING OF THE FLOW OF THE RIVER OF
         ROMANIAN HISTORY.  [OPT]  IT WAS NOT AS CATACLYSMIC AN
         EVENT AS IT IS PORTRAYED SOMETIMES.  AND WHAT HAD
         HAPPENED IN POLAND AND HUNGARY AND THEN CZECHOSLOVAKIA
         AND NEIGHBORING BULGARIA HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE
         ROMANIAN POPULACE. THEY WERE ABLE TO  SEE WHAT WAS GOING
         ON IN THOSE OTHER EAST EUROPEAN COMMUNIST COUNTRIES, AND
         THAT WAS AN INSPIRATION FOR THEM.&quot; [END OPT]
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    PROFESSOR DANIEL NELSON SAYS EMIL CONSTANTINESCU, THE
         NEW PRESIDENT OF ROMANIA AND FORMER RECTOR OF BUCHAREST
         UNIVERSITY, IS BOTH AN INTELLECTUAL AND A PRAGMATIC
         POLITICIAN.
TAPE A:  CUT FOUR -- NELSON (0:57)
         &quot;LLIESCU LOST A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE WORKER VOTE,
         AND HE LOST IT ON THE BASIS OF POLICIES, OR AT LEAST THE
         PERCEPTION OF POLICIES, THAT HE  HAD NOT HELPED THE
         WORKERS, SO THAT THEY VOTED ON THAT BASIS FOR A CHANGE.
         AND THIS WAS IN THAT SENSE NOT A PURELY INTELLECTUAL OR
         INTELLIGENSIA MOVEMENT -- BY NO MEANS. WHAT
         CONSTANTINESCU DID, BETWEEN 1990 AND NOW, WAS TO
         REPACKAGE HIMSELF, APPEAL TO A BROADER BASE OF VOTERS,
         AND SUCCESSFULLY SUGGEST THAT HE WOULD CARE FOR THEM AS
         ILIESCU HAD NOT.  SO THIS IS NOT ANYMORE AN INTELLECTUAL
         EVENT AND HAS A LOT OF MASS APPEAL. CONSTANTINESCU AND
         [ION] CIORBEA AND THE GOVERNMENT PROBABLY HAVE SIX
         MONTHS DURING WHICH TIME THERE WILL BE SOME POPULAR
         PATIENCE, BUT BY THIS TIME NEXT YEAR, I CAN GUARANTEE
         YOU THAT THE POPULATION AND PUNDITS IN ROMANIA WILL BE
         SAYING, 'WELL, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?'  AND I HOPE FOR
         ROMANIA THERE HAVE BEEN RESULTS.  BUT, PRINCIPALLY IN
         THE ECONOMIC DIRECTION, IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT.&quot;
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN ROMANIA HAS
         BEEN LARGELY ECLIPSED IN THE MEDIA BY WHAT'S HAPPENING
         ON THE STREETS OF BELGRADE AND BY COMPARISONS BETWEEN
         SERBIAN PRESIDENT SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC AND THE DEPOSED
         ROMANIAN DICTATOR CEAUCESCU.  PROFESSOR NELSON SAYS HE
         THINKS EAST EUROPEAN ANALYSTS SHOULD BE PAYING A LOT
         MORE ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN ROMANIA.
TAPE A:  CUT FIVE -- NELSON (0:44)
         &quot;THE REAL NEWS HERE IS THAT A COUNTRY THAT IS THE SECOND
         LARGEST IN THE BALTIC TO BOSPORUS CORRIDOR HAS VOTED
         OVERWHELMINGLY, HAS TURNED OUT, AND DECIDED FOR A CHANGE
         AND TRUSTED IN THE BALLOT BOX TO DO IT.  WHAT AN
         EXTRAORDINARY DEVELOPMENT!  HOW MAGNIFICENT,
         PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU COMPARE IT WITH THE BACKDROP,
         WHICH WAS A DESPICABLE DICTATORSHIP THAT LASTED A
         QUARTER OF A CENTURY, THAT OF CEAUCESCU, AND WAS A
         REGIME IN WHICH -- ALTHOUGH HE DIDN'T KILL A LOT OF
         PEOPLE -- MADE MOST OF THE PEOPLE WANT TO DIE.  IT WAS A
         TERRIBLE REGIME, AND OUT OF THAT HAS EMERGED
         NEVERTHELESS A PEOPLE THAT HOPE, THAT TRUST IN THE
         BALLOT BOX, AND SEE THE NEED FOR CHANGE AND MOVE IN A
         DIRECTION FAIRLY DECISIVELY.&quot;
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON, DANIEL NELSON SAYS, IS A
         WONDERFULLY AUSPICIOUS TIME FOR THE ROMANIAN PEOPLE.
TAPE A:  CUT SIX -- NELSON (0:52)
         &quot;THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY HOPEFUL MOMENT FOR ROMANIA.  IT
         IS HOPEFUL BECAUSE THE VOTING TURNOUT WAS HIGH, THE
         VOTING DECISION WAS CLEAR CUT, THE OLD GOVERNMENT HAS
         LEFT IN GOOD ORDER, THE NEW GOVERNMENT IS ENTERING WITH
         SUBSTANTIAL TRUST AND ANTICIPATION ON THE PART OF THE
         POPULATION.   FURTHER, IT'S HOPEFUL BECAUSE FOR THE
         FIRST TIME THERE'S DISCUSSION, SERIOUS DISCUSSION, OF
         ROMANIA'S ENTRY INTO NATO.  [OPT] IT'S CERTAINLY NOT
         GUARANTEED, BUT THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS IN THAT
         DIRECTION, AND OF COURSE HOPE BECAUSE OF THE AGREEMENT,
         THE ACCORD WITH HUNGARY [CONCERNING THE PROTESTION OF
         ETHNIC MINORITIES]. AT THE  SAME TIME, THERE ARE MANY
         CHALLENGES, AND THE CHALLENGES ARE PARTICULARLY
         EGREGIOUS IN THE ECONOMIC REALM, WHERE MANY SERIOUS
         EFFORTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE MADE TO LOWER INFLATION,
         CONSTRAIN UNEMPLOYMENT, WHILE YET ACCELERATING
         PRIVATIZATION. AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT YEAR
         OR TWO FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT -- IN THAT RESPECT.&quot; [END
         OPT]
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:    PROFESSOR DANIEL NELSON SAYS HE WISHES THAT THE GOOD
         NEWS ABOUT ROMANIA'S DEMOCRATIC VICTORY WAS BETTER
         UNDERSTOOD AND MORE FULLY APPRECIATED IN THE UNITED
         STATES AND WESTERN EUROPE.

AGAINST HAVING CLOSER TIES WITH IRAN.  AS AMBERIN ZAMAN REPORTS
FROM ANKARA, THE WARNINGS COINCIDE WITH IRANIAN PRESIDENT HASHEMI
RAFSANJANI'S FOUR DAY OFFICIAL VISIT TO TURKEY.
<P><STRONG>TEXT</STRONG>:  ON THE SECOND DAY OF HIS TOUR, PRESIDENT RAFSANJANI
ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WIFE, SON, TWO DAUGHTERS, AND OVER 200 IRANIAN
OFFICIALS AND BUSINESSMEN, INSPECTED TURKEY'S SOUTHEAST ANATOLIA
PROJECT GAP, A MULTI-BILLION IRRIGATION SCHEME COVERING THE
MAINLY KURDISH SOUTHEAST PROVINCES.
<P>MR. RAFSANJANI SAID IRANIAN NATURAL GAS WOULD PLAY A BIG ROLE IN
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGION.  HE WAS REFERRING TO THE
23-BILLION DOLLAR NATURAL GAS DEAL SIGNED BETWEEN TURKEY AND IRAN
LAST AUGUST.
<P>THE NATURAL GAS DEAL, ALONG WITH TURKEY'S PLANS TO DOUBLE ITS
TRADE WITH IRAN, HAS ANGERED WASHINGTON.  U-S OFFICIALS CONFIRM
THAT THE IRANIAN PRESIDENT'S VISIT HAS RAISED CONCERN OVER THE
COURSE WHICH TURKEY -- A NATO MEMBER -- IS TAKING UNDER ITS
RECENTLY-ELECTED ISLAMIST PRIME MINISTER, NECMETTIN ERBAKAN.  ON
THURSDAY, U-S STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN NICHOLAS BURNS ONCE
AGAIN VOICED WASHINGTON'S OPPOSITION TO TURKEY'S TIES WITH IRAN,
SAYING IRAN HAD TO BE ISOLATED.
<P>PRIOR TO MR. RAFSANJANI'S VISIT, AN ANNOUNCEMENT BY PRIME
MINISTER ERBAKAN THAT HE WANTS TO DEVELOP MILITARY COOPERATION
WITH IRAN PROVOKED A STRONG BACKLASH FROM MEMBERS OF TURKEY'S
CONSERVATIVE &quot;TRUE PATH" PARTY, OR D-Y-P, WITH WHOM HIS ISLAMIST
&quot;WELFARE PARTY" HAS BEEN SHARING POWER OVER THE PAST FOUR MONTHS.
<P>DEFENSE MINISTER TURHAN TAYAN -- A MEMBER OF THE D-Y-P WING OF
THE ISLAMIST-LED COALITION -- SAID HE WOULD REFUSE TO SIGN ANY
MILITARY ACCORD WITH IRAN.  BUT ABDULLAH GUL, A SENIOR CABINET
MEMBER FROM THE WELFARE PARTY, SAID ON THURSDAY THAT TURKEY COULD
JOINTLY MANUFACTURE HELICOPTERS WITH IRAN.
<P>SOME ANALYSTS WARN THAT MR. ERBAKAN'S PLANS TO REDUCE CUSTOMS
TARIFFS WITH IRAN COULD ALSO JEOPARDIZE A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT

PAST WEEK ENDORSED HIS NOMINATION AS THE SEVENTH U-N
SECRETARY-GENERAL.  HE IS THE FIRST U-N LEADER FROM SUB-SAHARAN
AFRICA.
<P>THE UNITED STATES FAVORED MR. ANNAN FOR THE U-N POST, AFTER IT
VETOED A SECOND TERM FOR OUT-GOING SECRETARY-GENERAL BOUTROS
BOUTROS-GHALI.  MR. ANNAN SAYS HE IS COUNTING ON THE CLINTON
WHITE HOUSE TO PERSUADE THE U-S CONGRESS TO PAY ITS HUGE DEBT TO
THE U-N OF OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS:
<CENTER><H4>// ANNAN ACT //</H4></CENTER>
<P>IT IS  NOT  REALLY IN THE INTEREST OF THE U-S  NOT  TO
         PAY ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE U-N.  IT OFFENDS FRIENDS AND
         FOES ALIKE.  THE U-S NEEDS THE U-N AND THE U-N NEEDS THE
         U-S, AND WE  CANNOT  OPERATE EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY
         WITHOUT A SOUND FINANCIAL BASIS.
<CENTER><H4>// END ACT //</H4></CENTER>
<P>THE U-S CONGRESS STARTED WITHHOLDING U-N DUES ABOUT A DECADE AGO,
DEMANDING DEEP REFORMS.  A POWERFUL SENATE LEADER FROM CAPITOL
HILL (JESSE HELMS) CONGRATULATED MR. ANNAN ON HIS ELECTION AND
INVITED HIM TO WASHINGTON TO DISCUSS HIS PLANS FOR RE-STRUCTURING
THE ORGANIZATION.
<P>ISMAIL RAZALI OF MALAYSIA -- THE PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL

<P>THE UNITED NATIONS SHOULD  NOT  BE DONOR DRIVEN.  AND

         A MENDICANT, PETITIONING GOVERNMENTS AND LEGISLATURES
         ALIKE.

<P>THE NEW SECRETARY-GENERAL HAS SAID HE WOULD CONSIDER A TRIP TO
THE U-S CONGRESS.
<P>         -0-
<P>THE SECURITY COUNCIL SPENT THE LATTER PART OF THE WEEK EXPRESSING
CONCERN OVER AND CONDEMNING VIOLENCE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE
WORLD.  ON THE TAKING OF HOSTAGES IN TAJIKISTAN -- INCLUDING
SEVEN U-N MILITARY OBSERVERS -- COUNCIL PRESIDENT FRANCESCO FULCI
MADE A PUBLIC APPEAL:
<CENTER><H4>// FULCI ACT //</H4></CENTER>
<P>THE MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL HAVE INSTRUCTED ME TO EXPRESS
         THEIR FIRM AND RESOLUTE CONDEMNATION OF THESE REPEATED,
         COWARDLY ACTS AND APPEAL FOR AN IMMEDIATE  AND
         UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF ALL THE HOSTAGES.
<CENTER><H4>// END ACT //</H4></CENTER>
<P>TAJIK GUERRILLAS THREATENED TO EXECUTE THE HOSTAGES UNLESS REBELS
RELEASED THE BROTHER OF AN OPPOSITION CHIEF WHO HAD JOINED FORCES
WITH THE GOVERNMENT.  THE HOSTAGE DILEMMA DEVELOPED AS TALKS WERE
UNDER WAY IN MOSCOW TO TRY TO END THE FOUR-YEAR OLD CIVIL WAR.
<P>ON THE SEIZURE OF HUNDREDS OF HOSTAGES AT THE RESIDENCE OF
JAPAN'S AMBASSADOR TO PERU -- THE COUNCIL PRESIDENT DESCRIBED THE
ASSUALT BY PERUVIAN GUERRILLAS AS A TERRORIST ACTION:
<CENTER><H4>// FULCI ACT //</H4></CENTER>
<P>THIS INTOLERABLE ACT CONSTITUTES ALSO AN ASSUALT AGAINST
         THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE.  THE COUNCIL HAS
         ALWAYS CONDEMNED TERRORIST ACTS WHATEVER THE
         CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE MOST UNEQUIVOCAL TERMS.
<CENTER><H4>// END ACT //</H4></CENTER>
<P>AND FINALLY, ON THE RESUMPTION OF FIGHTING IN SOMALIA -- THE
SECURITY COUNCIL ISSUED A FORMAL STATEMENT CALLING ON THE
FACTIONS TO REINSTATE A CEASE-FIRE.  DIPLOMATS WONDERED WHETHER
THE COMBATANTS WOULD EVEN RECEIVE THE MESSAGE, AND IF THEY DO --
WHETHER THE U-N HAS ANY REAL INFLUENCE IN THE COUNTRY.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> PNO calls off strike, ferry boats scheduled to sail</H3>
<H4>Athens, 21/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
More than 15 passenger ferry boats were expected to sail from
Piraeus until the early morning hours, carrying more than 5,000
passengers and 2,000 trucks with goods to Aegean islands, Crete
and the Dodecanese, after a decision by the Panhellenic Seamen's
Federation (PNO) last night to call off their strike.
<P>PNO members had begun their strike on Monday, which affected all
Greek-flagged vessels throughout the world.
<P>Earlier, the finance ministry announced that it had committed
itself to finding a commonly acceptable decision with the
seamen's union, the General Confederation of Greek Workers
(GSEE) and the Piraeus Labor Center on merchant marine issues,
which will provide the basis for a debate in Parliament.
<P>The announcement came after a meeting between Merchant Marine
Minister Stavros Soumakis, Finance Under-secretary Giorgos Drys,
and other bodies involved.
<P>The PNO originally called a 48-hour strike in support of their
demand that the government not proceed with plans to abolish
seamen's special fiscal status, according to which their income
is taxed.
<P>It was subsequently extended for two days and then, yesterday,
for a further 24 hours.
<P>In a related development, a Piraeus court ruled Thursday that
the strike was illegal and asked the PNO to immediately call off
all protest action.
<P>&quot;We do not accept coercion from the shipowning companies which
are asking Greek captains not only to carry on sailing vessels
but also to impose sanctions on striking seamen,&quot; PNO general
secretary Yiannis Halas said.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> Clashes</H3>
<H4>Athens, 21/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Meanwhile, striking seamen and port police clashed yesterday at
the northwestern port of Igoumenitsa when the ferry board
&quot;Brindisi&quot; tried to depart with some 50 trucks for the Italian
port of the same name.
<P>The clash took place on the ramp of the ferry boat, from which
one protesting seaman fell and was taken to a nearby hospital at
Philiates.
<P>Another protester climbed on to one of the vessel's mooring
ropes in an effort to prevent it leaving the port, but fell into
the sea. He also was taken to the hospital.
<P>The Brindisi finally managed to sail at 3:15 p.m. local time,
while the situation at Igoumenitsa is reported at presstime to
be calm.
<P>PNO threatened to call a new 48-hour on Jan. 8, 1997, if the
government does not stick to the agreement reached.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> Stranded Greek truckers amassing in Italian ports</H3>
<H4>Rome, 21/12/1996 (ANA - L. Hatzikyriakos)</H4>
More than 500 Greek transport trucks have been isolated in three
Italian ports, awaiting the end of the seamen's strike in Greece.
<P>In Ancona, 150 Greek trucks have jammed the road leading to the
port, creating a traffic problem in the city.
<P>In Bari, where the situation is slightly better, 160 Greek and
70 Turkish trucks have been accommodated inside the port
compound for fear of thefts.
<P>In Brindisi, about 200 trucks have been stranded inside and
outside the port.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> Civil aviation strike suspended</H3>
<H4>Athens, 21/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Airport employees suspended a 24-hour nationwide strike
scheduled for yesterday, and all domestic and foreign flights
were carried out normally.
<P>The strike was called by the Federation of Civil Aviation
Employee Associations (OSYPA) demanding that four employee
benefits be excluded from the new scalary sale, an 8.0 percent
salary increase and legislation of overtime and holiday
remuneration.
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> More aggressive economic policy for Balkans, E. Europe considered</H3>
<H4>Athens, 21/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Development Minister Vasso Papandreou held a business summit at
her own initiative at the industry ministry yesterday, which was
attended by business leaders Vardis Vardinoyiannis, Sokratis
Kokkalis, Dimitris Kopelouzos and Spyros Latsis.
<P>The meeting focused on the government's plan to implement an
aggressive economic co-operation policy with Balkan and eastern
European countries in the sectors of industry and energy. In the
framework of promoting the government's plan, more meetings will
be held with business representatives and finalized decisions
will be announced after an enlarged meeting is chaired by Prime
Minister Costas Simitis.
<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> Trikoupis exhibit inaugurated</H3>
<H4>Athens, 21/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Prime Minister Costas Simitis and Parliament President Apostolos
Kaklamanis inaugurated an exhibition yesterday on Greece's
premier 19th century statesman Harilaos Trikoupis, which
coincided with the 100th anniversary of his death.
<P>Mr. Simitis said &quot;Greece's present image in the Balkans and the
world is due to Trikoupis' initiatives, his conception of
Hellenism and to his beliefs that the country must have a strong
economy to enable Greece to play a role.&quot;
<P>Mr. Kaklamanis said Trikoupis was the &quot;politician who
substantively prepared Greece's entry into the 20th century with
boldness, realism and planning.&quot;
<P>The inauguration of the exhibition, entitled &quot;Harilaos Trikoupis
- 100 Years of Memory&quot;, and housed in the Eleftherios Venizelos
Hall in Parliament, was attended by many deputies, party
leaders, personalities from the cultural sector and descendants
of Harilaos Trikoupis.
<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> Stephanopoulos message to expatriate</H3>
<H4>Athens, 21/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
The operation of the World Council of Hellenes Abroad has
brought to the surface the contribution of the expatriate Greeks
in the promotion of the country's national issues, President of
the Republic Kostis Stephanopoulos said yesterday.
<P>In a message to expatriate Greeks on the occasion of the holiday
season, Mr. Stephanopoulos said that despite efforts and even
though positive steps have been noted over the past year,
Greece's national issues have been left pending.
<P>&quot;International circumstances as well as the general confusion
and uncertainty prevailing in the world as a result of the
changes which have been noted and continue to be noted in the
Balkans and elsewhere the economic superpowers of the earth have
not allowed settlement to our national issues,&quot; Mr.
Stephanopoulos said.
<P>Mr. Stephanopoulos said that existing difficulties urge for
national unity and co-operation.
<P>Alternate Foreign Minister George Papandreou also sent a message
to the expatriate Greeks stressing that &quot;this era is rife with
danger and action while at the same time is opening routes to
development, peace, and co-operation.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</A> Premier meets with Fouras</H3>
<H4>Athens, 21/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Prime Minister Costas Simitis yesterday received Sports
Under-secretary Andreas Fouras, who briefed him on developments
regarding the Athens Olympic Committee's efforts to win the 2004
Olympic Games.
<P>Mr. Fouras also briefed the premier on the Greek hosting of the
1997 World Athletics Championship and an array of problems
facing the sports world in Greece.
<H3><A NAME="09">[09]</A> Stephanopoulos arrives in Egypt for official visit</H3>
<H4>Cairo, 21/12/1996 (ANA - N. Megadoukas)</H4>
Bilateral relations between Greece and Egypt and developments in
the southeastern Mediterranean are expected to be the focal
point of talks here today between President of the Republic
Kostis Stephanopoulos and his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak.
<P>President Stephanopoulos arrived in Alexandria yesterday on the
first stop of his official four-day visit to Egypt, where he
received a warm welcome from members of the local ethnic Greek
community. It was the first ever visit to Alexandria by a Greek
p resident.
<P>Diplomatic observers said Greece and Egypt are not faced with
any special problems in their bilateral relations but, on the
contrary, must seek ways of further expanding relations.
<P>According to reports, President Stephanopoulos in his meeting
with President Mubarak and Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos
in his meeting with his Egyptian counterpart, Amr Mousa, are
expected to brief the Egyptian side on Greek national issues,
the Cyprus issue and Greek-Turkish relations.
<P>Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan had visited Cairo last
October, while President Mubarak visited Ankara last July.
<P>During a special ceremony, the ethnic Greeks from Alexandria
briefed President Stephanopoulos on problems they are facing,
such as the provision of Egyptian nationality to Greek
businessmen in Egypt and the establishment of an archaeological
academy at a postgraduate level under the name &quot;Alexander the
Great.&quot; President Stephanopoulos said the Greek foreign minister
will address these issues and try to find solutions with the
Egyptian side, adding that a Greek-Egyptian university should be
established i n Alexandria.
<P>Mr. Stephanopoulos visited the seat of the Patriarchate during
his stay in Alexandria, where he said the best candidate should
be elected to succeed the late Patriarch Parthenios. In the
afternoon he was given a guided tour of the Kait Bey Castle,
built on the spot where the lighthouse of Alexandria stood, and
the house where the poet Constantine Cavafy lived.
<P>President Stephanopoulos left for Cairo late in the afternoon
where today, before meeting President Mubarak, he will lay a
wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and at the monument
created where late Egyptian president Anwar Sadat was
assassinated on Oct. 6, 1981.
<H3><A NAME="10">[10]</A> Gov't: Ambassador in Peru instructed not to return to terrorists</H3>
<H4>Athens, 21/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
The government said yesterday that its ambassador in Peru had
been instructed &quot;to use the opportunity given to him to escape&quot;
from the Tupac Amaru guerrillas, who are still holding about 200
people hostage at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima.
<P>&quot;This was the message given to (Ambassador Alcibiades) Karokis,
when he was a prisoner, through his wife,&quot; government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said in reply to press questions.
<P>The Greek envoy was released by the guerrillas along with three
other ambassadors to negotiate with the Peruvian government on
their behalf. Mr. Karokis, like the ambassadors of Germany and
France, did not return to the embassy.
<P>Only the Canadian ambassador returned. Diplomatic sources said
all the European diplomatic missions in Lima agreed with the
decision on the European ambassadors' getaway.
<P>Asked why Mr. Karokis did not play the role of mediator as
requested by the guerrillas, Mr. Reppas replied that ambassadors
are representatives of their respective countries and &quot;the Greek
government did not assign the role of mediator to our envoy in
Lima.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="11">[11]</A> Greece says no problem in Cyprus' purchase of Russian missiles</H3>
<H4>Athens, 21/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Greece said yesterday that there was &quot;no problem&quot; in contacts
between Cyprus and Russia concerning Nicosia's plans to purchase
several S-300 surface-to-air missiles from Moscow in order to
bolster its defense against air attack.
<P>Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas added that the S-300 was
not an &quot;aggressive&quot; weapons system and reiterated a similar
statement by Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
<P>Mr. Reppas made the statement when asked to comment on remarks
by Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller, who claimed that on
her recent trip to Moscow, she had received assurances that
Russia would not go ahead with the sale after beating her fist
on the desk of Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin four times.
<P>A Russian diplomat who was present at the Ciller-Chernomyrdin
meeting later categorically rejected that such assurances had
been given. According to an ANA dispatch from Moscow late last
night, Russia denied categorically Ms Ciller's statements.
<P>Michail Tarasov, an aide to Mr. Chernomyrdin, told ANA that Ms
Ciller's statements &quot;do not correspond to reality&quot;.
<P>According to Mr. Tarasov, the Russian premier supported, during
his talks with the Turkish foreign minister, the
demilitarization of the island republic, underlining at the same
time that under present circumstances, if Cyprus did not buy
arms from Russia it would purchase them elsewhere.
<H3><A NAME="12">[12]</A> EU absorption rate sparks latest PASOK, ND clash during
Parliament budget discussion</H3>
<H4>Athens, 21/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Yesterday evening's budget debate in Parliament was marked by a
renewed clash between National Economy Minister Yiannos
Papantoniou and main opposition New Democracy party leader
Miltiades Evert on the issue of absorption of European Union
funds.
<P>Mr. Evert produced national economy ministry figures, claiming
that funds amounting to 1.85 trillion drachmas had been lost in
the last three years. The minister replied, acknowledging that
funds had indeed been lost during the first six months of the
initiation of programs, chiefly due to the lack of planning by
the previous New Democracy government.
<P>He added that there was an upward rate in the absorption of
funds, which was 45 per cent in 1994, 70 per cent in 1995 and
100 per cent this year. He reiterated that all available funds
would be absorbed and that the Thessaloniki metro and the
Aheloos River diversion projects would be implemented.
<P>On her part, Development Minister Vasso Papandreou said the
Greek people had given the government &quot;a mandate for
confrontation with all large and small interests that kept the
country away from the year 2000, from a united Europe and
development&quot;.
<P>She added that the government's development program contained
significant institutional reforms, including preparation of the
Public Power Corp. (DEH) for a deregulation of the energy
market, 18 institutional plans for industry and 300 operational
business plans involving a total sum of 512 billion drachmas.
<P>She also referred to a significant number of projects for
tourism, and legislation regarding consumer protection, fair
competition, the insurance market and the system of public
procurement.
<H3><A NAME="13">[13]</A> Simitis to meet farmers' reps after Thessaloniki-area blockades
lifted</H3>
<H4>Athens, 21/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
After a decision of the Macedonia-Thrace Farmers' Coordinating
Committee to suspend mobilizations and lift roadblocks
yesterday, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas announced that
Prime Minister Costas Simitis has accepted their proposal for a
meeting.
<P>&quot;The prime minister will receive a five-member delegation of the
Macedonia-Thrace Farmers' Coordinating Committee at 5 p.m. on
Monday, Dec. 23. The meeting is within the framework of a
broader dialogue on the problems of Greek agriculture,&quot; he
specified.
<P>Road access to Thessaloniki from the surrounding prefectures was
restored yesterday morning after farmers lifted their blockade
at the Malgara toll post on the Thessaloniki-Athens highway.
<P>However, the protesting farmers left a small number of tractors
at the side of the road at Malgara and did not rule out
re-blocking the road for a few hours later in the day. The same
tactic was adopted by farmers Thursday in Pieria prefecture ,
who opened the last remaining roadblocks in the area at Variko
and Aiginio on the Thessaloniki-Athens highway, only to again
block the road at the same two points this morning.
<P>The government has insisted over the more than three weeks of
the blockades that there can be no dialogue between protesting
farmers and Mr. Simitis, as long as they continued to block the
country's road and rail links.
<P>Representatives of farmers in Macedonia and Thrace warned,
however, that if the dialogue with the premier proved to be
fruitless they would resume their protests in mid-January.
<P>In a related development, Mr. Reppas said that following
Thursday's mass protest rally in Athens by farmers, &quot;the process
of dialogue remains open.&quot;
<P>He added that the government had already replied to three of the
six &quot;points&quot; raised by farmers, adding that &quot;anyone can put
forward demands but it is the government which charts policy and
is responsible for tackling problems in the way it sees fit.&quot;
<P>The spokesman also attacked opposition parties, saying that &quot;the
silence of the political party leaders concerning the damaging
and provocative&quot; farmers' blockades &quot;speaks volumes.&quot;
<P>&quot;I am surprised by the fact that the (opposition) leaders do not
take a stance concerning the inability of citizens to freely
travel, particularly on the eve of the Christmas holidays,&quot; Mr.
Reppas said.
<P>The spokesman called on farmers &quot;and all others who have the
ability to contribute to the unblocking of the roads&quot; to do so.
<H3><A NAME="14">[14]</A> Thessaly still holding out</H3>
<H4>Athens, 21/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
In contrast to their northern colleagues, the Panthessaly
Farmers' Coordinating Committee decided after a four-hour
meeting yesterday to &quot;continue the struggle&quot; and the blockades
of national and provincial highways in the broader region.
<P>Although the decision was adopted unanimously, reliable sources
said that strong disagreements have begun arising among the
members on the committee, while the main opposition New
Democracy-affiliated farmers are blaming their representatives
on the committee for not accepting a proposal for a 12-hour
withdrawal of tractors from the roads.
<P>Other reports state that many farmers have begun pressuring
committee members for a withdrawal, and that there had been
&quot;de-sertions&quot; from the blockades at Tempi and Volos. However,
the largest roadblock, at the Biokarpet site, manned by farmers
from the predominantly cotton-growing region of Karditsa,
reportedly remained intact.
<P>Finally, the situation in Larisa has deteriorated due to the
blockades, with small clothes manufacturers having already
suffered losses estimated at 1.5 billion drachmas.
<H3><A NAME="15">[15]</A> Athens Mayor meets with Prime Minister</H3>
<H4>Athens, 21/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Athens Mayor and Central Union of Greek Municipalities and
Communities (KEDKE) President Dimitris Avrampoulos received an
assurance from Prime Minister Costas Simitis yesterday that
legislation outlining finances of Local Government Organizations
(OTA) will not be changed. Mr. Simitis met with Mr. Avramopoulos
in Parliament.
<P>&quot;The specific legislation institutes local governments' economic
autonomy. Its correct implementation remains of paramount
significance and any change will bring negative repercussions in
the nation's municipalities and communities' budgetary
capabilities and developmental actions...&quot; a KEDKE memorandum
handed to the prime minister states.
<H3><A NAME="16">[16]</A> EU tourism ministers fail to implement Philoxenia program</H3>
<H4>Brussels, 21/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
European Union tourism ministers' failure, during their recent
meeting in Dublin, to consider the Philoxenia program for
tourism promotion has caused bitterness in numerous business
sectors involved in the industry and in a number of countries,
including Greece.
<P>Philoxenia, the EU's modest tourism plan proposed this year by
the Union's second Directorate General, was apparently postponed
at the instigation of one member-state, according to Olivier
Lepine, president of the European Federation of Conference Towns
(EFCT) and the chairman of the European Meeting Industry Liaison
Group (EMILG).
<P>&quot;We support the reported view of the Irish presidency that
Philoxenia is a real step in the direction of a clearly defined
and fully implemented European Tourism policy,&quot; said Mr. Lepine.
<P>&quot;It was the result of a widely discussed Green Paper that aimed
to provide support to tourism, the Community's neglected child&quot;.
<P>The cost is relatively minor - ECU 25 million over four years -
for what is Europe's largest industry, with a great potential
for job creation and GDP.
<P>&quot;We hope Philoxenia can be rescued from the neglect that
threatens it, the victim of certain members who feel that
tourism should remain a non-activity, while Europe continues to
lose congress and other tourism business year by year to other
destinations,&quot; Mr. Lepine said.
<P>There was also disappointment that no progress has been made in
the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) on the widely-supported
proposal for tourism to become an EU 'competence', which would
enable it to win badly needed support. After the Europarliament
voted in favor of making tourism a competence, it was hoped that
this could have been achieved during the Irish EU presidency,
but there were few signs of progress.
<P>&quot;There is wide concern that matters which may have considerable
support can be set aside by the opposition of just one
member-state,&quot; Mr. Lepine said, adding: &quot;We support the view
that a majority vote should prevail: this could open up the
opportunity for tourism and conference tourism promotion to get
the understanding and support from the Community that they
deserve.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="17">[17]</A> Mortgage Bank announces measures for flood-stricken</H3>
<H4>Athens, 21/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
The National Mortgage Bank yesterday announced three measures to
relieve flooding victims in Xanthi prefecture.
<P>Legal actions concerning compulsory settlement of outstanding
debts of flood victims in Xanthi will be suspended until Dec. 1,
1997.
<P>On the question of interest rates, a conventional interest rate
will be applied, and not one applied in cases of overdue debts,
for possible outstanding debts of both forthcoming installments,
which will be estimated after Dec. 1, 1996 and will possibly not
be paid.
<P>Moreover, flood victims in the prefecture will be provided with
the possibility of settling possible outstanding debts of their
loans with a 10 per cent down payment of the outstanding debt.
<P>The measures apply to housing loans and working space loans.
<H3><A NAME="18">[18]</A> Greek products exhibit in Cyprus</H3>
<H4>Athens, 21/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
The fourth Greek products exhibition in Cyprus organized by
Helexpo and the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair will be
held in Nicosia on Jan. 15-19.
<P>The exhibition will take place with participation from the
Thessaloniki Bio-technical Chamber, the Thessaloniki Vocational
Training Chamber, the Komotini Commerce and Industrial Chamber,
the Larisa Commerce and Industrial Chamber and the Pieria
Industrial Chamber.
<P>It will also be held with the participation of a number of
independent businesses.
<P>Exhibits include furniture, building and construction materials,
marbles, garments, foodstuffs, etc.
<H3><A NAME="19">[19]</A> Protection measures for EYDAP consumers announced</H3>
<H4>Athens, 21/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Measures protecting consumers of the Athens Water and Sewerage
Co. (EYDAP) were announced yesterday after a meeting at the
environment, town planning and public works ministry.
<P>Public Works Under-secretary Christos Verelis said special
two-member work groups will be created in every branch of EYDAP
to serve consumers in immediately resolving problems.
<P>Additionally, bills will not be issued in the event the
computerized system ascertains that they are 50 per cent higher
than in the corresponding quarterly period of the previous year
and are more than 50,000 drachmas.
<P>A consumer will be notified immediately in such cases in order
to ascertain the cause of the problem. A local administration
representative will also participate in the committee checking
consumers' objections and deciding on discounts for bills.
<P>Mr. Verelis said the three measures will be implemented by the
end of January and will substantively improve the relationship
between consumers and EYDAP.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> Farmers converge on Athens, Gov't unwavering</H3>
<H4>Athens, 20/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
The government stood its ground as thousands of farmers from all
over the country converged on Athens' city center yesterday in
support of their demands, although Prime Minister Costas Simitis
again refused to meet them as long as they continued to block
roads and rail links.
<P>More than 100 coaches arrived in Athens at noon with farmers and
their families scheduled to attend the rally. Some 5,000 farmers
began to arrive in waves outside the agriculture ministry
building, shouting slogans and expressing their determination to
continue their protests until they are vindicated.
<P>Farmers want lower fuel prices, higher price supports and US$
1.3 billion in debts rescheduled, however, the government has
maintained that it has no money to give.
<P>The rally began with speeches by members of the farmers'
coordinating committee of Thessaly, who attacked the government
for its handling of the situation, accusing it of intransigence.
<P>Pan-Thessaly Struggle Committee President Yiannis Pattakis,
Communist Party of Greece (KKE) Deputy and Coordinating
Committee member Vangelis Boutas as well as other members of the
committee addressing the crowds of farmers in Vathis Square,
accused the government of &quot;not listening to farmers' cries of
desperation&quot; and of following a &quot;Thatcherist&quot; policy. They said
it was a question of survival for the farmers, while Mr. Boutas
said survival does not go together with convergence programs.
<P>Mr. Simitis, they said, was refusing dialogue with the farmers
because he had nothing to say with respect to their demands.
<P>Thousands of farmers have blocked national roads for 23 days
with tractors, causing a transportation chaos and inflicting
more than $100 million in damages on the economy.
<P>Many barricades have come down in recent days and farmers in
some regions have lost heart, but blockades on the north-south
motorway in the Thessaly region have stayed in place, virtually
cutting the country in two.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> Gov't spokesman</H3>
<H4>Athens, 20/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas yesterday called on the
farmers to take the first step towards resolving the impasse
caused by the type of protest action they have chosen, stressing
that the government had done all it could to alleviate their
problems.
<P>He said it was not possible for the government to be
&quot;blackmailed&quot; under pressure created by the road and rail
blockades.
<P>Mr. Reppas urged farmers to participate in the dialogue for the
creation of a national &quot;framework&quot; for agriculture as well as a
framework for putting agricultural demands to the European Union.
<P>Replying to questions, Mr. Reppas accused KKE of providing
assistance and &quot;political cover&quot; to the form of protests used by
the farmers. He added that the government had taken all the
necessary measures to prevent any outbreak of violence at
yesterday's rally and march.
<P>The farmers' march coincided with a debate in Parliament on the
1997 budget, which ends on Saturday night with a vote. The
budget has triggered a number of strikes and protests in recent
weeks by various groups opposing Mr. Simitis' economic policy.
<P>He has stressed that Greece needs to catch up with its European
partners, reiterating that sacrifices must be made, especially
by the wealthy.
<P>Students, a large number of construction workers and some
pensioners later joined the farmers in a show of solidarity.
<P>The Civil Servants' Supreme Administrative Council (ADEDY), the
Confederation of Workers of Greece (GSEE), the Athens Labor
Center, the Federation of Pensioners and other trade union
organizations in resolutions all expressed solidarity with the
farmers.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> Farmers' meeting with Tzoumakas</H3>
<H4>Athens, 20/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
After the rally, farmers' representatives held a meeting with
Agriculture Minister Stephanos Tzoumakas in Parliament, during
which they demanded satisfaction to their demands.
<P>The resolution, which they handed to Mr. Tzoumakas, also refers
to problems facing stockbreeders and pension demands in general.
<P>Farmers' representatives said later that a two-hour meeting with
the minister had been fruitless and that the government's
&quot;intransi-gence&quot; was outrageous. They claimed none of the six
demands they had put forward had been accepted, adding that the
only thing which the government promised them was 12 billion
drachmas from the European Union as compensation for farmers
whose crops or installations were damaged by recent bad weather.
<P>In contrast, the minister described the meeting as substantive,
adding that farmers had been fully briefed on the 12 million
drachma compensation sum approved by the European Commission. He
reiterated that the budget and commitments towards the EU
prohibited the circumscribed the government's possibilities in
further meeting farmers demands at the present time.
<P>Also present at the meeting was Under-secretary to the Prime
Minister's Office George Paschalidis. The farmers' Struggle
Coordinating Committee later decided to escalate its action and
said the precise form would be defined today at a meeting in
Larisa.
<P>Meanwhile, the managing director of the Athens Paper Mill plant
in Drama (Softex) announced earlier in the day that the company
had been forced to give compulsory leave to 200 workers.
<P>Explaining the decision, Antonis Georgiadis said the temporary
lay-off was necessitated by a lack of raw materials resulting
from farmers' blockades.
<P>He said production at the Softex plant had stopped on Dec. 7.
<P>Although the president of the Drama Labor Center, Savvas
Ispachanidis, who represents the Softex workers, said that there
was no cause for concern, Drama residents are reportedly worried
that the compulsory leave is just the first step towards the
closure of the plant, which plays a major role in the economy of
the northern Greek city.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> Greek ambassador reported safe in Lima</H3>
<H4>Athens, 20/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
The Greek Ambassador in Peru, Alcibiades Karokis, his wife and
their three children are safe and under guard by Peruvian police
after his ordeal in the hands of Tupac Amaru guerrillas at the
Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima.
<P>The head of the foreign ministry's A4 department Nikos
Ladopoulos told the Athens News Agency that Mr. Karokis was
released from the Japanese embassy on Wednesday.
<P>Following the failure of negotiations with the Peruvian
government, the guerrillas decided to send four diplomats (the
ambassadors of Greece, Germany, France and Canada) out of about
200 people they are holding hostage to negotiate with the
Peruvian government on their behalf. However, the three European
ambassadors did not return to the Japanese ambassador's
residence and angered the guerrillas.
<P>According to reports, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel had
instructed the German ambassador to escape and hide if he found
the opportunity. The Greek foreign ministry gave similar
instructions to Mr. Karokis.
<P>Diplomatic sources said all the European diplomatic missions in
Lima agreed with the decision on the European ambassadors'
getaway.
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> Stephanopoulos on official visit to Egypt</H3>
<H4>Athens, 20/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
President of the Republic Kostis Stephanopoulos will begin a
four-day official visit to Egypt today, at the invitation of
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
<P>The Greek president will meet Mr. Mubarak in Cairo at noon
tomorrow for talks expected to focus on bilateral relations
between Athens and Cairo, the Middle East and Greek national
issues.
<P>President Stephanopoulos, who will visit Luxor and Alexandria,
as well will also have contacts with members of the ethnic Greek
community in Egypt.
<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> Athens welcomes Euro Court rulings</H3>
<H4>Athens, 20/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
The government yesterday welcomed a European Court ruling which
found Turkey guilty of continuing human rights violations and
offers the opportunity to hundreds of Greek Cypriot refugees to
claim their right to use and enjoy their property in the
Turkish-occupied north of the island republic.
<P>&quot;An important ruling with great significance on many levels,
which touches the essence of the Cyprus problem,&quot; government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said of the judgment vindicating the
plaintiff, Titina Loizidou, a Greek Cypriot refugee from the
occupied port city of Kyrenia.
<P>&quot;The ruling has great symbolic value,&quot; Mr. Reppas said, calling
on other Cypriots to take the same initiative in order to exert
pressure on &quot;a condemnable status.&quot;
<P>The court found Turkey responsible for the continuing violation
of human rights in the Turkish-occupied area of Cyprus, ruling
by 11 votes to 6 that &quot;denial of access to the applicant's
property and consequent loss of control thereof is imputable to
Turkey.&quot;
<P>According to the ruling, the Republic of Cyprus remains &quot;the
sole legitimate government of Cyprus&quot; and the international
community does not regard the puppet regime in the occupied
north as a state under international law.
<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> Cultural Capital of Europe programs outlined to deputies</H3>
<H4>Athens, 20/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Several ministers and other officials yesterday presented
Parliamentary deputies with the file of all infrastructure
projects for Thessaloniki's assumption of the Cultural Capital
of Europe title next year, as well as an accompanying financial
and cultura l plan.
<P>Funding of the whole program amounts to 80 billion drachmas and
is met through both national and EU credits. It is the first
time that a Cultural Capital is funded with such large sums.
<P>Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos, Environment Minister
Costas Laliotis and Macedonia-Thrace Minister Philippos
Petsalnikos, together with Thessaloniki Mayor Dinos Kosmopoulos,
and the art director of the city's Cultural Capital Organization
(CCO) P. Theodoridis, unveiled the plans in Athens' Zappeion
Hall.
<P>Mr. Laliotis expressed confidence that the city can adequately
meet its role as Cultural Capital, as a metropolitan center of
northern Greece, and as a dominant reference pole for the
Balkans, the Black Sea region and the Mediterranean.
<P>The government is funding 233 basic projects budgeted at 62
billion drachmas, of which 52 billion are managed by CCO, and
the rest concern projects in the city's harbor.
<P>An additional sum of 10 billion drachmas through the EU's URBAN
program is devoted to construction of the city's concert hall
and municipal utility projects.
<P>Mr. Theodoridis said the concept of a city of diverse culture
due to its immigrant population was a guide for the cultural
capital.
<P>The cultural program is based on eight large exhibitions,
centered on the one featuring the relics of Mount Athos, and
including one on perceptions of the personality of Alexander the
Great in east and west.
<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</A> Simitis says he would never bow to 'blackmail'</H3>
<H4>Athens, 20/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
The government is not opposed to Greece's farmers but only to a
few of them, Prime Minister Costas Simitis was quoted yesterday
as stating during an interview with the popular monthly magazine
&quot;Nitro&quot;.
<P>The premier added that he would rather &quot;go home&quot; instead of
bowing to protesting farmers' demands.
<P>&quot;There are millions of farmers in Greece but only 3,000 farmers
have taken the streets,&quot; Mr. Simitis said, sending a clear
message to farmers blockading the country's roads for 22 days,
demanding higher subsidies, lower taxes and cheaper fuel.
<P>&quot;My job is to spread the available money in a socially just way
and that is why we must struggle not to succumb to blackmail,&quot;
he said.
<P>Yesterday, farmers marched on Athens to press for a meeting with
Mr. Simitis, who, staying true to his original stance, refused
to personally talk to them unless they abandoned their
barricades.
<P>Mr. Simitis has rejected all demands, saying Greece has no money
to give and must catch up with its European Union partners.
<P>In the wide-ranging interview, Mr. Simitis said he was in
politics &quot;to apply certain ideas about society.&quot;
<P>He said his vision of Greece in the next few years included a
stabilized economy and an improved quality of life, with better
public services.
<P>Stressing that more work was needed to make the country a
significant economic force in the Balkans, he said that Greece
should direct its foreign policy towards the United States, the
European Union and eastern Europe.
<P>Mr. Simitis said Washington was interested in ending
Greek-Turkish disputes as part of its general policy but warned
that Greece would not rush to agree to solutions contrary to its
interests.
<P>Noting as &quot;positive&quot; the fact that new US Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright had a good knowledge of Greek issues, the
prime minister said &quot;we should not fall into the trap of
labeling US secretaries of state as either pro-Turkish or
pro-Greek because at the end of the day they represent the
United States.
<P>&quot;Understanding of our issues is greater, now, than a year ago.
That doesn't mean that we have won the game. The game is open,&quot;
he said.
<P>Mr. Simitis took over from ailing Andreas Papandreou in January,
winning the general elections last September and party congress
elections since then.
<P>&quot;Andreas Papandreou was a clear thinker and was able to express
his views simply and persuasively,&quot; he said of the late premier,
adding that the model of the leader-oriented party is now a
thing of the past.
<P>&quot;The model of leadership is related to the evolution of
society,&quot; Mr. Simitis said, adding that National Defense
Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos - one of Mr. Simitis' rivals in
party elections for the post of prime minister and then party
president - and the rest of the founding members of ruling party
PASOK &quot;were well aware that we can proceed only through
co-operation.&quot;
<P>Mr. Simitis said the fact that he had a stable policy won him
the September elections, while his chief opposition rival, New
Democracy party leader Miltiades Evert, relied solely on
promises.
<P>&quot;Mr. Evert plays power games,&quot; Mr. Simitis said, accusing ND of
a lack of policies, which &quot;results in personal opposition.&quot;
<P>&quot;The biggest problem with ND is that they regard politics
exclusively as the art of power,&quot; the premier noted.
<H3><A NAME="09">[09]</A> Court rules seamen's strike illegal</H3>
<H4>Athens, 20/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
A Piraeus court ruled yesterday that the ongoing seamen's strike
was illegal and asked the Panhellenic Seamen's Federation (PNO)
to immediately call off all protest actions.
<P>The PNO organized two consecutive 48-hour nationwide strikes
beginning on Monday this week to press demands for the special
tax status of seamen to be left intact by the government's new
tax law.
<P>The strike has prevented many Greek-flagged as well as many
foreign-flagged vessels from entering or leaving ports
throughout the country.
<P>The court issued its ruling following a petition filed by the
association which represents owners of coastal shipping vessels.
<P>In a related development, striking seamen held a rally and march
in Piraeus yesterday to protest the government's decision to use
navy vessels to transport trucks from Crete to Piraeus.
<P>According to informed sources, three navy vessels late Wednesday
night sailed from the Suda naval base on Crete carrying trucks
to the Salamina naval base.
<P>The PNO board of administration was expected yesterday to hand a
resolution condemning the decision to Merchant Marine Minister
Stavros Soumakis.
<P>Meanwhile, 13 vessels serving foreign routes remained at anchor
in Patra yesterday, unable to leave for destinations in Italy
because striking seamen and dockworkers refused to allow the
embarkation of passengers and trucks.
<P>About 300 trucks continue to be stranded at the western port
city by the strike, which was scheduled to end at 6 p.m. today.
<P>Meanwhile, the Communist party of Greece (KKE) lashed out
against the government yesterday accusing it for &quot;assault
against the seamen,&quot; and warning that &quot;the climate of terrorism
which is reproduced by the government policy will not prevail.&quot;
<P>The PNO's executive committee later decided to extend the strike
for a further 24 hours.
<P>It is now scheduled to end at 6 a.m. local time on Saturday,
although a further extension of strike action cannot be ruled
out.
<P>Meanwhile, scuffles in Piraeus yesterday between striking seamen
and truck drivers resulted in one man's death.
<P>The scuffles broke out when drivers tried to board the &quot;Vicenzos
Kornaros&quot; ferry boat with their vehicles and were opposed by
striking seamen.
<P>The victim, Manolis Roditis, who according to initial reports
was a passenger on the ferry boat, apparently found himself in
the midst of the scuffles and fell to the ground unconscious.
<P>He was immediately rushed to the Tzanneion Hospital in Piraeus
where doctors said he had died from heart failure.
<H3><A NAME="10">[10]</A> Citibank explosion work of November 17, police sources say</H3>
<H4>Athens, 20/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Security police said yesterday that a bomb blast against a
Citibank branch in the northwestern Athens suburb of Halandri
shortly after midnight on Thursday bore the hallmarks of the
elusive November 17 terrorist organization.
<P>The strong blast, which police said was caused by three
kilograms of TNT, caused extensive damage but no casualties. The
blast completely destroyed the bank and damaged almost all the
shops in the shopping center housing the bank at Halandri's
central Dourou Square.
<P>Police said the home-made explosive device had been planted in a
bag at the bank's entrance.
<P>The same Citibank branch was the target of a November 17 attack
in 1991.
<H3><A NAME="11">[11]</A> 18 illegal immigrants picked up on Samos</H3>
<H4>Athens, 20/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Eighteen Iraqis of Kurdish descent were arrested yesterday on
the deserted coast of Vourlioton on the island of Samos, police
said.
<P>The illegal immigrants - eight men, five women and five children
- told harbor authorities they had paid $2,000 each to a Turkish
captain to transport them from Turkey to Samos on his speedboat.
<P>The Turkish captain of the speedboat was later arrested by the
coastguard after a sea chase north of Samos.
<P>Mehmet Mirze Yayla, 29, from Izmir was subsequently identified
by the illegal immigrants and was due to appear before the
public prosecutor later yesterday.
<P>The speedboat was spotted by a Greek fisherman and coastguard
officers believe Yayla was preparing to ferry another &quot;cargo&quot; of
illegal immigrants from the Turkish coast.
<H3><A NAME="12">[12]</A> 'Wrapping paper' furor hits Thessaloniki</H3>
<H4>Athens, 20/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
A design for paper used for wrapping meat and fish has divided
the world of arts and letters in Thessaloniki just days before
the northern port city officially assumes its one-year term as
Cultural Capital of Europe.
<P>The furor has been caused by the plans of the art department of
the city's Cultural Capital Organization to print and distribute
wrapping paper with lines from the works of celebrated Greek
poets alongside catch-phrases commonly used by contemporary
Greek youth such as &quot;... don't bug me.&quot;
<P>Proponents of the paper, which has lines from the poetry of
Nobel laureates George Seferis and Odysseus Elytis, describe the
concept as a &quot;public, literary rave or happening&quot; which brings
the popular masses closer to literature.
<P>However, a number of prominent literary figures in Thessaloniki
have expressed strong opposition, saying literature and its
creators should be treated with greater respect.
<H3><A NAME="13">[13]</A> Commission approves transport, environment projects for Greece</H3>
<H4>Brussels, 20/12/1996 (ANA - M. Savva)</H4>
The European Commission has approved the sums of ECU 324.1 and
88.9 million for projects in Greece in the transport and
environmental sectors, respectively.
<P>The funds are to be provided through the EU's Cohesion Fund, and
will cover in most cases between 85 and 90 per cent of the total
cost of such projects.
<P>The transport sector projects include two plans aiming to
improve transportation from various outlying areas to the center
of Athens with the construction of a new railway line to Corinth
(Ecu 140 million), and of a railway carriage sorting station
west of the capital. The projects are estimated to significantly
reduce the journey time between Athens to Patra, and from Patra
to Thessaloniki.
<P>The transport projects also include the Patra- Athens -
Thessaloniki highway, which is to be funded with ECU 74.4
million.
<P>The environmental projects concern drainage, biological waste
treatment plants and the Evinos River dam.
<H3><A NAME="14">[14]</A> Kavala business delegation attend Belgrade trade fair</H3>
<H4>Athens, 20/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
A Greek business delegation from Kavala, representing mainly the
food and beverage sector, has participated in an international
trade fair in Belgrade as part of an attempt to enter the
Yugoslav market.
<P>The head of the delegation and president of the Kavala chamber,
Apostolos Mardyris, met on the sidelines of the exhibition with
the president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Commercial
Chamber, Michaelo Milosevic, and the president of the Serbian
Commercial Chamber, B. Stoicovic.
<P>The Kavala Chamber delegation also held a meeting with
representatives from the Valievo Chamber in Serbia, with both
delegations signing a co-operation agreement.
<H3><A NAME="15">[15]</A> Bourse approves bonds loan</H3>
<H4>Athens, 20/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
The board of the Athens Stock Exchange has approved the entry
into the bourse of a bonds loan amounting to 20 billion drachmas
by the International Reconstruction and Development Bank at its
board meeting yesterday.
<P>The board also approved the papers concerning an increase in the
share capital of the insurance company &quot;European Reliance AEGA&quot;,
to enable it to join the main market of the bourse.
<P>Another issue examined was the prolonged rise in the ELBIEMEK
company's shares. The company was called on to explain possible
substantive events justifying the continuous rise.
<H3><A NAME="16">[16]</A> OECD forecasts 3 per cent growth in '97</H3>
<H4>Paris, 20/12/1996 (ANA/AFP)</H4>
Greece will have a growth rate near 3 per cent in 1997 but is in
danger of maintaining an increased public deficit, high
inflation and unemployment as well as a drop in competitiveness,
an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
report stated.
<P>The report said growth reached 2.5 per cent in 1996, which is
higher than the European Union average, thanks to salary
increases which precipitated an increase in household
consumption, as well as to an increase in public investments
supported by EU funds.
<P>However, the report notes, inflation stood at 8.5 per cent,
higher than the government's convergence target, while efforts
to limit the public deficit to 7.6 per cent of GDP in 1996 will
be &quot;difficult to attain.&quot; Consequently, the target of 4.2 per
cent for 1997 is in danger of being missed, according to the
OECD, which estimates that the deficit is not expected to be
reduced by more than 1.5 per cent next year.
<P>The report also refers to &quot;uncertainties&quot; which exist concerning
a reduction in interest rates and the rate of de-escalation of
inflation, despite the declared intention of the government to
persist with its &quot;hard drachma&quot; policy. Expansion of production
&quot;may not be enough to avert a rise in unemployment, due to the
fact that undertakings are continuing their process of
restructuring,&quot; the OECD report notes.
<H3><A NAME="17">[17]</A> Mastroianni death noted</H3>
<H4>Athens, 20/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Greek Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos called the death
yesterday of Italian film star Marcello Mastroianni a &quot;loss of
life, not a loss of memory.&quot;
<P>Mastroianni died at the age of 73 at his home in Paris. He had
been treated for pancreatic cancer over the past few months.
<P>&quot;As an actor, Mastroianni transformed the role to a real-life
person,&quot; Mr. Venizelos noted.
<H3><A NAME="18">[18]</A> Jules Dassin to become honorary Greek citizen</H3>
<H4>Athens, 20/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos yesterday called for
honorary Greek citizenship to be extended to renowned French
film and stage director Jules Dassin, husband of the late
actress and former culture minister Melina Mercouri.
<P>&quot;Being a Greek has never been simply a legal formality, but is
deeply linked with a prevalence of ideals, a field of historic
memory and collective dignity,&quot; Mr. Venizelos said in a letter
to Interior, Public Administration and Decentralization Minister
Alexandros Papadopoulos.
<P>&quot;Jules Dassin has acquired this bond of physical and moral
citizenship of our country through his personal stance in
difficult times,&quot; Mr. Venizelos added, calling for procedures to
be immediately set in motion to extend honorary citizenship to
Mr. Dassin.
<P>&quot;I propose, therefore, that you initiate procedures, ex officio,
to formally make Jules Dassin a Greek citizen. The country owes
this to him for all that he has done, together with Melina, and
continues to do on his own for the international projection of
Greece,&quot; the letter said.
<H3><A NAME="19">[19]</A> Bendit urges radical change in anti-drug policies</H3>
<H4>Athens, 20/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Green Eurodeputy and former leftist firebrand Daniel con Bendit
urged adoption of a European Union anti-prohibition policy in
relation to drug substances and legalization of so-called &quot;soft&quot;
drugs, as well as the free provision of &quot;hard&quot; ones or their
substitutes under strict medical control.
<P>Mr. Bendit made his proposal in a speech at the Athens Economic
University (ASOEE) yesterday. Speeches were also made by
Alternate Foreign Minister George Papandreou, New Generation
General Secretary Petros Sfikakis and deputy and former leader
of the Coalition of the Left and Progress (Synaspismos) Maria
Damanaki. The event was jointly organized by the New Generation
General Secretariat, the Continuous Youth Committee for Drugs
and the International Anti-Prohibition Union.
<P>Mr. Bendit then referred to official figures outlining the
magnitude of the development of the illegal drugs trade. Its
annual turnover amounts to US$ 500 billion, with the price of
substances being 1,700 times greater than their purchase value
from Third World farmers.
<P>&quot;Mobilize as many armies as you like. Only 10 per cent of drug
trafficking is seized and the sole thing further prosecution
will achieve is some sort of an increase in the above percentage
with, however, a parallel increase in the price of drugs in the
illegal trade as well,&quot; he said.
<P>Pondering whether all drugs should be allowed freely, Mr. Bendit
said &quot;this not so responsible proposal is the neo-conservative
one which was discussed in the US in Reagan's time.&quot;
<P>&quot;Our model is aimed at an immediate restriction of the danger
and anticipates legalization of soft drugs, the granting of
methadone (and even heroin in special cases) under strict
medical control and briefing for young people on the real
dangers linked to each substance,&quot; he added.
<P>Mr. Papandreou, Mr. Sfikakis and Ms Damanaki agreed in general
with the above views.
<P>Mr. Papandreou referred to his recent experience from the
conflict between the two policies concerning drug substances.
The conflict was also visible during the European Union summit
in Dublin, where &quot;French President Jacques Chirac demanded
consolidation of a suppression policy all over Europe.&quot;
<P>Mr. Papandreou, openly favoring the contrary conception, said
that &quot;in society conceptions on drugs appear to have a mythical
and religious aspect&quot; and that the dominant approach did not
produce results.
<P>&quot;The legalization of 'soft' drugs and implementation of
methadone programs is the sole solution for handling the
problem,&quot; he said.
<P>At the same time, Mr. Papandreou proposed an open social
dialogue on the issue, as well as collecting and comparing
experiences gained by various countries.
<P>Mr. Papandreou reserved the right to support the
anti-suppression view together with the Netherlands (they hold
the next rotating European Union presidency as of January)
during the next summit.
<H3><A NAME="20">[20]</A> Rhodes to host &quot;Culture Marathon&quot;</H3>
<H4>Athens, 20/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Greece will host a major international athletics event on the
island of Rhodes on April 20 next year on the occasion of the
50th anniversary of the incorporation of the Dodecanese islands
in the modern Greek state.
<P>The &quot;Rhodes Culture Marathon,&quot; organized by Rhodes municipality,
will follow a route taking in most of the island's ancient
monuments.
<P>It is based on an idea conceived by philhellene Sudanese
journalist Meki Abdelatif who last year organized the &quot;Nile
Culture Marathon.&quot;
<P>Runners from 21 countries of Europe, Africa, Asia and America
will be taking part in the marathon, while parallel events will
be attended, among others, by six ministers from Africa.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> Pangalos satisfied with Britain's positions after talks with
Rifkind</H3>
<H4>London, 19/12/1996 (ANA - L. Tsirigotakis)</H4>
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos expressed satisfaction
yesterday over his talks here with British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind, noting that Britain's positions on the Cyprus
problem and Greek-Turkish relations are very positive.
<P>Reiterating that Britain sets no prerequisite for the
commencement of negotiations for a Cyprus-EU accession, Mr.
Pangalos said that &quot;it is now clear that the United Kingdom does
not set as a prerequisite for the start of entry negotiations a
settlement to the Cyprus issue, or even the start of talks for a
Cyprus settlement.&quot;
<P>&quot;But they (Britain) say, and this I will not have trouble
accepting myself, that if there is progress on the Cyprus
problem then negotiations between the Union and Cyprus would be
much easier, conducted in a better atmosphere and concern the
entire population of Cyprus.&quot; &quot;We do not want a Cyprus' EU
accession to be to the detriment of the Turkish Cypriot
community,&quot; Mr. Pangalos added.
<P>Both ministers said negotiations for Cyprus' accession would
commence according to a schedule already decided by the EU,
namely, six months after the end of the IGC.
<P>Asked to comment on the British minister's statements regarding
an &quot;arms race&quot; in Cyprus, which Mr. Rifkind termed as &quot;a step in
the wrong direction,&quot; Mr. Pangalos said:
<P>&quot;Athens, and I believe Nicosia also, are in favor of a decrease
in armaments, in favor of demilitarization of Cyprus. But
demilitarization must first start from the mightier,&quot; he added.
<P>Mr. Pangalos said Turkey has not yet accepted the idea of the
demilitarization of the island and retains there 300 tanks,
heavy artillery and 40,000 Turkish soldiers.&quot;
<P>Earlier, both men told reporters that they had so far discussed
the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC), European issues and
bilateral relations.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> Gov't spokesman</H3>
<H4>Athens, 19/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
In a related development, Athens announced yesterday that a
statement by Mr. Rifkind on Tuesday, in which he referred to the
possibility of a war between Greece and Turkey in the Aegean,
was the minister's &quot;personal opinion.&quot;
<P>&quot;This opinion does not reflect the actual situation,&quot; government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said, stressing that the policy
proposed by Greece for de-escalating tension between Athens and
Ankara could constitute the basis for peace in the region.
<P>&quot;The prospect of a military conflict is a long way off,&quot; Mr.
Reppas added.
<P>Mr. Rifkind later clarified that he had made the comment when
speaking &quot;generally&quot;, and against the background of the Imia
incident in late January, which resulted in a Greek-Turkish
military stand-off in the Aegean.
<P>He made the clarification during a break in talks with Mr.
Pangalos.
<P>When asked if he shared Mr. Rifkind's concern, Mr. Pangalos
replied:
<P>&quot;We live with these concerns every day, we have learned to live
with them as well as with the frequent Turkish violations of our
air space, and we continuously inform international public
opinion about Turkey's behavior,&quot; the Greek minister added.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> Turkish response</H3>
<H4>Athens, 19/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Meanwhile, Ankara expressed opposition to almost all of Mr.
Rifkind's points on a Cyprus settlement announced in Nicosia
last Monday, although it underlined its satisfaction at the
foreign secretary's meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash in occupied Nicosia, and his recommendation for direct
talks between the two communities on the Mediterranean island.
<P>An ANA dispatch from Istanbul quoted a Turkish foreign ministry
spokesman as expressing a hope that &quot;other states'
representatives will show the same sensitivity shown by Mr.
Rifkind (i.e. his meeting with Mr. Denktash).&quot;
<P>He added, however, that Mr. Rifkind's views regarding
guarantees, security and Cyprus' accession to the European Union
&quot;are issues concerning the 1960 guarantor agreements, for which
Turkey is directly concerned.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> Euro Court condemns Turkey for human rights violations in Cyprus</H3>
<H4>Nicosia, 19/12/1996 (ANA/CNA)</H4>
President Glafcos Clerides said a decision yesterday by the
European Court of Human Rights, which found Turkey guilty of
continuing human rights violations, will have immense effects on
the Cyprus problem.
<P>Attorney General Alecos Markides described the decision as
&quot;historic&quot;.
<P>Yesterday's ruling by the Strasbourg-based court marks an
unprecedented move which offers the opportunity to hundreds of
Greek Cypriot refugees to claim their right to use and enjoy
their property in the Turkish-occupied part of the island
republic.
<P>The court found Turkey responsible for continuing violation of
human rights in the Turkish-occupied areas of Cyprus and said in
its ruling that it &quot;holds by 11 votes to six that denial of
access to the applicants' property and consequent loss of
control thereof is imputable to Turkey.&quot;
<P>The court's decision was warmly welcomed by lawyer Achilleas
Demetriades, who argued the case before the European Court on
behalf of his client, Greek Cypriot refugee Titina Loizidou, a
summer resident of the currently Turkish-occupied port city of
Kyrenia.
<P>Describing the decision as a &quot;great success&quot;, President Clerides
noted that Ms Loizidou's case was justified even though it was
over a holiday residence.
<P>&quot;The effects of such a decision can be even greater, if we take
account the cases of permanent residents forced to abandon their
homes&quot;, Mr. Clerides added.
<P>Speaking at a press conference, the attorney general said &quot;the
ruling is a landmark in the history of law relating to human
rights and the development of international law&quot;.
<P>This decision, he added, by such a legal body proves there is
faith in the role of international law and the Convention of
human rights.
<P>Mr. Markides noted the importance of the decision in that it
holds Turkey responsible for human rights violations, and since
it controls the occupied part of the island, and rejected
Turkey's arguments that it bears no responsibility in this part
of Cyprus.
<P>&quot;The violation of human rights by Turkey is continuing&quot;, Mr.
Markides explained and referred to the text of the decision
which says that the Turkish army &quot;exercises effective overall
control in northern Cyprus&quot; through a large number of troops
&quot;engaged in active duties there&quot;.
<P>The decision also states that the &quot;Republic of Cyprus remains
the sole legitimate government of Cyprus&quot; and that the
international community does not regard the puppet regime in
occupied Cyprus as a state under international law.
<P>Mr. Markides also explained that peace negotiations for a
political settlement of the Cyprus question are not related to a
case such as this one.
<P>Mr. Demetriades, who took Turkey to the court seven years ago,
told the press conference that the ruling acknowledges that the
property in question &quot;was, is and will remain the property of my
client.&quot;
<P>He explained that he has already asked for half a million Cyprus
pounds in compensation (about one million US dollars) with
regard to the denial of access to the property and has also
asked to exercise freely the right to peacefully enjoy her
property.
<P>Should Turkey refuse to pay damages, the applicant can ask for
yesterday's ruling to be implemented with regard to Turkey's
property or funds allocated to the country by international
organizations.
<P>Polis Polyviou, a lawyer with the government's legal department,
described the decision as &quot;historic&quot;, because it makes clear
that Turkey is responsible for what happens in the occupied
areas and points out that legal rights exist irrespective of
military circumstances.
<P>&quot;Perhaps more importantly, the decision does not recognize any
legal status to the illegal Turkish Cypriot regime in occupied
Cyprus, which in turn would render any attempt to recognize this
self-styled entity almost impossible&quot;, Mr. Polyviou said.
<P>In a statement from Strasbourg, Ms Loizidou said the decision
was &quot;a victory for Cyprus and proves that Europe does recognize
justice and cares that justice should be done&quot;.
<P>&quot;It is a very important decision, not only for me but for all
the Cypriot refugees who have not been able to go home and to
their properties since 1974,&quot; the statement added. About 200,000
Greek Cypriots were forced to leave their homes when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island
republic in 1974.
<P>A press release issued yesterday said the European Court &quot;held
that the denial of the applicant of access to her property in
the northern part of Cyprus and consequent loss of control
thereof was imputable to Turkey and amounted to a violation of
the applicant's property rights, under Article 1 of Protocol 1
to the European Convention of Human Rights&quot;.
<P>The court also held &quot;unanimously that there had been no
interference with the applicant's right to respect for her home
under Article 8 of the Convention, and that the question of just
satisfaction under Article 50 was not yet ready for decision and
should be reserved.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> Dutch foreign minister comments on Greek-Turkish relations</H3>
<H4>Brussels, 19/12/1996 (ANA - M. Spinthourakis)</H4>
Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo, whose country will hold
the rotating European Union presidency as of Jan. 1 1997, said
that a discussion held in Dublin on Saturday between Turkish
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller, in whose honor a dinner was
given, and Greek Alternate Foreign Minister George Papandreou
was encouraging and hopeful.
<P>During the presentation of his country's program for the EU
presidency and replying to a question on how the Dutch EU
presidency plans to handle Turkey's relations with the EU, Mr.
Mierlo referred primarily to Greek-Turkish relations, saying
that he h ad the pleasure of attending a hopeful dialogue
between the Greek and Turkish sides in Dublin.
<P>&quot;I have the feeling that both Greece and Turkey are ready to
start a dialogue both on their bilateral relations and on
Turkey's relations with the EU. I had the privilege of attending
Saturday's dinner and I believe that we must encourage dialogue
between the two sides,&quot; he said.
<P>The Dutch presidency also referred to relations between the EU
and Cyprus, placing emphasis on the participation of the two
communities in the dialogue for Cyprus' accession to the EU.
<P>Deputy Foreign Minister Michiel Patijn said &quot;everybody is aware
of the island's division&quot;, stressing that &quot;when accession talks
will start they should concern both communities of the island
and not just one.&quot;
<P>However, according to EU diplomats, this reference can in no way
be interpreted as a change in present factors, or as an effort
to equate the legal government of Cyprus with the Denktash
regime in the framework of the pre-accession dialogue.
<P>EU diplomats said it was a reiteration of the EU's known
position that the accession of Cyprus should be beneficial for
both communities.
<P>&quot;The European Commission's adjudication concerning the accession
of Cyprus has already been publicized. This adjudication is
positive, but the division of Cyprus is a major problem. This
issue should draw the attention of the Dutch presidency,&quot; the
programme stated.
<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> New NATO mission to Bosnia approved</H3>
<H4>Brussels, 19/12/1996 (ANA - M. Savva)</H4>
The NATO Defense Ministers' Council approved a new mission to
Bosnia at the end of its two-day session yesterday.
<P>The formation of the new corps, named Stabilization Force
(SFOR), will be activated tomorrow for a period of 18 months.
<P>&quot;This force will continue the successful intervention of its
predecessor, IFOR, with the aim of stabilizing peace in Bosnia,&quot;
National Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos, who attended the
session, said.
<P>He added that the size of the Greek contingent would remain the
same, i.e. 250 men, one C-130 transport aircraft, and vessels
patrolling in the Adriatic.
<P>Mr. Tsohatzopoulos discussed the issue during a meeting with his
Belgian counterpart, and matters of common interest with British
counterpart, which included the terms and conditions for NATO's
internal evolution.
<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> Greek-Turkish relations</H3>
<H4>Athens, 19/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Questioned about an earlier statement by Dutch Foreign Minister
Hans van Mierlo, regarding a dialogue between Greece and Turkey
which, he claimed, &quot;began in Dublin&quot;, Mr. Tsohatzopoulos said,
&quot;I do not know of any dialogue between Greece and Turkey. Turkey
must respect international treaties and conventions... And, of
course, on the issue of the continental shelf, we are willing to
go to the International Court at The Hague.&quot;
<P>Regarding the dialogue envisaged before the opening of entry
negotiations between Cyprus and the EU, he said it will be
&quot;exclusively carried out by the Republic of Cyprus, but the
final solution we are seeking of course concerns the both
communities living on the island.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</A> Stephanopoulos to visit Egypt, meet with Mubarak</H3>
<H4>Athens, 19/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
President Kostis Stephanopoulos leaves tomorrow for a four-day
official visit to Alexandria and Cairo at the invitation of his
Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak.
<P>The two heads of state will have talks on Saturday in Cairo
covering bilateral relations, international developments and
problems in the region of the southeast Mediterranean.
<P>Mr. Stephanopoulos is also expected to brief Mr. Mubarak on
major Greek foreign policy issues such as the Cyprus problem and
Greek-Turkish relations.
<P>Mr. Mubarak will brief Mr. Stephanopoulos on developments in the
Middle East problem, given Egypt's leading role in the Arab
world. Mr. Stephanopoulos' visit to Egypt takes on special
significance in view of Mr. Mubarak's visit to Turkey in July an
d Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's visit to Cairo in
October.
<P>During his stay in Egypt, Mr. Stephanopoulos will meet with
members of the Greek community and visit Luxor.
<P>It is the first visit to Egypt by a Greek president since March
1984, when Constantine Karamanlis had talks with President
Mubarak.
<H3><A NAME="09">[09]</A> President, prime minister confer</H3>
<H4>Athens, 19/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
President of the Republic Kostis Stephanopoulos and Prime
Minister Costas Simitis held a meeting yesterday focusing on the
recent Dublin summit, Greece's relations with the European
Union, Turkish demands and Ankara's aggressive policies, the
Greek economy and other domestic issues. The two men also
discussed the farmers' protests and continuing blockades in
northern Greece.
<H3><A NAME="10">[10]</A> Talks between Greece, FYROM resume</H3>
<H4>New York, 19/12/1996 (ANA - M. Georgiadou)</H4>
Talks between Greece's permanent representative to the United
Nations, Christos Zacharakis, and the Former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia's (FYROM) representative, Ivan Tosevski, resumed
here yesterday on the issue of the one-time Yugoslav republic's
name.
<P>The talks were held under the aegis of special UN mediator Cyrus
Vance. After the end of the session, Mr. Vance said that &quot;the
two sides are expected to meet again in January, at a date to be
determined in the near future.&quot;
<P>He added that he would continue providing his services until the
completion of the talks, irrespective of the election of the new
UN secretary general.
<P>Mr. Vance replied negatively on a question on whether the two
sides had submitted specific name formulas on the negotiating
table.
<P>Questioned whether his country had the political will to proceed
to an amendment of its constitution regarding its name, Mr.
Tosevski replied, &quot;my country has the will to solve the problem.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="11">[11]</A> Diplomatic corps' strike suspended</H3>
<H4>Athens, 19/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
A strike called by the foreign ministry's diplomatic employees
will be suspended as of Monday after the Union of Diplomatic
Employees' general assembly reached a majority decision on the
issue yesterday. Consequently, diplomats will not turn up for
work today and tomorrow.
<P>According to reports, the diplomats' representatives received
assurances from the government that their claim that an overseas
bonus should not be taxed will be examined in January, before
the tax bill is tabled in Parliament. In the event their claim
is not satisfied the strike will be resumed.
<P>The diplomats' union provided special permission for diplomats
to accompany President of the Republic Kostis Stephanopoulos on
his four-day official visit to Egypt, which begins tomorrow.
<H3><A NAME="12">[12]</A> Gov't promises compensation for recent crop losses, blockades
continue</H3>
<H4>Athens, 19/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Agriculture Minister Stephanos Tzoumakas announced yesterday
that farmers who have incurred losses due to bad weather would
receive compensation, as farmers continued to blockade roads
around the country for the 21th consecutive day.
<P>Speaking at a press conference, Mr. Tzoumakas said that
compensation payments would be made in January to farmers whose
crops or facilities were damaged by recent bad weather.
<P>He said the ministry was in the process of drawing up lists of
the damage which will be sent to the European Union in order for
the corresponding compensation to be approved.
<P>The compensation, estimated at 10 billion drachmas, will be
given to farmers in Thessaly, Karditsa, Trikala, Larissa, Volos,
Xanthi, the island of Mytilene and other areas of the country.
<P>Replying to questions, Mr. Tzoumakas clarified that the funds
would be made available from the Second Community Support
Framework, a procedure which had been approved by the European
Commission.
<P>Mr. Tzoumakas also announced that the Agricultural Policy
Council would be convened for the first time on Jan. 10, the
sessions of which would be opened by Prime Minister Costas
Simitis.
<P>Opposition party leaders and 43 representatives of producer
classes, mainly farmers, exporters and industrialists active in
the agricultural sector, have also been invited to attend the
council.
<P>Although no agenda has yet been prepared, it is expected that
the meeting will discuss problems facing the agricultural sector.
<P>Meanwhile, the board of the union of truck drivers was scheduled
to meet at 6 p.m. yesterday to decide whether or not they would
use their vehicles to block roads to Athens today, in order to
prevent farmers from reaching the capital to take part in a
protest rally.
<P>If the truckers decide to block access to the capital, it will
be in protest against the 21-day blockade of roads by farmers,
which has left hundreds of drivers stranded.
<P>In another development, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas
reiterated yesterday that the government will not enter talks
with protesting farmers if the latter do not end the blockades.
<P>Stressing that protesting farmers have not so far expressed a
desire to meet with government officials, Mr. Reppas said the
government was willing at any time to enter dialogue with the
farmers.
<P>He told reporters he did not anticipate any violent clashes
today when the farmers take the streets of Athens to demand
satisfaction of their claims.
<P>In a related development, farmers in northern Greece began to
dismantle roadblocks which have stood in place since the
beginning of protests three weeks ago.
<P>At midnight Tuesday night, farmers and stockbreeders in the
southern part of Evros prefecture suspended their protest action
and lifted a roadblock at the Ardanios junction, freeing the
flow of traffic between Alexandroupolis and the Greek-Turkish
border.
<P>The decision meant that 110 international transport trucks
coming from Turkey, which had been stranded at the Kipi border
post for a fortnight, could continue their journey to Greece and
other European countries.
<P>Conversely, farmers in the north of the Evros prefecture
maintained their blockades at three points, resulting in the
closure of roads and border crossings.
<P>Yesterday afternoon, the farmers' coordinating committee for
Macedonia and Thrace decided to lift their blockade of the road
linking Thessaloniki with the Macedonia International airport as
goodwill gesture to the government.
<P>The committee, however, decided to maintain the blockade of
other roads in the prefectures of Thessaloniki, Imathia and in
central Macedonia until Friday, when it will reconvene to
examine the situation.

<H4>Athens, 19/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
The value of industrial production lost as a result of farmers'
mobilizations amounts to 56 billion drachmas, a sum representing
0.7 per cent of the estimated total for 1996, Association of
Greek Industries (SEB) President Iason Stratos told reporters.
<P>He added that deliveries of industrial goods were down by 134
billion drachmas, of which 84 billion were destined for the
domestic market, and the rest abroad, while 208,000 working days
had been lost, corresponding to some two billion drachmas.

<H3><A NAME="15">[15]</A> Papantoniou says tabled '97 budget follows 'necessary' economic
policy</H3>
<H4>Athens, 19/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
National Economy Minister Yiannos Papantoniou outlined the
government's economic policy on the second day of Parliamentary
debate on the 1997 state budget yesterday, stressing that it
will be a difficult year.
<P>Appearing optimistic over the outcome of economic policy, he
said it is a necessary policy, which is both a just and
effective at the same time.
<P>Mr. Papantoniou called on businessmen, working people and
property owners to de-escalate their nominal incomes claims, so
as to safeguard their real incomes in a better way with a
decrease in inflation.
<P>Referring to the economy in general, he said inflation decreased
by 5.9 percentage points, the economy recovered by 6.2 points
over the last three-year period of economic output anticipated
by the Convergence Program, while the deficit was decreased b y
6.6 units of the GDP.
<P>Mr. Papantoniou said that despite progress achieved, the country
still had a great deal of ground to cover to achieve real and
nominal convergence with its other European partners.
<P>He said the progress of the economy, either collective or
individual, the long-term interests of the working people and
the weaker classes depended on the country's ability to converge
with the development levels of the other European Union
member-states.
<H3><A NAME="16">[16]</A> Soumakis condemns dockers' refusal to allow foreign vessels to
disembark passengers</H3>
<H4>Athens, 19/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Merchant Marine Minister Stavros Soumakis said yesterday it was
unacceptable for foreign-flagged vessels to be prevented from
entering or leaving Greek ports by the ongoing nationwide
dockworkers' and seamen's strike.
<P>&quot;This kind of logic serves neither the interests of the seamen
nor of shipping in general...,&quot; Mr. Soumakis said, when asked to
comment on the decision of the Panhellenic Seamen's Federation
(PNO) on Tuesday to extend a 48-hour strike which began on
Monday for a further two days.
<P>In a related development, minor incidents broke out at
Igoumenitsa, western Greece, when two foreign-flagged ferryboats
headed for Ancona, Italy tired to dock at the port to let off
passengers.
<P>The two vessels, the &quot;Ionian Star&quot; and the &quot;Brindisi&quot;, both of
which belong to Greek companies, had previously been given
permission by the PNO administrative board to dock at
Igoumenitsa, because they were sailing under foreign flags.
However, when the first ferryboat let its ramp down, about 20
striking dockworkers boarded her and tried to persuade the few
Greek crew members to join the strike. At the same time, dozens
of trucks began to move towards the ramp to disembark,
triggering strong protests from the striking workers.
<P>The port police intervened to restore order and arrested three
striking dockworkers who were released shortly afterwards.
<P>A similar incident took place at Piraeus when five trucks tried
to board the ferryboat &quot;Daedalus&quot; with destination Crete. Again,
scuffles broke out between drivers and striking dockworkers
until order was restored by a public prosecutor.
<P>Meanwhile, more than 300 trucks were stranded at the central
port city of Patras yesterday morning.
<P>The trucks were scheduled to board ferry boats to Italy and
Piraeus.

<H4>Brussels, 19/12/1996 (ANA - G. Daratos)</H4>
The budget committee of the European Parliament has rejected two
proposals by the European Commission for the funding of projects
in Turkey, worth a total of ECU 50 million, within the framework
of the Mediterranean Assistance Program (MEDA).
<P>The reason cited for the rejection was that EU Commissioner Hans
van den Broek did not submit the necessary documents with the
applications for approval of funds.
<P>It may be noted that Mr. van den Broek did not take into account
the Commission's commitment to the Europarliament that any
funding of Turkey through MEDA should concern improvement of
human rights in Turkey, and the economic development of the
areas where the Kurdish minority lives.
<H3><A NAME="18">[18]</A> Airport employees strike tomorrow</H3>
<H4>Athens, 19/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Airport employees will stage a 24-hour nationwide strike on
Friday demanding improvements in their wages and other fringe
benefits, the Federation of Civil Aviation Employee Associations
(OSYPA) announced yesterday.
<P>The announcement said that the employees are demanding that four
benefits they receive be excluded from the new salary scale, an
8.0 per cent salary increase, and legislation regarding overtime
and holiday remuneration.
<P>Olympic Airways (OA) officials said they expected only minor
problems on tarmacs from the stoppage, as air traffic
controllers and civil aviation technical staff were not taking
part in the strike.

between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. on Christmas Eve and on Jan. 3, and at
the same times and place on Sunday, Dec. 22.
<P>The same measures will be applied on the same dates and times at

<H3><A NAME="21">[21]</A> Commission decides to continue tobacco subsidies, anti-smoking
campaign</H3>
<H4>Brussels, 19/12/1996 (ANA - P.Pantelis)</H4>
After discussions lasting many years, the European Commission
yesterday decided to maintain supports to tobacco growers, but
for radically improved varieties and to continue a strong
anti-smoking campaign.
<P>The anti-smoking campaign had originally envisaged the gradual
abolition of tobacco subsidies. In a press conference yesterday,
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said the Commission had
opted for a radical change in the tobacco support system,
because the abolition of supports altogether would have serious
repercussions on 200,000 jobs in the tobacco production and
manufacturing sectors.
<P>&quot;The European Commission estimates the number of tobacco
growers' families at about 135,000, of which 52 per cent are in
Greece, and 31 per cent in Italy. For many of these tobacco
growers there is no alternative. If tobacco growing is
abolished, they will have to leave agriculture,&quot; he said.
<P>He added that it had been found that tobacco production did not
correspond to contemporary demands regarding processing and
quality, and for this reason the Commission decided to
discriminate in favor of improved varieties in granting supports.
<P>Greek EU Commissioner Christos Papoutsis issued a statement
calling for safeguards for the income of tobacco growers in the
less developed parts of the Community, and expressing the view
that a fall in tobacco production, far from leading to a
corresponding reduction in smoking, would lead to a significant
increase in tobacco imports from third countries.
<P>All of the EU Commissioners agreed with Mr. Papoutsis' second
observation.

Xanthi until the year 2000. Mr. Laliotis headed a government
delegation that toured Xanthi's flood-stricken villages.

<H4>Athens, 19/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
The environmental organization &quot;Mediter-ranean SOS&quot; yesterday
warned of the dangers posed by Turkish plans to build the
country's first nuclear power plant at Akkuyu in the area of
Mersin on its eastern Mediterranean coast.
<P>In an announcement, the organization called on local government,
ecological groups and citizens in Greece, Turkey and Cyprus to
co-operate in protesting the planned construction.
<P>Mersin lies to the north of Cyprus and just 300 kilometers from
the Dodecanese islands.
<P>The plans to build the plant, which have been discussed for the
past 30 years, have already been opposed by environmentalists
and local government authorities in Mersin.
<P>Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said in May that Greece
would pull out all stops to halt construction of the plant.
<P>Mediterranean SOS condemned what it called &quot;the promotion of
unsafe technology in the Balkans by the nuclear lobby and the
nuclear mafia&quot; at a time when nuclear energy is being abandoned
in countries with a strong ecology movement.
<P>In the announcement, the organization also called for the
closure of the six reactors at Kozloduy in Bulgaria, the closure
of the nuclear plant at Korsk in Slovenia and an end to
construction of five nuclear reactors in Romania.

Basketball's governing body, FIBA, has ordered a Korac Cup match
between Aris of Thessaloniki and Besiktas of Istanbul to be
replayed in Athens on January 7 without the presence of

<P>The second leg of the tie was held in Thessaloniki on December

Dinos Angelidis.
<P>Aris was ahead 40-31 when the match was abandoned.
<P>FIBA also suspended Angelidis for three matches, Alexander for
four and fined Aris 45,000 marks (about 6.8 million drachmas).

Athens' ambassador to Lima, Alcibiades Karokis, is among the
approximately 200 hostages being held by Peruvian rebels at the
Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima, foreign ministry

<P>Guerrillas from the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA)
stormed the Japanese ambassador's residency late Tuesday in an
operation they codenamed &quot;Breaking the Silence&quot; in order to
demand the release of jailed comrades.
<P>The hostages, which include the Peruvian foreign and agriculture
ministers, local legislators and numerous ambassadors and
diplomats from around the world, were attending a reception in
honor of the Japanese emperor's birthday.
<P>The same sources said Ambassador Karokis' wife was among the
approximately 80 women and elderly released.

The Alexandros Onassis Foundation honored several athletes and
their coaches yesterday that distinguished themselves in the
recent Atlanta Olympics.
<P>The event at a downtown Athens hotel was attended by several
Olympic medallists as well as by players of the national
basketball and water polo teams.
<P>The foundation is the sole private body which has begun an
effort over the past 10 years to support sports in Greece by
offering athletic scholarships, up to 83 so far. Among those
studying with the foundation's scholarships are gymnastics
Olympic gold medallist Yiannis Melissanidis, national
high-jumping champion Lambros Papakostas and wrestling champion
Iordanis Constantinidis.
<P>Speaking at the event, the foundation's President Stelios
Papadimitriou said the board will also provide scholarships for
the children of the Olympic champions. Namely, a full university
scholarship in Greece and then an overseas scholarship for
post-graduate studies.
<P>&quot;...We all hope that the Olympics will soon be held in the
country which also gave birth to the Olympic Games and what they
represent in ideals,&quot; Mr. Papadimitriou said.
<P>&quot;Unfortunately, it was not only the (Parthenon) marbles which
were forced to leave for foreign countries in dark times of
Hellenism. It is these and even more which Greek civilization,
on its knees, was forcibly deprived of...&quot; he added.
<H3><A NAME="29">[29]</A> Euro Court clears Greece in Jehovah Witness ruling</H3>
Strasbourg, 19/12/1996 (Reuter/ANA)
<P>The European Court of Human Rights ruled on Wednesday that a
Greek headmaster acted legally in suspending a young Jehovah's
Witness from school for refusing to march in a parade on
Greece's national day.
<P>The court threw out a complaint by the parents of Victoria
Vlasamis of Athens that their daughter, a follower of the
Jehovah's Witness Christian sect, should have had the right to
refuse on religious grounds.
<P>She was later suspended from school for a day as a punishment.
<P>The parents argued that her religion espoused pacifism and the
Greek national day, celebrated on October 28, commemorated the
outbreak of war between Greece and Italy in 1940. The court
expressed surprise at Greece's insistence that marching in the
parade was part of the required national school curriculum, but
concluded that such celebrations &quot;served, in their way, both
pacifist objectives and the public interest&quot;.
<P>The court criticised Greece for failing to offer Victoria's
parents legal avenue to raise their complaint with the Greek
authorities before bringing it to the European Court and awarded
the family 600,000 drachmas for legal costs.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> Debate on budget begins in Parliament amid strike actions</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Parliamentary debate on the government's new 1997 state budget
began yesterday afternoon, while the General Confederation of
Workers of Greece (GSEE) staged a protest rally outside the
legislature against the government's economic policy.
<P>A vote on the budget will be taken on Saturday evening.
<P>The Parliamentary debate was accompanied by a 24-hour nationwide
strike called by the Civil Servants Supreme Administrative
Council (ADEDY).
<P>A delegation of ADEDY met with National Economy and Finance
Minister Yiannos Papantoniou, who did not rule out the
possibility of improvements being made to the unified salary
scale.
<P>Elementary school and kindergarten teachers continued their
mobilizations, while the Panhellenic Seamen's Federation (PNO)
decided to continue the 48-hour strike called on all
Greek-flagged vessels.
<P>In another development, farmers from Thessaly in central Greece
and their families will hold a rally in Athens tomorrow. The
farmers' roadblocks in Kastro, Voiotia and on the road leading
to the city of Edessa opened yesterday, while farmers in
Thessaloniki will decide today on whether they will maintain
their roadblocks.
<P>The government has ruled out the possibility of Prime Minister
Costas Simitis meeting the farmers for as long as tractors
remain on the streets.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> High-ranking meeting focuses on national issues</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Prime Minister Costas Simitis chaired a meeting on national
issues at the Maximos Mansion yesterday with the participation
of Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, Alternate Foreign
Minister George Papandreou, Foreign Under-secretary Christos
Rozakis and Eurodeputy Yiannos Kranidiotis.
<P>According to government sources, the meeting focused on the
Cyprus issue, Greek-Turkish relations, Greek tactics in light of
the upcoming US initiative, as well as proposals made by
Washington and the UN on measures aimed at defusing tension on
the island republic. An exchange of views also followed on the
proposals presented in Nicosia by British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind, and in light of his meeting in London with Mr.
Pangalos and Mr. Kranidiotis today.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> UN spokesman says no proposal on FYROM name submitted so far</H3>
<H4>Skopje, 18/12/1996 (ANA - M. Vihou)</H4>
A spokesman for United Nations mediator Cyrus Vance said in New
York yesterday that no proposal on a descriptive name concerning
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) has been
submitted so far, according to a broadcast by the private
channel A1.
<P>The spokesman said the new round of talks, concerning the
finding of a compromise name for FYROM, has not yet started and
that consultations are taking place but it is yet unknown when
they will get underway.
<P>Meanwhile, after news of the appointment of Kofi Anan as UN
secretary general, the media in Skopje presented past statements
by Mr. Anan when he had visited Skopje in his capacity as the
official responsible for the UN peacekeeping forces in the
former Yugoslavia.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> Avramopoulos on official Tirana visit</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Athens Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos leaves for Tirana today at
the invitation of his local counterpart.
<P>He will also meet with the country's president, Sali Berisha,
and visit the town of Sarande, with a sizable ethnic Greek
population.
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> Athens 'stupefied' by Ankara's foreign policy tactics</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
The way in which Ankara exercises foreign policy is
&quot;stupefying&quot;, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said
yesterday commenting on the latest tirade of threats against
Greece by Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller. &quot;Turkey's
foreign policy is characterized by inconsistency,
shilly-shallying, retractions and is two-faced - one (feigning)
moderation towards Europe, and one of threats and references to
military strength for domestic consumption,&quot; Mr. Reppas said.
<P>In statements in Ankara after returning from the EU summit in
Dublin, Ms Ciller said &quot;Has Greece pondered on the kind of
threat Turkey might pose in the event Turkey remains out of
Europe?&quot;.
<P>Ms Ciller added that &quot;Greece fears our military might. It is a
justified fear...&quot;.
<P>Apart from causing perplexity, Mr. Reppas said, Ms Ciller's
threats &quot;express fear about the future of Turkey&quot;.
<P>If Turkey wishes to come closer to Europe, the spokesman added,
&quot;it should take care not to obstruct itself.
<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> Comprehensive proposal for Cyprus solution already exists,
Athens says</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
The government yesterday acknowledged that the ten proposals put
forward by British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind for a
Cyprus solution contained &quot;positive elements&quot; which corresponded
to positions of Nicosia and Athens. Government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas stressed however that Mr. Rifkind's proposals
expressed British policy, adding that a comprehensive proposal
of the Cyprus government already existed, on the basis of which
Greece also wished a solution to be found.
<P>Mr. Rifkind outlined the ten &quot;elements&quot; at a press conference
yesterday at the end of a two-day visit to Cyprus, during which
he held talks with President Glafcos Clerides, Foreign Minister
Alecos Michaelides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
<P>He said he hoped that Mr. Clerides and Mr. Denktash would turn
the &quot;elements&quot; into &quot;the provisions of a detailed settlement.&quot;
<P>According to Mr. Rifkind, a solution should be based on &quot;a
bizonal, bicommunal federation in conformity with the high level
agreements and (UN) Security Council resolutions.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> Tsohatzopoulos reiterates Athens' commitment to Bosnia

<H4>Brussels, 18/12/1996 (ANA - M.Spinthourakis)</H4>
National Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos reaffirmed
yesterday that Greece had participated and will actively
participate in NATO's peacekeeping forces in Bosnia.
<P>Speaking to reporters after a council of NATO's defense
ministers in Brussels, Mr. Tsohatzopoulos also referred to
aggressive statements recently made by Turkish Foreign Minister
Tansu Ciller, saying she is slipping from political reality for
reasons of domestic consumption in Turkey.
<P>Yesterday's session, attended by France after many years and by
Spain for the first time, focused on granting approval for
NATO's new mission in Bosnia under the name SFOR, to replace
NATO's current force IFOR, and the Alliance's new structure in
light of its discussed enlargement eastwards.
<P>On the question of NATO's new structure and operation, Mr.
Tsohatzopoulos said both NATO and the European Union were going
through a transitional phase aimed at finding a new defense and
security policy in Europe, which will safeguard peace and
cooperation between countries.
<P>Referring to discussions on NATO's internal adjustment and new
structure, Mr. Tsohatzopoulos said no specific decision was
taken yesterday, adding that discussion is difficult due to
frequent conflicting interests between member-states and the
finding o f an agreement in relation with the role Russia must
play in the new European balance.
<P>One of the issues discussed was responsibility for NATO's
southern administration, where there are conflicting views
between the US and France.
<P>&quot;It appears we are headed for the creation of four regional
inter-branch and multinational headquarters - one each in
Greece, Spain, Italy and Turkey,&quot; he said.
<P>Mr. Tsohatzopoulos said the Turkish side reiterated its proposal
for the creation of a branch headquarters (naval or air) in
Izmir, which will be responsible for the entire Mediterranean
region. He said the Greek side reiterated its disagreement with
the Turkish proposal, considering it a significant change in
NATO's existing administrative balance.
<P>He further said Greece presented its own six-point proposal on
NATO's future structure, saying that in his address at the
Council of Ministers he had the opportunity of referring to
relations between the West European Union and NATO, adding that
despite the need for co-operation between the two organizations
each enjoyed its autonomy.
<P>Mr. Tsohatzopoulos also held bilateral talks with his Belgian
and German counterparts yesterday, while today he will
participate in a meeting with the Russian defense minister
together with the other NATO defense ministers.
<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</A> Greece to officially request return of Parthenon Marbles from
Britain</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos has announced that Greece
will officially submit an application for the return of the
Parthenon Marbles from the British Museum.
<P>&quot;I explained to my British counterpart that in the next few days
he will receive a letter with Greece's official demand for
return of the marbles,&quot; the Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted
Mr. Venizelos as saying after the EU Culture Ministers' Council
session in Brussels yesterday.
<H3><A NAME="09">[09]</A> Clinton bows to help resolve Cyprus conflict</H3>
Washington, 18/12/1996 (Reuter/ANA-T. Ellis)
<P>US President Bill Clinton on Monday called on Greece and Turkey
to re-examine their positions and reach out to one another.
<P>&quot;I intend to do whatever I can in these next four years to try
to help work out the situation in Cyprus, and work out the
problems generally between Greece and Turkey,&quot; President Clinton
said at a news conference with European Commission President
Jacques Santer and Irish Prime Minister John Bruton.
<P>&quot;I intend to invest an enormous amount of effort in trying to
succeed there and I ask them to re-examine their positions and
try to reach out to one another,&quot; President Clinton said.
<P>&quot;I believe that the future of the European Union and the future
of the United States will be much brighter and much less
troublesome if these things can be resolved,&quot; he said.
<P>&quot;Greece and Turkey,&quot; he added, &quot;are two great nations that have
an enormous commonality of interests, either in NATO or European
unification or the minimization of the chaos in their region, if
only they can just solve these long-standing difficulties
between them.&quot;
<P>&quot;It is clear that they have a lot more in common when facing the
future than those separating them. It is the past which
continues to poison their relations,&quot; President Clinton said,
noting that Greece and Turkey are two very important countries
for a &quot; stable 21st century.&quot;
<P>President Clinton said he has already spent a lot of time trying
to end the conflict between the free part of Cyprus and the
breakaway Turkish pseudo-state in the North.
<P>Mr. Santer said that Cyprus' accession talks to the European
Union were expected to start in 1998.
<P>&quot;The position of the European Union in this is very clear,&quot; he
said.
<P>President Clinton said he supported the enlargement of the
European Union, but recognized that it was for the Europeans to
decide the terms, parties and timetable for expansion.
<H3><A NAME="10">[10]</A> Farmers' blockades drag on for 20th day, Gov't remains steadfast</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Farmers in Viotia prefecture yesterday appeared to be scaling
down their protests as they lifted their main roadblock on the
Athens-Lamia national highway at the Kastro region, while
protesting farmers elsewhere continued mobilizations for the
20th consecutive day.
<P>Two smaller blockades at Akraifnio and Thebes, as well as
roadblocks in the area of Domokos and Neo Monastiri, Fthiotida
remained in place.
<P>Meanwhile, the old and new highways to Patra continued to remain
blocked at Aigio, while farmers in Fthiotida approved the
decision of the Pan-Thessaly coordina-ting committee and will
participate together with their families in the farmers' protest
rally in Athens on Thursday.
<P>On his part, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said yesterday
that the farmers' protest rally in Athens was an &quot;acceptable&quot;
means of pressing their demands since it did not harm the
country nor the interests of other social groups. He reiterated,
however, that dialogue between protesting farmers and Prime
Minister Costas Simitis was impossible as long as the country's
highways remained blocked. Expressing a hope that a solution
would be found in the next few days, Mr. Reppas described as
&quot;encouraging&quot; a reported de-escalation of protests in certain
regions.
<P>In a related development, the president of the hoteliers'
association of Kavala, Costas Stavropoulos, noted that tourism
in eastern Macedonia and Thrace had been badly hit by the
farmers' protests. &quot;The damage is enormous. There have been a
large number of cancellations by individuals and groups,&quot; he
said.
<P>Mr. Stavropoulos estimated that the arrival of 3,000-3,500
tourists had been canceled, while there had been numerous
cancellations of visitors who had planned to arrive on charter
flights.
<P>More than 100 hoteliers are facing serious financial
difficulties, Mr. Stavropoulos said.
<P>The Macedonia-Thrace Farmers Coordinating Committee is convening
today in order to evaluate the situation and take decisions as
to whether to continue the blockades in northern Greece. The
meeting is expected to discuss a Thessaloniki prefecture
initiative for a meeting between Mr. Simitis and a delegation of
the coordinating committee, under the condition that the
blockades end.
<H3><A NAME="11">[11]</A> Papantoniou</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
In discussing the farmers' protests, National Economy Minister
Yiannos Papantoniou told Reuters Television that the government
was deeply concerned about the 20-day-old road blockades, which
he said were crippling the economy, but added that the
government would not give in to the farmers' demands.
<P>&quot;As far as the government is concerned our position is very
clear. We shall not give in. There is no room for further
concessions to farmers,&quot; he said in the interview.
<P>&quot;The consequences are quite substantial... The government is
really very, very worried about the situation. Our patience is
wearing thin,&quot; he added.
<P>Mr. Papantoniou said he hoped that on Thursday there would be a
turning point in the confrontation after farmers march to Athens
in a protest rally.
<P>Farmers are demanding lower fuel rates, higher price supports,
lower Value Added Tax (VAT) on their equipment and re-scheduling
of some US $1.3 billion in debts.
<P>Refraining from giving a clear answer as to what action the
government could take to get the farmers off the highways, Mr.
Papantoniou said &quot;the government has the responsibility for the
proper functioning of the country.&quot;
<P>After convening in Naoussa earlier in the day, the Central
Macedonia Regional Council appealed to farmers to free the road
axis ending the blockades, thus conforming to the government's
terms for the commencement of dialogue.
<H3><A NAME="12">[12]</A> Opposition</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
The Coalition of the Left and Progress' agricultural department
yesterday made a five-point proposal to Thessaly farmers in an
effort to overcome the impasse between farmers and government.
<P>The Coalition proposal recommends the temporary lifting of the
blockades in the event Prime Minister Costas Simitis agrees to a
meeting with farmers representatives. The meeting would be
attended by representatives of all the major farming groups -
GESA SE, SYDASE and PASEGES.
<P>Following the meeting with the prime minister, there would be
meetings with farmers to discuss the content of the meeting and
the future of the protests.
<P>The third proposal refers to a mass rally of women and children
at Parliament and a visit to the president of the republic, the
prime minister, the president of Parliament and political party
leaders.
<P>The Coalition also proposed daily contact with representatives
of other social groups as well as an expansion of the
coordinating committee to represent other demands.
<P>Political Spring party leader Antonis Samaras also called for an
end to the crisis which he said was costing a &quot;high price to the
economy and the people.&quot;
<P>Mr. Samaras called on the premier to propose a &quot;peace agreement&quot;
and commit himself to the commencement of a broader dialogue
procedure including the entire farming problem.
<H3><A NAME="13">[13]</A> Fischler favorable to support for beleaguered Greek farmers</H3>
<H4>Brussels, 18/12/1996 (ANA- P. Pantelis)</H4>
European Union Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler yesterday
expressed full understanding with Greek farmers' problems, and
the intention of the Commission to help in a spirit of Community
solidarity.
<P>The Commissioner's statement came in response to problems
besetting flood- and disease-stricken farmers and cotton
growers, as set out in a letter by Agriculture Minister
Stephanos Tzoumakas. He had asked for direct subsidies to cotton
farmers, and that penalties imposed for excess production be
imposed on the farmers and areas specifically responsible.
<P>Mr. Fischler said during the Farm Ministers' Council that the
Commission would examine as soon as possible and in a positive
spirit all Greek proposals, so as to amend the Greek Support
Community Framework, and support flood-stricken producers
directly through the 1996 budget.
<P>He said that community action and budget funds were not
envisaged for such cases, but it was possible to draw funds from
existing structural actions.
<H3><A NAME="14">[14]</A> Greek tobacco growers join Brussels protests</H3>
<H4>Brussels, 18/12/1996 (ANA-P.Pantelis)</H4>
Hundreds of Greek, Italian, Spanish, French and German tobacco
growers blocked a central square in Brussels yesterday prior to
a European Commission discussion today, expected to focus on the
common tobacco market organization within the framework of
anti-smoking campaigns.
<P>Greek protesters from the tobacco-producing regions of
Macedonia, who flew to Brussels on Sunday, joined their European
Union colleagues in front of the European Commission building.
<P>Shouting slogans, the Greek protesters handed a memorandum to
Greek EU Commissioner Christos Papoutsis, disputing anti-smoking
arguments and requesting that their demands be met.
<P>Meanwhile, Agriculture Minister Stephanos Tzoumakas supported
the protest, saying that Greek tobacco producers were right to
take their demands in Brussels, since &quot;this is the place where
all decisions are made for the sensitive farming products.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="15">[15]</A> Papantoniou, ADEDY talks fail to break impasse</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
National Economy and Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou
yesterday held fruitless talks with representatives of the Civil
Servants' Supreme Administrative Council (ADEDY), which began a
24-hour nationwide strike yesterday morning.
<P>During the meeting, however, Mr. Papantoniou left open the
possibility of slight improvements being made to the final draft
of the new pay scale for civil servants, which will be submitted
to ADEDY in January.
<P>A new meeting between ADEDY representatives and ministry
officials is expected in the next few days.
<P>Mr. Papantoniou reiterated that the 1997 budget exhausted all
margins for further state hand-outs, while the new pay scale
proposed by the government gave civil servants increases higher
than inflation.
<P>ADEDY President Yiannis Koutsoukos said he hoped the government
would &quot;get the message&quot; from yesterday's strike and effect
improvements to the pay scale.
<P>Mr. Koutsoukos added that Mr. Papantoniou was insisting on
maintaining a &quot;tough stance&quot; towards employees and therefore the
trade unions would continue their struggle.
<P>Civil servants held protest rallies and marches in Athens, the
northern port city of Thessaloniki, Larisa and Patra yesterday.
Workers in a number of other sectors joined the employees in the
protests, including doctors, public secondary school teachers
and customs officials.
<P>Bank employees also held a three-hour work stoppage from 12:30
p.m. to 3:30 p.m.
<H3><A NAME="16">[16]</A> ADEDY Rally</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
At a rally marked by low attendance in Athens yesterday, and
marred by incidents caused by some protesters, General
Confederation of Greek Workers (GSEE) President Christos
Polyzogopoulos called on the government to adopt corrective
measures in its economic policy.
<P>The rally was held in view of the beginning of Parliamentary
debate on the 1997 budget.
<H3><A NAME="17">[17]</A> Dockworkers prevent disembarkation of ferry passengers</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Striking dockworkers yesterday prevented the disembarkation of
passengers and vehicles from the ferry-boat &quot;Cephalonia&quot; at
Patras which had to leave the port after only one ill passenger
was allowed to get off.
<P>The ferry-boat operates between Sami on Cephalonia, stopping off
at Ithaki before sailing on to Patras.
<P>After the refusal of the dockers to allow disembarkation, the
&quot;Cephalonia&quot; was forced to return to Sami.
<P>Minor scuffles broke out on the quay but order was restored by
port police and no arrests were reported.
<P>The ferry-boat has a carrying capacity of 100 passengers, six
trucks, 15 cars and one coach.
<P>Greek ports have been closed since yesterday due to a 48-hour
strike called by the Panhellenic Seamen's Federation (PNO) to
press demands for fringe benefits and the continuation of
certain tax privileges to be abolished under the government's
new fiscal law.
<H3><A NAME="18">[18]</A> Magazine reports cite Karamanlis displeasure over recent
Mitsotakis comments</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
According to this month's issue of the magazine &quot;Crash&quot;, former
president of the republic and the founder of the New Democracy
party, Constantine Karamanlis, is vexed over comments made by
former party leader and premier Constantine Mitsotakis in an
inter view carried by the same magazine last month.
<P>Mr. Mitsotakis claimed in the interview that Karamanlis first
became prime minister in the 1950s on account of being favored
by the palace, and criticized him for several nationalizations
after assuming power again in 1974.
<P>According to an unidentified source quoted by the magazine,
after hearing of Mr. Mitsotakis' comments, Mr. Karamanlis said:
&quot;No-one is capable of showing greater ingratitude than someone
who has received favors.&quot;
<P>According to the same source, the former president seems to be
maintaining interest in the current ramifications in the party
he founded, and is urging his former close aides to back
incumbent leader Miltiades Evert, despite not being wholly
satisfied with his performance.
<P>&quot;Miltos (Evert) must be competent both inside and outside
Parliament. What annoys me is that at party headquarters they
cannot listen to what the people want,&quot; Mr. Karamanlis is quoted
as saying.
<H3><A NAME="19">[19]</A> Mitsotakis</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
On his part and in unrelated statements, Mr. Mitsotakis
expressed concern for the country's future, saying that Prime
Minister Costas Simitis is &quot;inadequate.&quot;
<P>&quot;I am deeply concerned for this country's course. The Greek
people do not hear the truth from the parties. I have the
feeling that Greece is being dissolved,&quot; Mr. Mitsotakis said in
an interview in Crash.
<P>Stressing that his daughter, former minister and ND deputy Dora
Bakoyianni, is &quot;without a doubt, among the three young
politicians who are capable to rise high,&quot; Mr. Mitsotakis
expressed regret over his decision to resign from the ND
leadership in 1993.
<H3><A NAME="20">[20]</A> State Dept. says Washington expects good-neighborly relations
from all its allies</H3>
<H4>Washington, 18/12/1996 (ANA - A. Ellis)</H4>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns avoided comment on
threats recently made against Greece by Turkish Foreign Minister
Tansu Ciller, saying he had not seen her statements, but made an
overall statement on threats of such a nature. &quot;Firstly, the US
expects from all its allies, including Greece and Turkey, to
have relations of co-operation without any kind of threats of
force or use of force.
<P>This is a basic principle in relations between allies and all
our allies in NATO will agree with us. Secondly, we support
absolutely Turkey's inclusion in European mechanisms and we made
this known both to the European Union and to European countries
at a bilateral level. &quot;We do not support any kind of threats by
one NATO ally against another. NATO is an organization of
collective defense to safeguard the collective security of all.
It is not an organization whose members fought against each
other ever, or should fight against each other,&quot; he said.
<H3><A NAME="21">[21]</A> Gov't unconcerned by new opinion poll</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Opinion polls express the inclinations of public opinion at a
particular point in time and do not determine the choices of
interviewees for a four-year period, government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said yesterday.
<P>Mr. Reppas was responding to questions regarding a new opinion
poll showing conservative opposition New Democracy leading PASOK
by a slight margin.
<P>The poll, conducted by MRB Hellas, also showed a dip in Prime
Minister Costas Simitis' popularity.
<P>&quot;We will let whoever wants to feel joy over this opinion poll
feel joy, while we keep the joy we felt over winning the
elections, which determined the course of the country,&quot; Mr.
Reppas said.
<H3><A NAME="22">[22]</A> Diplomats to consider further strike action</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Union representatives from the foreign ministry's diplomatic and
administrative employees will convene general assemblies at noon
today to consider whether or not to continue their strike.
<P>The strike, and primarily that of the diplomatic corps, has
created serious problems for the country's diplomatic missions
abroad as well as for communication between Greek embassies with
Athens.
<P>According to reports, Foreign Under-secretary Christos Rozakis
had a meeting with a representation of diplomatic officials on
Monday. Mr. Rozakis said the government is examining the demand
that an overseas bonus for diplomats should not be taxed, which
Finance Under-secretary Nikos Christodoulakis rejected last week.
<P>According to the same sources, the government intends to handle
the diplomats' claim through the tax bill. Consequently, a
decision might be taken at the general assembly today to suspend
the strike since the diplomats' initial aim of having the
government address and sensitize itself over their claim was
achieved.
<H3><A NAME="23">[23]</A> Turkeys seized by health officials</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Health officers yesterday seized 10 tons of US-originated
turkeys, whose consumption date had expired, owned by the
Veropoulos supermarket chain.
<P>According to reports, market checks in view of the holiday
season are intensifying.
<H3><A NAME="24">[24]</A> Suit filed after priest refuses to perform funeral service</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
A man from Drama, northern Greece has filed a complaint &quot;against
all persons responsible&quot; after a local priest refused to perform
the funeral service for his wife because she had not been
married in church.
<P>Christos Fyssanidis, 48, filed the complaint at the police
station in Drama following the death of his wife, Sofia, 43, who
had died in Thessaloniki, and the priest's refusal.
<P>The last wish of the deceased was to be buried in her hometown.
The priest at the church of Agia Triada (Holy Trinity) in Drama,
Theodoros Topalidis, 45, refused to perform the funeral service,
saying that &quot;the deceased was married in a civil no t a
religious ceremony.&quot;
<P>Called by the police to make a deposition, the priest claimed he
had simply been carrying out the instructions of the Metropolis
(bishopric).
<H3><A NAME="25">[25]</A> Faikoglou handed suspended sentence for election fracas</H3>
<H4>Athens, 18/12/1996 (ANA)</H4>
Former independent deputy Ahmet Faikoglou was sentenced
yesterday to two months in jail with a three-year suspension by
an appeal's court in Komotini for &quot;disturbing the election
process.&quot;
<P>During parliamentary elections in 1989, Faikoglou forced his way
into a polling station in Kimmeria, Xanthi and caused a
commotion when the local polling representative prohibited him
from entering, in accordance with existing electoral legislation.
<P>Faikoglou had initially been sentenced to five months in jail by
a court in Xanthi.

<H3>TRANSCRIPT: SECRETARY OF STATE'S YEAR-END PRESS CONFERENCE</H3>
<H4>(Christopher covered a wide-range of issues Dec. 19) (5770)</H4>
<STRONG>Washington</STRONG> -- The State Department's Middle East Coordinator Dennis Ross
will return to the Middle East this weekend to assess the status of Israeli-
Palestinian peace negotiations so that he can present an up-to-date
appraisal to President Clinton and Secretary of State Christopher before
Christmas (December 25).
<P>Christopher announced the Ross trip at his final year-end news conference
December 19 with invited State Department correspondents in the Benjamin
Franklin room.
<P>The Secretary said that he and President Clinton &quot;have become concerned
about the drift in the peace process,&quot; and the Ross mission is in part an
effort &quot;to reenergize the process.&quot; Ambassador Ross will also provide &quot;a
first-hand view ... of the attitude of the leaders there with respect to
the peace process.&quot;
<P>The Ross trip follows recent U.S. criticism of Israel's plans to increase
its support to West Bank settlements and frustration over the apparent
impasse in negotiations over the status of Israeli forces in Hebron.
<P>&quot;We think it is time for the parties to come into agreement on Hebron,&quot;
Christopher said, and he called upon Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat &quot;to
reciprocate&quot; moves made by the Israelis in recent Hebron discussions.
<P>But he also said Israeli settlement activity complicates the peace process,
and he repeated President Clinton's statement earlier that week that any
step that preempts negotiations or &quot;seeks to move ahead of where the
parties are&quot; tends &quot;to be a problem.&quot;
<P>Christopher said he still expects eventual agreement on a Hebron settlement,
and, although he is very concerned about the possibility of an upsurge in
terrorism by &quot;the enemies of peace,&quot; he feels that the threat of all-out
war in the region is remote. He stressed, however, that the United States
is &quot;indispensable&quot; in the region in helping its peoples overcome deep
mistrust, to build mutual trust and to help overcome the remaining
obstacles to the peace process.
<P>In the opening statement, a valedictory review of policy achievements
during his tenure of office, Christopher sought to measure them against his
definition of what the goals of U.S. foreign policy should be.
<P>He said those goals should be to make the American people more secure and
more prosperous and to advance U.S. democratic ideals.
<P>&quot;Looking back on the last four years,&quot; the Secretary of State said, &quot;I am
confident that we have met that test.&quot; He asserted that the Clinton
administration had made &quot;significant progress in resolving the critical
problems that we faced when we took office, establishing an enduring basis
for leadership in a more secure and more prosperous 21st century.&quot;
<P>He said that among its &quot;lasting legacies&quot; will be the addressing of global
problems such as crime, narcotics trafficking, proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction, damage to the environment and world-wide threats. He said
overcoming these threats will be &quot;a central aspect&quot; of U.S. foreign policy
in the next century.
<P>Christopher asserted that significant progress was made on these problems
during 1996, including the signing of a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty, the removal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakstan
and U.S. ratification of the START II Treaty. He also made reference to
international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to combat
arms smuggling and drug trafficking.
<P>The Secretary of State noted that the United States is better integrating
environmental considerations into its foreign policy, and that it has made
economics a central focus of its foreign affairs efforts. In this regard,
he cited successful U.S. efforts this year to promote greater free trade in
the Asia-Pacific region, and the recent World Trade Organization decision
to eliminate tariffs on all information technology by the year 2000.
<P>&quot;Our leadership has advanced our interest and ideals in every region of the
world,&quot; Christopher said. He claimed that &quot;we are closer today than ever
before in seeking our goal of an undivided, democratic Europe.&quot; Christopher
noted progress toward revising NATO's structure, expanding its membership
and working out a new relationship between the alliance and Russia and
NATO's role in bringing peace to Bosnia.
<P>The Secretary of State noted the strengthening of ties with Japan and new
market access agreements with that country, U.S. support for South Korea
against North Korean provocations while moving ahead with the framework
agreement, and the movement of U.S.-Chinese relations &quot;onto a more positive
footing.&quot;
<P>In addition, Christopher cited U.S. efforts to head off a major war between
Ecuador and Peru, to help end the 35-year-old Guatemalan civil war, U.S.
assistance to stabilize the Mexican economy and the continued efforts to
contain Iraq and Iran.
<P>He also pointed to U.S. efforts to promote democratic market reform in
Africa and to help end the conflict and ease the suffering in Africa's
Great Lakes region.
<P>Christopher said he was certain that in the future, people would look back
on this period as one that was &quot;decisive&quot; in diplomatic history in which,
with U.S. leadership, the world began to shape its plans for the twenty-
first century.
<P>&quot;It's a world,&quot; he said, &quot;in which no great power views any other as an
immediate threat, a world in which institutions that we created after World
War II are beginning to be adapted to meet the new challenges of the next
century, a world in which open societies and open markets have a competitive
advantage, a world in which America remains the indispensable nation and
our leadership remains indispensable to the world.
<P>It is a world in which our interests and values can thrive but also in
which new threats like proliferation and terrorism make American leadership
even more vital than in the past.&quot;
<P>On the hostage situation at the Japanese Embassy in Lima, Christopher told
questioners, &quot;You'll understand why I don't want to confirm the presence of
Americans there. It's been a long-standing policy that we do not do that,
and I will not violate that today.&quot;
<P>The Secretary of State pointed that &quot;We have sent some security experts in
to assist the Ambassador because of his concern about the security
situation. They're going in there for the purpose of advising the
Ambassador about security conditions in our Embassy. But we're following
the situation as closely as we possibly can.&quot;
<P>U.S. policy &quot;against making concessions in this situation, Christopher said,
&quot;is well-known. At the same time, because so many people are involved, it's
important the lines of communication remain open between those terrorists
who have taken the embassy and the Peruvian government. We would encourage
the maintenance of communications. But the United States, as I say, has a
strong policy against making any concessions. We'd advise all of those
involved to follow that policy. It is a dangerous and difficult situation,
and I think you'll understand there are limitations on what I feel prudent
to say.&quot;

<H4>YEAR-END PRESS CONFERENCE SECRETARY OF STATE WARREN CHRISTOPHER</H4>
<EM>Washington, D.C.<BR>Thursday, December 19, 1996</EM>
<P><STRONG>CHRISTOPHER</STRONG>: Good afternoon and thank you all for attending this year-end
press conference. I want to begin by commenting on an important breaking
news story. As some of you may have seen this morning, my hometown
newspaper in a story entitled, &quot;Vanilla Man,&quot; said that on my many stops at
the Shannon Airport, I made a habit of ordering Irish coffee but with no
caffeine and no whiskey. I can confirm to you on-the-record here that that
great piece of investigative journalism is exactly right. Even more than
that, I want to tell you that Irish coffee tastes better that way, and to
prove that when we finish here, I'm going to offer you all a &quot;Christopher
Special,&quot; so you can learn with me how good it is that way.
<P>I'm very pleased to meet with all of you and pleased by the good turnout to
have an opportunity to review what has gone on in this past year, 1996.
Since this is my last year-end review, I'd like to take the opportunity to
put this year in a somewhat broader context.
<P>From the beginning of my tenure here, I've said that the fundamental test
of American foreign policy has always been this: Does it make the American
people more secure? Does it make us more prosperous? Does it advance our
democratic ideals that we share with people around the world?
<P>Looking back on the last four years, I feel confident that we have met that
test. As I've said many times, there are no final victories in this
business and success usually takes quite a lot of time. But step by step,
we've made significant progress in resolving the critical problems that we
faced when we took office and establishing and enduring basis for
leadership in a more secure and more prosperous 21st century.
<P>A lasting legacy of the President's first term will be the results we
achieved in addressing global challenges -- challenges like proliferation,
crime, narcotics, damage to the environment -- those global threats. I
believe that overcoming these threats will become a central aspect of
American foreign policy in the next century.
<P>We made dramatic progress in these global areas in 1996. We signed a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a goal of American foreign policy for the
last quarter century. The last nuclear weapons have been withdrawn from
Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakstan, and we also secured ratification of START
II here in the United States. The G-7 adopted a large number of specific
steps for shutting down money laundering, to prosecute fugitives, and to
protect our borders against trafficking in guns and narcotics.
<P>We forged an international consensus to develop a binding agreement to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Following the initiative that I launched
at Stanford University, we're better integrating environmental issues into
the full range of American diplomacy, and there will be more to come on
this.
<P>Another hallmark of the last four years is the central focus we placed on
economic diplomacy. By passing NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement),
by concluding the Uruguay Round, by gaining free trade commitments in our
hemisphere and in the Asia-Pacific region, we've positioned ourselves to
become an even more dynamic hub of the international economy.
<P>This year, with our APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) partners
meeting in the Philippines, we agreed to take concrete stops to move ahead
with trade liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region. At the first
ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization in Singapore a couple
of weeks ago, we agreed with our trading partners to eliminate tariffs on
all information technology by the year 2000. Our leadership has advanced
our interests and ideals in every region of the world. Across the Atlantic,
we're closer today than ever before in seeking our goal of an undivided and
democratic Europe. This month our allies agreed to President Clinton's
proposal to hold a summit meeting to consolidate the agenda that the
President launched at the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) meeting
in January of 1994.
<P>This summit will begin enlargement negotiations. It will launch those
negotiations. It will strengthen NATO's relationship with all of Europe's
new democracies, including Russia. It will complete NATO's adaptation to
new rules and missions, and it will strengthen Europe's role in acting
under the Alliance.
<P>In 1996, NATO also fulfilled its initial mission in Bosnia, bringing peace
to that war-torn country, separating the warring armies, providing great
support for the fall elections and creating a stable environment so that
reconstruction can move forward.
<P>President Clinton has also placed an unprecedented emphasis on deepening
our engagement in the Asia-Pacific region. 1996 here was a year of
important achievement. We invigorated our core alliances, and the President
signed a new security declaration with Japan to make sure that the next 50
years of our alliance is as productive as the last 50 years have been. We
completed an important semi-conductor agreement with Japan, adding to the
22 market access agreements we reached over the last four years.
<P>We also stood by South Korea in the face of provocations from the North,
while moving ahead with the implementation of the Framework Agreement
between the United States and North Korea.
<P>This year, we moved our relationship with China onto a more positive
footing. We made some progress on non-proliferation, although we continue
to have in that area serious concerns. We reached an agreement on the
enforcement of intellectual property rights. President Clinton and
President Jiang have agreed to exchange state visits, giving us further
opportunities to build on our cooperation, as well as to address our
serious differences in such areas as human rights.
<P>In the Middle East, we moved immediately in 1993, when we first came into
office, to build on America's two decades of bipartisan leadership on
behalf of peace. I will not certainly minimize the severe tests that have
been placed in the road of peace in recent months through terrorist attacks
and other matters, but we have made lasting achievements, and we are
determined to move forward.
<P>The role of the United States is not just to help the parties reach
agreement but to stand by them in tough times. That's why President Clinton
and President Mubarak brought together the region's leaders last March to
stand against terrorism, and that's why President Clinton brought together
here King Hussein, Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat when
violence threatened to disrupt the peace process.
<P>Our goal remains indispensable in helping the countries in the region
overcome their long history of distrust, to build mutual trust, and to
overcome the obstacles that remain in the peace process, including, of
course, Hebron.
<P>The President and I have been concerned about the recent drift in the peace
process. To re-energize this effort, we're sending Dennis Ross to the
region this weekend to report on the status of negotiations there, to
report on his discussions with the leaders, to return before Christmas in
order that we can have an up-to-date assessment from Ambassador Ross.
<P>In 1996, we also demonstrated once again our determination to prevent
Saddam Hussein from threatening his neighbors.
<P>We took office at a time of historic transformation here in the Americas,
with democracy and open markets on the march. This year, we sustained that
momentum. Our diplomacy was critical in bringing Ecuador and Peru to the
negotiating table, was critical in averting a coup in Paraguay and in
ending Guatemala's 35-year civil war. With our much needed assistance, the
Mexican economy is improving, and Mexico is paying its debts ahead of
schedule, and NAFTA is working.
<P>We welcome also, in connection with this hemisphere, the tougher stand that
the European Union is now taking in the Cuba situation and the tougher
stand they're taking in the direction of bringing democracy to Cuba.
<P>In the last four years, we've also sought to deepen America's engagement in
Africa. We've made an unprecedented effort to encourage democratic market
reform there and to promote trade and investment. Now we're deeply engaged
in an effort to end the conflict and ease the suffering in the Great Lakes
region. The situation in the Great Lakes region and my recent travels in
Africa have underscored the need to create an African crisis response force,
which would enable African countries to respond to emergencies in their
region, with the backing of the United States and our allies.
<P>In all of these areas, we forged a considerable record of accomplishment
and set the stage for a memorable second term. I think the people will look
back on this period as a decisive period in diplomatic history. It is in
this period, with our leadership, that the world has begun to shape its
plans for the 21st Century.
<P>It's a world in which no great power views any other as an immediate threat,
a world in which institutions that we created after World War II are
beginning to be adapted to meet the new challenges of the next century, a
world in which open societies and open markets have a competitive
advantage; a world in which America remains the indispensable nation, and
our leadership remains indispensable to the world.
<P>It is a world in which our interests and values can thrive but also in
which new threats like proliferation and terrorism make American leadership
even more vital than in the past. I know that the President and Ambassador
Albright will maintain that kind of American leadership. I also know that
their ability to be effective will depend upon finding the resources we so
urgently need to support our diplomacy.
<P>I'll be glad to take your questions now.
<P><STRONG>QUESTION</STRONG>: On another current story, the Fargo Forum and the rest of us have
been following, could you tell us, please, if there is any connection that
you can discern between Cuba and the group that is taking hostages in Lima?
Any financial, training or other connection? Any connection, in fact,
between any foreign government and this terrorist group?
<P><STRONG>CHRISTOPHER</STRONG>: That's a very dynamic situation in Peru now at the present
time. It's a dangerous situation, and I don't want to make any comment on
the group that is involved there or any connection they might have to other
situations around the world.
<P>In doing so, let me emphasize, I'm not confirming or denying that. It's
simply not the right time for me speculate or comment on that subject.
<P><STRONG>Q</STRONG>: Mr. Secretary, as you reviewed your list of diplomatic endeavors, you
omitted any reference to the dual containment policy in Iran and Iraq. What
would you say are the accomplishments and the results of that policy?
<P><STRONG>CHRISTOPHER</STRONG>: The dual containment of Iran and Iraq continues to be a
primary goal and object of American foreign policy. We continue to regard
Iran as a dangerous projector of terrorism, a country that's dangerous
because they're trying to assemble weapons of mass destruction and a
dangerous country because of their efforts to undermine the peace
process.
<P>With respect to Iraq, we continue to regard Saddam Hussein as someone who
is a threat to his neighbors as well as to the minorities within his
country, a leader who has not brought himself or his country into
compliance with the U.N. resolutions.
<P>I would say the goals of our policy have remained firm during this four
years and, particularly, during the last year.
<P>With respect to Iraq, I think we have once again made it clear that the
United States will not stand by and watch Saddam Hussein threaten his
neighbors through the buildup in the region. We have made it, I think,
emphatic to him that the United States and our allies will resist any
effort on the part of Saddam Hussein to move against his neighbors. That's
one of the things that we have to be constantly vigilant about, and I think
we have been.
<P>With respect to Iran, we remain in the process of calling to the attention
of our allies the conduct of Iran and urging them not to give financial
material -- military support -- to Iran. I think that policy is one in
which we've been firm throughout the course of the year. We still have some
persuading to do. That's a continuing story.
<P>We have also, though, made it clear to the countries in the regions who are
threatened by Iran that the United States is firmly on their side against
any efforts by Iran to threaten them or to exercise greater dominance in
the region. Those are both areas where our efforts at containment continue,
and I believe they have been effective in 1996.
<P><STRONG>Q</STRONG>: Mr. Secretary, Dennis Ross' trip to the Middle East sounds like an
attempt to rescue something which seems to be in bad shape. The Palestinians
have been saying that they now think that reopening any part of an agreed
document then reopens the whole document to renegotiation. Can you or
anybody reassure them that that is not the case?
<P>The second part of that question, how badly do you think the settlement
announcements have been affecting this negotiation process?
<P><STRONG>CHRISTOPHER</STRONG>: The President and I have asked Ambassador Ross to go back to
the Middle East so that we could have a first-hand view from him of the
attitudes of other leaders there with respect to the peace process to
understand the status of the process. We've asked him to come back by
Christmastime so we can have his report on the situation there.
<P>As I say, we've been concerned about the situation and think it is time for
the parties to come into agreement on Hebron. The Israelis have made some
moves in connection with Hebron. We think it's time for the Palestinians --
for Chairman Arafat -- to respond to those moves, to reciprocate those
moves. We're also concerned, though, about the effect of other issues on
that negotiation.
<P>As we've said many times, we feel that settlement activity does have the
effect of causing problems for complicating the peace process. Indeed, the
President spoke for the United States, of course, when he said just a few
days ago that any step that pre-empts the negotiations or seeks to move
ahead of where the parties are, in the way they have consigned various
issues, tends to be a problem. We think that's not helpful.
<P>I can say that we feel that it is time for the Hebron agreement to be
reached and the parties to pursue the remaining issues under negotiation
there and without further delay.
<P><STRONG>Q</STRONG>: Mr. Secretary, regarding Peru, since it's been announced by our Embassy
down there -- it was announced last night -- that there are Americans
involved, can you at least assure the American people that this government
is doing what it can, and tell us as much as you can about what our
government can do since this is essentially Japanese territory but also,
obviously, the primary function is up to the Peruvian government?
<P>And can you tell us where one should draw the line between the mediation
that is under way and our long-standing policy of not negotiating with
terrorists? What is the proper way of making that demarcation?
<P><STRONG>CHRISTOPHER</STRONG>: You'll understand why I don't want to confirm the presence of
Americans there. It's been a long-standing policy that we do not do that,
and I will not violate that today.
<P>We have sent some security experts in to assist the ambassador because of
his concern about the security situation. They're going in there for the
purpose of advising the ambassador about security conditions in our
Embassy. But we're following the situation as closely as we possibly
can.
<P>Just before coming up here, the assistant secretary, Jeff Davidow, talked
to our ambassador there. There's nothing new in the situation. A little
earlier this morning I talked to Foreign Minister Ikeda of Japan, in his
stopover in Los Angeles, on his way to Peru, and we agreed to counsel
closely together. I told him that our ambassador, Dennis Jett, is following
the situation closely. I think Ambassador Jett is doing a fine job, and
we'll work closely with the Japanese as well as we will with the Peruvian
government, if we can be of some assistance. Obviously, the Peruvian
government is taking the lead.
<P>The United States policy against making concessions in this situation is
well-known. At the same time, because so many people are involved, it's
important the lines of communication remain open between those terrorists
who have taken the embassy and the Peruvian government. We would encourage
the maintenance of communications. But the United States, as I say, has a
strong policy against making any concessions. We'd advise all of those
involved to follow that policy.
<P>It is a dangerous and difficult situation, and I think you'll understand
there are limitations on what I feel prudent to say.
<P><STRONG>Q</STRONG>: Can you at least tell us what the condition, as far as you know, what
the condition of the hostages is?
<P><STRONG>CHRISTOPHER</STRONG>: I only have radio reports on that. They're available to you as
well.
<P><STRONG>Q</STRONG>: Hello, Mr. Secretary. Can I ask you about Russia and NATO? When you were
in Brussels, Mr. Primakov said he was willing to negotiate with Mr. Solana
on a charter in Brussels this week; the newly civilianized Mr. Rodionov,
the defense minister, was much harsher. He said Russia would never accept
NATO expansion and might take military steps to counter it. Dmitri Ryurikov,
Mr. Yeltsin's personal foreign affairs advisor, was here last week and
basically guaranteed there would be no conclusion of a charter negotiation
before the July summit.
<P>Do you think the Russians are trying to keep the West off balance in their
reaction to this? Or are they off-balance themselves? Do you think they yet
really know how to handle NATO's expansion plans?
<P><STRONG>CHRISTOPHER</STRONG>: I think it's reasonably clear that the Russians are not
enthusiastic about and will not applaud NATO enlargement. But what was also
made clear to me when I was in Brussels, the Russian government is prepared
to pursue negotiations for some kind of an arrangement. Call it a
&quot;charter&quot;; you might call it by some other name, but some kind of an
arrangement between NATO and Russia. I have every confidence those
negotiations will begin shortly after the first of the year.
<P>I don't find anything inconsistent, really, with the statement of the new
Russian defense minister, General Rodionov, with the idea that discussions
will begin in January between Foreign Minister Primakov and (NATO)
Secretary General Solana.
<P>I would suggest that you'll not soon hear the Russians saying positive
things about enlargement. But the change that took place at this year's
NATO meeting in Brussels was an attitude on the part of Foreign Minister
Primakov that they're prepared to start serious negotiations for the
development of a kind of arrangement -- call it a &quot;charter,&quot; if you will --
between NATO and Russia. I don't see anything to contradict that, and that
is the course that I think will be followed.
<P><STRONG>Q</STRONG>: Mr. Secretary, you gave us a list of the achievements of the last four
years of American diplomacy. I wonder if I could ask you about which you
consider to have been your own personal keenest disappointment? Whether it
would have been the failure of your many trips to Damascus to produce a
peace or something in your relations with France? What particular area do
you regret the most?
<P><STRONG>CHRISTOPHER</STRONG>: I'm going to disappoint you on that. I've had a tremendously
enjoyable four years here, I think we've made considerable progress. I
think with President Clinton's leadership, the American people are safer. I
think the world is safer. We're better off in the sense of being more
prosperous, and I think we've had an opportunity to advance our goals. So I
take some satisfaction in the results of the four-year period. I don't
intend to view it in terms of disappointments.
<P><STRONG>Q</STRONG>: Mr. Secretary, you made reference to Iran earlier. Twenty years ago or
almost 20 years ago, you were thrust in your previous incarnation here into
a role of negotiating indirectly with the government of Iran in a different
situation. But I'd like to ask you how you feel at the end of this
incarnation of your work at the State Department about the direction of
U.S. policy and U.S. relationships with that important country in the Gulf.
Should there be a change -- should there be a review of that policy,
especially in light of what you referred to as Iran's role in supporting
terrorism in the world and in light of recent reports about increases in
Iran's role in southern Lebanon and in its relationship with Syria?
<P><STRONG>CHRISTOPHER</STRONG>: The future really of the relationship is in the hands of Iran,
in the sense that if they're prepared to change their policies with respect
to terrorism and if they're prepared to change their policies with respect
to the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and hence to undermine
the peace process, the United States would stand ready. We've always said
we stand ready to have a dialogue with them -- a discussion -- as long as
it's an official dialogue and all the issues are open.
<P>But until that happens on their part, I see no basis for the United States
to change its position. Wherever I look, I find the dangerous hand of Iran -
- or at least so many places where I look around the world -- the
projection of terrorism, of state-sponsored terrorism, so I regard them as
a dangerous force in the world scene, one that the United States has to act
to contain. If others want to have a different relationship with them, I
would say that's an area where the United States should lead and try to
persuade the other nations of the difficulties of doing anything to
encourage, either financially or otherwise, Iran in the course that it's
presently following.
<P>So I don't see a basis until they change their policies for a change in the
United States' relationship with Iran.
<P><STRONG>Q</STRONG>: Mr. Secretary, if I could take you back to the Middle East for a moment.
For the last several years, this administration has been able to claim that
the peace process, in spite of bumps in the road, is irreversible, that the
possibility of renewed conflict is one that no longer needs to be seriously
considered.
<P>In recent weeks, I've heard non-governmental experts, both here and in the
region, say that that may no longer be true, that the danger of war is
growing. Would you care to say what you think the situation is going to be
in the coming year?
<P><STRONG>CHRISTOPHER</STRONG>: I still have confidence in the peace process. I believe that
if an agreement can be reached on Hebron, which I think it should be, that
that will give a new sense of forward momentum. The peace process is not
just one small discussion between parties. It's much broader than that. The
economic situation has changed in the Middle East. The peace treaty between
Jordan and Israel is in place. There are agreements between Israel and the
Palestinians which are being respected.
<P>So although this is a tense time -- there's no doubt about that -- I still
have confidence in the peace process. What I would say about it is that
U.S. leadership is indispensable there. It has been for 30 or 40 years now
and maybe even more indispensable now. The United States cannot fail to
assist the parties and to stand by the parties who have taken risks for
peace. But I continue to have confidence that the parties in the Middle
East, having seen some of the benefits of peace and having glimpsed a
different kind of a future, will not abandon that but will remain with all
of its difficulties on the road to peace. I hope that any of the countries
there will back away from any threats or any efforts to try to achieve
their aims through the use of those kinds of threats.
<P>What I'm more concerned about is the emergence of terrorist acts. There are
still people who are obviously hostile to the peace process, and that's one
of the reasons why we need to try to regain and restore momentum in the
peace process because of the risk in a hiatus of some kind of a terrorist
incident. I hope and pray that that won't happen. I strongly urge President
Arafat and all those who are involved to take every action that they can to
ensure that there's no recurrence of violence, because violence can only
aid the enemies of the peace process.
<P><STRONG>Q</STRONG>: Mr. Secretary, in the beginning of the year, Turkey was described as a
front-line state which replaced Germany in importance by a State Department
senior official. At the end of the year, Turkey still could not get any of
the arms orders from the United States; and, as you know, there's a
coalition government now in Turkey, trying to strengthen Turkey's ties with
Islamic countries.
<P>Mr. Secretary, is Turkey still a front-line state? How do you see the
future of Turkish-American relations?
<P><STRONG>CHRISTOPHER</STRONG>: Is Turkey still a what state?
<P><STRONG>Q</STRONG>: Front-line state.
<P><STRONG>CHRISTOPHER</STRONG>: Turkey remains a country of great importance to the United
States. It's a member of NATO, and it sits at a very strategic place in the
world. The United States' friendship for Turkey is a very deep one, and
we've worked together on a number of matters recently. They've assisted the
United States in the evacuation of a number of Americans and others from
northern Iraq. We continue to have an important dialogue with them on many,
many subjects, and we have many matters to work on in the course of the
next year, including an effort to resolve the problems in Cyprus.
<P>So I think the United States continues to place the highest priority on
maintaining good relationships with its Turkish allies, and I would say
that my successor, Ambassador Albright, will be giving high attention to
that.
<P><STRONG>Q</STRONG>: Yes, Mr. Secretary. We have another American official that's been
arrested for spying for the Russians. Considering the amount of assistance
we've put into Russia and the new relationship we have with them at the end
of the Cold War, are you going to be lodging any protests with Moscow or
making any demands that they have some type of new code of behavior in
espionage?
<P><STRONG>CHRISTOPHER</STRONG>: That really is an area that is in current discussion. We've
had not just one episode but a series of episodes, and it's really a matter
that needs to be considered carefully between the various security agencies
in the United States. But I don't have any comment for you on it at the
present time. I would say it's a sad and tragic event to see these
Americans who are selling out their country for financial gain. That seems
to be the motivating factor in this new era rather than ideology, and it's
certainly selling out your country for just a pittance, and I think we have
to find some way to work with that issue more effectively than we have
within our security agencies. But with respect to the direct question you
asked, I don't have anything to report to you on that today.
<P>Thank you very much.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</a> GREEK PRESIDENT TO MEET WITH EGYPTIAN COUNTERPART IN CAIRO ON FRIDAY</H3>
<P>     The President of the Hellenic Republic Kostis Stephanopoulos
will depart on Friday for an official visit to Cairo where he will
meet with the President of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak.
<P>     President Stephanopoulos' visit is awaited with interest
since the situation in the Middle East is quite convoluted, given
that after the election of Benjamin Netaniahu as Israeli Premier,
the Israeli and Palestinian relations are undergoing a severe
crisis.
<P>     Egyptian daily &quot;Al Gum Huriya&quot; recently published an article
on Greek-Egyptian relations, mentioning that the two presidents'
talks will center on bilateral relations which are on a path of
constant improvement in all areas.
<P>     The President will return to Athens on December 23.

<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</a> FARMERS' PROTESTS ON THE WANE, TRUCKERS WON'T TAKE COUNTERMEASURES</H3>
<P>     Despite their sounding threats of taking countermeasures
against the country's roadblocking farmers, the Federation of
International Transportation Drivers announced this evening that
they do not intend to blockade the protesters' &quot;descent&quot; to Athens
tomorrow.
<P>     In the meantime, in a move which further illustrates that the
protests that dragged on for 20 days have began to wane,
Thessaloniki's farmers blocking access to the city's road leading
to &quot;Macedonia&quot; airport and to Thermi's road that leads to the
Halkidiki peninsula have lifted their barricades.
<P>     Following a meeting held this evening by the Macedonia-Thrace
Farmers' Coordinating Committee, the protesters decided to let go
of their roadblocks as a &quot;goodwill gesture, in light of
Christmas.&quot; As a result, the airport's incoming and outgoing
passengers will be able to travel without added delays caused by
the roadblocks.
<P>     However, the makeshift committee has decided to maintain all
the roadblocks in most of northern Greece's main road arteries,
such as Malgara, the airport in Kavala, Ludia, Aiginio and
Litochoron.
<P>     In regards to tomorrow's mass rally to Athens, the committee
did not announce any orchestrated plans, but instead has said that
it is up to the individual farmers to decided if they will join
their comrades at the capital.
<P>     Meanwhile, the country's seamen continue their work stoppages
in all of the country's ports, paralysing Greece's marine
industry, having extended their strike to two more days, that is
until tomorrow night.
<P>     In Thessaloniki, two car ferries and a passenger ship are
moored at port waiting for the strike to end, while none of the 15
extra passenger ship routes that were due to be carried out next
week will take place. Ironically, these added routes were
scheduled to make up for the disruption in public transportation
and food transit caused by the farmer's roadblocks.

<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</a> PREMIER BRIEFS PRESIDENT ON DEVELOPMENTS SURROUNDING NATIONAL ISSUES</H3>
<P>     Prime Minister Kostas Simitis briefed the President of the
Hellenic Republic Kostis Stephanopoulos on the overall
developments surrounding the country's national issues, during a
routine meeting held today.
<P>     President Stephanopoulos noted that the outcomes of the
recently-held European Union Summit in Dublin are quite
satisfactory. In turn, the Premier stated that the Summit
confirmed the European Commission's policy towards Turkey, in
spite of the fact that Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller was
active in behind-the-scenes politicking  in order to change the
&quot;15&quot;'s draft resolution concerning EU-Turkey relations.
<P>     Not only did the relevant paragraph remain in the document,
Mr. Simitis stated, but, for the first time ever contains a
reference to Cyprus and calls on Turkey to promote a solution to
the matter of the island's division.
A.F.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</a> NO ONE STOPS TURKEY FROM ENTERING EU, EXCEPT HERSELF, SAYS REPPAS</H3>
<P>     Press and Mass Media Minister Dimitris Reppas reiterated
today that the Greek Government's position is well known and stems
from the principle that all governments and states must observe,
which is that international accords are the most powerful weapon
and means in order to establish and maintain harmony, cooperation
and friendship in the relations among countries.
<P>     During today's briefing, Mr. Reppas condemned once more the
provocative statements made recently by Turkish Foreign Minister
Tansu Ciller.
<P>     &quot;If Turkey wishes to take steps towards approaching the
European Union, no one is stoping her from doing so, expect her
own self,&quot; Mr. Reppas added.
A.F.
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</a> GREECE'S AIRPORT EMPLOYEES TO STRIKE ON FRIDAY</H3>
<P>     Greece's airport employees will embark on a 24-hour strike on
Friday, according to the Federation of Civil Aviation Employee
Associations (OSYPA).
<P>     According to the OSYPA announcement, the airport employees
are demanding an eight percent salary increase and legislation of
overtime and holiday renumeration.
<P>     Air traffic controllers and civil aviation technical staff
will not take part in the work stoppage.
A.F.
<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</a> LORRY DRIVERS GET ON THE OFFENSE, MIGHT BLOCK FARMERS' RALLY TO ATHENS</H3>
<P>     Protesting farmers from central Greece's Thessaly region,
considered to be the hard core of the country-wide mobilizations,
plan to &quot;descend&quot; to Athens tomorrow along with their families, to
bring their complaints over the State's austere economic policy to
the capital.
<P>     In the interim, exasperated lorry drivers who have often been
rendered hostage at the road barricades posted by the farmers, are
threatening with counter measures tomorrow and may even block the
farmers' rally to Athens.
<P>     The President of the Federation of International
Transportation Drivers Panayiotis Nikolaras said today that this
evening a coordinating committee will determine whether or not the
drivers will block junctions at the national highways of Athens-
Corinth and Athens-Lamia, thereby not allowing the farmers to
rally towards Athens.
<P>     Meanwhile, the  Athens-Larisa route has been freed, as well
as the route between Thessaloniki-Edessa. The only vehicles
allowed to pass through the roadblocks at Almyros and Velestinos
are passenger cars, after an agreement was reached between
Magnesia's hoteliers and the region's protesters.

<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</a> GREECE-FYROM DELEGATES MEET IN NEW YORK WITH UN MEDIATOR VANCE</H3>
<P>     Talks between Greece and FYROM will be held again in January
of 1997 at the United Nations headquarters in New York, according
to UN mediator Cyrus Vance.   Following the two-hour meeting held
between Greece's ambassador Christos Zacharakis and his
counterpart from FYROM Ivan Tosevski, Mr. Vance stated that the
exact date of the meeting will be assigned at a later day.
<P>     Also, responding to a relevant question, the UN mediator
stated that neither of the two countries submitted specific names
for FYROM.
<P>     However, Mr. Tosevski emphasized that his country is willing
to resolve the name issue.
A.F.
<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</a> RELIEF MEASURES OF GRD5.68 BILLIONS TO BE GIVEN TO XANTHI'S FLOOD VICTIMS</H3>
<P>     The Minister of Environment, Planning and Public Works Kostas
Laliotis announced today that the residents of Xanthi in northern
Greece who incurred losses during recent torrential floods will
receive compensation amounting -in total- 3.15 billion drachmas,
while another GRD2.53 billion will be allocated for reconstruction
projects in the region.
<P>     Mr. Laliotis visited Xanthi today, accompanied by the
Minister of Macedonia-Thrace Philippos Petsalnikos, the deputy
Minister of Interior Labros Papademas and the Secretary-General of
the National Economy Ministry Apostolos Fotiades.
A.F.
<H3><A NAME="09">[09]</a> EU TO GRANT COMPENSATION TO GREEK FARMERS BY JANUARY</H3>
<P>     Greece's Agriculture Minister Stephanos Tzoumakas announced
today the outcomes of the recently-held meeting among the European
Union's Agriculture Ministers Council and said that the EU intends
to grant compensation for damages to the Greek farmers, thus
recognizing that their losses accrued by the recent natural
disasters are quite extensive.
<P>     Moreover, Mr. Tzoumakas stated that the Greek Government will
present the EU with a memorandum outlining the assessments of
these damages, which will be subject to EU approval prior to
covering these losses from within the EU support funds.
<P>     Referring to the timetable within which these procedures are
expected to be fulfiled, Mr. Tzoumakas also stated that, within
January of 1997, compensation monies amounting to ten billion
drachmas wil be distributed.
<P>     Referring to the farmers' plight, Mr. Tzoumakas stated that
the Agriculture Ministry has proposed a four-year program ladden
with restructures, cost-assessing and legislation, all of which
are part of an effort to form a new institutional framework that
will enable the creation of new concepts and developments in
agriculture.
<P>     Meanwhile, Press and Mass Media Minister Dimitris Reppas
stated today that the Government, represented by Mr. Tzoumakas, is
willing to hold talks with the farmers.      Yet, Mr. Reppas
clarified, such request has yet to be expressed by the farmers.
<P>     When asked if the Premier, Kostas Simitis, intents to receive
the farmers' coordinating committee, the Press Minister responded
that it is Mr. Simitis' final decision not to meet with the
farmers for as long as they keep blocking the national highways.

<H3><A NAME="10">[10]</a> WORLD COUNCIL OF HELLENES ABROAD CONFERENCE ENDS WITH MIXED FEELINGS</H3>
<P>     The Presidium members of the World Council of Hellenes Abroad
(SAE) ended their Thessaloniki-held third conference today, in a
climate marked by concerns over the organization's future.
<P>     The President of SAE, Andrew Athens, told the Macedonian
Press Agency that the talks held between the Presidium and the
country's political leaders were quite productive, although he did
add that he has &quot;concerns.&quot;
<P>     &quot;I wouldn't say that we have complaints, we have concerns,&quot;
stated Mr. Athens adding that &quot;the Greek Government shares these
concerns which are based on the fact that we wish to do more
through the SAE.&quot;
<P>     The president of the Council also expressed his optimism over
the prospect of SAE's self financing, adding that the State has
promised to provide funding by the end of this year.
<P>     SAE's vice-president Elias Rallis, who is also the President
of the Regional SAE of Oceania, stated that, despite the
obstacles, the Presidium has managed to provide the Council with a
vision.
<P>      The president of the Regional SAE of Europe, Agathaggelos
Aslanides, hailed this conference as the best ever.
<P>     &quot;We believe that the political void will soon be covered,&quot;
Mr. Aslanides stated, adding that the Government's stance as well
as the Inter-party Committee's, was especially satisfactory.
<P>     However, two of SAE's secretaries, Dimtiris Konstantinides
and Paschalis Papachristopoulos, were overall more critical.
<P>     &quot;At some point Greece must decide if it wishes to sustain a
Hellenic community abroad, and how they want this community,&quot; Mr.
Konstantinides stated, urging that the whole issue must be viewed
from a clearly technical view, not an emotional one.
<P>     Mr. Papachristopoulos stated that the Greek communities
abroad are disappointed with the Greek State's stance towards
them, partially caused by a continuous change in leadership which
in turn results in a continuous change in policies concerning
Greeks abroad.

<H3><A NAME="11">[11]</a> UNESCO TO ESTABLISH SCHOOL PROGRAM PROMOTING BALKAN REGIONS' ROLE</H3>
<P>     The Balkan region's contribution to world peace, and the
strengthening of solidarity and cooperation of the Balkan
countries, will be the focus of a program titled &quot;Improvement of
Peoples' Ties Through the School Book&quot;, jointly organized by
UNESCO and the Women's Association of Inter-Balkan Cooperation.
<P>     This program of UNESCO (the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization) sees for an examination of
the language and history school books taught in Balkan countries
that may contain nationalist and propagandist excerpts which can
easily influence the young readers.
<P>     &quot;Many of the school books of the Balkan countries have a
negative and antagonistic disposition towards neighboring states.
There are excerpts in some of these books that promote chauvinism
and isolation,&quot; accordng to Ms. Titika Vouloni-MacGrew, a NATO
employee and UNESCO volunteer.
<P>     Moreover, Ms. Vouloni-MacGrew told the Macedonian Press
Agency that a recent study showed that fifty percent of these
school books contain negative reports for the neighboring
countries in the Balkans, while twenty-five percent contain
neutral references and another twenty-five percent contain
positive ones.
<P>     &quot;This phenomenon must be eradicated in order to achieve
mutual understanding  and cooperation among the Balkan peninsula's
states,&quot; she stated.
<P>     A forerunner of this program is a Balkan conference to be
organized by UNESCO, for the exchange of views among Balkan
Culture Ministers, and various academicians and historians from
the region.
<P>     The Council of Europe has already expressed its support of
the school program, a move that opens prospects for securing the
European Union's cooperation as well.

<H3><A NAME="12">[12]</a> STRONG SLAP TO TURKEY FROM COUNCIL OF EUROPE'S COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS</H3>
<P>     In an unprecedent decision, the Council of Europe's Court of
Human Rights has ruled in favor of a Greek-Cypriot woman's claim
over the illegal occupation of her land by Turkish occupation
forces, while also announcing in its decision that the matter
concerns a &quot;continuous violation of human rights.&quot;
<P>     The President of the Republic of Cyprus Glafkos Clerides
saluted the court's ruling today, which was voted 11-6 in favor,
and stated that it constitutes a great victory that could bear
quite positive influence on the Cyprus issue.
<P>     The plaintiff, Titina Loizidou, sought recourse to the
European Court when the Turkish government refused to allow her
access to the occupied northern Cyprus territory where she has a
vacation home.
<P>     As such, President Clerides pointed out, given that Ms.
Loizidou's residence was only seasonal, the Court's ruling for
those cases that concern permanent residents of the  occupied
territory who are refused access to their land and homes can be of
greater significance.
<P>     In its ruling, the Court rejected Turkey's claims that the
accord for human rights in Europe cannot be enforced in northern
Cyprus' occupied territory.
<P>     The Court has granted Turkey a six-month time period to file
its response concerning Ms. Loizidou's claim for restitution.
<P>     Ms. Loizidou's attorney pointed out that the significance of
the Court's ruling lies on the fact that Turkey is, for the first
time, held responsible by the international community for
violations of human rights, due to its continuous occupation of
part of Cyprus.

refugees against Turkey is awaited to reach the European Court of
Human Rights, following today's ruling that upheld a Greek-Cypriot
woman's claim against Turkey for refusing her access to her home

examine the &quot;irregularities&quot; noted in some precincts where the
country's main opposition, the three-member coalition &quot;Zajedno&quot;
(Together) prevailed.
<P>     Moreover, Mr. Milosevic added that those who are found
responsible for these &quot;irregularities&quot; will be punished.
<P>     He also promised the students that the Government and
Minister of Justice will examine their claims, which mostly see
eye to eye with the opposition's cries of foul.

<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</a> STATE SHIFTED ITS STANCE, BUT FARMERS REMAIN UNWAVERING, SAYS REPPAS</H3>
<P>     The Government has shifted from its original positions, but
the farmers remain unwavering in their barricades, stated the
Press and Mass Media Minister Dimitris Reppas today.
<P>     The Government spokesperson also implicated the opposition
party leaders as having played a role in the farmers'
mobilizations by stating that &quot;their silence speaks volumes&quot; since
they've appeared reluctant to denounce the road blockades so far.
A.F.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</a> TENSIONS RISE IN PARLIAMENT OVER FARMERS' MOBILIZATIONS</H3>
<P>     Tensions rose in Parliament last evening, during the
discussion of the 1997 State budget, over the farmers'
mobilizations.
<P>     Prime Minister Kostas Simitis accused the main opposition -
New Democracy-  leader Miltiades Evert of demagogery, while Mr.
Evert called the Premier a &quot;liar.&quot;
<P>     Meanwhile, the Pan-Thessaly Farmers Coordinating Committee
will convene once again this afternoon to map out its next moves,
following the impasse reached yesterday during its meeting with
Agriculture Minister Stephanos Tzoumakas.
A.F.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</a> SEAMEN, DOCKWORKERS CONTINUE STRIKE, SHIPS IMMOBILIZED AT PIRAEUS PORT</H3>
<P>     Ships under domestic and foreign flags continue to remain
moored at Greece's ports, due to the continued strike of the
country's seamen and dockworkers who have decided to extend their
work stoppage until tomorrow.
<P>     At Thessaloniki's port, vessels were allowed to sail later
this morning, although hundreds of others remain stranded at the
rest of the country's ports, unable to embark on their
destinations.
<P>     Minister of Merchant Marine Stavros Soumakis stated that the
seamen's problems cannot be solved under a state of threats.
<P>     The National Marine Federation will convene this afternoon in
order to see whether or not the strikes will be extended.
A.F.
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</a> FARMERS IN NORTHERN GREECE CALLED OFF THEIR MOBILIZATIONS</H3>
<P>     The Coordinating Committee of the striking farmers in
Macedonia-Thrace decided to call off their mobilizations in
northern Greece.
<P>     In a statement the Committee stresses that the decision was
made in view of the Christmas holidays and in order to give time
to the Prime Minister to materialize his promise-pledge to meet
with the farmers' Coordinating Committees for a dialogue aimed at
the solution of existing problems.
<P>     Also, is mentioned that if those pledges are not turned into
actions soon, the farmers will again be ready to assert their
demands with new mobilizations.
<P>     The Coordinating Committee will not be dissolved and will
meet again after the Christmas holidays to assess the government's
actions and to respond accordingly.
<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</a> FARMERS' COMMITTEES TO DECIDE TODAY IF THEY WILL CONTINUE MOBILIZATIONS</H3>
<P>     The Farmers Coordinating Committee of Thessaly, a valley in
central Greece,  will convene this afternoon in order to decide
whether or not they will continue their mobilizations.
<P>     Their meeting yesterday with Agriculture Minister Stephanos
Tzoumakas was fruitless, since none of the six demands they put
forward was met.
<P>     Meanwhile, the Coordinating Committee of Macedonia-Thrace
Farmers is currently holding a meeting, although the barricades in
this region have come down, with the exception of the roadblock in
Malgara which the farmers open and close at will.
A.F.
<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</a> ALTERNATE FOREIGN MINISTER FORWARDS X-MAS MESSAGE TO GREEKS ABROAD</H3>
<P>     Greece's alternate Foreign Minister George Papandreou has
forwarded a holiday message to the Greek communities living
abroad.
<P>     In his message, Mr. Papandreou reminds the Greeks living
abroad that &quot;especially these days, everyone's thoughts are on
Hellenism living all over the world which, through the bastions of
Hellenism and Orthodoxy, tradition and faith, shines with its
bright presence every day.&quot;
A.F.

European countries.
<P>     The General Assembly of Greece's branch of the European
Parliament of Youth will convene on Sunday and will address the
relations between the European Union and Turkey, especially in
light of the European Commission's recent decisions, as well as
the EU's regional restructure and the principle of subsidiarity.

<H3><A NAME="10">[10]</a> NEW PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN BOSNIA TAKES OVER TODAY</H3>
<P>     NATO defense ministers have ordered new alliance-led peace
force into Bosnia to police the Dayton peace accords, as the
mandate of the current force expires today.
<P>     The NATO foreign ministers last week formally agreed to send
a 25,000-30,000-strong force to Bosnia for a further 18 months to
police the peace accords which ended the 3-1/2 year war in
November 1995. The new Stabilization Force (SFOR), which takes
over from an Implementation Force (IFOR) double its size, was
endorsed by the UN Security Council.
<P>     The 16 ministers, who recently met Brussels to discuss reform
of the Alliance and relations with Russia, issued an &quot;ACT-ORD&quot;
(order to act) to the new force one week in advance so that
commanders could begin deployment ahead of the transfer date.
A.F.
<H3><A NAME="11">[11]</a> IRANIAN PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO TURKEY DIVIDES ANKARA, CONCERNS U.S.</H3>
<P>     Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's current visit to
Turkey has apparently divided Ankara's political circles, while
also raising a few eyebrows within the U.S. State Department which
interprets such contacts as a sign of Islamist-led Turkey's
further alienation from western ideals.
<P>     The Iranian president's official four-day visit is to result
in a series of Iranian-Turkish trade, economic and environmental
agreements, according to the BBC, while Turkish Premier Necmettin
Erbakan has emphasized that cooperation in the arms industry could
only be to the benefit of both Tehran and Ankara.
<P>     However, Turkish Defense Minister Turhan Dayan, a deputy with
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller's &quot;True Path&quot; party, appeared
linearly opposed to the Islamist Premier's proposals and stated
that &quot;under the current circumstances, cooperation between the two
countries is not appropriate.&quot;
A.F.
<H3><A NAME="12">[12]</a> THREE GREEK-AMERICANS WERE APPOINTED AS HIGH OFFICIALS IN THE WHITE HOUSE</H3>
<P>     US newspapers write about the appointment of seven new high
officials in the White House, among whom are three Greek-
Americans. George Stephanopoulos, who leaves his post in the White
House to teach in Columbia University, work for ABC television
channel and write a book, will be replaced by Ram Emanuel.
<P>     Two of the three Greek-Americans, John Pontesta and Silvia
Mathius, were appointed deputies of the new White House Chief of
Staff mr.E.Bowls, while the third of them, Victoria Rant was
appointed as mr.Bowls' Office Director.
<P>     The &quot;Washington Post&quot; writes that the selection of those
specific persons reflects the preference the Chief of Staff has to
young and bright people who are easy to work with. The newspaper
writes that the White House Chief of Staff had described 31yearold
Silvia Mathius, as one of the brightest young women in America. It
is believed that due to her personality and the fact that she has
a good relationship with television cameras, will be a new George
Stephanopoulos, in a female version.
<H3><A NAME="13">[13]</a> CONCERN IN CYPRUS OVER THE POSITION OF THE NEW UN SECRETARY- GENERAL ON THOSE MISSING SINCE THE TURKISH INVASION</H3>
<P>     The families and relatives of those still missing since the
Turkish invasion of Cyprus and the Parliamentary Committee on
refugees express concern over the information that new UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan will ask from Cypriot President
Glafkos Clerides to declare as pressumed dead the 992 Greek-
Cypriots whose fate is unknown since July and August of 1974.
<P>     President of the Parliamentary Committee for the Missing and
Refugees, Aristophanis Georgiou mentioned that the UN Secretary-
General must clarify his position on Cyprus' accession course into
the EU and on the plans of the UN Human Rights Committee regarding
the missing people.
<P>     Both the Cypriot Parliament and the families of the missing
are calling the Cypriot government to ask for explanations from
mr.Annan.
<H3><A NAME="14">[14]</a> THE CYPRIOT PRESIDENT MET WITH THE US AMBASSADOR TO NICOSIA</H3>
<P>     Foreign governments are realizing that the situation in
Cyprus can be likened to an active volcano ready to explode,
stressed Cypriot President Glafkos Clerides after his meeting with
US Ambassador to Nicosia Keneth Brill.
<P>     The US Ambassador referring to the recent statements made by
US President Bill Clinton, who has pledged to work hard for Cyprus
and the Greek-Turkish relations, underlined that his government's
objective is the promotion of negotiations for the solution of the
Cyprus problem in the first half of 1997.
<H3><A NAME="15">[15]</a> TOSEFSKI DENIES PUBLICATIONS ALLEGING THAT FYROM'S GOVERNMENT HAS THE POLITICAL WILL TO CHANGE THE ARTICLE OF THE CONSTITUTION CONCERNING THE COUNTRY'S NAME</H3>
<P>     Ambassador Ivan Tosefski, who represents FYROM in the talks
held with Greece  in New York, denied press publications according
to which he allegedly stated that his government has the political
will to change the article in the Constitution concerning the name
of his country.
<P>     Mr.Tosefski in a telephone interview with FYROM's state radio
station, maintained that his statement was misinterpreted by the
Greek mass media, clarifying that he had stated that there is a
political will for finding a solution mutually advantageous to
both countries.
<H3><A NAME="16">[16]</a> ERBAKAN CALLS FOR RENEGOTIATION OF THE TURKISH-ISRAELI AGREEMENT FOR THE MODERNIZATION OF TURKISH AIRCRAFT</H3>
<P>     Turkish Prime Minister Necmetin Erbakan reneges on the terms
of the latest agreemnet signed with Israel for the modernization
of 54 &quot;F-4&quot; military planes, in an effort to minimize reactions
from the Welfare Party and from certain islamist countries.
<P>     According to the newspaper &quot;Zaman&quot;, mr.Erbakan after the
ratification of the agreement with Israel began strong efforts to
cut the estimated cost of 632 million dollars which will be paid
to Israel for the modernization of the Turkish Air Force.
<P>     In a letter he sent last week to the Ministry of Defence,
mr.Erbakan calls for significant changes in the agreement and
specifically, asks that the aircraft's electronic navigation
systems, with a total cost of 100 million dollars, be manufactured
by turkish companies.
<H3><A NAME="17">[17]</a> ERBAKAN TRIES TO DOWNGRADE CILLER'S ROLE</H3>
<P>     The Turkish press saw the decision of Prime Minister Necmetin
Erbakan to limit certain powers of the Turkish Foreign Ministry as
an effort to downgrade the role of Tansu Ciller.
<P>     Mr.Erbakan with a surprise circular, as it is described by
the newspaper &quot;Hurriyet&quot;, takes away from the Foreign Ministry the
authority to coordinate all the economic and political relations
with the Turks living abroad and with islamist countries and gives
it to Minister of Prime Minister's Department Abdullah Gul.
<P>     The newspaper stresses that with this action the Foreign
Minister's powers are restricted to the promotion of political
relations, while &quot;shadow&quot; Minister Abdullah Gul, from the Welfare
Party, is being upgraded.
<P>     According to the newspaper, Minister Namik Kemal Zeimbek,
from Ciller's &quot;True Path&quot; Party, who chairs the joint economic
committees of Turkey, Kazakstan and Azerbadjan, is also being
upgraded.
<H3><A NAME="18">[18]</a> THE TURKISH MILITARY SENT A WARNING LETTER TO DEMIREL</H3>
<P>     According to the Turkish press, the Turkish General Army
Staff has prepared a warning letter addressed to Turkish President
Suleiman Demirel.
<P>     Turkish newspaper &quot;Zaman&quot; writes in a front page article that
a high ranking military officer has confirmed the letter's
existence stressing that the letter is not a warning but rather
has an advisory role especially, on issues on which the military
is sensitive.
<P>     According to &quot;Zaman&quot;, the letter was prepared in the Navy
headquarters and was drawn up by Land Forces Chief, General Dogu
Aktulga and General Staff deputy Chief, General Tsevik Bir.
Mr.Demirel will convey the contents of the letter to the political
party leaders in their meeting on December 22.
<H3><A NAME="19">[19]</a> F.R.Y.: OSCE DELEGATION ARRIVES IN BELGRADE, LED BY SPAIN FORMER PREMIER</H3>
<P>     A delegation from the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) arrived in Belgrade late this
evening, to investigate the process followed in  the Federal
Yugoslav Republic's recent municipal elections that led to month-
long cries of foul from the main opposition whose victory was
annuled in a number of municipalities.
<P>     Leading the delegation, Spain's former Premier Felipe
Gonzalez stated that the visit is not to be seen as &quot;mediation&quot;
but rather as an effort to shed light into what exactly happened
during the local elections.
<P>     The OSCE delegates are to meet with the F.R.Y.'s Serb
President Slobodan Milosevic this evening, as well as with the
leader of the tri-partite main opposition &quot;Zajedno&quot; (Together).
<P>     Mr. Gonzalez did clarify that the results of the
investigation process will be publicised through the OSCE
headquarters in Vienna, not through Belgrade.
<P>     Meanwhile, students and opposition supporters continue to
rally in the streets of Belgrade, with similar rallies held in
other seven cities in the Serb Republic.
<P>     One of Zajedno's leaders, Zoran Djindjic, has told the
Macedonian Press Agency   that the opposition will ask for local
elections to be reheld in every municipality, not only in those
whose results were annuled.
A.F.
<H3><A NAME="20">[20]</a> REPEATED THREATS DROVE KEMAL TO FLEE TURKEY FOR SWITZERLAND</H3>
<P>     Turkish author Yasar Kemal fled his land fo Switzerland after
being repeatedly subjected to threats by ultra-right Turks,
according to Dennmark's daily &quot;Politicken&quot;.
<P>     According to the article, the popular author did not seek
asylum in Switzerland, but instead chose this country in order to
continue with his work without harassment and also as a sign of
protest against the pressures exerted by the Turkish government.
<P>     Kemal has stated that Turkey's National Security Council and
military staff are sensitive to criticism of the country's
judicial system and they do not tolerate any form of criticism.
<P>     &quot;To be critical, is a natural right,&quot; Kemal has stated, &quot;but
in Turkey it's a crime. The State now threatens us with the death
penalty or incarceration. The Turkish Republic was founded upon
crimes against the people. In eastern Turkey, the Kurds and my
relatives are thrown off their land by force.&quot;

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> BA to sever ties with USAir and sell its 25% stake</H3>
British Airways said it plans to sell all of its shares in USAir, but
stressed that the sale wasn't related to the US carrier's lawsuit.
<P>The British airline said that it was required to offer the shares to USAir
before selling them and that the U.S. airline has 60 days to decide whether
to purchase the 25% stake. BA said it was not disclosing the price it has
offered.
<P>In addition, it said it has exercised its rights to require USAir to
register all the shares BA holds in order for a public offering to take
place. If USAir doesn't take up the offer, BA will be free to sell the
stake privately or in a public offering.
<P>BA said its three directors on USAir's board would resign when the stake,
currently around 25%, is sold.
<P>In the statement, BA's chief executive officer Bob Ayling said the sale had
not resulted from USAir's recent lawsuit against BA related to the British
carrier's proposed strategic alliance with American Airlines.
<P>'British Airways has taken this action with regret. But it has become
inevitable. It would clearly be unwise to pursue an alliance with an
unwilling partner. We still believe the legal action to be groundless,'
Ayling said.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> London Electricity accepts $2.11 billion takeover bid from Entergy</H3>
London Electricity has accepted a 1.27 billion ($2.11 billion) takeover
bid from Entergy of the U.S.
<P>Entergy, bidding through its Entergy Power U.K. subsidiary, said London
Electricity shareholders will receive an already announced 14.3 pence-per-
share special dividend and that the offer represents a 27% premium to the
share price in late October, before bid speculation in the sector pushed
London Electricity's share price higher. The bid values London
Electricity's shares at 705 pence apiece.
<P>Entergy said that the U.K. regional electricity company, which supplies
power to the nation's capital city, will ''provide a platform for Entergy's
future expansion in Europe'' and ''for developing an expanded business in
the U.K.''
<P>London Electricity's decision to recommend the offer to shareholders
contrasts with another recent bid for a U.K. electricity company. Northern
Electricity is fighting a hostile takeover bid from CalEnergy.
<P>London Electricity said it was pleased with the Entergy bid. ''The board of
London Electricity considers that the offer represents fair value for
London Electricity and is in the best interests of London Electricity
shareholders, customers and employees,'' London Electricity Chairman Sir
Bob Reid said.
<P>He added that the partnership will help London develop a strong business
base and further its focus on customer service. Nigel Hawkins, analyst at
Yamaichi, said widespread expectations of an Entergy bid is the main reason
that London Electricity's share price has climbed only modestly so far.
<P>''The price Entergy is paying is par for the course, and the bid comes as
no real surprise given the disclosure a couple of weeks ago that the two
parties were in talks,'' Hawkins said.
<P>He added that concerns that the MMC might launch an enquiry have faded
since other U.S. companies have been allowed to proceed with takeover bids
for U.K. targets.
<P>However, he added that there remains the political risk of the government's
objecting to a U.S. company's taking over the electricity distributor in
the capital city.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> UK jobless rate drops to 6.9% in November</H3>
British unemployment dropped to 6.9% in November, from 7.2% in October, as
the number of people out of work slid to its lowest level since 1991.
<P>The number of unemployed fell by 95,800, the biggest fall since 1971, to
1.93 million.
<P>The fall, reported by the Office for National Statistics, was nearly four
times as large as the decline of 25,000 economists were expecting and the
largest monthly fall since the series began in January 1971.
<P>It took the level of unemployment to its lowest since January 1991. It was
last below 2 million in February 1991.
<P>The ONS said around 25,000 of fall was probably accounted for by the
recently-introduced jobseeker's allowance. It said it is not possible to
give and underlying trend for the fall in unemployment but said the
downward trend is still within the 15,000 to 20,000 estimated last month
and is possibly faster.
<P>The number of people employed in manufacturing rose by 6,000 in October to
3,939,000, an increase of more than 1,000 on the year.
<P>The stock of vacancies at government employment offices rose by a
seasonally adjusted 7,100 to 269,700 in November, the highest level since
the series began in January 1980.
<P>Other official figures showed retail sales rose 0.7% in November after a
0.5% gain in October.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> Northern Electric continues defence efforts against CalEnergy</H3>
Northern Electric again stepped up its defence against a hostile takeover
from CalEnergy of the US by saying earnings growth and debt reduction will
both exceed market expectations this year.
<P>The British regional electric company also cited a 1.2 billilon agreed
takeover bid for as an example of how CalEnergy's bid undervalues the
company.
<P>The British regional electric company said it expects pretax profit for
fiscal 1997 to be 14% ahead of current market expectations.
<P>The company predicted that net debt at the same time will be 46 pence a
share lower than market estimates.
<P>The news comes as a further stage of defence against a hostile takeover bid
from U.S. company CalEnergy.
<P>Northern also reiterated it's belief that the CalEnergy bid is too low.
Northern noted Entourage's 1.2 billion agreed takeover bid for London
Electricity as an example of how cheap CalEnergy bid is.
<P>'If Northern Electric's shareholders were being offered the same cash flow
multiple as those in London Electricity, they would be receiving around 780
pence per ordinary share in cash,' Northern said.
<P>CalEnergy boosted its offer for Northern Electric to 650 pence a share on
Dec. 6, and said the offer won't be improved before the offer period closes
this Friday.
<P>In an unusual response to Entergy's bid, Northern said Wednesday that if
the cash-flow ratios used in valuing London Electricity were applied to
Northern Electric, CalEnergy's bid would have to be 780 pence a share.
<P>Northern has said CalEnergy's offer price, which values it at 782 million,
is still too low and that major shareholders, including insurance giant
Prudential Corp., oppose the takeover.
<P>The U.K. government cleared CalEnergy's bid on Friday, meaning it won't be
referred to the U.K. Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The move suggests
Entergy's bid also will be waved through by regulators.
<P>London Electricity was pleased with the offer.
<P>'The board of London Electricity considers that the offer represents fair
value for London Electricity and is in the best interests of London
Electricity shareholders, customers and employees,' London Electricity
Chairman Sir Bob Reid said.
<P>He added that the partnership will help London develop a strong business
base and further its focus on customer service.
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> Gulf Canada offers $721 million cash for Clyde Petroleum</H3>
Gulf Canada Resources has made a 432 million ($721 million) cash takeover
bid for Britain's Clyde Petroleum.
<P>The Canadian company said the bid represented a premium of 24.3% over the
mid-market quotation for a Clyde share of 84 1/2 pence at yesterday's
close.
<P>The group said in a statement that it already owned 7.4 million Clyde
shares, or about .8% of the UK oil and gas exploration company's shares.
<P>'The offer for Clyde follows Gulf Canada's previously stated desire to
increase its activities outside of its existing core areas of North America
and Indonesia,' J. P. Bryan, president and chief executive of Gulf Canada
said.
<P>The company added that Clyde's North Sea and Australian assets would
provide it with additional core areas, while Clyde's Indonesian assets
would complement its existing assets.
<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> Van Miert says Boeing, McDonnell merger may be `problematic'</H3>
Comments by the European Union's top antitrust official about the merger of
U.S. aircraft makers Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have left analysts and
Boeing's archrival Airbus Industrie reeling.
<P>Analysts, and Airbus, don't agree with the opinion of E.U. Competition
Commissioner Karel Van Miert that the merged group could run afoul of E.U.
antitrust rules.
<P>Van Miert called the case 'complex and problematic,' and said the
Commission would be particularly interested in the market position of
Boeing as a result of the link.
<P>The competition czar said European planemaker Airbus, which groups Daimler-
Benz of Germany, Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace and Spain's
Construcciones Aeronauticas, hadn't yet contacted the Commission regarding
the merger, but said he expected to hear from the company. 'I'm sure, one
way or another, Airbus will give us the benefit of their views,' he told
journalists.
<P>Not necessarily, says Airbus.
<P>'Why does he want to hear from us?' asked Robert Alizart, Vice President of
corporate communications at Airbus in Toulouse. He says the European
conglomerate isn't quaking in its shoes at the prospect of competing with
the McDonnell/Boeing powerhouse.
<P>'The terms of the competition aren't altered much,' by the merger news,
Alizart said. Airbus takes a 'serene' view of the merger, he added.
<P>Airbus says that it had a hold in 1996 on some 41% of the global market in
which it competes with Boeing, while it reckons Boeing controlled 53% of
that market. Neither Boeing nor Airbus had estimates for their grip on the
E.U. market, which is of primary interest to the Commission.
<P>Airbus' Alizart noted that McDonnell Douglas' grip on the civil aviation
market has dwindled enormously and added that the merger shouldn't hit
Airbus sales substantially.
<P>'The manufacture of civil aviation jets is a two-horse race anyway,' he
said. ' Douglas is out of the civil aviation business.' For its part,
Seattle-based Boeing said it 'intends to provide information about its
merger with McDonnell Douglas to the Commission,' but added that it doesn't
foresee competition concerns.
<P>'We don't anticipate any impediments to this merger from the E.U.
Commission since Europe's principal commercial aircraft manufacturer,
Airbus, has already stated that the merger doesn't change the competition
environment,' spokesman Tim Neil said from Seattle.
<P>Analysts generally agree with the companies saying the merger won't have a
negative effect on competition.
<P>'Douglas had faded as a force in the civil airline market and consolidating
its product into Boeing's range doesn't change the competitive dynamic
which remains a war between Boeing and Airbus,' said analyst Chris Avery of
Paribas Capital Markets in London.
<P>Zafar Khan, analyst at Societe Generale in London, said the Commission's
action would have little impact anyway at this stage. The merger is `a done
deal,' he said.
<P>The aviation megamerger will create a global colossus with estimated annual
sales of $48 billion and an estimated 60% grip on the world's market for
large, commercial jetliners. The merged company will also manufacture a
range of military planes.
<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> German M3 money-supply growth slid preceptibly in November</H3>
The Bundesbank said Germany's M3 money-supply growth slowed `markedly' in
November, damped by a clear rise in capital formation.
<P>The broad money category expanded at an annual 8% rate in the month
following an 8.4% pace in October. The rate was at the lower end of
economists' expectations of an 8% to 8.2% growth rate.
<P>The central bank said growth was slowed by a 'a considerable revival of
monetary capital formation and larger capital shifts into the Euro market.'
damped M3 in October.
<P>'After the strong rise in money stock in October, monetary development in
November slowed perceptibly,' the central bank said.
<P>The Bundesbank's target range for M3 growth in 1996 is 4% to 7% and the
bank is scheduled to set its 1997 target range tomorrow.
<P>Bank lending to domestic non-banks remained buoyant but public sector
lending slowed slightly while private sector lending grew.
<P>Among savings components, only savings accounts grew in the period while
other components eased.
<P>'Even sight deposits, which rose unexpectedly fast in the previous month
due to the acquisition of Telekom shares, were scaled back considerably,'
the Bundesbank said.
<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</A> Japan's trade surplus shows first expansion in two years</H3>
An unexpected expansion in Japan's November trade surplus was partly due to
special factors and the surplus could shrink again in coming months - but
the data confirmed the surplus is likely to enter a rising trend sometime
next year, economists said.
<P>'The timing was a surprise,' Yasushi Okuda, economist at BZW Securities
Japan, said of news that the merchandise trade surplus expanded 0.2% from
year-earlier levels to 675.19 billion yen.
<P>That was the first increase in 2 years, and the surplus was far bigger than
the 498.8 billion yen that a survey of Tokyo-based economists by AP-Dow
Jones has forecast.
<P>Like some other economists, Okuda had expected the first rise in the
surplus to occur early next year. Special factors, including a sudden
decline in oil prices, caused it to happen earlier than expected.
<P>Okuda said the surplus could therefore resume falling year-on-year in
December, and possibly continue dropping in January.
<P>But a series of rises in the surplus should then begin later in 1997,
economists said.
<P>'Looking at the trend line, (the November data) isn't surprising,' says
Mineko Sasaki-Smith, an economist at CS First Boston.
<P>Economists noted that a major factor behind the rise in the surplus was a
sharp rise in automobile exports - something that could well continue in
coming months. The depreciation of the yen has made Japan's auto exporters
more competitive, while they have been boosting exports to assure US market
share until their new capacity in the US comes on stream in the next few
years.
<P>Many economists warned that the sudden reversal heralded a possible return
of trade friction with the US and a shift in US authorities' stance in
favour of a strong dollar.
<P>November auto exports rose 27.7% on the year, while passenger car exports
gained 32.1%, CS First Boston's Sasaki-Smith noted. The rise in car exports
was especially dependent on a 45.7% surge in shipments to the US.
<P>Overall, Japan's politically-sensitive trade surplus with the US surged
31.2% to 378.39 billion yen in November from the year-earlier month.
<P>On the other hand, the importance of auto shipments to the US in overall
exports could make Japan's economy vulnerable to a slowdown, economists
said. 'That's a danger if the US economy slows,' BZW's Okuda says.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> Turkey guilty of human rights violations, says Euro Court</H3>
<STRONG>Nicosia, Dec 18 (CNA)</STRONG> --The European Court of Human Rights found Turkey
guilty of continuing human rights violations with regard to Article 1 of
Protocol 1 of the European Convention of Human Rights.
<P>The judgement of the Court issued in Strasbourg today read: ''in the
case of Loizidou versus Turkey, the European Court, by 11 votes to six,
held that there has been a continuing violation in relation to her
immovable property situated in Kyrenia and which since 1974 has been under
the control of the Turkish army.''
<P>Titina Loizidou, a Greek Cypriot from the Turkish-occupied town of
Kyrenia, brought her case against Turkey alleging violation of her right to
peacefully enjoy her property, which lies in the area of the Republic of
Cyprus under Turkish occupation since 1974.
<P>Loizidou's lawyer, Achilleas Demetriades, told CNA today ''this is the
first time Turkey is held accountable in the international scene for human
rights violations in Cyprus' Turkish-occupied areas.''
<P>Article 1 of Protocol 1 stipulates that ''every natural or legal person
is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.''

<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> Immense effects of Euro Court decision on Cyprus</H3>
<STRONG>Nicosia, Dec 18 (CNA)</STRONG> -- President Glafcos Clerides said a decision today
by the European Court of Human Rights, which found Turkey guilty of
continuing human rights violations, will have immense effects on the Cyprus
problem.
<P>Titina Loizidou, brought her case against Turkey alleging violation of
her right to peacefully enjoy her property in the Turkish occupied northern
part of the island.
<P>Describing the decision as a ''great success'', President Clerides
noted that Loizidou's case was justified even though it was over a holiday
residence and she was not living permanently in the area.
<P>''The effects of such a decision can be even greater, if we take into
account the cases of permanent residents forced to abandon their homes,''
Clerides added.
<P>The importance of the Court decision was also pointed out by Attorney
General, Alecos Markides.
<P>A press release, issued by the Court Wednesday said, the European Court
''held that the denial to the applicant of access to her property in the
northern part of Cyprus and consequent loss of control thereof was
imputable to Turkey and amounted to a violation of the applicant's property
rights, under Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the European Convention of Human
Rights.''
<P>The Court also held ''unanimously that there had been no interference
with the applicant's right to respect for her home under Article 8 of the
Convention, and that the question of just satisfaction under Article 50 was
not yet ready for decision and should be reserved.''

<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> Historic decision for Cyprus</H3>
<STRONG>Nicosia, Dec 18 (CNA)</STRONG> -- Attorney General Alecos Markides described a
decision by the European Court of Human Rights, which found Turkey
accountable for violations of human rights in Turkish occupied Cyprus, as
''historic.''
<P>Today's ruling marks an unprecedented move which offers the opportunity
to hundreds of Greek Cypriot refugees to claim their right to use and enjoy
their property, in the Turkish occupied part of the Republic.
<P>The Court found Turkey responsible for continuing violation of human
rights in the Turkish occupied areas of Cyprus and said in its ruling that
it ''holds by eleven votes to six that the denial of access to the
applicant's property and consequent loss of control thereof is imputable to
Turkey.''
<P>The Court's decision was warmly welcomed by lawyer Achilleas
Demetriades who argued the case before the European Court on behalf of his
client, Greek Cypriot refugee Titina Loizidou from Turkish occupied Kyrenia
town.
<P>Speaking at a press conference, the Attorney General said ''the ruling
is a landmark in the history of law relating to human rights and the
development of international law.''
<P>This decision, he added, by such a legal body proves there is faith in
the role of international law and the Convention of human rights.
<P>Markides noted the importance of the decision in that it holds Turkey
responsible for human rights violations since it controls the occupied part
of the island and rejected Turkey's arguments that it bears no
responsibility in this part of Cyprus.
<P>''The violation of human rights by Turkey is continuing,'' Markides
explained and referred to the text of the decision which says that the
Turkish army ''exercises effective overall control in northern Cyprus''
through a large number of troops ''engaged in active duties there.''
<P>The decision also states that the ''Republic of Cyprus remains sole
legitimate government of Cyprus'' and the international community does not
regard the puppet regime in occupied Cyprus as a state under international
law.
<P>Replying to press questions, Markides said ''my purpose is not to
encourage or discourage other Cypriots but to explain the decision.''
<P>He also explained that peace negotiations for a political settlement of
the Cyprus question are not related to a case such as this one.
<P>Achilleas Demetriades, lawyer of Greek Cypriot refugee Titina Loizidou
who took Turkey to Court seven years ago, told the press conference the
ruling acknowledges that the property in question ''was, is and will remain
the property of my client.''
<P>He explained that he has already asked for half a million Cyprus pounds
in compensation (about one million US dollars) with regard to the denial of
access to the property and has also asked to exercise freely the right to
peacefully enjoy her property.
<P>Should Turkey refuse to pay up damages, the applicant can ask for
today's ruling to be implemented with regard to Turkey's property or funds
allocated to the country by international organisations.
<P>Polis Polyviou, lawyer with the government's legal department,
described the decision as ''historic'' because it makes clear that Turkey
is responsible for what happens in the occupied areas and points out that
legal rights exist irrespective of military circumstances.
<P>''Perhaps more importantly, the decision does not recognise any legal
status to the illegal Turkish Cypriot regime in occupied Cyprus, which in
turn would render any attempt to recognise this self-styled entity almost
impossible,'' Polyviou said.
<P>In a statement from Strasbourg, Loizidou said the decision was ''a
victory for Cyprus and proves that Europe does recognise justice and cares
that justice should be done.''
<P>''It is a very important decision, not only for me but for all the
Cypriot refugees who have not been able to go home and to their properties
since 1974,'' the statement added.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> Government sticks to its guns</H3>
<STRONG>Nicosia, Dec 22 (CNA)</STRONG> -- The government has reiterated its position that
the responsibility for the defence of the state rests with her, and
expressed displeasure about moves aimed at halting its arms acquisition
programme.
<P>Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides has expressed the government's
displeasure at efforts to include a reference, in a UN Security Council
resolution, to a proposed purchase by Cyprus of the S300 surface-to-air
missiles from Russia.
<P>The US, backed by Britain, favours such a wording in the resolution,
expected to be adopted on Monday for the renewal of the mandate of the UN
Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, but following Russian objections and French
reservations about the draft text, attempts are being made to amend it.
<P>It is believed the text will express grave concern about the increased
level of military forces and equipment of the Republic of Cyprus and the
rate at which these are upgraded, including sophisticated weaponry.
<P>The draft is expected to note with concern the absence of progress
towards a significant reduction of the number of foreign forces in the
Republic of Cyprus, which threaten to increase tension on the island and
the region and render a political settlement complex.
<P>Minister Michaelides told Cyprus radio the government has an obligation
to boost its defences, and noted that nobody has complained in the past 22
years about the illegal transfer to the island, by Turkey, of its military
machine.
<P>The UN estimates that there are over 30,000 Turkish troops in the
northern occupied areas of the Republic since the Turkish invasion in 1974,
in addition to some 4,500 Turkish Cypriot troops, making the ''northern
part of Cyprus one of the most densely militarised areas in the world.''

<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> Arms programmes to continue as planned</H3>
<STRONG>Nicosia, Dec 22 (CNA)</STRONG> -- Defence Minister Costas Eliades has said that arms
acquisition programmes will go ahead as originally planned, irrespective of
outside objections.
<P>Speaking during a visit to army camps on Saturday, Eliades, accompanied
by National Guard Commander Nicolaos Vorvolakos and members of the House
Defence Committee, said the purchase of military hardware acts as a
deterrent.
<P>''We believe the effort to boost our defences is effective and I can
assure the people of Cyprus that their contribution to these efforts are
not in vain,'' Eliades said.
<P>The statements came amid calls from the US and Britain for a halt in
the government's plans to buy the S300 surface-to-air missiles from Russia.
<P>House Defence Committee president, MP Takis Hadjidemetriou, reiterated
the Minister's comments and stressed that, the Republic's weaponry, unlike
Turkey's military hardware in occupied Cyprus, is to deter any possible
offensive against the country.
<P>Hadjidemetriou also noted the sudden concern of the US and the
international community about the Republic's defence-boosting programme,
which renders Cyprus' defence capability a far cry from Turkey's military
might.
<P>In Greece, Defence Minister Akis Tsohazopoulos told the Greek
Parliament Greece aims to upgrade the country's defence capabilities in
order to promote the necessary policy and meet the national interests.
<P>This policy, he said, incorporates the search for a just and viable
solution of the Cyprus question.
<P>Cyprus and Greece agreed in November 1993 to a joint defence policy,
which provides for Greek military air, land and sea cover for Cyprus in the
event of a fresh Turkish offensive against the island.
<P>The Greek government has often said that any such military advance
against Cyprus would mean a casus belli.

exhibition, entitled ''Greek Space,'' to mark the 150th anniversary since
the foundation of the French School of Archaeology in Athens.
<P>The grand exhibition, due in Nicosia in mid-January, will reflect Greek
civilisation through maquettes (small model) of archaeological sites the
Athens School has brought to light during the past 150 years.
<P>Cyprus will be represented in the exhibition with maquettes presenting
finds from Amathus (one of the island's ancient kingdoms), the Temple of
Aphrodite and other archaeological sights.
<P>The exhibition will open in Athens and then move to Cyprus, before
going to Paris and other European capitals. Visitors will be able to wander
around archaeological sites through the use of modern technology, including
CD-Roms.
<P>A series of lectures will also be organised by eminent academics during
the month-long exhibition which opens on January 17th, outlining the
island's archaeological treasures.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> Kornblum on US initiative on Cyprus</H3>
<STRONG>Washington, Dec 21 (CNA)</STRONG> -- The Cyprus question really needs to be solved
now, Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, John
Kornblum, has said during his annual review briefing.
<P>''I would say that there is a very strong consensus in Europe, in the
United States, and I think also in Cyprus, that this is an issue which
really does need to be solved now,'' Kornblum said.
<P>He said also that he worked very hard during the year on the Cyprus
issue, and that Ambassador Madeleine Albright, the designate Secretary of
State, made an important visit in Cyprus.
<P>''We worked quite hard, I worked personally, quite hard on it during
the past year and as you know, Ambassador Albright in her role as US
ambassador to the UN made a very important visit there in the summer,'' he
noted.
<P>The Assistant Secretary of State for Europe pointed out that all the
elements for a solution in Cyprus are present, and it is a question for the
participants to determine whether the time has come to push for a solution.
<P>''I think that we have all of the elements of a solution there, and
it's a question now of the participants, that includes the parties of the
island and it includes the European Union, it includes the United States,
it includes the United Nations, that all the parties now need to determine
whether the time has come to push for a solution,'' Kornblum said.
<P>Referring to this week's visit to Cyprus by the British Foreign
Secretary, Kornblum said Malcolm Rifkind gave a very important push to the
issue. He also announced that, when the new U.S. National Security team is
in place, the US will work very hard to see whether the time has come to
make such a push.
<P>''Secretary Rifkind, I think, gave it a very important push with his
visit. And we will be working once our new team is in place. We'll be
working very hard also to see whether the time has come to make such a push,
'' he added.
<P>Kornblum concluded his remarks on Cyprus by saying that the Cyprus
problem is a very complex issue and he preferred not to go into details
right now.

<STRONG>Nicosia, Dec 21 (CNA)</STRONG> -- Three Cypriot deputies, representing two
parliamentary parties, will attend a breakfast of prayer in Washington in
the presence of US President Bill Clinton in February next year.
<P>One of the MPs, Katerina Paschalidou, of the centre-right Democratic
Party (DIKO), told Cyprus Radio the invitation to breakfast was conveyed to
her from Senators and Congressmen.
<P>The presidential breakfast, to take place at the Washington Hilton
hotel, will be one of many events the Cypriot deputies will attend,
Paschalidou explained.
<P>''We shall have the chance to meet Senators and Congressmen as well as
members of the Greek American community,'' she added.
<P>The four-day programme of the visit to the US, from 4-7 February,
includes dinner and working lunches with American officials.
<P>''The visit will offer me a very good opportunity to be informed about
this kind of programmes and get a better idea about the proposed US
initiative on Cyprus,'' Paschalidou added.
<P>The other two MPs who will go to Washington are DIKO deputy Marcos
Kyprianou and United Democrats MP Androula Vasiliou.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> Washington to discuss Cyprus with Turkey</H3>
<STRONG>Washington, Dec 20 (CNA)</STRONG> -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has
said one of the matters that the U.S. has to work with Turkey next year is
an effort to resolve the Cyprus problem.
<P>The reference to Cyprus follows a recent statement on Cyprus by U.S.
President Bill Clinton, reiterating Washington's interest in a solution to
the Cyprus problem in 1977.
<P>Asked by a Turkish journalist if Turkey is still a front line state for
the U.S. interests, Christopher told his annual review press conference
that ''Turkey remains a country of great importance to the United States.
It's a member of NATO and it sits at a very strategic place in the world.''
<P>He said the United States' friendship for Turkey is ''a very deep one
and we've worked together on a number of matters recently. They've been
assisted the United States in the evacuation of a number of Americans and
others from Northern Iraq.''
<P>The U.S. Secretary of State said ''we continue to have an important
dialogue with them on many, many subjects. And we have many matters to work
on in the course of the next year. I mean, including an effort to resolve
the problems in Cyprus.''
<P>Turkish troops have been occupying 37 per cent of Cyprus territory
since 1974, in violation of repeated UN resolutions calling for their
withdrawal.

<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> US favours cuts in military spending</H3>
<STRONG>Nicosia, Dec 20 (CNA)</STRONG> -- The US has indicated its support for a halt in the
military hardware in Cyprus to enable a political settlement to be reached,
a position outlined earlier this week by Britain.
<P>Asked if the US has attempted to cancel the sale of Russian anti-
aircraft missile system S300 to Cyprus, American ambassador in Nicosia,
Kenneth Brill, replied ''we believe that adding military weapons in Cyprus
or other places is not conducive to moving forward politically.''
<P>This position was also expressed on Monday by British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind at a press conference here during his brief visit to the
island.
<P>Speaking after a meeting with President Glafcos Clerides to review the
year's work, Brill said he had a ''good discussion'' but did not talk about
the ideas Rifkind put forward to both sides, in the course of a press
conference, which covered the main aspects of the Cyprus question and have
been described as Britain's views on Cyprus.
<P>Replying to questions, Brill reiterated American interest in seeing a
solution in Cyprus and added ''The US determination to work on Cyprus was
articulated as recently as Monday by the US President when he said he
anticipated on working hard on Cyprus and Greco-Turkish relations.''
<P>''The documents put out publically in Washington (after the President's
meeting with European Union Commission President Jacques Santer)
specifically mentioned as a goal for the first six months of 1997 promoting
direct negotiations,'' he added.
<P>Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
occupied 37 per cent of its territory.

<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> Cyprus: a dormant volcano, says Clerides</H3>
<STRONG>Nicosia, Dec 20 (CNA)</STRONG> -- President Glafcos Clerides considers that foreign
circles see the situation in Cyprus as ''a dormant volcano'' which could
erupt at any time, with far-reaching repercussions.
<P>The President's comments came after calls from various quarters,
including Britain and the US, for a halt to the military build-up on the
island, including the Republic's plans to purchase the Russian anti-
aircraft missile system S300.
<P>''It is clear that, for the first time, everybody is concerned because,
so far they believed Cyprus to be a dormant volcano, whereas now they see
it can erupt, destabilise the Balkan region and Europe,'' the President
told the press after meeting US ambassador to Cyprus Kenneth Brill.
<P>Asked if Greek Cypriots can stop worrying about their security now, the
President said ''the more armed we are, they less we should worry.''
<P>Commenting on the UN Secretary-General's view that common ground might
be found during peace talks, Clerides reiterated the need to find common
ground between the positions of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides on the
main aspects of the Cyprus question before negotiations begin.
<P>''I believe the position that preparation is necessary to be correct.
Sitting around the negotiating table without reaching common ground would
mean that we will reiterate our positions and be led to a new deadlock,''
the President explained.
<P>Turkish troops have been occupying 37 per cent of Cyprus territory
since 1974, in violation of repeated UN resolutions calling for their
withdrawal.

<STRONG>Nicosia, Dec 20 (CNA)</STRONG> -- Cyprus House of Representatives President Spyros
Kyprianou has congratulated newly-elected UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
wishing him every success in his work.
<P>Kyprianou notes in his congratulatory message that the nations of the
world invest their hopes for a peaceful and more prosperous future.
<P>He points out that the Republic of Cyprus has always been a steadfast
supporter of the efforts to achieve the prevalence of the UN Charter
principles and the respect of its resolutions.
<P>''In this connection I should like to emphasise the paramount
importance which the people of Cyprus attach to the implementation of the
pertinent UN resolutions on Cyprus, as well as the full commitment of their
political leadership to a settlement based on these resolutions and the
full respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms,'' Kyprianou added.
<P>The House President expresses the belief that the new UN Secretary-
General shares this commitment.
<P>This, he concluded, ''will underlie the efforts you will undertake in
the context of your good offices mission on Cyprus.''

<STRONG>Nicosia, Dec 20 (CNA)</STRONG> -- A draft resolution on the situation in Cyprus was
adopted by the Political Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe's (CoE)
Parliamentary Assembly, at a London meeting earlier this week.
<P>The report and resolution was presented Wednesday by the Assembly's
vice president and chairman of the Political Affairs Committee Andras
Barsony, a socialist MP from Hungary, who was recently appointed as a COE
rapporteur on the situation in Cyprus.
<P>Cypriot MP Doros Christodoulides had proposed a number of amendments
aimed to improve certain provisions of the draft resolutions.
<P>A House official press release issued here said a lot of these
amendments were adopted by the Committee.
<P>The Committee decided to present the amended draft resolution for
debate and adoption at the next plenary session of the CoE Parliamentary
Assembly, which will take place in Strasbourg between January 27-31, 1997.
<P>Christodoulides was accompanied to London by Yiannakis Georgiades, Head

<P>Matsis, who suffered a hear attack at the end of November, flew to

<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> Annual export awards given</H3>
<STRONG>Nicosia, Dec 20 (CNA)</STRONG> -- President Glafcos Clerides has called on local
businessmen to invest and improve their methods and produce in order to
meet the challenges ahead.
<P>Speaking at the annual exports award ceremony, the President noted the
recent economic achievements which helped Cyprus meet the Maastricht
criteria, unlike most of the European Union (EU) member-states.
<P>''We shall not deviate from our course towards a united Europe. Our
efforts to harmonise our institutions and legislation with the acquis
communautaire will intensify so that our objectives are achieved by the
time we begin accession negotiations (with the EU),'' the President said.
<P>He noted that the introduction of a common foreign tax system and GATT
(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), will liberalise Cyprus' external
trade.
<P>''What we need is to draft out a strategy which would give the private
sector the leading role,'' he said and urged businessmen to invest in
equipment, upgrade production units, produce new products and offer
improved services.
<P>He stressed the importance of the human factor and improved management
methods.
<P>The government, he assured the business world, will offer support to
local companies to the extent circumstances allow it to do so.
<P>Commerce, Industry and Tourism Minister Kyriakos Christofi said exports
helped ''the country's economic development in that they contribute to
improved production.''
<P>''One of our primary goals must be the continuous development of our
exports in goods and services,'' he added.
<P>Cyprus must, not only offer goods and services at competitive prices,
but also provide the goods at the right time and in the right manner to
attract buyers, the Minister stressed.
<P>The world market, which is becoming smaller by the day because of rapid
development in communications, creates a ''new reality which affects the
production and marketing policies.''
<P>Christofi called on the Cypriot businessmen to undertake initiatives
for the appropriate investment and updating of their businesses, and not to
rely exclusively on measures adopted by the government.
<P>The awards included prizes for industrial products, European Union
award, special prize, agricultural produce award, and services award.

<H3><A NAME="09">[09]</A> Russian assurances to Cyprus on arms sales</H3>
<STRONG>Nicosia, Dec 20 (CNA)</STRONG> -- Russia does not intend to stop selling arms to
Cyprus, reliable sources have told CNA.
<P>This message was communicated to the Republic's embassy in Moscow by
officials of the Russian Foreign Ministry at a briefing today, following
representations to Moscow by Turkey's Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller about
the proposed sale of S300 anti-aircraft missiles.
<P>Ciller was in Moscow earlier this week and is reported to have claimed
obtaining assurances from Russia that it would not go ahead with the sale.
<P>According to reliable sources, close to the Russian News Agency NOVOSTI,
the Russian officials reiterated this position in no uncertain terms.
<P>The officials, the same sources say, had informed Turkey two weeks ago,
through diplomatic channels, about their government's views on the matter
and noted that Russia had no intention of bringing up the issue during
Ciller's visit to Moscow.
<P>Today's briefing paves the way for the purchase of the much publicised
S300 surface-to-air missiles.

<P>The European Commission, acting on scientific advice, had proposed further
reductions aimed at safeguarding both run-down fish stocks and the future
of the EU fishing industry.
<P>'We have agreed sensible and pragmatic quotas,' Irish Marine Minister Sean
Barrett said at a news conference after 21 hours of talks. 'It was
particularly complex with a lot of new elements.'
<P>Belgium and Sweden voted against the deal, officials said.
<P>Belgium wanted a higher North Sea sole quota while Sweden wanted more cod
under a compensation deal agreed when it joined the EU in 1995.
<P>The Commission sought a 50% cut to 12,000 tonnes in catches of seriously
depleted North Sea sole stocks but ministers raised this to 18,000. Belgium
wanted 23,000 tonnes.
<P>British Fisheries Minister Tony Baldry said he had won the best possible
deal for British fishermen consistent with the need to protect stocks.
<P>'The objectives that we set have all been achieved,' Baldry told reporters
after the meeting.
<P>In Western waters, British mackerel quotas are 21,000 tonnes higher while
in the North Sea their plaice quotas are 2,700 tonnes higher than
originally proposed, he said.
<P>One of the most difficult issues was the allocation of quotas under new EU
fisheries agreements with the Baltic States following Sweden and Finland's
entry into the EU.
<P>In the end there was unanimous agreements between the four countries
concerned -- Germany, Denmark, Finland and Sweden.
<P>Denmark reluctantly accepted the introduction of a 15,000 tonnes quota for
by-catches of herring by huge vessels hunting sprats for industrial
processing into fish meal and oil.
<P>Italy and Greece fought off quotas on tuna fishing in the Mediterranean
while measures to restrict sardine fishing off the coasts of Spain and
Portugal were eased.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> German economic data suggest long-term price stability</H3>
German producer and import prices remained unchanged in November,
suggesting strong prospects for price stability in the long-term, but
consumer prices in Hesse clouded the picture somewhat.
<P>Pan-German producer prices were flat in November after a 0.2% rise in
October, while the year-on-year figure was down 0.3%, in line with the
previous month, the Federal Statistics Office said.
<P>A 0.1% month-on-month drop in western Germany was offset by a gain of 0.1%
in the Eastern region.
<P>Separate data showed that import prices were unchanged in November after a
0.6% blip in October linked to a rally in oil prices. The yearly increase
was 1.4%.
<P>Before the data was released, Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing said
Germany's chances of maintaining price stability were unprecedented. 'We
are in a phase of stability in the value of money, which is favourable as
never before,' Issing told German television.
<P>November's producer price data showed a sharp 1.4% increase in tobacco
products, while oil fell back by 1.1%.
<P>Import prices -- excluding oil -- rose by 0.2 percent, showing that oil
imports had exerted a negative influence on the overall figure.
<P>In separate reports, Germany's states have begun reporting their consumer
price data for December, showing that costs have been gaining.
<P>Hesse said consumer prices rose 0.3% in December, after remaining unchanged
the month before. Prices rose 1.4% on the year, up from 1.3%
<P>Prices in Baden-Wuerttemberg rose 0.2% on the month, after a 0.1% gain in
November. On an annual basis, prices rose at a 1.2% rate.
<P>And in Bavaria, consumer prices were up 0.3% from a 0.1% drop the month
before. For the year, prices rose 1.4%.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> CS Holding establishes new credit-risk system</H3>
CS Holding, mimmicking its rivals, has set up a series of measures to
protect itself from risky loans.
<P>Following similar moves by Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank
Corporation, CS Holding said it will introduce 'a new method of credit risk
management.' The parent of Credit Suisse and other banks said the plan aims
to 'offer credit products at conditions which reflect the risks involved.'
<P>Under the current system of provisioning, CS Holding books reserves for
annual defaults.
<P>As part of the risk-management changes, the bank said it will establish
provisions for statistically expected credit losses. An annual credit
provision will be determined and charged to the profit and loss account.
<P>But because the actual credit loss may vary from the expected amount, a
fluctuation reserve will be formed as well. These two reserves will be
recalculated each year in order to reflect shifts in the risk profile of
the bank's loan portfoliio.
<P>For 1996, CS Holding said, this new system means it will set aside 630
million francs as an extraordinary provision for credit risks.
<P>CS Holding said it expected its consolidated profit before deduction of
minority interests to total around 1.8 billion Swiss francs ($1.3 billion)
this year, including ordinary credit provisions of 1.2 billion.
<P>But after extraordinary reserves, provisions and depreciation of a total
3.9 billion francs, CS Holding will report a consolidated loss before
deduction of minority interests of around 2.1 billion for 1996, CS Holding
said.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> French industrial production continues decline</H3>
French industrial production fell in October for the second month in a row,
highlighting more weakness in the economy.
<P>Industrial production excluding energy dropped 0.8% in October compared to
September, yielding a 1% year-on-year rise, national statistics institute
INSEE said.
<P>Manufacturing output, which excludes energy, agri-food businesses and
construction, fell 1.2% month-on-month but was 0.8% higher on the year.
<P>The car industry suffered the biggest setback, with production dropping
3.1% as the positive effect of a year of government-subsidised rebate
programmes wore off. But consumer goods production and construction were
also sharply lower, registering 2.6% and 2.1% declines, respectively.
<P>'It's weak,' said Smith Barney international economist Paul Horne of the
overall production figure. 'The auto effect has got to be huge. The
consumer goods part is bad news because it confirms that it's more than
just cars.'
<P>The report showed seven of the production index's elements fell in October.
Only the agri-food and energy sectors eked out small gains of 0.9% and 0.2%,
respectively. Horne said the weakness in consumer goods production was the
most worrying part of the report because it reflected weak consumer
spending and hinted that production might well remain soft for the rest of
the year.
<P>'The consumer remains a problem,' he said. 'There's a lot of window
shopping going on but that's pretty much it. I would think November and
December will remain weak.'
<P>Separately, INSEE released final data on November consumer prices which
confirmed a small drop in inflation for the month and year-on-year
inflation of 1.6%.
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> Fortis acquires Meespierson for $1.45 billion</H3>
Dutch-Belgian financial group Fortis said it has acquired Dutch merchant
bank MeesPierson from ABN AMRO Bank, for 2.5 billion guilders ($1.45
billion).
<P>Fortis said MeesPierson will make a positive contribution to Fortis'
earnings per share from 1997. 'After due diligence, further talks with the
management of MeesPierson and the usual negotiations, agreement has now
been reached on price and the other conditions,' Fortis said.
<P>Fortis said the acquisition makes it one of the three most important
financial groups in the Benelux region, and the fourth largest bank in the
Netherlands.
<P>With MeesPierson, Fortis said total assets under its management will amount
to more than 99 billion European currency units ($122 billion), bringing
the group to 14th place worldwide.
<P>Fortis said it will finance the acquisition by increasing its net equity,
reallocating available funds and employing various financing instruments.
<P>The two parent companies of the group, Belgium's Fortis and Fortis Amev in
the Netherlands, will each contribute equal amounts in cash in order to
increase the group's net equity. Fortis noted that these measures will take
into account the financing needs involved in a possible increase of Fortis'
stake in ASLK-CGER Bank and ASLK-CGER Insurance in 1997.
<P>Fortis, the company said, is considering a capital increase in 1997, with
the subscription right reserved for existing shareholders only. Fortis Amev
will provide the necessary funds from its own assets.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> PRESIDENT STEPHANOPOULOS EMBARKS ON OFFICIAL VISIT TO EGYPT
TODAY</H3>
<H4>Athens, December 20 (MPA)</H4>
President of the Hellenic Republic Kostis Stephanopoulos
embarked today on his four-day offficial visit to Egypt, at the
invitation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
<P>In Cairo, President Stephanopoulos, who is accompanied by
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, will meet with the Egyptian
President tomorrow, while today's contacts will be dedicated
mostly to Alexandria's Greek community. Mr. President will also
visit the Konstantinos Kavafis Museum, dedicated to the memory of
the famous Greek poet who was born and raised in Alexandria, and
is scheduled to meet with Metropolitan Dionysus.
A.F.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> TENSIONS RISE IN PARLIAMENT OVER FARMERS' MOBILIZATIONS</H3>
<H4>Athens, December 20 (MPA)</H4>
Tensions rose in Parliament last evening, during the
discussion of the 1997 State budget, over the farmers'
mobilizations.
<P>Prime Minister Kostas Simitis accused the main opposition -
New Democracy-  leader Miltiades Evert of demagogery, while Mr.
Evert called the Premier a &quot;liar.&quot;
<P>Meanwhile, the Pan-Thessaly Farmers Coordinating Committee
will convene once again this afternoon to map out its next moves,
following the impasse reached yesterday during its meeting with
Agriculture Minister Stephanos Tzoumakas.
A.F.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> SEAMEN, DOCKWORKERS CONTINUE STRIKE, SHIPS IMMOBILIZED AT
PIRAEUS PORT</H3>
<H4>Athens, December 20 (MPA)</H4>
Ships under domestic and foreign flags continue to remain
moored at Greece's ports, due to the continued strike of the
country's seamen and dockworkers who have decided to extend their
work stoppage until tomorrow.
<P>At Thessaloniki's port, vessels were allowed to sail later
this morning, although hundreds of others remain stranded at the
rest of the country's ports, unable to embark on their
destinations.
<P>Minister of Merchant Marine Stavros Soumakis stated that the
seamen's problems cannot be solved under a state of threats.
<P>The National Marine Federation will convene this afternoon in
order to see whether or not the strikes will be extended.
A.F.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> FARMERS' COMMITTEES TO DECIDE TODAY IF THEY WILL CONTINUE
MOBILIZATIONS</H3>
<H4>Thessaloniki, December 20 (MPA)</H4>
The Farmers Coordinating Committee of Thessaly, a valley in
central Greece,  will convene this afternoon in order to decide
whether or not they will continue their mobilizations.
<P>Their meeting yesterday with Agriculture Minister Stephanos
Tzoumakas was fruitless, since none of the six demands they put
forward was met.
<P>Meanwhile, the Coordinating Committee of Macedonia-Thrace
Farmers is currently holding a meeting, although the barricades in
this region have come down, with the exception of the roadblock in
Malgara which the farmers open and close at will.
A.F.
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> NEW PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN BOSNIA TAKES OVER TODAY</H3>
<H4>Brussels, December 20 (MPA)</H4>
NATO defense ministers have ordered new alliance-led peace
force into Bosnia to police the Dayton peace accords, as the
mandate of the current force expires today.
<P>The NATO foreign ministers last week formally agreed to send
a 25,000-30,000-strong force to Bosnia for a further 18 months to
police the peace accords which ended the 3-1/2 year war in
November 1995. The new Stabilization Force (SFOR), which takes
over from an Implementation Force (IFOR) double its size, was
endorsed by the UN Security Council.
<P>The 16 ministers, who recently met Brussels to discuss reform
of the Alliance and relations with Russia, issued an &quot;ACT-ORD&quot;
(order to act) to the new force one week in advance so that
commanders could begin deployment ahead of the transfer date.

<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> IRANIAN PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO TURKEY DIVIDES ANKARA, CONCERNS
U.S.</H3>
<H4>Ankara, December 20 (MPA)</H4>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's current visit to
Turkey has apparently divided Ankara's political circles, while
also raising a few eyebrows within the U.S. State Department which
interprets such contacts as a sign of Islamist-led Turkey's
further alienation from western ideals.
<P>The Iranian president's official four-day visit is to result
in a series of Iranian-Turkish trade, economic and environmental
agreements, according to the BBC, while Turkish Premier Necmettin
Erbakan has emphasized that cooperation in the arms industry could
only be to the benefit of both Tehran and Ankara.
<P>However, Turkish Defense Minister Turhan Dayan, a deputy with
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller's &quot;True Path&quot; party, appeared
linearly opposed to the Islamist Premier's proposals and stated
that &quot;under the current circumstances, cooperation between the two
countries is not appropriate.&quot;

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> CITIBANK BRANCH IN ATHENS DESTROYED BY BOMB LAST NIGHT</H3>
<H4>Athens, December 19 (MPA)</H4>
A time-regulated bomb destroyed Citibank's branch in
Chalandri, a suburb in northern Athens, shortly after midnight.
<P>The explosive mechanism contained at least three kilos of
dynamite and had been placed in the bank's ATM.
<P>The powerful blast also caused extensive damages to the
surrounding parked cars and stores.
<P>Although no one has claimed responsibility for the attack,
the police suspect that the terrorist group &quot;17 November&quot; is
behind this strike.
<P>The same group has also hit the same bank on January 26,
1991, while another rebel group, the &quot;Revolutionary People's
Struggle&quot; has stricken Citibank in the past as well.

<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> GREEK AMBASSADOR HELD HOSTAGE IN PERU WAS FREED EARLY THIS
MORNING</H3>
<H4>Lima, December 19 (MPA)</H4>
Greece's Ambassador to Peru, Alkiviades Karokis is among the
five persons who were freed early this morning after being held
hostage -along with 500 others- by the Peruvian rebels who stormed
the Japanese ambassador's home in Lima on Tuesday night.
<P>Mr. Karokis and the other four ambassadors have now taken the
role of &quot;go-between&quot;, negotiating with the armed guerillas for the
freeing of the hostages.
<P>According to reports, the armed rebels are members of the
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), and are threatening to
kill the hostages unless the Peruvian government frees their
jailed comrades. Also, they demand that they embark on direct
negotiations with Peru's president and that they be provided with
medical aid for a wounded comrade of theirs.
<P>The five freed ambassadors have already met with a delegation
of Peruvian government officials. Meanwhile, the United Nations
Secretary-General has asked for the immediate release of the
hostages.
<P>The attack took place during a reception held at the Japanese
ambassador's home to honor the Japanese Emperor. The event was
attended by an array of foreign diplomats and ambassadors from
around the world.

<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> THESSALY'S FARMERS TO RALLY IN ATHENS WITH THEIR FAMILIES
TODAY</H3>
<H4>Athens, December 19 (MPA)</H4>
Thessaly's protesting farmers, considered to be the &quot;hard-
core&quot; of the country-wide mobilizations, have descended in Athens
where they will conduct a massive rally in the city's center
flanked by their family members.
<P>In turn, the protesters will march towards the Parliament,
joined by the country's disgruntled construction workers and
pensioners who themselves have organized a &quot;solidarity gathering&quot;.
<P>Despite their threats of taking countermeasures against the
country's roadblocking farmers, the Federation of International
Transportation Drivers announced last night that they will not
blockade the protesters' arrival to Athens today.
<P>In the meantime, in a move which further illustrates that the
protests that dragged on for 21 days have began to wane,
Thessaloniki's farmers blocking access to the city's road leading
to &quot;Macedonia&quot; airport and to Thermi's road that leads to the
Halkidiki peninsula have lifted their barricades.
<P>Minister of Agriculture Stephanos Tzoumakas has stated that
he is willing to receive the farmers' representatives if they also
wish to meet with him.
<P>Minister of Environment, Planning and Public Works Kostas
Laliotis stated today that &quot;we don't want the farmers to be beaten
or succumb&quot; but, instead, he added, the Government wants to see
the roads open.
<P>Meanwhile, the country's seamen continue their work stoppages
in all of the country's ports for a fourth day, paralysing
Greece's marine industry.
<P>This afternoon they marched to the Ministry of Merchant
Marine.

<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> NATIONAL ECONOMY MINISTER: INFLATION REDUCED TO 4.5% BY END
OF 1997</H3>
<H4>Athens, December 19 (MPA)</H4>
In an optimistic tone, National Economy and Finance Minister
Yiannos Papantoniou outlined the Government's economic policy for
1997 in his parliamentary address last night.
<P>Mr. Papantoniou stated that inflation will be reduced to 4.5
percent by the end of 1997 and will further drop to 3 percent by
the end of 1998.
<P>The National Economy and Finance Minister added that the
State's development rates are actually quicker than those foreseen
by the convergence program, albeit noting that there is still a
lot of ground to be covered before achieving real and nominal
convergence.
<P>Meanwhile, the debate on the state budget continues today in
the Parliament's Plenary session, set to conclude at midnight on
Saturday with an open vote.

<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> GREEK PRESIDENT TO MEET WITH EGYPTIAN COUNTERPART IN CAIRO

meet with the President of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak.
<P>The first day of President Stephanopoulos' visit will be
dedicated to Egypt's Greek community. On Friday morning he will be
in Alexandria, accompanied by Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos,
where he will visit the city's Museum of Greco-Roman Antiquities.
His next stop will be at the Greek Patriarchate and then will
visit the Kavafis Museum. Later, the President is scheduled to

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> MEETING OF PRESIDENT BERISHA WITH DP PARLIAMENTARY GROUP</H3>
TIRANA, DEC 20 (ATA) - Today the President of Albania Sali Berisha had a
working meeting with the Democratic Party parliamentary group.
<P>President Berisha stressed in the meeting the fact that the
government and the parliament have worked and are working with a special
commitment to implement the program of the Democratic Party.
<P>President Berisha appreciated the parliament for its work in the
adoption of new laws. The law under way for the electronic media and
creation of space for private mediae is a great achievement in the field of
information in Albania but also for the Albanian democracy.
<P>President Berisha stressed that although the law on justice is
considered as very good, a group of experts, among the best, in cooperation
with the Council of Europe, is preparing a better law which will be soon
sent to the parliament for approval.
<P>But, said Berisha, 1996 was the year of the wisest decisions of the
Albanians but it unfortunately has been accompanied with an increase of the
budgetary deficit. This has been because of an increase of expenses but a
result of non-realisation of the revenues because of the lack of responsibility
and the manifestations of corruption in the institutions which are directly
responsible for their realisation.
<P>&quot;I fully support and consider in full terms with the DP program the
lawmaking initiative of a group of deputies to present in the parliament a
package of provisions for the fight against crime and corruption.
<P>The aim of this package, said Berisha, is to give the deserved
response to the drug traffickers and those involved in prostitution, to
killers and those who abuse with children, fiscal evasion which threatens
to block the reforms and kills competition and the free market spirit, as
well as a number of other crimes such as illegal possession of arms,
smuggling, etc.
<P>&quot;The program of the Democratic Party and its commitments before the
Albanian electorate express clearly our solemn commitment to guarantee the
life, activity and property of the individual.
<P>&quot;I think that with this package of laws a very important step forward
is made in the realisation of this program,&quot; said Berisha. xh/E

<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> MEMBERS OF COMMISSION ON RENTING ACTIVITY OF FIRMS NOT YET DEFINED</H3>
TIRANA, DEC 21 (ATA) By Agim Baci: The parliamentary commission on
economy, budget, finance and privatization examined Friday the names
proposed by the commission to secure the transparency in the activity of
lending, which will pass for approval to a plenary session.
<P>&quot;We will soon inform you of the names which will make up this
commission&quot;, declared the chairman of the DP parliamentary commission, Ali
Spahia.
<P>The commission of economy discussed on the same day the draft-law &quot;On
the new customs evaluation&quot;, which passed for approval to the parliament,
in a plenary session.
<P>This draft-law helps Albania to be accepted as a full right member of
the World Trade Organization, because she has so far only the status of the
observer.
<P>&quot;Albania, which wants to become member of the WTO, is obliged and at
the same time interested in these methods of evaluation for the imported
goods, so that they are the same with those used by other member countries,
&quot; said Dhrima. /jz/mt/E

TIRANA, DEC 20 (ATA) - By Flora Nikolla: The 35th Song Festival which

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> ALBANIAN DEPUTY PREMIER ADDRESSES OSCE REGARDING ISSUE OF SENDING A
MISSION TO BELGRADE</H3>
TIRANA, DEC 19 (ATA) - The Albanian Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister,
Tritan Shehu, has sent a letter to the current holder of the OSCE Chairman,
Flavio Cotti, regarding the issue of sending an OSCE mission in Belgrade,
after the request of the Serbian President Miloshevic.
<P>The letter of Minister Shehu is being discussed for two days in the
Leading Council of OSCE, and its content has found understanding and
support from the participating countries in this organization, Foreign
Ministry press and information office reports.
<P>In his letter Shehu says that he had been informed of the recent leeter
correspondence between Serbian President Milishevic and U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, as well as of the letter addressed to you by
Minister Milutinovic, in your capacity as chairman in Office of OSCE,
inviting a &quot;distinguished delegation of the OSCE to visit our country and
obtain true information on all the facts&quot;.
<P>In the letter Shehu mentions the fact that the OSCE has, during the
last three years adopted a number of decisions, among other things,
requesting Belgrade to accept immediate and unconditional return of the
OSCE Long Term Mission to Kosova, Sandjack and Vojvodina, to stop
repression and human right violations, to allow the opening of the
democratic institutions, including the Parliament and the judiciary, and to
start a substantial dialogue, in a third party presence, for the solution
of the status of Kosova.
<P>&quot;The UN Security Council has also adopted Resolution 885, August 9,
1993, requesting Belgrade the immediate return of the OSCE Mission; the UN
General Assembly, the UN Sub-Commission on Human Rights has done so, and
the reply from Belgrade has been a &quot;flat &quot;NO&quot;, says the letter.
<P>&quot;Now that Miloshevic seems to be in trouble, he is requesting the OSCE
to send an &quot;eminent&quot; or a &quot;distinguished mission&quot;. What about all the
previous OSCE, UN and other organizations' requests to Belgrade? Do they
want a mission as a face-savor, as a shield or something else? Other high
profile representatives have visited Belgrade recently, and the statements
released on the occasion have cast doubts on certain demands of the
opposition, thus creating more confusion or makinf life easier for the
regime in Belgrade.
<P>Can we absolutely exclude the possibility that an OSCE mission
fielded in haste may be used in the same way?&quot; asks Shehu in his letter.
<P>&quot;This is a two-edged knife and the OSCE must be very careful about
it. It is my opinion that we have to ask Belgrade, first to implement
Resolution 855 of August 9, 1993, and all relevant OSCE decisions to that
effect. Otherwise, the credibility of OSCE is at stake,&quot; writes Shehu
further on.
<P>In the letter, Shehu expresses Albania's reserves about the sending
of a mission in Belgrade at such a speed, without analysing in details all
the possible implications that might arise therefrom.
<P>Without claiming to enter into the procedural aspects of sending
Personal Representatives of the chairman, of fact-finding and rapporteur
missions, as the only options according to the OSCE documents, Shehu
informs that &quot;we could approve of sending a mission or delegation to
Belgrade, only if its mandate of terms of reference will automatically
include unconditional return of long-term missions in Kosova, Sandjak and
Vojvodina according to Resolution 855, of August 9, 1993, and the necessary
efforts to establish a dialogue between Belgrade and Prishtine, in the
presence of a third party.
<P>According to Shehu, &quot;I am fully confident, Mr Minister, that the
Swiss Chairmanship will seriously take into consideration our concerns and
will elaborate and accommodate them in the course of its efforts to provide
the appropriate and good leadership of the OSCE. I would appreciate if you
kindly inform all the participating states of the OSCE about this letter,&quot;
writes Shehu. ssh/kei/mt/xh/

<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> 10.5 YEAR IMPRISONMENT FOR PROTAGONISTS OF ARKOND COMPANY SCANDAL</H3>
TIRANA, DEC 20 (ATA) - Prosecutor Sajmir Hysi has demanded ten and a half
years in prison for the protagonists of the scandal with 2.6 million
dollars misused through deceit and usury in the Arkond company.
<P>But according to the final saying, the main culprit is thought to be
the president of the Bushi firm, Mehmet Bushi, for whom were demanded four
years in jail for the penal act of fraud in cooperation.
<P>The prosecutor demanded 3.6 years in jail for Ferit Kastrati and 3
years for Irfan Canaj with the same charge as Bushi.
<P>According to the final saying, the defendants have deceived in
cooperation with one another a great number of citizens of Tirana, Vlora
and Fier, by accumulating millions of money and misusing them in forms of
bribing and honoraria for enigmatic Nigerian people.
<P>The prosecutor's office accused the above mentioned defendants of the
loss of 460 million leks, but the amount of money of a great number of
nationals accumulated through contracts at monthly interest rates ranging
from 8 to 15 per cent is much larger and until the day when the court will
hold its decision, the deceived people have the right to deposit their
civil indictments. kei/xh/k

TIRANA, DEC 20 (ATA)- Speaker of Albanian Parliament Pjeter Arbnori met
Friday with a group of deputies of the Kosova parliament, at their
request.

and stressed that the new situations in the region require the definition
of realistic policies in favour of the peaceful solution and positive
dialogue.

issue and expressed the conviction that the perspective would be even more
favourable than so far.
<P>The deputies of the Kosova parliament appreciated the Albanian state's
contribution in supporting of the Albanian issue. They especially valued
the contribution of Arbnori to the sensitization of the European governments
and senior officials of the Kosova issue.

diplomatic terminology regarding the Kosova issue, explaining that the
Albanians in Kosova are not a minority, they live in their own lands.
<P>They also asked that the national rights the Albanians are deprived of
and the fact that the cause of the Albanians in Kosova is not based on the
idea of a greater Albania, as speculated in some case, should be considered.

PRISHTINE, DEC 20 (ATA)-Elisabeth Rehn, special envoy of the United Nations
on Human Rights in former-Yugoslavia, told a news conference in Geneva on
Tuesday that the Kosova issue should be examined in round table talks,
according to the Kosova Centre of Information.
<P>Rehn spoke of the situation in Serbia and dwelt on the latest
demonstrations in Belgrade and the Kosova issue.
<P>She referred to the Albanian education agreement and deplored its non
application and the latest killing of an Albanian teacher by Serb
police.
<P>The Kosova issue is very significant but difficult to be resolved
without the democratisation of the whole &quot;Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&quot;,
she said.
<P>The assistant of the special envoy, referring to Rehn's statements,
mentioned Rugova's proposal for a transition period, overseen by the
International Community.

means that the parties conduct talks. p.ta/l/z/lm/Z/

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> BULGARIAN DIPLOMAT HELD HOSTAGE IN LIMA</H3>
Sofia, December 18 (BTA) - Dimiter Stanoev, Charge d'Affaires of the
Bulgarian Embassy in Lima, is among the hostages held by the Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement at Japans' Embassy, the Foreign Ministry's
Information Department said on Wednesday.
<P>The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry took urgent steps to protect the Bulgarian
official, addressing a note to the Peruvian Embassy in Sofia. The note
expresses serious concern about the fate of the hostages and appeals to the
Government of Peru &quot;to do every possible effort for protecting the life and
health of the hostages, one of which is a Bulgarian diplomat&quot;. The
Bulgarian Foreign Ministry addressed the foreign ministries of some
countries asking that their diplomats in Lima provide assistance to Mr
Stanoev and his family until the incident is settled.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> PRESIDENT ELECT LEAVES FOR ITALY</H3>
Sofia, December 18 (BTA) - &quot;I attach great importance to the visit because
it will give me the chance to seek understanding of Bulgaria's problems
among the Italian political circles,&quot; President elect Peter Stoyanov said
upon departure to Rome Wednesday. Stoyanov will take office as of late
January, 1997. He is paying the visit to Italy at the invitation of Italian
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
<P>Mr Stoyanov is scheduled to meet President Scalfaro, Prime Minister
Lamberto Dini and Foreign Minister Romao Prodi. He is also expected to be
received by Pope John Paul II and the Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal
Angelo Sodano. Stoyanov said he will invite the Pope to visit Bulgaria. &quot;I
carry a lot of presents for Pope John Paul II the most unusual being a
table-top sculpture made by several children,&quot; Peter Stoyanov stated.
Besides he will give Pope John Paul II Bulgarian historical books and five
books by the Pope published in Bulgaria.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> MILITARY COUNCIL MEETING</H3>
Sofia, December 18 (BTA) - A meeting of the Supreme Military Council
discussed on Wednesday the programme for rearmament and modernization of
the Bulgarian army until the year 2015, the Defence Ministry's press office
said. The meeting focused on the land forces, the air forces and the units
and divisions under the direct command of the General Staff as well as on
the programmes for maintainig arms and equipment in 1997-1998.
<P>The Supreme Military Council discussed also some obligations of the
Republic of Bulgaria under the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty,
particularly those concerning arms in &quot;for export&quot; category.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> PUBLIC HEALTH ACT AMENDED</H3>
Sofia, December 18 (BTA) - Parliament today passed at second reading
amendments to the Public Health Act, regulating private practice. Only
dentists and medics with experience of two years or more qualify for
private practitioners. Those of them working in a specific medical field
must be specialists. After nearly two hours of debates, the MPs postponed
passage of a provision barring private practitioners from public hospitals
and polyclinics. Opposition MPs fought against this provision.
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> TOBACCO LAW AMENDED</H3>
Sofia, December 18 (BTA) - The National Assembly adopted on second reading
amendments to the Tobacco and Tobacco Goods Act Wednesday envisaging
stricter sanctions for violations of the rules about purchasing, production
and sales of tobacco and tobacco products. Under the new amendments the
purchase of tobacco has to be licensed by the Finance Minister and the
payment should be made within 30 days.
<P>Licensing requirements for the manufacture of tobacco goods will also be
introduced in compliance with the new amendments. The fees on each license
will be set on proposal of the Finance Minister on an annual basis and
should be gazetted by March 31. Tobacco goods designed for the home market
should have an excise revenue stamp. Bans on advertising tobacco and
tobacco goods outside the production and sale units remain into effect. The
Act envisages sanctions of up to 1.5 million leva for violations of this
provision.
<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> BULGARIAN-RUSSIAN PROJECTS MAKE PROGRESS</H3>
Sofia, December 18 (BTA) - Bulgarian-Russian projects in trade, science and
technology are making good progress, said Deputy Prime Minister Doncho
Konakchiev, cochairman of the intergovernmental committee, after its
meeting on Monday.
<P>Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Lobov, co-chairman of the committee,
listed the parameters of a project for transmission of Russian gas across
Bulgaria. Lobov said 29,000 million cubic metres of gas may be supplied to
other countries under a 30-year concession with an estimated net profit of
5,800 million dollars for Bulgaria.
<P>If the project is given the green light in early 1997, the existing
transmission network will have to be expanded. Two compressor stations will
have to be built and up to 2,500 million cu m of gas will be supplied
during the year, Lobov said. Bulgaria stands to gain 100 million dollars
from this.
<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> FIFTY TURKISH COMPANIES ENTER BULGARIA</H3>
Sofia, December 18 (BTA) - Some 50 Turkish companies registered in Bulgaria
during a two-day seminar of Bulgarian and Turkish businessmen, said
Bozhidar Bozhinov, President of the Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce and
Industry. He said the Turkish delegation consisted of 51 companies.
Bulgaria was represented by 120 companies.
<P>The seminar was a success, according to Sabahiddin Gazanfer, Secretary
General of the Aegean Chambers of Commerce and Industry. He stressed
Turkish companies are strongly interested in the Bulgarian market but are
wary because they are unfamiliar with Bulgarian law.
<P>Turkey is among Bulgaria's major trading partners in the Balkans, said
Bozhinov. He stressed, however, that there is an imbalance at company level
- Bulgaria is represented by two companies in the Turkish market as against
1,600 Turkish companies in Bulgaria. The main obstacle is that Turkish law
restricts the entry of foreign businesses.
<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</A> STEFKA KOSTADINOVA NAMED 1996 TOP ATHLETE IN THE BALKANS</H3>
Sofia, December 18 (BTA) - High jump Olympic champion Bulgarian Stefka
Kostadinova was named 1996 Athlete of the Year in the Balkans in a poll of
the Sports Desk of the BTA. Participating in this 24th Athlete of the Year
poll of the BTA were Balkans news agencies and some specialized
periodicals.
<P>Votes were given for 21 athletes in 12 sports. The respondents could choose
among 15 Olympic champions which made their task difficult. And yet the
charming Stefka Kostadinova emerged the indisputable leader. Kostadinova
came ahead of the second in the list, Naim Suleimanoglu of Turkey, and the
third, Yugoslav basketballer Vlade Divac, currently playing for NBA's
Charlotte Hornets.
<H3><A NAME="09">[09]</A> FOUR BULGARIAN SCHOOLCHILDREN AMONG WORLD'S BEST YOUNG MATHEMATICIANS</H3>
Sofia, December 18 (BTA) - Four Bulgarian schoolchildren emerged among the
11 winners who scored the maximum number of points at a math competition
organized by the Australian Mathematics Society. A total of 521,000
schoolchildren from 32 countries took part in the competition, Professor
Peter Kenderov today said before the opening of a conference on &quot;Bulgaria's
Talents and Education&quot; at the National Palace of Culture. The forum is
organized by the Public Council Promoting the National Capital, Science,
Culture and Education. Rositsa Doneva, 17, of the Varna Mathematics School,
Galin Nachev, 15, and Kaloyan Karov, 15, of the Bourgas Mathematics School
and Dimiter Zhechev, 15, of Gabrovo, received the Australian Math Cross
award and Bernard Neumann diplomas.
<H3><A NAME="10">[10]</A> U.S. AMBASSADOR BOHLEN ON BULGARIAN-AMERICAN RELATIONS</H3>
Sofia, December 8 (BTA) - In her first televised interview, broadcast on
Saturday in the weekly political show Panorama, U.S. Ambassador to Bulgaria
Mrs Avis Bohlen said that the current Bulgarian-American relations are in
general very good and that there is good dialogue on a number of issues.
She said that there are certain fields where she would like to the
relations to be stronger and more active, with more intensive high-level
contacts and voiced certainty that this will happen.
<P>Asked of her opinion on the IMF's proposal for the introduction of a
currency board in Bulgaria, Mrs Bohlen said that this is a decision which
the Bulgarians must take on their own and assess if this is the best
solution for them. Given the current level of financial and banking
problems in Bulgaria, she believes that the currency board is a very
efficient mechanism for imposing financial discipline. Mrs Bohlen said that
on the other hand the IMF has moved the idea but has not taken a final
decision yet. The IMF insists on the particularization of certain
fundamental conditions, which should be fulfilled before it could proceed
with the currency board. One of these conditions, she said, is the
achievement of a political consensus in the country and the other one, the
Government's serious commitment to its application, involving a lot of
preparatory hard work so that the board can be made operating and
effective.
<H3><A NAME="11">[11]</A> UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY PASSES BULGARIAN-SPONSORED RESOLUTION</H3>
New York, December 6 (BTA)- On December 5 the UN General Assembly today
unanimously passed a resolution on special assistance to countries which
sustained losses as a result of the enforcement of Security Council
sanctions on F.R. Yugoslavia, the Foreign Ministry press office said.
<P>The resolution was moved and coordinated by the Bulgarian delegation during
the 51st Session of the General Assembly, and coauthored by all member
countries of the European Union, the US, Russia, Belarus, Cyprus, Jordan,
Kyrgyzstan, Norway, Poland, Moldova, Romania, Slovakia, Macedonia, Ukraine
and the Czech republic.
<P>Taking into accounts political developments in the area in the last year,
the resolution expresses serious concern over the continuing negative
effects of the sanctions on the economy of third countries, and stresses
the need for an adequate response by the international community, the UN
and specialized agencies and programmes, including the international
financial institutions. It calls on the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to
continue focussing special attention on the economic problems in the
affected countries after the abolition of the sanctions.
<P>The document emphasizes the need to take practical steps to cushion the
negative effect of the sanctions by supporting the countries' financial
stabilization, infrastructure development, and by promoting trade and their
participation in the postwar reconstruction of the region. It reiterates an
appeal to UN member countries to render technical, financial and other
assistance, including the discussion of steps to encourage export,
investment and the development of the private sector in the affected
countries.
<H3><A NAME="12">[12]</A> P.M. ZHAN VIDENOV: &quot;PARLIAMENT WILL RULE ON CURRENCY BOARD ALREADY
EARLY NEXT YEAR&quot;</H3>
Sofia, December 8 (BTA) - According to Prime Minister Zhan Videnov the
practical actions of the Government and of the experts in the different
fields are currently directed at achieving consensus on the currency board
issue. The problem will be moved for consideration by the National Assembly
already at the beginning of next year, Mr Videnov said in an interview for
the National Television.
<P>PM Videnov said that the Government is intensively working on the major
problems it will consider jointly with the technical missions of the IMF
expected on Monday: the 1997 budget bill, budget projections until the year
2000, the privatization programmes and the necessary legislation
amendments. The Government wants to come up with its proposals for
structural reform, for financial stabilization and economic growth already
before Christmas so that they could be put up for public discussion,
Videnov said.
<H3><A NAME="13">[13]</A> CURRENCY BOARD. UDF LEADER KOSTOV BACK FROM U.S.</H3>
Sofia, December 8 (BTA) - There are alternatives for Bulgaria to avoid the
formula &quot;currency board&quot;, like hyperinflation or a moratorium on the
foreign debt payments together with radical decisions on the part of the
international financial institutions, but these alternatives would rather
not be discussed, said leader of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces
(UDF) Ivan Kostov who returned on Sunday after one week of consultations in
the U.S. with representatives of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
the World Bank.
<P>Mr Kostov is pleased with the talks in Washington as they helped clarify
both the UDF's stands and the reasons of the IMF to suggest the
introduction of a currency board in Bulgaria. According to Mr Kostov, the
international financial circles are interested in Bulgaria and he is
pleased that despite all significant and unfavourable for the country
economic factors, the circles have not distanced themselves from Bulgaria.
<P>Mr Kostov and the UDF members accompanying him to Washington have worked
out on the basis of the consultations a draft of the opposition coalition's
attitude towards the currency board proposal. Kostov hopes that the final
stand will be formulated tomorrow after the meeting of UDF's National
Coordinating Council. The UDF leader would not unveil details about the
draft stand but said it has a special clause treating the achievement of a
national consensus on the problem of the currency board. The UDF will
coordinate the stand with their partners of the United Opposition Forces
(the UDF, Popular Union, the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and
Freedoms) and only after that will officially make it public. According to
UDF leader, a national consensus would mean dissolution of Parliament,
early elections and replacement of the Governing Board of the National Bank
of Bulgaria (BNB, the central bank). This view the UDF upheld earlier
remained in force after the consultations.
<H3><A NAME="14">[14]</A> SAFETY OF KOZLODOUI N-PLANT</H3>
Sofia, December 6 (BTA) - The results of the analyses of the metal
templates from the casing of power unit one of the Kozlodoui nuclear power
plant show that the reactor can continue to operate without additional heat
treatment, Kozlodoui n-plant director Kiril Nikolov told a news conference.
<P>In mid-September this year, experts cut three pairs of templates from the
fourth seam of the casing of the plant's oldest reactor - power unit one.
The carefully prepared operation was conducted by a remote- controlled
robot. The templates were then sent for detailed analyses to the Russian
Kurchatov Institute. The analyses, supervised by experts of the German
Siemens concern, had to determine whether the condition of the metal casing
allows the unit's safe operation. The Kozlodoui n-plant generates more than
50% of this country's electricity at the lowest prime costs.
<P>Experts of the Kozlodoui n-plant, the National Electricity Company, the
Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, the European Commission, the Kurchatov
Institute, the chief contractor Siemens and of the chief constructor
Hydropress discussed the results of the analyses. The Siemens officials and
the representatives of the Kurchatov Institute said that nuclear power
generation in Bulgaria is safe.
<P>The losses sustained from the switched off generator total USD 10 million.
Under the PHARE Programme, the EU extended ECU 10 million. Bulgaria has so
far utilized ECU 5 million of them, Nikolov said, adding that he hopes that
all losses will be compensated.
<H3><A NAME="15">[15]</A> REFERENDUM ON BULGARIA'S MEMBERSHIP IN NATO POSSIBLE</H3>
Sofia, December 10 (BTA) - Deputy Foreign Minister Irina Bokova gave an
interview to BTA before her departure for Brussels today where she will
attend the meeting of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council.
<P>Q: You said yesterday that Parliament has not used all of its ability on
the issue of Bulgaria's membership in NATO. Why do you think this to be
the case?
<P>A: If we want to reach consensus and if we want a broad public discussion
on the question of Bulgaria's membership in NATO, I think that it is
absolutely necessary and obligatory for this to happen in Parliament.
Besides, we have reached consensus on a similar question in Parliament.
This was the declaration of 1993 on Bulgaria's integration in the European
and Euro-Atlantic structures. I think we have to use the same approach in
the future as well.
<P>Q: What is your opinion about the possibility of the issue of Bulgaria's
membership in the European Union (EU) and NATO to be decided by a
referendum?
<P>A: I think this is one of the options, probably the most likely one. I do
not consider the possibility an unusual one. Bulgaria's membership in the
EU should be decided by a referendum. This country will have to ratify a
treaty which may have to require amending even the Bulgarian Constitution.
Experience shows that when they sign new amendments to the European treaty,
such as the Treaty of Maastricht, even EU member states resort to
referendums in most of the cases.
<P>This has greater importance for the issue on NATO, as the public opinion
is strongly divided on it. I think that the possibility of deciding the
question by a referendum should not be ruled out.
<P>Q: What is your comment on the various positions within the Bulgarian
Socialist Party (BSP) on Bulgaria's membership in NATO?
<P>A: [The various positions] indicate that a discussion is under way, which,
in my opinion, is a good thing. The fact that the BSP members are not
unanimous on the issue shows that [different] opinions can be heard so
that we can seek the best and most appropriate decisions. By the way,
there are many prominent political figures in the BSP who are in favour of
a neutrality. This means that we have to discuss all the pros and cons of
this country's membership in NATO, the neutrality, or the option to remain
outside the North Atlantic Organization, which is related to the overall
development of the political processes in Bulgaria.
<P>Q: At their meeting today, the foreign ministers of NATO's member states
discuss the situation in Belgrade. What is your comment on the events in
Bulgaria's Western neighbour?
<P>A: We have been following closely the events in Belgrade, which
undoubtedly are a cause for concern. I would say it once again that
Bulgaria is not interested in political instability, mostly considering
the threat of the introduction of sanctions, which we consider very
alarming indeed.
<P>We are aware what economic losses this country sustained as a result of
the U.N. sanctions against former Yugoslavia over the past few years, and
how much we can suffer now when Bulgaria has to resolve serious economic
problems. Such a development will be very unfavourable to Bulgaria indeed.

Sofia, December 10 (BTA) - Bulgaria's President elect Peter Stoyanov, who
will take office in late January 1996, has sent a letter of
congratulations to Ms Madeleine K. Albright on her appointment as US
Secretary of State.
<P>&quot;I am glad that at a time of fundamental changes in the modern world it is
precisely you that are becoming chief American diplomat,&quot; the letter
reads. &quot;Your profound commitment to the principles of democracy and market
economy, as well as your understanding of the present-day problems in the
former communist countries make me see in your person not only a proponent
of the virtues of the American nation but also a friend of my country
Bulgaria,&quot; Mr Stoyanov
<H3><A NAME="17">[17]</A> PRESIDENT VETOES AMENDMENTS TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT ACT</H3>
Sofia, December 11 (BTA) - President Zhelyu Zhelev Wednesday imposed a
suspensory veto on the amendments to the Business of Foreign Persons and
Foreign Investment Protection Act, which Parliament passed on November 28,
1996.
<P>Dr Zhelev argues that some of the revisions of the law are inconsistent
with the State's interest in attracting foreign investment. &quot;They do not
create a better investment climate but, worse yet, abolish some of the
effective privileges and imposes fresh restrictions on foreign investments,
&quot; the President's reasoning reads.
<P>Dr Zhelev challenges an amendment which makes the provisions of the Act
wholly or partially inapplicable to investments made by foreign persons
whose countries of origin extend discriminatory treatment to Bulgarian
partnerships or citizens.The President also disagrees with an amendment,
according to which &quot;no partnership wherein a foreign person holds any
interest may acquire a right of ownership to agricultural land.&quot; According
to Dr Zhelev, the worst restriction which the amended version of the law
imposes on foreign investments is the minimum value of 50,000 US dollars or
the equivalent in Bulgarian leva or any other foreign currency of which a
foreign investment must be to qualify for treatment as foreign investment
for the purposes of the Act. The effective law did not set any such
threshold. &quot;This practically denies protection to all small investors which
now form the bulk of foreign investors in Bulgaria,&quot; the President argues.
Wrapping up his reasoning, Dr Zhelev expresses the hope that Parliament
will realize the pressing need of creating favourable conditions for
attraction of foreign investments to Bulgaria and will bring the texts of
the law in conformity with its title: Encouragement and Protection of
Foreign Investments Act.
<H3><A NAME="18">[18]</A> POPULATION DECREASE IN BULGARIA IN 1995</H3>
Sofia, December 11 (BTA) - There has been a negative rate in Bulgaria since
1990; in 1995 the rate was -5 per 1,000 population, Director of the
Institute of Demography with the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences Emil Hristov
told reporters here today.
<P>From 14.5 per 1,000 population in 1980, the birth rate fell to 8.6 per 1,
000 population in 1995. In that time, the death rate increased from 11.1 to
13.6 per 1,000 population. The mortality rate is higher among people of
rural areas and among male adults. The number of Bulgarians getting married
decreased from 7.9 per 1,000 population in 1980 to 4.4 per 1,000 population
in 1995. In the 1990-95 period a total of 366,000 Bulgarians emigrated
abroad.
<H3><A NAME="19">[19]</A> OPPOSITION BINDS INTRODUCTION OF CURRENCY BOARD IN BULGARIA WITH EARLY
PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS</H3>
Sofia, December 11 (Iva Toncheva of BTA) - The opposition political forces
in Bulgaria today stated that they bind the introduction of a currency
board in Bulgaria with the holding of early general elections, a year and a
half before the end of the term of the incumbent Parliament.
<P>&quot;A necessary condition for the success of the currency board in Bulgaria is
for the parliamentary forces to officially declare their agreement to
dissolve Parliament immediately after the implementation of the measures
for the board's introduction,&quot; the united opposition said after a meeting
of its leaders today. Consultations with the Left, which has a
parliamentary majority, are expected to start soon. A special working group
will determine the mechanism for holding the consultations.
<P>The largest opposition formation, the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF),
stated yesterday that the International Monetary Fund-proposed currency
board will not be a successful undertaking under the incumbent Cabinet. The
other two parliamentary opposition formations, the Popular Union and the
ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms, today agreed with UDF's
position. &quot;It is impossible for the gravediggers to be doctors,&quot; Popular
Union Co-Chairman Stefan Savov said after the meeting of the opposition's
leaders.
<P>The opposition pledges for the appointment of a new governing board of the
National Bank of Bulgaria (BNB, the central bank), one that will act as a
currency board until the latter is introduced.
<H3><A NAME="20">[20]</A> BULGARIA SHOULD JOIN EU AND NATO, PRESIDENT-ELECT STOYANOV SAYS</H3>
Sofia, December 12 (BTA) - Bulgaria should claim for a befitting place in
the family of the nations in the world and my national ideal is an
economically strong and politically independent country, president-elect
Peter Stoyanov said on Thursday evening at a meeting with students and
lecturers of the St Kliment Ohridski University of Sofia.
<P>In his lecture Mr Stoyanov advanced the thesis about Bulgaria's association
with the EU and NATO as a means of its survival and overcoming the crisis.
We cannot overcome the crisis on our own, and even if we can, it will be
stupid not to use foreign assistance, he said.
<H3><A NAME="21">[21]</A> DEFENCE MINISTRY, GENERAL STAFF WRESTLE WITH LOGISTIC DIFFICULTIES</H3>
Sofia, December 13 (BTA) - &quot;Bulgarian soldiers do not starve and freeze,&quot;
Lieutenant General Lyuben Pehlivanov, Deputy Chief of General Staff of the
Bulgarian Army for Logistical and Medical Support, told a news briefing at
the Defence Ministry Thursday. At some places some provisions are scarce
for lack of money and a backlog of debts to supplier companies, and the
quality of food has indeed deteriorated, he admitted.
<H3><A NAME="22">[22]</A> 1996 BUDGET UPDATED AGAIN</H3>
Sofia, December 12 (BTA) - Parliament today passed at second reading a new
update of the 1996 budget to increase budget expenditures and the deficit.
<P>The 438,932.6 million leva expenditures are increased to 654,238 million.
The budget deficit is increased by 125,200 million to fetch 206,000 million
leva. The initial version of the budget set the deficit at 7.4% of the GDP.
<P>The budget update was prompted by the sizable interest payments from the
public purse as a result of the financial instability in the country over
the recent months, the skyrocketing exchange rate and high interest rates
in the second half of 1996. The bulk of the increased budget deficit will
be financed with a 115,000 million leva credit from the central bank.
<H3><A NAME="23">[23]</A> SUPREME COURTS REPEALS COUNCIL OF MINISTER'S REFUSAL TO REGISTER
ALTERNATIVE SYNOD OF ORTHODOX CHURCH</H3>
Sofia, December 13 (BTA) - The Supreme Court returned today to the Council
of Ministers the requested for registration of an alternative synod of the
Orthodox Church, headed by former Metropolitan Pimen of Nevrokop. The
reasoning of the Council of Ministers (that the Bulgarian Patriarchate
headed by Pimen is legally non-existent) is estimated as unjustified. In
its ruling the Supreme Court does not respond to the request of Father
Pimen's lawyers for his registration as Patriarch.
<H3><A NAME="24">[24]</A> INTERIOR MINISTER REPORTS ON PERFORMANCE</H3>
Sofia, December 13 (BTA) - At a news conference on Friday Interior
Minister Nikolai Dobrev analysed the performance of the Ministry during
the two years since the government of the Left came into power. &quot;A key
priority of the Interior Ministry since I took office as its head, has
been bringing the crime-control, the information and management policy in
line with the nature and the dynamics of the crime situation, with the
requirements of the time and the expectations of the citizens,&quot; Minister
Dobrev said. Minister Dobrev took office on May 10, 1996.
<P>Among the other main priorities of the Ministry are the combat against
economic crime, street crime in the cities and ensuring the safety and
security of the citizens. Another important task, according to Minister
Dobrev, is the combat against corruption within the Ministry's officers,
in the state apparatus and in the bodies of local self- government.
<P>Stabilization and a tendency of decreasing the crime rates has been
observed, Minister Dobrev said. Despite the quantitative reductions in the
number of crimes, they are becoming more brutal, organized and aggressive,
Minister Dobrev said.
<P>One of the major problems the Ministry faces is that it has a
comparatively large number of young and inexperienced employees, he said.
Other problems involve the lack of system for training, low payments and
unfair public assessment, Minister Dobrev added. The managements of certain
structures within the Interior Ministry are incompetent, Dobrev stated.
<P>Although not widely spread, cases of disclosure of classified information
and corruption in the Ministry are not isolated, Dobrev said. Every time a
police raid is planned there is a leak of a part or sometimes even of the
whole information, the Minister stated adding the blame lies with the
Ministry's leadership and himself. Minister Dobrev said he will tender his
resignation in case violations by Interior Ministry officials are
detected.
<H3><A NAME="25">[25]</A> OCTOPUS CONFERENCE ENDS</H3>
Sofia, December 14 (BTA) - The three-day Multilateral Conference on
Corruption and Organised Crime Control in States in Transition (Octopus)
ended here on Saturday with the adoption of final documents with
recommendations and proposals for measures in combating organized crime.
The Conference was organized by the Commission of the European Communities
and the Council of Europe.
<P>Behind closed doors, delegations of 16 countries and experts of the
Council of Europe discussed various aspects of corruption and organized
crime and the threats they pose.
<P>Bulgaria has undertaken a number of steps in this field over the past one
or two years, according to Prof. Ernesto Savona, Council of Europe expert
and member of the research group on transnational crime. He warned that
Bulgaria, which lies on one of the many drugs trafficking routes may soon
become a drugs consumer.

Bulgarian MPs left for Jerusalem where their five-day working visit began.
Today the Bulgarian delegation met Israeli President Ezer Weizmann. During
their almost 40-minute conference Sendov and his host informed each other
of the situation in their countries and discussed topical international
issues.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL DISCUSSES BULGARIAN- MACEDONIAN RELATIONS</H3>
Sofia, December 17 (BTA) - The Consultative Council on National Security
with the President discussed the situation in Southeastern Europe on
Tuesday, said Presidential Spokesman Valentin Stoyanov. Bulgarian-
Macedonian relations were in the focus of attention, he said.
<P>The Foreign Ministry should continue seeking ways to break the impasse in
bilateral relations through diplomatic channels with a view to signing a
cooperation agreement, the Council said.
<P>The Foreign Ministry will continue its talks with Macedonia, First Deputy
Foreign Minister Irina Bokova said after the meeting. She said the language
dispute is not the main obstacle to signing a bilateral agreement.
<P>The Council also discussed Bulgaria's possible participation in the NATO-
led multinational force implementing the peace accord on Bosnia.
<P>Bulgaria was the first country in the world to recognize the sovereignty of
the former Yugoslav republic in January 1992. Then foreign minister Stoyan
Ganev stressed at the time that Bulgaria does not recognize a Macedonian
nation.
<P>Nearly five years and several diplomatic missions later, the two countries
have not signed yet a cooperation agreement and a declaration on the
principles of bilateral relations.
<P>The creation of the legal framework has stumbled over Macedonia's condition
that a clause should expressly state that bilateral treaties are signed in
Bulgarian and Macedonian, Prime Minister Zhan Videnov told Parliament in
May. He emphasized that the theory of a Macedonian language being an
attribute of &quot;the so- called Macedonian nation and Macedonian minority&quot; is
unacceptable to Bulgaria. He recalled that Bulgaria had proposed many
compromise solutions but Macedonia's position was not flexible enough,
according to him. &quot;We still hope this reasonable, balanced approach will
meet with understanding and support in the interests of bilateral
relations,&quot; Videnov said.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> PRESIDENT ELECT STOYANOV, DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER BOKOVA MEET</H3>
Sofia, December 17 (BTA) - Bulgarian President elect Peter Stoyanov and
First Deputy Foreign Minister Irina Bokova met today to discuss the
cooperation among the Head of State, the Foreign Ministry and Bulgarian
diplomats.
<P>The most important thing we discussed was the need for reaching a consensus
on a single foreign policy both among politicians and among institutions in
Bulgaria, Bokova said after the meeting adding the two agreed that it
matches Bulgaria's national interests.
<P>She also said Bulgarian-Macedonian relations and the events in Serbia were
not discussed at the meeting. The question about NATO, though, was brought
forth by Peter Stoyanov, said Irina Yordanova of Stoyanov's press office.
Ms Bokova reportedly proposed that Peter Stoyanov be informed on the issues
brought to the attention of the Foreign Ministry by the Bulgarian-based
Embassies.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> BULGARIAN PARLIAMENTARIANS PAY TRIBUTE TO HOLOCAUST VICTIMS</H3>
Tel Aviv, December 17 (BTA) - On the third day of their visit to Israel,
the Bulgarian parliamentarians, led by National Assembly Chairman Blagovest
Sendov, laid a wreath at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial. The members of
the delegation, which includes representatives of all parliamentary groups,
paid tribute to the 6 million Jew victims.
<P>The Bulgarian parliamentarians passed along the Avenue of the Righteous
which leads to the Memorial. Thirteen trees have been planted along the
Avenue of the Righteous to pay tribute to the 13 Bulgarian who saved Jews.
This is however only part of the gratitude expressed to Bulgaria and the
Bulgarian people on the part of the Israeli hosts for the rescue of
Bulgarian Jews during World War Two.
<P>The Bulgarian MPs also laid wreaths at the grave of former Israeli prime
minister Yitzhak Rabin.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> CABINET DISCUSSES 1997 BUDGET BILL AT EXTRAORDINARY SITTING</H3>
Sofia, December 17 (BTA) - The macroeconomic framework of the draft budget
for 1997 was high on the agenda of an extraordinary Cabinet sitting held
late Monday night. Budget parameters with a currency board were discussed
but a final version of the budget bill was not approved.
<P>The Government set up a working group which will go on working on the 1997
budget bill, Industry Minister Lyubomir Dachev said after the sitting. The
working group should specify the budget allocations for education, culture,
healthcare, the army and the police within several days.
<P>A 40 percent inflation and an exchange rate of 400 leva for US dollar 1 are
set in the budget bill, Environment Minister Georgi Georgiev said Monday
evening before the sitting. However, Minister of Agriculture and Food-
Processing Krustyu Trendafilov said the budget target for the exchange rate
is 320 leva for one US dollar.
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> PRIVATIZATION REVENUE FIGURES</H3>
Sofia, December 17 (BTA) - Deputy Prime Minister Roumen Gechev, who is also
Minister of Economic Development, accounted for the 1996 privatization
revenues at an extraordinary Cabinet meeting on Monday evening, the Council
of Ministers said. The Privatization Agency, individual ministries and
committees made 444 deals between January 1 and December 13, Gechev said.
Of them 312 deals (70%) were closed for whole enterprises.
<P>Payments to the amount of 37,854 million leva were agreed, of which 23,339
million in cash and 14,515 million leva in bonds.
<P>By December 13 the Finance Ministry had received 14,564 million leva in
cash, 5,138 million leva in ZUNK bonds and 838 million leva in Brady bonds
from deals closed by the Privatization Agency.
<P>Sell-offs by ministries fetched 2,892 million leva.
<P>The Cabinet gave the go-ahead for cash privatization of up to 55% of two
pharmaceutical companies: Pharmacia in Doupnitsa (Western Bulgaria) and
Troyapharm in Troyan (Central Bulgaria). Pharmachim, the state-owned
holding company, will retain a 25% stake in each subsidiary with a view to
keeping the trademark.
<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> RUSSIA AWAITS BULGARIA'S DECISION ON BUILDING GAS PIPELINE</H3>
Sofia, December 17 (BTA) - The speeding up of the project for building a
gas pipeline for transiting Russian natural gas through Bulgaria and
cooperation in power engineering topped the agenda of the meeting between
Prime Minister Zhan Videnov and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Lobov.
Lobov arrived here on Tuesday on a brief working visit as head of a
government delegation. The visit is within the framework of the
preparations for the seventh session of the Bulgarian-Russian
Intergovernmental Commission on Economic, Scientific and Technological
Cooperation scheduled to be held at the beginning of 1997 in Sofia.
<P>Both sides to the talks agreed that it is necessary to make a final
decision on the gas pipeline project as soon as possible. The project for
transiting Russian gas through Bulgaria would bring net revenues totalling
USD 6,000 million from participation in the joint venture for the 30-year
period of the concession, Oleg Lobov said after the meeting. There are few
projects in the world bringing such revenues, Lobov believes. Bulgaria may
also start exporting electricity to its neighbours, Lobov said. The
transiting of gas and electricity generation are two major projects by
which Bulgaria may improve its balance of payments with other states,
Russia's deputy prime minister said.
<P>At a plenary session of the intergovernmental commission it was decided to
set up joint ventures for the production of spare parts for agriculture,
the government press office said.
<P>The deadline for signing an agreement between the Bulgarian and Russian
foreign trade banks - Bulbank and Vneshekonombank, was set at January 15,
1997. The lack of such an agreement is the main obstacle to implementing
the agreements of 1995 on the repayment of Russia's 100 million
transferrable rubles debt to Bulgaria.
<P>Bulgaria asked Russia for customs preferences already in 1995 during the
visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to this country but the
problem has not been settled so far. While Russia levies an average 30%
customs duty on Bulgarian imports, Russian goods are imported with a 5- 10%
customs duty.
<P>In 1994 Bulgaria's deficit in its trade with Russia amounted to USD 629.280
million and in 1995 to around USD 833 million.
<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> RUSSIA INTERESTED IN BALKANCAR HOLDING PRIVATIZATION</H3>
Sofia, December 17 (BTA) - Prime Minister Zhan Videnov met on Tuesday with
Viktor Glukhikh, President of the International Congress of Industrialists
and Entrepreneurs, and representatives of Russia's Elit economic group.
The Russian officials registered an interest in setting up a joint venture
with industrial truck maker Balkancar, which is slated for privatization.
<P>Balkancar Holding, established in 1965, makes electric and engine-driven
cars and has 18 subsidiaries. The company holds stakes in more than 20
overseas companies.
<P>The setting up of the joint venture will be accompanied by technology and
know-how transfer, Glukhikh told the press. &quot;If we have a stake in
Balkancar, its name will not be changed and production will not be
relocated - on the contrary, we will develop it here, in Bulgaria,&quot; said
Glukhikh.
<P>The sides discussed opportunities for Russian investment in joint ventures
in the oil and food industries.
<P>Even before the start of political and economic reform in 1989 Balkancar
had secured a foothold in the former Soviet Union and the whole eastern
bloc, as well as in Germany, Algeria, Venezuela, the UK and Japan. In the
last five years the company has exported industrial trucks to CIS, the
Baltic republics and many other countries.
<P>Since 1989 Balkancar Holding has had financial difficulties. It has not
received state subsidies for four years and its debt has mounted to 271,
664 million leva.
<P>The buyer must assume the company's debt and pay Bulgarian banks 29 million
dollars and 6,000 million leva, as well as 1,262 million leva to the budget
and the social security fund.
<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</A> IN BRIEF</H3>
Sofia, December 17 (BTA) - Bulgarian Industry Minister Lyubomir Dachev and
Turkish Minister of Industry and Trade Yalim Erez discussed opportunities
for Turkish investment in Bulgaria. The Turkish minister is visiting here
to attend a two-day Bulgarian- Turkish business meeting. Turkish
businessmen showed interest in enterprises subject to privatization.
<P>Romania's concept on border crossings provides for the construction of two
new bridges across the Danube. It was set forth by Romanian Deputy
Transport Minister Petrika Diakonu at a meeting with his Bulgarian
counterpart Luchezar Lalov and Deputy Construction Minister Nikola
Grigorov. The two sides also discussed an agreement on building border
crossings expected to be signed in 1997.
<P>Two aircraft carrying 9 tonnes of Polish Red Cross humanitarian aid landed
at Sofia Airport. The aid includes flour, pasta and other durable foods to
help socially disadvantaged through the winter.
<P>The leaders of the two major trade union amalgamations in Bulgaria:
Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (CITUB) leader

The Security Council has expressed grave concern at the resumption of
fighting in Mogadishu, Somalia, where the latest clashes were taking an
increasingly heavy toll in human lives.
<P>In a Presidential statement Friday, the Council President, Ambassador
Francesco Paolo Fulci of Italy said the Council was deeply concerned, in
particular, at the plight of the civilian population, whose suffering was
increased even further by the fighting.
<P>He said the Council fully supported the efforts of the countries of the
region as well as of international and regional organisations to facilitate
a political settlement of the crisis in Somalia. &quot;It appeals to all Somali
factions to join in such efforts and to start a process of national
reconciliation aimed at the establishment of a broad-based national
Government,&quot; the Council President said.
<P>Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has called for the
immediate cessation of hostilities in Somalia, the Secretary- General's
Spokesman told UN correspondents. &quot;The Secretary-General has been following
with deep concern the renewed fighting in Mogadishu, Somalia which since
last week has claimed the lives of over 100 people,&quot; the Spokesman
said.
<P>The Spokesman said that the Secretary-General urged the Somali leaders to
demonstrate political wisdom and patriotism and to desist from all action
which served to undermine the positive contributions to peacemaking coming
from within that region.
<HR ALIGN=center WIDTH=50%>
The Security Council has said that it was deeply concerned that inspite of
its previous requests there had been little progress on the issue of the
return of the Croatian Serb refugees.
<P>In a Presidential statement Friday, the Council President Ambassador
Francesco Paolo Fulci of Italy said the Council urged the Government of
Croatia to adopt a comprehensive approach in order to facilitate the return
of refugees originating from Croatia to their homes of origin throughout
Croatia.
<P>He said the Council deplored the continued failure by the Government of
Croatia to safeguard effectively the property rights of returning refugees.
It equally deplored the situation where many of those Serbs who have
returned to the former sectors have been unable to regain possession of
their properties.
<P>&quot;The Security Council is deeply concerned at reports that the new amnesty
law was not being implemented in a fair and equitable manner. It underlines
that equitable application of that law was vital for building confidence
and promoting reconciliation in Croatia as well as for the peaceful
reintegration of the Region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western
Sirmium,&quot; the Council President said.
<P>Ambassador Fulci said the Council called upon the Government of Croatia to
intensify its efforts to improve the security situation and to ensure
adequate security conditions for the local Serb population including the
urgent re-establishment of a functioning court system in the former sectors
North and South.
<HR ALIGN=center WIDTH=50%>
The Angolan Government and the Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) have agreed on a new timetable to complete the remaining military
and political tasks, the Secretary-General's Spokesman, Sylvana Foa
said.
<P>The Spokesman said that under the new timetable, the Angolan Government of
Unity and National Reconciliation would be formed on 23 January 1997 and
would assume its functions on 25 January 1997.
<HR ALIGN=center WIDTH=50%>
A vehicle convoy travelling between the town of Garm and Dushanbe in
Tajikistan has been taken hostage by an armed group, the Secretary-
General's Spokesman Sylvana Foa said today. Among the twenty-three people
taken hostage are seven United Nations military observers, the Spokesman
said.
<P>According to the Spokesman, the Commander of the armed group had demanded
the release by the United Tajik Opposition (UTO) of several people as well
as the formation of a protected quarter from the Afghan- Tajik border to
his present location to ensure that his group of rebels currently in
Afghanistan can join them.
<P>She said the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) had
been in urgent contact with the Government of Tajikistan and the UTO
leadership to resolve the crisis.

UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has expressed shock at the
attack on the residence of the Ambassador of Japan in Lima, Peru, the
Secretary-General's Spokesman, Sylvana Foa said today.
<P>&quot;He condemns this violation of international law and calls for the swift
and safe release of all of those being held,&quot; the Spokesman said. She said
several United Nations staff are among those being held.
<HR ALIGN=center WIDTH=50%>
The United Nations Secretary-General-designate Mr. Kofi Annan has said that
it was &quot;not in the interest of the United States not to pay its contribution
to the United Nations&quot;.
<P>Addressing UN correspondents Wednesday, the Secretary-General- designate
said the Organisation could not operate effectively and efficiently without
a sound financial basis. &quot;I am confident that the United States will do all
that it can. We, on our side, also have to do what is expected of us. And
by this I mean ongoing reforms and the search for excellence is an ongoing
process,&quot; he said.
<P>Mr. Annan told correspondents that Member States should begin to discuss
what the United Nations should be doing. &quot;I would hope to be able to engage
the Member States in that debate, and once we have been able to set our
objectives, we can then re-focus and re-orient the efforts of the
Organisation towards those objectives,&quot; he said.
<P>On the issue of Security Council reform, Mr. Annan said the Council, as it
existed today, by and large reflected the political and economic realities
of 1945 and that it had to be brought into line with the realities of
today.
<HR ALIGN=center WIDTH=50%>
The Security Council has given a positive response to the Secretary-
General concerning his proposal to send an assessment mission to Sierra
Leone, the Secretary-General's Spokesman, Sylvana Foa said today.
<P>The assessment mission, to be headed by the Deputy Force Commander of the
UN Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), would develop recommendations
on ways the United Nations can assist the peace process in that country,
she said. The mission would include seven military and civilian staff
members, expected to arrive in Sierra Leone later this month.
<P>The Spokesman said that both the President of Sierra Leone and the
opposition leader had requested the Secretary-General to send neutral
international observers to assist in the implementation of the peace
accord.
<HR ALIGN=center WIDTH=50%>
The General Assembly has called upon the Security Council to provide
information to the Assembly regarding Council consultations held prior to
action or deliberation by the Council, by adopting a resolution on the
Council's annual report to the Assembly.
<P>In taking that action, the Assembly requested the Council to highlight in
its report to what extent Assembly resolutions were taken into account by
the Council.
<P>Following the vote, several representatives, speaking in explanation of
position, objected to the way the resolution addressed only some aspects of
Security Council reform, while Assembly working groups were attempting to
craft a comprehensive reform package.
<P>In another action, the Assembly welcomed the signing in April of the
political charter between the Government and many factions of the rebel
movement in the Sudan. By a vote of 103 in favour to 34 against, with 15
abstentions, the Assembly adopted a resolution encouraging the remaining
factions to join the peace process so as to establish durable peace and
stability in the country and to facilitate relief efforts.
<HR ALIGN=center WIDTH=50%>
The General Assembly has taken action to facilitate the establishment of an
International Criminal Court. The Assembly set the dates for forthcoming
meetings of the Preparatory Committee of the proposed International
Criminal Court. The Preparatory Committee would aim at completing a draft
convention for submission to a diplomatic conference of plenipotentiaries
to be held in 1998, to finalise and adopt the convention.
<P>In another action, the Assembly strongly condemned all acts of international
terrorism. It called on all States to adopt a wide range of specified
measures to prevent terrorism and to strengthen international cooperation
against it. The Assembly also established an ad hoc committee to elaborate
an international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and
acts of nuclear terrorism.
<HR ALIGN=center WIDTH=50%>
The United Nations Centre for Regional Development commemorated its twenty-
fifth anniversary from 12 to 13 December in Nagoya, Japan. The two day
event included the Twenty-fifth Anniversary Symposium and the Anniversary
Lecture.
<P>The United Nations Centre for Regional Development, located in Nagoya City,
was established under the agreement between the United Nations and the
Government of Japan in 1971 as a trust fund project executed by the UN
Department of Development Support and Management Services Department
(DDSMS).
<P>One of its primary objectives was to promote sub-national regional
development in developing countries through research and training, as well
as advisory service to concerned governments and organisations.
<HR ALIGN=center WIDTH=50%>
The Legal Commission of UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation's
(UNESCO) International Bioethics Committee (IBC) Tuesday approved a draft
of the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights, which
proclaims the set of some 100,000 genes that determine heredity to be a
common heritage of humanity.
<P>Meeting at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris for its eighth session, the 20-
member commission revised the draft declaration in view of observations and
suggestions made about the text during the fourth session of the IBC held
last October.
<P>The draft declaration proclaimed that the principles it set forth were
based on recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and
inalienable rights of all members of the human family, reflecting the
Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
<P>Its seven chapters cover areas such as research in the human genome, rights
of persons concerned, conditions for the exercise of scientific activity
and the duty of states to show solidarity toward individuals, families and
population groups particularly vulnerable to genetic diseases.

Chiara Lubich, founder and President of the Focolare Movement, was awarded
the 1996 UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO)
Prize for Peace Education, Tuesday, during a ceremony at UNESCO Headquarters
in Paris.
<P>Francine Fournier, UNESCO Assistant Director-General for Social and Human
Sciences, presented Ms. Lubich with a statuette by the Catalan sculptor
Fenosa and a cheque for US$25,000 in recognition of her work in favour of
peace education, of reconciliation and confidence among human beings on all
continents and of all religious, spiritual or philosophical traditions.
<P>The Focolare Movement is present in 180 countries with some 200,000 active
members and two million followers. &quot;This movement which contributes to
peace and mutual understanding, builds bridges among persons, generations,
social classes and peoples,&quot; the UNESCO Assistant Director-General
said.

PRESENTED BY STUDENTS FROM NIS</H3>
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has referred to Serbian Government the
documents presented to him on Tuesday by a delegation of Nis University
students.
<P>The President asked the Government that the Ministry of justice carefully
examine the presented documents and draw up a detailed report which must be
made public in full.
<H5>Yugoslav Daily Survey, 1996-12-18 ; Tanjug, 1996-12-17</H5>
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> AGREEMENT ON SOCIAL INSURANCE BETWEEN FRY AND CROATIA</H3>
Delegations of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) and of the Republic
of Croatia (RC) have agreed, in accordance with the normalization of
relations between the two countries, to urgently make preparations for the
conclusion of an overall international agreement in the field of social
insurance.
<P>Journalists learnt this on Tuesday from the Yugoslav Minister of labour,
health and social policy Maksic Korac, who headed the delegation of the FRY
at talks with the delegation of RC in Zagreb on December 10-12.
<P>Korac said that the Yugoslav side suggested at the talks the conclusion of
a bilateral agreement, covering old age and disability benefits, health
care, unemployment benefits, and mutual health care services for the
insured of both sides, and based on the latest European standards.
<P>The delegations of the FRY and RC have reached an agreement that
international agreements on social insurance concluded by the former
Yugoslavia be applied to all insurers, regardless of their current status.
<P>Korac said that the positions of the Yugoslav delegation were fully
acknowledged in Zagreb, as contained in the platform determined by the
Federal Government, based on European standards in the field, past
experience in negotiations with European countries, as well as with the
national legislature.
<P>The Yugoslav side will do everything within its competency for the
agreement with Croatia to be signed within six months, Korac said.

<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> DEADLINE EXTENDED FOR NORMALIZING RELATIONS WITH IMF</H3>
Yugoslav Minister of finance Tomica Raicevic told Tanjug on Tuesday
referring to the extension of the deadline for the normalization of
relations with the International Monetary Fund that the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia had succeeded in coordinating with IMF the most important legal
documents on the normalization of relations and the modalities for meeting
financial obligations.
<P>As very little time had remained for resolving these issues, the IMF Board
of Directors has decided to extend until next June 14 the deadline for the
normalization of relations and Yugoslavia's reintegration in the IMF and
other international financial institutions, Raicevic said.
<P>Anti-Yugoslav sanctions have been lifted. Keeping this in mind, Yugoslavia
is trying to give a clear message to IMF, Raicevic said, and added that
there were no political or economic obstacles that would prevent Yugoslavia
from fulfilling all its obligations in accordance with the IMF statute.
<P>Yugoslavia has pointed to joint interests regarding cooperation and mutual
benefits that would result from normalizing relations, Raicevic said,
adding that Yugoslavia was maintaining regular working contacts with
relevant departments of the IMF and other international financial
institutions.
<P>Through regular contacts and open dialogue, Yugoslavia hopes to overcome
the problems which have emerged in its relations with IMF, Raicevic said.

<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> SERBIAN PRESIDENT RECEIVES REPRESENTATIVES OF NIS UNIVERSITY
STUDENTS</H3>
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic received on Tuesday a delegation of 17
students from the University of Nis, southern Serbia, at their own request.
<P>Although all 17 students had been invited to take part in talks with
Milosevic, the delegation chose Predrag Cveticanin, a teaching assistant at
the Nis University School of philosophy, Nikola Bozinovic, a fourth-year
student at the School of electrical engineering and Dejan Milovic, a fifth-
year student at the School of civil engineering, to represent them in the
talks.
<P>The three students stressed that they did not belong to any party and that
they were taking part in the talks as citizens. The views they expressed
however were very much the same as those taken by the opposition coalition
'Zajedno'.
<P>Addressing the students, President Milosevic said, 'you have told me that
you have come here on foot and I was worried when I heard that you had set
on this journey on foot, but they told me later that you had used some kind
of transportation after all.'
<P>The three students said that it had been announced at the very start that
three groups, each group made up of three students, would walk, while
others would be transported, explaining that groups of students had in turn
walked all the way from Nis.
<P>They said they had covered the distance (about 230 km long) in only 47
hours. They said they had managed to do so because people in Nis had been
trying to say the truth over the past 30 days, adding however that the
truth was not easily reached. 'That is why we have tried to draw attention
in this way,' they said.
<P>Expressing hope that President Milosevic had already received a letter by
students of the Nis University, they read out the letter once again. The
students said in their letter that they hoped there would never again be
civil war in Serbia, saying they were determined not to allow that the
country they lived in be ruled by a dictator. 'We kindly ask you to start
acting again in keeping with the law that will protect you once you are an
ordinary citizen again from the self-will on the part of others,' the
students said.
<P>The students also said they would present the President with photocopies of
records from 17 polling precincts in Nis where the City Electoral
Commission had announced that Serbia's ruling Socialist Party (SPS) had won
the local polls despite the victory by the coalition 'Zajedno'.
<P>After that, the three students presented Milosevic with the photocopies in
question, explaining that the photocopies of 17 records had been brought by
17 students.
<P>Milosevic said, 'I think that no one who has entered this building to ask
that something be established or to find the truth could complain that the
truth was not found.'
<P>'Neither I nor you count the votes,' he said, adding that he would entrust
the Government with the task of seeing to it that the Ministry of justice
carefully reviews all facts referred to in the documents and photocopies he
had been presented with.
<P>He said there was no danger of the truth remaining hidden, adding that, 'we
all live in this country where it is very hard to hide the truth even if
one wants to do so.'
<P>'No one here wants the truth to be hidden. On the contrary, I believe that,
as regards the functioning of the state, all its bodies consider it vital
that the Constitution and Laws be respected, and these state bodies act in
keeping with the Constitution and Laws,' he said.
<P>'It is quite certain that we shall check the veracity of data and facts
concerning your requests. You can be sure of it,' he said.
<P>'I would like to tell you that my view is that it is in the interest of all
citizens of Serbia that every job be done, not only this concerning the
elections which is very important, should be dealt with by the institutions
of the Republic,' he said.
<P>You must therefore understand that, no matter how often your leaders appeal
to embassies or dispatch envoys or visit capitals throughout the world,
Serbia will not be ruled by a foreigner, he stressed.
<P>'We are our own masters in Serbia and must solve all issues within our
institutions,' he said.
<P>'Naturally, this does not mean that we do not want to cooperate with other
countries,' he said, adding that Serbia was very interested in cooperation
with other countries.
<P>We want to build our policy that will be based on open cooperation with all
other countries, all countries in and outside Europe, and that will be
based on the footing of equality, he said. Consequently, we believe that
our country can be a good partner but that it should not be anyone's
servant or bent its head, he said.
<P>'I therefore believe that it is in the interest of every citizen of Serbia
that its constitutional institutions be affirmed and that all issues be
solved within its constitutional institutions,' Milosevic said.
<P>Mistakes are always possible. The issue is whether they will be established
and whether there is good will to establish mistakes if there are any, he
said.
<P>As regards your remarks, you can be assured that all data and facts will be
thoroughly checked to determine what the issue is all about, he said adding
that this was in the interest of the country as well as in the interest of
relations in the country.
<P>The three students informed the President that through reports by a local
radio that had covered the November 17 polls they had been informed that
the coalition 'Zajedno' had won the majority vote.
<P>Local power-wielders however banned radio broadcasts at the point when the
coalition had secured 32 seats to 12 secured by the SPS, the students said.
<P>They said they realised that a person that was elected through the people's
will must rule and that if this was not the case, the Law was being
violated. This can lead either to dictatorship or to civil war, they said.
They said their protest would end once the Law was respected again.
<P>Milosevic apologized for not being informed about the details of the local
elections in Nis, asking the students whether the Nis City Court had acted
correctly.
<P>'We have brought these records to you to make sure that they were not
acting without your (Milosevic's) knowledge,' they explained.

<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> RUSSIA - DEVELOPMENTS IN YUGOSLAVIA</H3>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov's two recent statements on the
developments in Yugoslavia reflect Moscow's official stand, Russian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady Tarasov said on Tuesday. Tarasov was responding
to a statement given to Russian Television by Vuk Draskovic, one of the
leaders of the Serbian opposition coalition 'Zajedno' ('Together'), in
which he criticised the stand on developments in Belgrade expressed by
Primakov in Lisbon and London.
<P>Draskovic appeared in a Moscow NTV station broadcast, voicing accusations
against Serbian authorities, saying that the Russian Foreign Minister had
'insulted the democratic Serbia' and expressing hope that 'this is not the
support of democratic Russia.'
<P>This is not a private opinion of minister Primakov, but Russia's official
stand, Tarasov told a regular news briefing in Moscow. He said he hoped
that no one could try to deny it and especially not a citizen of another
country. Tarasov said that Russia's position on this and other issues was
quite clear and that a Foreign Ministry spokesman had recently made a
statement to this effect.
<P>Primakov and the Ministry spokesman have repeated several times in the past
few days that Russia regarded the developments in Belgrade as Yugoslavia's
internal affair. They welcomed Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's
invitation to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to
send a fact-finding mission so as to obtain information about the elections
in Yugoslavia.
<P>The Russian Minister has reiterated several times that everybody should pay
attention to human rights but that this should not turn into an
interference in other state's internal affairs.

<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> LILIC: POLITICAL EVENTS IN SERBIA ARE BAD FOR THE SITUATION IN
YUGOSLAVIA</H3>
Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic said on Tuesday that now that the U.N.
sanctions against Yugoslavia had been lifted conditions had been created
for the country's speedy economic recovery, but said the latest political
events had badly affected results achieved in this sense to date.
<P>'The latest developments concerning local polls in Serbia have had quite a
negative impact on advantages for the country's economic recovery we have
created,' Lilic said on his visit to the Serbian Post, Telegraph and
Telephone Services. In this context, he said the developments could affect
Yugoslavia's stability and foreign companies' interest in economic
cooperation with the country.
<P>'The opposition and to the great extent authorities as well have great
historical responsibility in the light of the separatists' and certain
foreign factors' newly awakened hopes that they will finally achieve their
goals thanks to the Serbs' disunity, and completely destabilise Serbia and
cause its possible disintegration,' he said. Yugoslavia would do all it
could to prevent this from happening and would use all political means to
find a solution to the issue, he added.
<P>Lilic said all parliamentary parties must show wisdom and must cooperate in
achieving goals of economic development and all that could make it possible
for this country to catch up with Europe as soon as possible. He said, 'the
only true way out is a political solution in line with democratic
principles and adopted by countries with a long democratic tradition like
Serbia.'
<P>He stressed that court decisions must be respected by both authorities as
well as the opposition, because he said the court had not given a single
vote to any party by annulling election results in constituencies where
irregularities had been observed.
<P>'The new round of polls was the only thing it was insisted on and all it
took was to run in that round and confirm one's victory,' he said.
<P>Lilic said the ruling party must accept the opposition's justified requests
that it raise the issue of its members' responsibility in constituencies
where irregularities had been observed, because he said what Serbia needed
most at this point were peace and stability rather than possible conflicts
that would affect also Europe.
<P>All parties concerned must reach agreement in the interest of the citizens
of Serbia who have not given a mandate to anyone to destabilise the country,
he said, adding that this was in the interest of its citizens, who he said
alone had the right to decide what kind of state they were going to live in
and what leadership they would put their confidence in, he said.
<P>Lilic said parliamentary elections in Serbia would be held next year,
saying it was necessary to create meanwhile conditions for high-level
election campaigns by all parties. This can be achieved through talks
rather than through threats and calls by some opposition leaders on the
world community to reimpose sanctions on Yugoslavia, he said.
<P>Lilic warned against calls to block Serbia's foreign funds again, adding
that he was confident that no one in Yugoslavia wanted this to happen. He
said it was therefore necessary to focus on work again as well as on
reaching agreement and strengthening rather than weakening Serbia. This
must be the goal of both the ruling party as well as the opposition, he
said.
<P>'Our obligation is to build the future rather than to turn to the past, and
to rule the country in the interest of the majority of its citizens,' he
said. He also said he was confident that neither Yugoslavia nor its federal
entities, Serbia and Montenegro, could follow a different path.

<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> OSCE CONFIRMS SENDING A DELEGATION TO BELGRADE</H3>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has decided to send
a high-level fact-finding delegation to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
in a few days to investigate the partial annulment of local election
results in Serbia, OSCE Headquarters in Vienna said on Tuesday.
<P>Former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzales has agreed to head the
delegation comprising high-level diplomats and experts from several OSCE
member-states, as proposed by OSCE Chairman, Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio
Cotti.
<P>Cotti has asked his special representative to 'seek information from all
political forces and institutions, including the media, and from the
judiciary on the facts and events relating to the municipal elections,
including the annulment of their results'.
<P>Cotti expects that the delegation will have free access to all persons,
institutions, election commissions and documents that they consider
necessary, the OSCE statement says.

<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</A> PREPARATIONS UNDER WAY FOR OSCE DELEGATION TO VISIT YUGOSLAVIA</H3>
The OSCE is working on putting together a delegation which is to visit
Belgrade to get genuine information about the situation in Yugoslavia, and
is trying precisely to define the delegation's mandate, Swiss Foreign
Ministry spokesman Franz Egle told Tanjug on Tuesday.
<P>The OSCE has assessed as positive Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's
proposal that an eminent OSCE delegation visit Yugoslavia to get informed
about the situation in the country, with a view to eliminating all
reservations in relations between Yugoslavia and the international
community.
<P>According to usually well-informed sources in Geneva, the delegation is
most likely to be made up of representatives of the U.S., Russia, the E.U.
and the OSCE 'three' - former, current and next country-chairman.
<P>U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum told reporters at the U.S.
Mission here late on Monday that he was pleased with the Milosevic proposal
that an OSCE delegation visit Yugoslavia, and said he hoped that would be
very soon.

<H3><A NAME="09">[09]</A> SERBIAN PREMIER MARJANOVIC BACKS PARLIAMENTARY DISCUSSION</H3>
Serbian Premier Mirko Marjanovic said on Tuesday that the upcoming
parliamentary discussion on the latest elections in Serbia, election
legislation and the role of media in the election process could ease the
post-election tensions created by the opposition.
<P>Marjanovic, who attended a session of the Assembly of Serbia, told
reporters that the election results, according to which the Socialist Party
of Serbia (SPS), Yugoslav United Left (JUL) and New Democracy (ND) have won
70% of votes at the Federal level and 65% at the local, should be
respected.
<P>Democracy must be respected even in the case of one-vote majority, as was
the case with the election of (German) Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl, Marjanovic
said.
<P>Commenting the domestic and foreign media coverage, Marjanovic said the
coverage provided by the foreign press had been 'relatively good'. He noted
that the New York Times, the Washington Post, Liberation, and Der Standard
were asking what the opposition coalition 'Zajedno' wanted at all.
<P>Turning to domestic media, Marjanovic said there was no black list and he
was speaking for himself when asking 'why do they report things which are
not true, and do so at the worst time for our country.'
<P>It would be good if journalists were only to publish the truth, Marjanovic
said.

Serbian Parliament Speaker Dragan Tomic said on Tuesday that the Parliament
had adopted important laws aimed at easing the social atmosphere in the
country.
<P>Tomic told Tanjug and Radio Belgrade that the Parliament had worked
efficiently and that its present composition had enabled it to work in
normal conditions.
<P>Referring to the decision to organize a Panel Discussion on current issues
regarding recent elections, Tomic said that at the time when the
development of democracy and dialogue was being sought by all, this
discussion would provide the best opportunity to all Parliament members to
meet and discuss many issues.
<P>Asked when the first session of the Panel Discussion would be held, Tomic
said it was yet to be agreed, but noted that the parliamentary debate on
this subject on Tuesday constituted in a way a first session.
<P>Today's debate has already shown differences in views, there have been
amendments, and Serbian Radical Party has participated very actively, which
demonstrates a great interest in this form of discussion, Tomic underlined.

<H3><A NAME="11">[11]</A> SERBIA ASSEMBLY DECIDES TO A OPEN PANEL DISCUSSION ON ELECTIONS</H3>
The Assembly of Serbia decided on Tuesday to organize a Panel Discussion on
issues relating to the recent elections, election legislation, and the role
of media in the election process, as proposed by the socialist (SPS)
deputies.
<P>The Assembly decided that representatives of the parliamentary groupings
and the Republican Government participate in the discussion, and that each
parliamentary grouping chose one representative. The Panel Discussion is to
last until all proposed topics are covered, and its first session will be
scheduled and the work chaired by the Socialist Party of Serbia
representative until the rules of work are adopted.
<P>The decision on the Panel Discussion will take effect a day after it is
published in the Official Gazette and the discussion will be accessible to
the public and media.
<P>Head of the SPS grouping Gorica Gajevic said, 'the election procedure in
our country is one of the most complicated,' which she noted had both
positive and negative sides to it.
<P>Gajevic said it was positive that the procedure prevented violations of the
election rules, and the negative was that election activities unfolded at
several levels, were complicated and could therefore be unclear for most of
the people.
<P>The Panel Discussion is in keeping with the place and time, since 'it is
not necessary that it unfold in the streets, but at a level of political
culture which corresponds to the majority of participants in the political
life.'
<P>The deputies of the opposition SRS urged that the discussion be held in the
Assembly and carried live on TV.

Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic has congratulated Kofi Annan on his election
as U.N. Secretary-General, the Presidential Office said on Thursday.
<P>Lilic said Yugoslavia, as a co-founder of the most important international
organization, had always attached the greatest significance to the
activities of the U.N., especially in the preservation of world peace and
international security, and the pursuit of global social and economic
development.
<P>Lilic offered assurances to Annan that Yugoslavia would continue to urge
the enhancement of and respect for the basic principles and goals of the
U.N. Charter, and the fulfilment of the ideals which had guided the U.N. co-
founders when setting up the organization more than 50 years ago.
<P>The Yugoslav President expressed conviction that the U.N., with Annan as
its Secretary-General, would meet the expectations of the international
community and help further consolidate the world peace, international
security and development.

<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> GOOD CONDITIONS EXIST FOR YUGOSLAV-VIETNAMESE ECONOMIC COOPERATION
YUGOSLAVIA WILL GET 20-40% LESS AID FOR REFUGEES IN 1997</H3>
Yugoslav minister without portfolio Zoran Bingulac and Vietnamese deputy
foreign minister Nguyen Van Hgan said on Thursday said that good political
relations between the two countries were a basis for their successful
economic cooperation.
<P>Both sides expressed readiness to promote bilateral cooperation, especially
in the building industry, agriculture, mechanical and electrical
engineering industries, trade and transportation, a Government statement
said.
<P>The two sides agreed that it was necessary to reactivate the mixed
committee for trade cooperation, and to open economic missions in the two
capitals.
<P>Nguyen Van Hgan said Vietnam was ready to back Yugoslavia's full
reintegration into international organizations, especially through ASEAN,
the statement said. (Tanjug, December 19, 1996)
<P>Yugoslavia will get in 1997, 20-40% less international aid for refugees
than this year, as Yugoslav Red Cross representatives have been told during
talks in Geneva. Difficulties in securing funds from institutional donors
were cited as the reason.
<P>The Yugoslav Red Cross delegation returned home from Geneva on Thursday,
after meeting with ranking officials of the International Committee of the
Red Cross, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies,
and the UNHCR, a released statement said.

<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> MILUTINOVIC: REMOVING ALL RESERVATIONS ON YUGOSLAVIA'S INTERNATIONAL
RELATIONS</H3>
Yugoslav foreign minister Milan Milutinovic said on Thursday that the
forthcoming visit of a delegation of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) was aimed above all at providing true
information on all facts so that all reservations regarding Yugoslavia's
relations with the international community can be removed.
<P>Answering a question by CNN reporter on the reason for the OSCE
delegation's visit to Belgrade, minister Milutinovic told a crowded press
conference at Sava Center in Belgrade:
<P>'We have invited the OSCE delegation precisely because an extremely
deformed picture was created in the international public on facts regarding
elections in Serbia. This is why we have invited the delegation to come in
order to obtain true information on all facts so that all reservations
regarding our relations with the international community can be removed.'
<P>'We thought that OSCE was the best framework for such a mission as OSCE
represents practically all countries of Europe and we are an integral part
of Europe'.
<P>'First of all, as you know, Yugoslavia is not an OSCE member and was, if I
might say so, expelled irregularly, without consensus and beyond all OSCE
regulations. However, we thought, and still think that we should be part of
OSCE with all our rights and duties. Consequently, this was the basic
idea.'
<P>'Of course, any conclusions taken by OSCE, one way or another, after
establishing all facts, which means that it should not come here with some
pre-conceptions but to examine all election results - as you know, the
elections had practically ended even before the so-called third round began,
as 96% of the delegates for 7,600 seats had already been elected - anything
that the OSCE will say will be discussed and assessed by our competent
institutions'.
<P>'Everything will therefore be within the framework of our system. As you
know, in keeping with our electoral system, local elections are held
entirely under the competence of electoral commissions and the courts, and
that is where it all ends. Consequently, it is precisely these institutions
which should examine the issue on the basis of facts established by OSCE'.
<P>'I cannot speak on behalf of those institutions. The Federal Government,
and particularly the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, can not do so'.
<P>Answering a question on the pre-defined procedure on the holding of
elections in Yugoslavia, minister Milutinovic underlined that as regards
local elections, and elections in general, it is the citizens who have the
last word, not courts or electoral commissions.
<P>'Consequently, in any case, any dispute will be resolved by the citizens,
by voting, because there is no other way. And, as your colleague Peter
Arnst has rightly said, this should be resolved by the Serbian people. And,
of course, by the institutions', Milutinovic specified.
<P>Reuters' reporter asked for an explanation on how the minister assessed the
damage suffered by Yugoslavia internationally due to the events in
Belgrade.
<P>Milutinovic answered:
<P>'The damage has been done in any case. Our assessment is that everything
that is happening now should be resolved, as I have said, within the
framework of the system, as you have seen, even during the second round of
voting there were, if I might say so, irruptions in the premises of the
electoral commissions, which generated many of subsequent developments'.
<P>'Local elections in any country represent a specific confrontation of
interests at all local levels. I think that all that happened regarding our
local elections was over emphasised in the international community and has
lead to a specifically deformed picture in the world regarding everything
happening here'.
<P>'I think that an unacceptable thesis was launched - that the entire
elections were annulled'.
<P>'It is not true that the entire elections were annulled, what was demanded
was a repetition of the vote, the citizens were urged to go out again to
the polling stations and the candidates were the same'.
<P>'I repeat, the elections were not repeated with different candidates but
with the same candidates, so one may wonder why a verification by the
voters should be feared'.
<P>'Also, the picture was also deformed in another sense'.
<P>'The opposition accepted the third round in places where it was winning,
and where it was not winning it did not accept it'.
<P>'You are, however, right in noting that the interests of the country had
suffered specific damage. It is clear that we must have a dialogue on any
and all issues, but, of course, within the framework of the institutions of
the system. Anything outside that framework is not democracy. It then
constitutes an attack on that other part of the citizenry who hold
different views'.
<P>'In previous elections, opposition in Yugoslavia had won in many places and
exercised local authority. No one had hindered it in this exercise,
absolutely'.
<P>'In Vracar (a Belgrade municipal district) in 1992, court rulings were
sought nine times until all seats were in the hands of the opposition. The
voters went to the polls nine times and no one dramatized the situation'.
<P>'Why is the present situation being dramatized? That is the right question.
Why and with what motives. I think that this is where the basic part of the
responsibility for the present situation lies.'
<P>'That the opposition has won local elections in many towns and communities
is nothing new here', Yugoslav Foreign Minister said.
<P>The correspondent of German news agency DPA asked whether the foreign flags
being carried during demonstrations could be interpreted as foreign
interference.
<P>'In itself, carrying the flags is not a problem. The problem lies in the
connotations linked with those flags, in the slogans being used and in the
kind of messages being sent to our population. Essentially, therefore, this
represents a request for foreign interference, ... which has antagonized a
major part of our population'.
<P>'These are political demonstrations to which a foreign factor is being
invited, symbolically, by those flags', Milutinovic underlined.

<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> OSCE DELEGATION EXPECTED FRIDAY IN BELGRADE</H3>
A delegation  of the OSCE headed by former Spanish foreign minister Felipe
Gonzalez is expected to arrive in Belgrade on Friday evening, it was
announced on Thursday evening at OSCE Headquarters in Vienna.
<P>The OSCE delegation comes to Belgrade on a fact-finding mission on the
situation in the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia following the partial
annulment of local election results and in order to remove all reservations
regarding the relations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the
international community.
<P>The delegation comprising high-level diplomats and experts from OSCE member-
states will return to Vienna on Saturday or Sunday evening, OSCE
spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said.
<P>Delegation members will confer in Belgrade with the representatives of all
political structures, including judiciary bodies, the media and any
organizations they expect can help them understand the factual situation in
Serbia.

<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> SERBIAN PRESIDENT RECEIVES U.N. ADMINISTRATOR</H3>
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic received on Friday U.N. administrator
of the Srem-Baranja region Jacques Klein, who arrived in Belgrade with a
number of associates.
<P>The talks focused on activities aimed at speeding up the overall
stabilisation of relations and normalisation of life, and especially
conditions for the region's economic recovery.
<P>It was said that a consistent implementation of the Erdut/Zagreb Agreement
was a basis for the overall normalisation of relations and consolidation of
peace and stability.
<P>The implementation of the agreement includes talks between representatives
of the Srem-Baranja region and the Croatian Government on protecting
security, freedom and rights of citizens as well as the speeding up of the
region's economic recovery, it was said.
<P>Yugoslav foreign minister Milan Milutinovic also participated in the talks.

<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> YUGOSLAV PRESIDENT LILIC EXTENDS CONGRATULATIONS TO KOFI ANNAN</H3>
Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic has congratulated Kofi Annan on his election
as U.N. Secretary-General, the Presidential Office said on Thursday.
<P>Lilic said Yugoslavia, as a co-founder of the most important international
organization, had always attached the greatest significance to the
activities of the U.N., especially in the preservation of world peace and
international security, and the pursuit of global social and economic
development.
<P>Lilic offered assurances to Annan that Yugoslavia would continue to urge
the enhancement of and respect for the basic principles and goals of the
U.N. Charter, and the fulfilment of the ideals which had guided the U.N. co-
founders when setting up the organization more than 50 years ago.
<P>The Yugoslav President expressed conviction that the U.N., with Annan as
its Secretary-General, would meet the expectations of the international
community and help further consolidate the world peace, international
security and development.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</a> Pseudostate's draft &quot;Budget&quot; figures</H3>
KIBRIS (12.12.96) publishes detailed figures of the pseudostate's draft
&quot;budget&quot;.  It says that the pseudostate's 1997 &quot;budget&quot; is envisaged to be
45,579, 690,000.000 TL.
<P>The draft &quot;law&quot; on the 1997 Financial Year &quot;Budget&quot;, which is
expected to increase by 85.3 percent compared to the 1996 &quot;budget&quot;, has
been submitted to the &quot;Council of Ministers&quot;.
<P>In the 1997 draft &quot;budget&quot;, 15,400,242,000,000 TL has been
appropriated for the &quot;civil servants.&quot;
<P>The 9,101,915,000,000 TL appropriation for personnel salaries and
other allowances in the 1996 &quot;budget&quot; is expected to be increased by
6,298,327,000,000 in 1997.
<P>In case the 1997 Financial Year &quot;Budget Draft Law&quot; by the
so-called Council of Ministers and the so-called assembly is approved as it
stands, the appropriation set aside for the &quot;civil servants&quot; will be 70
percent higher compared to the previous year.
<P>In assessing these figures, the economists are commenting that the
pseudo-government will be more generous towards the nearly 30,000 &quot;civil
servants&quot; in 1997.
<P>It also envisages a 301 percent increase in defense spending, 117
percent in investments, 66 percent in transfers, and 70 percent in current
expenditures.  Compared to the 1996 &quot;budget&quot;, the same draft envisages
increases of 98.4 percent in local revenues, 156.8 percent in aid from
Turkey, 400 percent in Turkey's credits, 40.4 percent in borrowings, and
100 percent in humanitarian aid received from the UN and third countries.
<P>In his preamble submitted to the so-called Council of Ministers
&quot;Finance Minister&quot; Salin Cosar said that the budget is realistic and
factual.
<P>If one compares the draft 1997 Financial Year &quot;budget&quot; with the
1996 &quot;budget&quot;, which had envisaged raising 29-trillion TL in revenues but
only managed to collect 24,604,034,117,969 TL, it could be seen that the
1997 &quot;budget&quot; has been increased by 85.3 percent.
<P>Accordingly, the following is a comparison between the 1996 and
1997 &quot;budgets&quot; in terms of revenues and expenditure.
<PRE>
                  Expenditure 1996     1997      Difference  Increase

</PRE>
According to the 1997 Financial Year &quot;Budget Draft Law&quot; the Education,
Culture, Youth and Sports &quot;Ministries&quot; will get the greatest share from the
45,579,690,000,000TL &quot;budget&quot;.
<P>The &quot;Education Ministry&quot; gets 6,019,120,100,000 TL from the
budgetary pie.
<P>The &quot;Public Works and Transportation Ministry&quot; comes second and
the &quot;Health and Environment Ministry&quot; third in obtaining the largest
shares.  The appropriation envisaged for the &quot;Public Works and
Transportation Ministry&quot; is 3,450,304,500,000 TL and for the &quot;Health and
Environment Ministry&quot; is 3,712,796,000,000.
<P>Only 93-billion has been appropriated for tourism investments out
of the 8,461,021,000,000 TL resources envisaged for investment projects.
This constitutes 1.09 percent of the resources set aside for all investment
projects.
<P>The largest share in the investment projects goes to the &quot;social
services&quot; with 2,245,005,000,00 TL.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</a> Denktash says Rifkind proposals are unimportant</H3>
According to illegal Bayrak radio (16:30 hours, 17.12.96), Rauf Denktash
has said that the British views announced by British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind at his news conference were not discussed at his meeting
with him.  Denktash said: &quot;Rifkind did not bring us such a proposal or
discuss it with us.  He expressed his own views at the new conference.  His
views are, naturally, his own.&quot;
<P>Denktash recalled that at their joint news conference, Rifkind
said that the Cyprus problem can be resolved between the two sides.
Denktash said: &quot;Consequently, Rifkind expressed his own views at his news
conference.  The views are deficient in places.  However, we are not
thinking of doing anything more about this issue now.&quot;
<P>Assessing Rifkind's news conference for illegal Bayrak Radio and
Television, Denktash said that the 10-item British view is not a proposal.
He alleged that some of Rifkind's views contain those elements that made
President Clerides reject the UN Secretary General's set of ideas.  He said
that Rifkind did not express an opinion about sovereignty, equality, and
the guarantees, issues which the Turkish Cypriots particularly emphasize.
<P>Denktash concluded by claiming: &quot;Rifkind's remarks were suggested
by Clerides.  Some of Rifkind's views are those views Clerides says he
accepts.  If that is the case, I say, come and let us negotiate.  Why does
he not come to the table and negotiate?  We can deduce that certain circles
are giving him the green light; in other words, Clerides wants the things
he says he accepts to be diluted.  Rifkind tried to help Clerides by saying
that they are his own views even though his original intention was to hear
the views of the two sides.  That is how we view this issue.  In other
words, as far as we are concerned, these proposals are unimportant.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</a> Denktash rejects Rifkind call for new guarantee plan for Cyprus</H3>
According to Turkish Daily News (17.12.96), Denktash Monday rejected
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind's proposal to &quot;reinterpret the
guarantorship&quot; with respect to the Cyprus issue.
<P>Rauf Denktash in reply to Rifkind's proposal to extend the
guarantorship in a way that meets the demands of both communities, claimed
that the agreement of guarantorship did not lead to any problems on the
island.  &quot;On the contrary, it prevented the Greek invasion of the island
and the annihilation of Cyprus Turks.  It is a good system; there cannot be
an alternative.
<P>We cannot give up on the guarantorship of Turkey because we cannot
give up on the basic rights granted to us in the 1960 agreements&quot;, he
claimed.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</a> Census results ready in three months</H3>
According to KIBRIS (18.12.96), the chairman of the Turkish State
Statistics Institute (DIE), Mehmet Siddik Ensari, has declared that the
census held last Sunday in the occupied area is, both technical and content
wise, of an international standard.  He further said that the technical
analysis of the census results, which will be done in Turkey, will be ready
in three months time.
<P>The pseudostate's so-called State Planning Organization &quot;under
secretary&quot; Ahmet Zeki Bulunc has claimed that &quot;Whatever the results, they
will be published&quot;.
<P>Turkey's State Statistics Institute Chairman Ensari, who had went
the occupied area to follow up the census, left the occupied area
yesterday.
<P>Prior to his departure Ensari answered questions put to him by
journalists.  He described the census as &quot;excellent&quot;.
<P>He further said that questions asked during the census are
questions asked in Turkey or in any other country.  &quot;The questions asked
are aimed at revealing the social, economic and demographic characteristics
of the population&quot;.  When asked to clarify the use of pencil by the people
who were conducting the census, Ensari claimed that &quot;pencil&quot; is used during
a census held in Turkey and &quot;the aim is to give the chance to the official
to correct mistakes he had made during the census&quot;.
<P>Regarding the &quot;concern&quot; that the census results will reveal the
number of mainland Turks living in the occupied area Ensari said: &quot;Our
evaluation will be done by computers.  All information will be loaded to
the computer and results will be out.  There is no reason for concern&quot;&quot;.
<P>Ensari alleged that the DIE's responsibility regarding the census
is &quot;technical&quot;.
<P>In his turn Ahmet Zeki Bulunc said that &quot;there was no reason to
hide the results.  Transparency is our basic principle.  Whatever the
results are, they will be made available to the public and to those who
will make use of these results.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</a> A bleak record for Turkey as regards human rights violations</H3>
According to Turkish Daily News (13.12.96), Turkey, with a constitution
dating from the 1980 military coup and signatory to two international
conventions against torture, has been encircled in claims of human rights
violations, stimulating many national and international nongovernmental
organizations to act.  Turkey's quest to become a member of the European
Union also accelerated efforts to improve human rights there.
<P>The most serious claims against Turkey involve systematic torture
and the increase in &quot;disappearances&quot; of people in custody.  In 1992, the
Council of Europe said that even though Turkey had improved its human
rights record, it had yet to eliminate torture and other violations of
basic freedoms.  The Council adopted a resolution urging Turkey to prevent
torture, pursue reports of human rights violations more vigorously and take
more control of security forces.  The Council's resolution followed a clash
between security forces and Kurds earlier in the year.
<P>During the same year, the British Medical Association said in a
report published in London that doctors in Turkey were involved in torture.
&quot;We found that doctors had actively participated in the process of torture
by certifying the prisoner's fitness for torture, reviving the prisoner
after collapse, monitoring the prisoner's state during torture and giving
false or inadequate medical care to the tortured person,&quot; the report said.
&quot;Equally importantly, we found that many doctors who know that torture or
other abuses are happening do nothing to challenge it&quot;.
<P>The report added that one common form of collaboration in human
rights abuses was the preparation of false or inadequate medical
certificates for victims.
<P>Turkey, following a two-year period in which it was supposed to
set the record straight, was once again blasted by Amnesty International
for its increasing attacks on freedom of expression.  The group called for
an expert mission to be sent to investigate deteriorating human rights in
the country.  In its annual report, Amnesty also urged Washington to
reconsider military aid to the country.
<P>The London-based group also drew attention to the alarming
increase in &quot;disappearances&quot;.  &quot;Urgent measures must be taken to stem the
alarming increase in `disappearances' and extrajudicial executions in
Turkey&quot;, Amnesty said, expressing fears that &quot;the practice of
`disappearance', like that of extrajudicial execution, is becoming
established as a tool of intimidation in Turkey&quot;.
<P>All these reactions were not enough to motivate the state to
improve human rights, as clearly seen in the horrifying violations of human
rights in 1996.  The death of Evrensel Journalist Metin Goktepe in January
due to torture while in custody, the hunger strikes in prisons in July,
which led to the deaths of 12 people, and the student demonstrations in
November were all examples of human rights violations where, despite
widespread criticism, the Turkish state remained a spectator.
<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</a> Abdullah Catli had travelled to the occupied area using forged travelling documents</H3>
YENIDUZEN (18.12.96) reveals that Turkish Mafia boss and member of the
notorious Grey Wolves gang, Abdullah Catli, who was killed in a car
accident in Turkey on 3 November together with a police chief, had also
visited the occupied area on 26 April together with the &quot;King of Casinos&quot;
Omer Lutfi Topal who was killed by Catli on 28 July in Istanbul in an
ambush.
<P>YENIDUZEN says that Catli wanted to acquire casinos belonging to
Topal in the occupied area.
<P>Catli entered the occupied area with forged travelling documents
issued in the name of &quot;Mehmet Ozbay&quot;.
<P>The accident on 3 November in Susurluk near Istanbul revealed a
Mafia-state relation in Turkey, because Catli's friend tribal chieftain and
True Path Party Deputy Sedat Bucak was also travelling in that same car
involved in the accident.  (MY)
<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</a> Eroglu on &quot;civil servants&quot; wages, importance of Rifkind visit</H3>
According to illegal Bayrak radio (11:30 hours, 17.12.96) &quot;prime minister&quot;
Dervis Eroglu has said that nobody can undermine the justified rights of
the workers as long as he is in the &quot;government&quot; and stressed that 1997
will be a critical and important year in terms of the Cyprus issue.
<P>The Turkish Cypriot &quot;civil servants&quot; held their fifth congress
yesterday.
<P>Addressing the congress, Eroglu said that it is out of question to
disregard the interests of those workers who work in the privatized
institutions, and added that the salaries of the &quot;civil servants&quot; will be
paid before the new year.
<P>Noting that 1997 will be a critical and important year in terms of
the Cyprus issue, Eroglu added that the United States continues to have a
say in the matter.  Eroglu further stated that the visit of British Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind to the pseudostate carried importance in terms of
showing that there are two separate &quot;administrations&quot; in Cyprus.
<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</a> Tore asks for Turkish nationality for all Turkish Cypriots</H3>
According to KIBRIS (18.12.96) the chairman of the Nationalist Justice
Party (MAP), Zorlu Tore, in a letter to Turkey's so-called envoy to the
occupied area Ambassador Ertugrul Apakan, asked him to grant Turkish
nationality to all Turkish Cypriots living in the occupied area.
<P>Tore claimed that Turkish Cypriots who are not Turkish citizens
face difficulties when they go to Turkey.
<P>Stating that with Cyprus's EU membership the integration of the
&quot;Greek Cypriot&quot; side with Greece will be speeded up, Zorlu Tore claimed
this will turn the Cyprus problem into not a Greco-Turkish conflict but a
problem between Turkey and the EU.  (MY) EF/SK

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</a> Etkin interviewed on Rifkind's plan</H3>
Illegal BRTK (17:45 hours, 17.12.96) aired a live interview with Taner
Etkin, &quot;minister of foreign affairs and defense&quot;.
<P>In reply to a question on Malcolm Rifkind's proposed 10 points,
Etkin inter alia said: &quot;Allow me now to express my opinion on the views he
outlined at his news conference.  It must be clearly known that a proposal
has not been made.  The first reports said that a proposal was put forward.
That is wrong.  A written or a verbal proposal was not made to us in the
talks.  We have assessed what was outlined as the British Foreign Office's
views.  Mr. Rifkind held a news conference at the end of his contacts and
outlined his views.  Naturally, whatever he has said is his opinion.  A
general assessment of the Cyprus problem will indicate that a proposal
cannot be made by a foreign official or country.  The problem will be
resolved through the talks that will be held between the two peoples in
Cyprus.&quot;
<P>In reply to a relevant question he said: &quot;Let us first discuss the
question of guarantees.  Our categorical stand can be outlined as follows:
The system that has been established in accordance with the 1960 Treaty of
Alliance and Guarantees cannot be changed.  No provision can be added to
the agreement that will be reached to weaken or remove Turkey's effective
and de facto guarantee in the future.  We resolutely insist on that.&quot;
<P>Asked if they are or not inclined to agree to an international
formula on the question of guarantees, a formula which also will include
Turkey, he said:
<P>&quot;We are definitely not inclined to do so because the guarantee of
an international force will weaken Turkey's effective and de facto
guarantee and, probably, remove it in the future altogether.  This state of
affairs will pose a very serious threat to our security.  It may weaken or
remove the system of guarantees which protects our existence on the island.
Agreeing to this is impossible.&quot;
<P>Asked if Turkey will be able to take unilateral action if it is
included in an international system of guarantees, Etkin said: &quot;Turkey will
not be able to effectively fulfill its role as a guarantor power in such a
system of guarantees.  This is why we oppose it.  Turkey will find it very
difficult to guarantee our security.  In fact, we are convinced that it may
forfeit the opportunity it has to do so.
<P>Meanwhile, why should we need an international force if we are
going to reach an agreement?  If a military force is required to monitor or
follow up implementation of the agreement we will reach for a certain
period of time, then UNFICYP, which has been on the island since 1963, can
fulfill this task and then withdraw.  Meanwhile, Turkey and Greece can
continue to be the guarantors of Cyprus, as called for by the 1960 Treaty
of Alliance and Guarantees.&quot;
<P>Asked on the issue of Cyprus' EU accession before Turkey, he said
that is impossible for them to adopt a favourable approach on the matter.
&quot;The talks may be resumed and an agreement may be reached.  However, we
must maintain a very careful approach on accession to the EU.  We have
outlined our resolute stand on the matter.  As far as we are concerned,
Cyprus' accession before Turkey joins the organization is impossible&quot;, he
said.
<P>Concluding, he said: &quot;We have outlined our position.  A basis
exists.  We have the Boutros-Ghali Set of Ideas, which was drawn up within
the framework of the UN Secretary General's good offices.  It includes the
necessary parameters.  We have said that we are ready to discuss them.
Meanwhile, we have a few basic principles which cannot be abandoned. Let us
briefly outline them as follows: The first is the principle of bizonality,
the second is political equality, the third is equal partnership in
sovereignty, and the fourth, which is the most important, is the
maintenance of Turkey's effective and de facto guarantee, in other words,
the right Turkey has in accordance with the Treaty of Alliance and
Guarantees.
<P>The question of accession to the EU may be placed on the agenda
after an agreement is reached.  However, we maintain a resolute approach on
an important matter.  It closely concerns our security and existence in
Cyprus.  We can join the EU if Turkey is a part of it.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</a> Report links Asil Nadir with Catli gang</H3>
Turkish weekly magazine Aydinlik (15.12.96) publishes a very interesting
report on Abdullah Catli, his links with Asil Nadir and the occupied area.
It is as follows:
<P>&quot;Asil Nadir's lawyer M.A. (as published) came to Turkey a few
times last month on a private plane.  The plane landed at Ankara's Esenboga
Airport.  The airport hangar belonging to Ceylanlar was used to take
attention away from the plane.  Nadir's lawyer held a secret private
meeting with Ozer and the Cillers.  The press was not informed of the
meetings.
<P>There was a `landing of banks' in Cyprus in 1993.  Many Turkish
`businessmen', among them people barred from establishing banks in Turkey,
ended up owning banks in Cyprus.  At the time the leader of New Cyprus
Party, Alpay Durduran, said that Cyprus had become `an inn where everybody
enters as he pleases.'  The money from Turkey obtained by tax evasion or
from unknown sources was laundered through these banks.  The Cypriots
complained that `we had become the Sicily of Turkey.'
<P>Asil Nadir escaped from Britain in May of 1993.  Nadir, who was
forced to present himself to the police every Sunday and who was barred
from leaving Britain until the conclusion of a court case, disappeared on
Sunday 3 May after presenting himself to the police for a last time.  He
took refuge in the `TRNC`.
<P>Nadir's escape was planned. All the preparations were made.
President Turgut Ozal died on 17 April 1993 just when the order to start
the operation was being awaited.  Upon his death the escape was postponed.
<P>Turmoil broke out in Cyprus after Nadir took shelter on the
island.  TRNC leader Rauf Denktash' son Serdar Denktash's newspaper VATAN
reported Nadir's escape to Cyprus under the headline: &quot;Now we are done
for&quot;.  Then Prime Minister Dervis Eroglu and his supporters saw the escape
as a `victory' and gave support to Nadir.
<P>Dervis Eroglu is an interesting man.  It is being claimed that
Eroglu is a partner of Gaziantep businessman Mehmet Ali Yaprak, who is the
`world's largest Coptagon (as published) producer.'  There are also claims
that Yaprak is producing his goods in Cyprus.  Yaprak was abducted in front
of his house in Gaziantep by Abdullah Catli (an Idealist Hearth Association
member and alleged mafia-state hitman who died together with a former
police chief in a car accident in Susurluk 40 days ago) and policemen from
a special operation team.
<P>Despite going bankrupt in Britain, Asil Nadir was a billionaire on
his return to the island.  Nadir's trump card was his wealth in Cayman
Islands banks.  It was rumoured at the time that this wealth amounted to 25
million pounds sterling.  The South American Cayman Islands were being used
to launder money and hide money obtained illegally.  Later the Ciller
family too started showing interest in these islands.
<P>When Asil Nadir wanted to invest in Turkey, MIT (the National
Intelligence Organization) sent a one-word report to the State Planning
Committee: `Objectionable'.
<P>Abdullah Catli and his team played an important role in the escape
of Asil Nadir.  In its 24 May 1993 issue AYDINLIK reported that the
organization that helped Nadir to escape was made up of member of the
Idealist mafia with links to the CIA.
<P>The escape was organized in Germany.  The plane and the pilot were
found in Germany.  Enver Altayli supervised the organization.  The plane
hired for Nadir's escape was arranged by Altayli, who was the MHP's
(Nationalist Movement Party) chief inspector in Germany prior to the 12
September 1980 coup.  The Turkish State's intelligence organizations know
that Altayli has been cooperation with the CIA for many years and carried
out activities in the Turkic republics on behalf of the CIA.
<P>And Rifat Yildirim, one of the key persons in the escape, was the
favourite hitman in Catli's team prior to the 12 September coup.  Yildirim,
who murdered Assistant Professor Bedrettin Comert on 11 July 1977, passed
himself off as a militant of the Army For the Liberation of the Enslaved
Turks (Esir Turkleri Kurtarma Ordusu) (ETKO) when he was captured a year
later.  Yildirim was spirited away from the Ankara Security Directorate and
went to Germany after the 12 September coup.  He was captured in Frankfurt
on charges of heroin smuggling.  In his deposition at the Frankfurt
prosecutor's office he announced that he was engaged in narcotic business
`in the name of the Idealist Organizations'.  He was sentenced to seven
years, the heaviest penalty under German law.  Yildirim was looked after at
the prison by Catli and Altayli.  Just like Catli, Yildirim too has murky
relations with Azerbaijan.
<P>These were not the only people involved in the getaway of Asil
Nadir.  Such old former MHP murder suspects as Yildirim Nihat Barlas,
Tayfun Iner, Mikail Goleli and Celal from Bingol were also in the team that
was to protect Nadir during the getaway.  Most of the MHP people mentioned
here were known to be members of the Abidinpasa Idealist Hearth
Association, which was one of the bloodiest gangs in Ankara before the 1980
coup.  The gang was headed by Catli.
<P>The Swiss narcotics prosecutor issued an international detention
warrant against Catli for bringing in 4 kg of heroin to Switzerland on 7
September 1984.  Catli was detained in Ardennes Street in Paris on 24
October 1984.  Again heroin was found on him.  He was sentenced to seven
years in prison in Paris on 27 January 1986 and in Basel on 20 July 1989.
Catli was spirited away from Bostadel Prison on 21 March 1990.
<P>Catli took over the leadership of his gang after escaping prison.
There are signs that relations between Asil Nadir, who gives material and
spiritual support to the Idealists in Cyprus, and Catli grew closer.
<P>Aysegul Nadir is as famous as Asil Nadir.  Aysegul Nadir is as
close to former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger as to be his `adviser
on antiques'.  Aysegul Nadir was caught while smuggling antiques and was
interrogated by the then director of the Istanbul Financial Police, Salih
Gungor.  Asil Nadir intervened and sacrificed $300,000.  There are claims
that the dollars were given to a former minister who is now in great
trouble.
<P>The internationally renowned bellydancer Yonca Yucel became famous
with the first MIT report.  The report said that Yucel was the mistress of
then deputy director of the Istanbul Security Directorate, Mehmet Agar.
Now Yucel is in London and lives in a house given to her as a gift by Asil
Nadir!
<P>Kutlu Adali was shot and killed on the night of 6 July in front of
his house in the TRNC capital of Nicosia.  Adali was a columnist in the
Republican Turkish Party's (CTP) organ YENIDUZEN.  Thousands took part in
Kutlu Adali's funeral.  Twenty trade unions staged strikes and businesses
closed for Adali.
<P>The Turkish Revenge Brigade (Turk Intikam Tugay, TIT) claimed
responsibility for the murder.  An unidentified person who called KIBRIS
said: `We killed Kutlu Adali.  The Turkish Revenge Brigade.'  Before the
1980 coup the TIT was one of the illegal organizations harbouring such
extremist rightist murder gangs as the ETKO of Rifat Yildirim who was
Catli's righthand man.  The TRNC police are now investigating if Catli had
a role in the murder of Adali.
<P>In the past year there has been an unprecedented bombing campaign
in Cyprus.  Buildings belonging to the two coalition partners were bombed.
<P>In a statement to AYDINLIK, CTP General Secretary Ferdi Sabit
Soyer said: `Bombs were placed in our party building and in the buildings
of our government partner.  The secret fascist organizations have recently
started publishing foundation statements.  The perpetrators of the bombing
incidents have not been found.  Eventually, important writer Kutlu Adali,
who was very sensitive over this issue and criticized them, was murdered by
these organizations.  It is impossible to find the perpetrators of any
crime on such a small island as Cyprus, which is teeming with thousands of
soldiers and policemen.  This is very interesting.  The TIT assumed
responsibility for the murder.  I think the Turkish public is no stranger
to the TIT.'
<P>Many who want to book a place on TRNC Airlines to go to Cyprus are
told: &quot;We have no seats.&quot;  But those who board the plane see that more than
half of it is empty.  When asked why the answer is given: &quot;Parliamentarians
book seats and then do not come.&quot;  Attention is being drawn to some
deputies who frequently travel by TRNC Airlines from Ankara-Ercan
(Tymbou)-Yesilkoy-London. These visits are considered meaningful.  The
Turkish State's narcotics officials are closely interested in these tours.
<P>The TRNC Airlines Administration Board is headed by Umit Utku, a
known figure in the Idealist world.  The Cypriots are somehow never able to
free themselves of Utku.  Turkish Airlines has a share in TRNC Airlines.
Utku maintains his position by relying on this share.  And it was Tansu
Ciller who appointed Umit Utku as a member of the Turkish Airlines
Administrative Board!
<P>Abdullah Catli, who used the pseudonyms Feridun Akkuzu in France
and Hasan Kurtoglu in Switzerland, was detained at Ataturk Airport on 26
February 1992.  This time round he used the pseudonym Sahin Ekli. Catli,
who was detained and fingerprinted for using a forged passport, was
released by the Istanbul Security Directorate.
<P>In a written statement on Friday 13 December the Interior Ministry
announced that Abdullah Catli's (Sahin Ekli) fingerprints were found on the
magazine of the Klalashnikov used in the murder of (casino owner) Omer
Lutfi Topal.  It was also announced that an investigation will be opened
against personnel who caused the delay by not examining the fingerprints on
the gun earlier.  The gun used in the murder and police officers Ercan
Ersoy, Ayhan Carkin, and Oguz Yorulmaz, who were released after being
detained for involvement in the murder of Toptan, were handed over to
Special Operations Department officials who came from Ankara.  That
Department was headed by Ibrahim Sahin.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</a> COE committee approves report on Turkish Cypriot representation</H3>
According to illegal Bayrak radio (6:00 hours, 19.12.96) a report approved
by the Political Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of
Europe (COE) foresees that Turkish Cypriots be represented at the committee
meetings.  The report says that &quot;political representatives of the Turkish
Cypriot community&quot; will participate in committee meetings on issues
concerning Cyprus.
<P>The report will go into effect once it is approved by the COE
Parliamentary Assembly.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</a> Turkish Cypriots were refused entry to COE committee meeting</H3>
KIBRIS (20.12.96) reports under banner headlines &quot;Scandal in London&quot; and
says that the &quot;Turkish Cypriot delegation who wanted to attend the Council
of Europe Parliamentary Assembly Political Affairs Committee meetings was
turned back and was not allowed to enter the meeting's hall.&quot;
<P>KIBRIS reports that the head of the so-called Turkish Cypriot
parliamentary delegation Hakki Atun has launched a protest.  (MY) EF/SK

<H4>Farmers march to Athens</H4>
The government stood its ground as thousands of farmers from all over the
country converged on Athens' city centre yesterday in support of their
demands, although Prime Minister Costas Simitis again refused to meet them
as long as they continued to block roads and rail links.
<P>More than 100 coaches arrived in Athens at noon with farmers and their
families scheduled to attend the rally. Some 5,000 farmers massed outside
the agriculture ministry building, shouting slogans and expressing their
determination to continue their protests until they are vindicated.
<P>Farmers want lower fuel prices, higher price supports and US$1.3 billion in
debts rescheduled, however, the government has maintained that it has no
money to give.
<P>The rally began with speeches by members of the farmers' coordinating
committee of Thessaly, who attacked the government for its handling of the
situation, accusing it of intransigence.
<P>Thousands of farmers have blocked national roads for 23 days with tractors,
causing a transportation chaos and inflicting more than $100 million in
damages on the economy.
<P>Many barricades have come down in recent days and farmers in some regions
have lost heart, but blockades on the north-south motorway in the Thessaly
region have stayed in place, virtually cutting the country in two.
<P><H4>Meeting with Tzoumakas</H4>
Farmers' representatives said later that a two-hour meeting with Agriculture
minister Stephanos Tzoumakas had been fruitless. They claimed none of the
six demands they had put forward had been accepted, adding that the only
thing which the government promised them was 12 billion drachmas from the
European Union as compensation for farmers whose crops or installations
were damaged by recent bad weather.
<P>In contrast, the minister described the meeting as substantive, adding that
farmers had been fully briefed on the 12 million drachma compensation sum
approved by the European Commision.
<P><H4>Simitis says he would never bow to `blackmail`</H4>
The government is not opposed to Greece's farmers but only to a few of them,
Prime Minister Costas Simitis was quoted yesterday as stating during an
interview with the popular monthly magazine &quot;Nitro&quot;. He said that he would
rather &quot;go home&quot; instead of bowing to protesting farmers' demands.
<P>&quot;There are millions of farmers in Greece but only 3,000 farmers have taken
the streets,&quot; Mr. Simitis said, sending a clear message to farmers
blockading the country's roads for 22 days, demanding higher subsidies,
lower taxes and cheaper fuel.
<P>&quot;My job is to spread the available money in a socially just way and that is
why we must struggle not to succumb to blackmail,&quot; he said.
<P>Mr. Simitis has rejected all demands, saying Greece had no money to give
and must catch up with its European Union partners.
<P><H4>Stephanopoulos visit to Egypt</H4>
President of the Republic Kostis Stephanopoulos begins a four-day official
visit to Egypt today, at the invitation of Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
<P>The Greek president will meet Mr. Mubarak in Cairo at noon tomorrow for
talks expected to focus on bilateral relations between Athens and Cairo,
the Middle East and Greek national issues.
<P>President Stephanopoulos, who will visit Luxor and Alexandria, as well will
also have contacts with members of the ethnic Greek community in Egypt.
<P>The PNO's executive committee later decided to extend the strike for a
further 24 hours.
<P>It is now scheduled to end at 6 a.m. local time on Saturday, although a
further extension of strike action cannot be ruled out.
<P>Meanwhile, scuffles in Piraeus yesterday between striking seamen and truck
drivers resulted in one man's death.
<P>The scuffles broke out when drivers tried to board the &quot;Vicenzos Kornaros&quot;
ferry boat with their vehicles and were opposed by striking seamen.
<P><H4>Wrapping paper furor hits Thessaloniki</H4>
A design for paper used for wrapping meat and fish has divided the world of
arts and letters in Thessaloniki just days before the northern port city
officially assumes its one-year term as Cultural Capital of Europe.
<P>The furor has been caused by plans of the art department of the city's
Cultural Capital Organisation to print and distribute wrapping paper with
lines from the works of celebrated Greek poets alongside catch-phrases
commonly used by contemporary Greek youth such as &quot;... don't bug me.&quot;
<P>Proponents of the paper, which has lines from the poetry of Nobel laureates
George Seferis and Odysseus Elytis, describe the concept as a &quot;public,
literary rave or happening&quot; which brings the popular masses closer to
literature.
<P>However, a number of prominent literary figures in Thessaloniki have
expressed strong opposition, saying literature and its creators should be
treated with greater respect.
<P><H4>EU approves transport, environment projects for Greece</H4>
The European Commission has approved the sums of Ecu324.1 and 88.9 million
for projects in Greece in the transport and environmental sectors,
respectively.
<P>The funds are to be provided through the EU's Cohesion Fund, and will cover
in most cases between 85 and 90 per cent of the total cost of such
projects.
<P>The transport sector projects include two plans aiming to improve
transportation from various outlying areas to the centre of Athens with the
contruction of a new railway line to Corinth (Ecu140 million), and of a
railway carriage sorting station west of the capital. The projects are
estimated to significantly reduce the journey time between Athens to Patra,
and from Patra to Thessaloniki.
<P>The transport projects also include the Patra- Athens - Thessaloniki
highway, which is to be funded with Ecu74.4 million.
<P>The environmental projects concern drainage, biological waste treatment
plants and the Evinos River dam.
<P><H4>Bourse approves bonds loan</H4>
The board of the Athens Stock Exchange has approved the entry into the
bourse of a bonds loan amounting to 20 billion drachmas by the International
Reconstruction and Development Bank at its board meeting yesterday.
<P>The board also approved the papers concerning an increase in the share
capital of the insurance company &quot;European Reliance AEGA&quot;, to enable it to
join the main market of the bourse.
<P>Another issue examined was the prolonged rise in the ELBIEMEK company's
shares. The company was called on to explain possible substantive events
justifying the continuous rise.
<P><H4>OECD forecasts 3 per cent growth in '97</H4>
Greece will have a growth rate near 3 per cent in 1997 but is in danger of
maintaining an increased public deficit, high inflation and unemployment as
well as a drop in competitiveness, an Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) report stated.
<P>The report said growth reached 2.5 per cent in 1996, which is higher than
the European Union average, following salary increases which precipitated
an increase in household consumption, as well as to an increase in public
investments supported by EU funds.
<P>The report noted that inflation stood at 8.5 per cent, higher than the
government's convergence target, while efforts to limit the public deficit
to 7.6 per cent of GDP in 1996 will be &quot;difficult to attain.&quot; Consequently,
the target of 4.2 per cent for 1997 is in danger of being missed, according
to the OECD, which estimates that the deficit is not expected to be reduced
by more than 1.5 per cent next year.
<P>The report also refers to &quot;uncertainties&quot; which exist concerning a
reduction in interest rates and the rate of de-escalation of inflation,
despite the declared intention of the government to persist with its &quot;hard
drachma&quot; policy.
<P><H4>Bendit urges radical chane in anti-drug policies</H4>
Green Eurodeputy and former leftist firebrand Daniel con Bendit urged
adoption of a European Union anti-prohibition policy in relation to drug
substances and legalisation of so-called &quot;soft&quot; drugs, as well as the free
provision of &quot;hard&quot; ones or their sub stitutes under strict medical
control.
<P>Mr. Bendit made his proposal in a speech at the Athens Economic University
(ASOEE) yesterday.
<P>Mr. Bendit referred to official figures outlining the magnitude of the
development of the illegal drugs trade. Its annual turnover amounts to
$US500 billion, with the price of substances being 1,700 times greater than
their purchae value from Third World farmers.
<P>&quot;Mobilise as many armies as you like. Only 10 per cent of drug trafficking
is seized and the sole thing further prosecution will achieve is some sort
of an increase in the above percentage with, however, a parallel increase
in the price of drugs in the illegal trade as well,&quot; he said.
<P>&quot;The legalisation of 'soft' drugs and implementation of methadone
programmes is the sole solution for handling the problem,&quot; he said.
<P><H3>WEATHER</H3>
Rainfall from the western regions will gradually spread to the rest of the
country and the northern Aegean later in the day. Athens will be sunny
getting cloudy with possible rain at night with temperatures ranging from
10-16C. Thessaloniki will be partly cloudy with temperatures between 8-
13C.

<H4>Farmers loosen blockades</H4>
Road access to Thessaloniki from the surrounding prefectures was restored
this morning after farmers lifted their blockade at the Malgara toll post
on the Thessaloniki-Athens highway.
<P>The farmers left just a small number of tractors at the side of the road at
Malgara and did not rule out re-blocking the road for a few hours later in
the day.
<P>The same tactic was adopted by farmers yesterday in Pieria, who opened the
last remaining roadblocks in the prefecture at Variko and Aiginio on the
Thessaloniki-Athens highway, only to reblock the road at the same two
points this morning.
<P>At the same time, the coordinating committee representing farmers of
Macedonia and Thrace today decided to suspend their protest action.
<P>The committee said all tractors at blockades still standing in the region
would depart at 16.00 local time in order to facilitate motorists wishing
to travel on the occasion of the Christmas holiday and pave the way for
dialogue with Prime Minister Costas Simitis.
<P>The government has insisted that there can be no dialogue between
protesting farmers and Simitis as long as they continued to block the
country's road and rail links.
<P>Representatives of farmers in Macedonia and Thrace warned however that if
the dialogue with the premier proved to be fruitless, they would resume
their protests in mid-January.
<P>Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that following yesterday's mass
protest rally by farmers in Athens, ''the process of dialogue remains
open''.
<P>Reppas said the government had already replied to three of the six
''points'' raised by farmers, adding that ''anyone can put forward demands
but it is the government which charts policy and is responsible for
tackling problems in the way it sees fit''.
<P>The spokesman also attacked opposition parties, saying that ''the silence
of the political party leaders... concerning the damaging and provocative''
farmers' blockades ''speaks volumes''.
<P>''I am surprised by the fact that the (opposition) leaders do not take a
stance concerning the inability of citizens to freely travel, particularly
on the eve of the Christmas holidays,'' Reppas said.
<P>The spokesman called on the farmers ''and all others who have the ability
to contribute to the unblocking of the roads'' to do so.
<P><H4>Simitis says he would never bow to `blackmail`</H4>
The government is not opposed to Greece's farmers but only to a few of them,
Prime Minister Costas Simitis was quoted yesterday as stating during an
interview with the popular monthly magazine &quot;Nitro&quot;. He said that he would
rather &quot;go home&quot; instead of bowing to protesting farmers' demands.
<P>&quot;There are millions of farmers in Greece but only 3,000 farmers have taken
the streets,&quot; Mr. Simitis said, sending a clear message to farmers
blockading the country's roads for 22 days, demanding higher subsidies,
lower taxes and cheaper fuel.
<P>&quot;My job is to spread the available money in a socially just way and that is
why we must struggle not to succumb to blackmail,&quot; he said.
<P>Mr. Simitis has rejected all demands, saying Greece had no money to give
and must catch up with its European Union partners.
<P><H4>Striking seamen escalate action</H4>
Striking seamen appeared determined to escalate their action which has
crippled ports around the country since Monday, in support of their demand
that the government does not go ahead with plans to abolish the special
fiscal status according to which their income is taxed.
<P>The Panhellenic Maritime Federation (PNO) originally called a 48-hour
strike beginning Monday, which was subsequently extended for two days and
then, yesterday, for a further 24 hours.
<P>At a press conference today, PNO general secretary Yiannis Chalas said ''we
will continue our strike which is still legal since provisional remedies
proceedings have not been initiated''.
<P>A Piraeus court ruled yesterday that the strike was illegal and asked the
PNO to immediately call off all protest action.
<P>''We do not accept coercion from the shipowning companies which are asking
Greek captains not only to carry on sailing vessels but also to impose
sanctions on striking seamen,'' Chalas said.
<P>After the press conference, striking seamen were to hold a protest rally
and march in Piraeus. The possibility of a meeting later today with
Merchant Marine Minister Stavros Soumakis remained open.
<P>Meanwhile, scores of passenger and car ferries remained at anchor at ports
around the country, with hundreds of trucks queuing up at quaysides and
frequent conflagrations between drivers and seamen.
<P>In a related development striking seamen and port police clashed today at
Igoumenitsa, western Greece, when the ferry-boat ''Brindisi'' tried to
leave carrying 50 lorries headed for the Italian port of the same
name.
<P>The clash took place on the ramp of the ferry-boat, from which one seaman
fell and was taken to a nearby hospital at Philiates.
<P>Another seaman climbed on to one of the vessel's mooring ropes in an effort
to prevent it leaving port, but fell into the sea. He too was taken to
hospital.
<P>The ''Brindisi'' finally managed to sail at 15.15 local time and the
situation at Igoumenitsa is said to be calm.
<P><H4>Karokis instructed to escape, says Government</H4>
The government said today that its ambassador in Peru had been instructed
''to use the opportunity given to him to escape'' from the Tupac Amaru
guerillas who are holding about 200 people hostage at the Japanese
ambassador's residence in Lima.
<P>''This was the message given to (Ambassador Alciviades) Karokis, when he
was a prisoner, through his wife,'' government spokesman Dimitris Reppas
said in reply to press questions.
<P>The Greek envoy was released by the guerillas along with three other
ambassadors to negotiate with the Peruvian government on their behalf.
<P>Karokis, like the ambassadors of Germany and France, did not return to the
embassy. Only the Canadian ambassador returned.
<P>Diplomatic sources said all the European diplomatic missions in Lima agreed
with the decision on the European ambassadors' getaway.
<P>Asked why Karokis did not play the role of mediator as requested by the
guerillas, Reppas replied that ambassadors are representatives of their
respective countries and ''the Greek government did not assign the role of
mediator to our envoy in Lima''.
<P>Reppas clarified that no request had been put to Greece to play some role
in the hostage crisis.
<P><H4>Cyprus plans to buy Russian missiles unhindered, says Athens</H4>
Greece said today that there was ''no problem'' in contacts between Cyprus
and Russia concerning Nicosia's plans to buy S-300 surface-to-air missiles
from Moscow in order to bolster its defence against air attack.
<P>Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas added that the S-300 was not an
''aggressive'' system and recalled a similar statement by Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
<P>Reppas made the statement when asked to comment on remarks by Turkish
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller who claimed that on her recent trip to Moscow,
she had received assurances that Russia would not go ahead with the sale
after beating her fist on the desk of Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin
four times.
<P>A Russian diplomat who was present at the Ciller-Chernomyrdin meeting later
categorically rejected that such assurances had been given.
<P><H4>Iraqis charged with stealing passports</H4>
Police and customs officers in Promachonas and Serres have arrested four
Iraqis who are alleged to have stolen 150 passports from public offices and
travel agencies in Belgium in 1993.
<P>The four were identified as Aziz Mohamed, 28, Hussein Sibik, 33, Hamid Siad,
28 and Rashid Halil, 34.
<P>All four tried to enter Greece on false passports from among those stolen
in Belgium but were arrested after Greek police were notified by Interpol.
<P>Although the four have not told the police what they did with the stolen
passports, informed sources said that they sold them to fellow Iraqis and
other Asians.
<P>The four Iraqis were due to appear before the public prosecutor in
Serres.
<P><H4>OECD forecasts 3 per cent growth in '97</H4>
Greece will have a growth rate near 3 per cent in 1997 but is in danger of
maintaining an increased public deficit, high inflation and unemployment as
well as a drop in competitiveness, an Organisation for Economic Cooperation

<P>The report noted that inflation stood at 8.5 per cent, higher than the
government's convergence target, while efforts to limit the public deficit
to 7.6 per cent of GDP in 1996 will be &quot;difficult to attain.&quot; Consequently,
the target of 4.2 per cent for 1997 is in danger of being missed, according
to the OECD, which estimates that the deficit is not expected to be reduced
by more than 1.5 per cent next year.
<P>The report also refers to &quot;uncertainties&quot; which exist concerning a
reduction in interest rates and the rate of de-escalation of inflation,
despite the declared intention of the government to persist with its &quot;hard
drachma&quot; policy.
<P><H4>Civil aviation strike suspended</H4>
Airport employees have suspended a 24-hour nationwide strike scheduled for
today, and all domestic and foreign flights will be carried out normally.
<P>The strike was called by the Federation of Civil Aviation Employee
Associations (OSYPA) demanding that four employee benefits be excluded from
the new scalary sale, an 8% salary increase and legislation of overtime and
holiday remuneration.
<P><H4>Bendit urges radical chane in anti-drug policies</H4>
Green Eurodeputy and former leftist firebrand Daniel con Bendit urged
adoption of a European Union anti-prohibition policy in relation to drug
substances and legalisation of so-called &quot;soft&quot; drugs, as well as the free
provision of &quot;hard&quot; ones or their sub stitutes under strict medical
control.
<P>Mr. Bendit made his proposal in a speech at the Athens Economic University
(ASOEE) yesterday.
<P>Mr. Bendit referred to official figures outlining the magnitude of the
development of the illegal drugs trade. Its annual turnover amounts to
$US500 billion, with the price of substances being 1,700 times greater than
their purchae value from Third World farmers.
<P>&quot;Mobilise as many armies as you like. Only 10 per cent of drug trafficking
is seized and the sole thing further prosecution will achieve is some sort
of an increase in the above percentage with, however, a parallel increase
in the price of drugs in the illegal trade as well,&quot; he said.
<P>&quot;The legalisation of 'soft' drugs and implementation of methadone
programmes is the sole solution for handling the problem,&quot; he said.
<P><H3>WEATHER</H3>
Rainfall from the western regions will gradually spread to the rest of the
country and the northern Aegean later in the day. Athens will be sunny
getting cloudy with possible rain at night with temperatures ranging from
10-16C. Thessaloniki will be partly cloudy with temperatures between 8-
13C.

<H4>Simitis to meet with farmers on Monday</H4>
The government announced today that Prime Minister Costas Simitis would
meet on Monday with the presidiums of the country's three biggest farmers'
labour unions.
<P>''Within the framework of dialogue concerning the problems facing Greek
agriculture, which must be held with the broadest possible participation,
the prime minister will meet on Monday with the presidiums of the
Panhellenic Confederation of Agricultural Cooperatives (PASEGES), the
General Confederation of Agricultural Associations (GESASE) and the
Democratic Confederation of Agricultural Associations (SYDASE),''
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said.
<P>The spokesman said that the meeting would take place at 14.30 local time,
adding that Simitis would also meet at 18.00 local time with the coordinating
committee representing farmers of Macedonia and Thrace.
<P>Simitis has persistently refused direct dialogue with the farmers for the
past three weeks, as their protests have blocked road and rail links
throughout the country, saying that dialogue was not possible under the
pressure of the blockades.
<P>In recent days however, farmers in numerous places around the country have
de-escalated their protest action, culminating yesterday in the decision of
the farmers of Macedonia and Thrace to lift all blockades until mid-January
when they will review the situation.
<P>In contrast, the Panthessaly Farmers' Coordinating Committee decided after
a four-hour meeting yesterday to ''continue the struggle'' and the
blockades of national and provincial highways in the greater region.
<P>Farmers in the Peloponnese are also continuing their blockade of the Patras-
Athens national road at Aigio.
<P>The Panthessaly committee meanwhile was expected today to decide whether to
allow people travelling on the occasion of the Christmas holiday to pass
the roadblocks or to harden their stance.
<P><H4>Parliament to vote on 1997 budget at midnight</H4>
Parliament will take a vote tonight on the 1997 state budget in a session
expected to be addressed among others by Prime Minister Costas Simitis and
the opposition party leaders.
<P>Voting on the budget will begin at midnight.
<P>Yesterday evening's budget debate in Parliament was marked by a renewed
clash between National Economy Minister Yiannos Papantoniou and main
oppositon New Democracy party leader Miltiades Evert on the issue of
absorption of European Union funds.
<P>Mr. Evert produced national economy ministry figures, claiming that funds
amounting to 1.85 trillion drachmas had been lost in the last three years.
The minister replied, acknowledging that funds had indeed been lost during
the first six months of the initiation of programmes, chiefly due to the
lack of planning by the previous New Democrcy government.
<P>He added that there was an upward rate in the absorption of funds, which
was 45 per cent in 1994, 70 per cent in 1995 and 100 per cent this year. He
reiterated that all available funds would be absorbed and that the
Thessaloniki metro and the Aheloos River diversion projects would be
implemented.
<P><H4>PNO calls off strike, ferry boats scheduled to sail</H4>
More than 15 passenger ferry boats were expected to sail from Piraeus until
the early morning hours, carrying more than 5,000 passengers and 2,000
trucks with goods to Aegean islands, Crete and the Dodecanese, after a
decision by the Panhellenic Seamen's Federation (PNO) last night to call
off their strike.
<P>PNO members had begun their strike on Monday, which affected all Greek-
flagged vessels throughout the world.
<P>Earlier, the finance ministry announced that it had committed itself to
finding a commonly acceptable decision with the seamen's union, the General
Confederation of Greek Workers (GSEE) and the Piraeus Labour Centre on
merchant marine issues, which will provide the basis for a debate in
Parliament.
<P>The announcement came after a meeting between Merchant Marine Minister
Stavros Soumakis, Finance Undersecretary Giorgos Drys, and other bodies
involved.
<P>The PNO originally called a 48-hour strike in support of their demand that
the government not proceed with plans to abolish seamen's special fiscal
status, according to which their income is taxed.
<P>It was subsequently extended for two days and then, yesterday, for a
further 24 hours.
<P>In a related development, a Piraeus court ruled Thursday that the strike
was illegal and asked the PNO to immediately call off all protest
action.
<P>&quot;We do not accept coercion from the shipowning companies which are asking
Greek captains not only to carry on sailing vessels but also to impose
sanctions on striking seamen,&quot; PNO general secretary Yiannis Halas
said.
<P><H4>Civil aviation strike suspended</H4>
Airport employees suspended a 24-hour nationwide strike scheduled for
yesterday, and all domestic and foreign flights were carried out normally.
<P>The strike was called by the Federation of Civil Aviation Employee
Associations (OSYPA) demanding that four employee benefits be excluded from
the new scalary sale, an 8.0 percent salary increase and legislation of
overtime and holiday remuneration.
<P><H4>More aggressive economic policy for Balkans, E. Europe considered</H4>
Development Minister Vasso Papandreou held a business summit at her own
initiative at the industry ministry yesterday, which was attended by
business leaders Vardis Vardinoyiannis, Sokratis Kokkalis, Dimitris
Kopelouzos and Spyros Latsis.
<P>The meeting focused on the government's plan to implement an aggressive
economic cooperation policy with Balkan and eastern European countries in
the sectors of industry and energy. In the framework of promoting the
government's plan, more meetings will be held with business representatives
and finalised decisions will be announced after an enlarged meeting
ischaired by Prime Minister Costas Simitis.
<P><H4>Gov't: Ambassador in Peru instructed not to return to guerillas</H4>
The government said yesterday that its ambassador in Peru had been
instructed &quot;to use the opportunity given to him to escape&quot; from the Tupac
Amaru guerrillas, who are still holding about 200 people hostage at the
Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima. &quot; This was the message given to
(Ambassador Alcibiades) Karokis, when he was a prisoner, through his wife,&quot;
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said in reply to press questions. The
Greek envoy was released by the guerrillas along with three other ambassad
ors to negotiate with the Peruvian government on their behalf. Mr. Karokis,
like the ambassadors of Germany and France, did not return to the
embassy. Only the Canadian ambassador returned. Diplomatic sources said
all the European diplomatic mission s in Lima agreed with the decision
on the European ambassadors' getaway. Asked why Mr. Karokis did not
play the role of mediator as requested by the guerrillas, Mr. Reppas
replied that ambassadors are representatives of their respective countries
and &quot;the Greek government did not assign the role of mediator to our envoy
in Lima.&quot;

<H4>Skopje, 20 December, 1996</H4>
<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> NEXT ROUND OF GREEK-MACEDONIAN NEGOTIATIONS DUE END OF JANUARY</H3>
Following the meeting of Greek Ambassador Christos Zacharakis and his
Macedonian counterpart Ivan Toshevski - under the auspices of Cyrus Vance -
in New York two days ago, the regular press briefing at the UN HQ merely
revealed the date for the subsequent encounter - the end of January
next year. Other details on the last round of Greek- Macedonian
negotiations on the name-issue have not been announced.
<P>Greek media, however, reported yesterday that Macedonian Ambassador Ivan
Toshevski - upon answering whether there was enough political will in his
country to adopt Constitutional changes regarding an alteration of name -
had given an affirmative reply. Ambassador Ivan Toshevski denied this
during an interview for A-1 TV, by correcting that he had actually said
that `there is political will in our country to arrive at a solution
benefiting both sides'. According to Ambassador Toshevski the last round of
negotiations went by in a positive atmosphere, though neither side had
proposed any references / names.
<P>In addition to this Athenian `Eskoussia' (according to `Makfax') reported
yesterday that negotiations mediator Cyrus Vance stated that he would not
return his mandate to the UN Security Council.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> FRENCH DEFENSE SECRETARY IN MACEDONIA THIS WEEK</H3>
The Secretary of Defense of the Republic of France, Charles Millon, is to
arrive on a two-day visit to Macedonia which is - according to `Makpress' -
to be marked by the ratification of a bilateral Defense Cooperation
Agreement.
<P>The paper should also cover staff exchange, particular in terms of training
Macedonian military personnel in France.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> NEWLY-APPOINTED DUTCH AMBASSADOR TO MACEDONIA COMMENCED HIS DUTIES
YESTERDAY</H3>
As of yesterday H.E.Amb. Henrich Heynen commenced his duties as Ambassador
of the Netherlands to Macedonia, by forwarding his accreditation to
Macedonian Head of State Kiro Gligorov.
<P>While welcoming the Dutch Ambassador, our President emphasized the
permanent support rendered by the Netherlands to Macedonia in its striving
for international affirmation, and the strengthening of its economy.
H.E.Amb. Heynen conveyed the best wishes for the country's prosperity, and
that of its people, by HRH. Queen Beatrix. Official records reveal that the
Dutch Ambassador stressed his country's intentions to intensify bilateral
cooperation.
<P>The newly-appointed Dutch Ambassador to Macedonia has also been received by
Parliamentary Chairman Tito Petkovski and PM Branko Crvenkovski.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> EVEN THE NEW BULGARIAN VICE-PRESIDENT HAS A `GOOD RELATION' WITH THE
MACEDONIAN AMBASSADOR</H3>
The first activity of the newly-elected Bulgarian Vice- President Todor
Karaldzhiev was to meet the Ambassador of the Republic of Macedonia to
Bulgaria, Gjorgji Spasov, as the Macedonian Radio reports. Within this
context the latter aired Karaldzhiev's statement on the informative
character of this meeting, as it dwelled on the latest Bulgarian
initiatives to overcome the so-called language-issue. It was revealed that
Karaldzhiev gave a `Zhelju Zheljev style' statement that Ambassador Spasov
did not require the services of an interpreter, as `he understood
everything'.
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> NEW TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM LINKING UP BULGARIA AND MACEDONIA
OPERATING</H3>
The international digital telecommunications system (signal transmission
via optical fibers), connecting Bulgaria and Macedonia, has commenced
operations after the opening ceremony held in Kriva Palanka and Kjustendil
yesterday.
<P>This communication system represents a component of the Trans-Albanian
Communication Line Project, providing a link- up of Italy, Albania,
Bulgaria, Turkey and Macedonia - as well as integration into other
international communication systems. The opening ceremonies in both cities
were attended by Macedonian Transport and Communications Secretary Dimitar
Buzleski and the Chairman of the Bulgarian Telecommunications and Postal
Services Committee Ljubomir Kolarov.
<P>According to representatives of both countries, Bulgaria and Macedonia are
the first states in the region to complete this telecommunications hook-up,
which actually is a segment of the setting up of the East-West corridor. As
it has been presented the overall length of this Trans-Balkan line from
Istanbul to Bari amounts to 1 600 km, whereas 435 km span across Macedonian
territory. The total capacity of the line amounts to 3 780 telephone
channels. The Ohrid - Tirana section is still under construction, whereas
the link-up between Bulgaria and Turkey is to be completed within a few
weeks' time.
<P>This is paralleled by contacts between Greece and SR Yugoslavia to the
already mentioned purpose. This should be conducive to a qualitatively new
mode in communicating between the countries of this region and Europe,
stated both sides after the ceremony staged to mark this occasion.
<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> BODIES OF CAPITAL AND SHORT-TERM STOCK EXCHANGE ESTABLISHED</H3>
The Council of the Capital and Short-Term Stock Exchange held its inaugural
session yesterday, during which Sashko Manakovski has been elected the
Charge D'Affairs Chairman of the Exchange - upon having obtained the
blessing of the NBM Governour previously. Other bodies of the exchange have
been established as well, such as those of the future
shareholding society which is to be headed by `Makedonska Stedilnica'
official Marjan Bojadzhiev... 10 banks and 7 savings institutions have
emerged as founders of the Exchange, whereas the Executive Board is
comprised of 11 members including one NBM representative, 2 financial
experts and 8 founder representatives. The Capital and Short-Term Stock
Exchange is due to begin operations after New Year's Eve holiday season,
with an initial capital of 85 000 DM. Preparations for this have spanned
over a longer period of time - as it had been stressed during yesterday's
session - and they have been supported by the NBM, the Macedonian
Government i.e. by Minister Vlado Naumovski, as well as by interested banks
and savings houses. In addition to this it was revealed that the Capital
and Short-Term Stock Exchange has been functioning unofficially so far, due
to the aid of the Economy Chamber of Skopje.
<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> `PHARE' COMMENCES LIEN PROGRAMME IN MACEDONIA</H3>
Yesterday the `Lien' Programme - as one of the PHARE programmes - was
presented in Skopje. Its main objective is to support economic and social
reforms in transitional countries. According to Macedonian Radio coverage
this presentation of the `Lien' Programme, about to cover
Macedonia as well, was organised by the Aid Coordination Unit within the
Macedonian Government. The Head of the PHARE Implementation Office,
Maurizio Locatelli emphasized upon presenting the PHARE Programme, that
throughout the past years 85 million ECU in funding in shape of medical aid
or industrial raw materials for Macedonia. With regards to the
`Lien' Programme Locatelli stressed that this programme has the task to
connect European NGOs, with the main objective to aid people in need,
people somehow marginalized by society. The Programme particularly targets
women who are unemployed due to health or social reasons, in addition to
other social groups such as unemployed generally speaking, individuals with
developmental difficulties, children without parents, homeless people, HIV-
positive persons and others requiring assistance. Funding via the `Lien'
Programme - as Locatelli stated - will be allocated according to strictly
codified criteria and terms.
<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</A> CONSTRUCTION WORKERS PICKETING MACEDONIAN GOVERNMENT</H3>
More than 500 construction workers of the `Mavrovo', `Ilinden', Tehnika
and Pelagonija contractors have been demonstrating in front of the
Macedonian Government premises for the past two days - demanding the
payment of income not received so far, as well as denar and hard currency
reimbursements of projects constructed abroad. `Mavrovo' employees have
been picketing their company HQ for 8 days prior to this. They have been
advised by General Director Goshev to return to their work as the October
pay has been forwarded. The `Mavrovians' however consider this solution
insufficient, thus that their demands will be submitted to PM Branko
Crvenkovski personally today.
<P>Miners of the `Sasa' Mining Enterprises in Makedonska Kamenica commenced
their strike in front of the company's HQ, demanding a rise in pay by 50%,
a change of the Director and the Management as well as the improvement of
working conditions. The Director of `Sasa' stated that the first
demand cannot be met as the `treasury' is empty.
<P>Concordant to previous announcements, a march of the Federation of
Independent Trade Unions is scheduled for today in Skopje, in order to
pressure the Government into resolving accumulated economic and social
problems. The march's final destination is the Government / Parliament
Building, and participants will include the Trade Unions of Taxi-Drivers
and Independent Truckers.
<H3><A NAME="09">[09]</A> CHAIRMAN OF SKOPJE CITY COUNCIL NOT YET DETERMINED</H3>
The Inaugural Session of the Skopje City Council has been scheduled for
today, and as media report the election of a chairperson remains highly
unpredictable due to the equal representation of forces within the Council.
A-1 TV obtained unofficial data based on which the IMRO-DPMNE &amp; DP
coalition has been strengthened by three LP counsellors who are most
likely to propose incumbent Jovan Kekenovski as their candidate. Off the
record this coalition has succeeded in procuring 12 votes in their favour,
but a reliable source claims that they are short of one vote to secure the
election. Therefore A-1 TV states that the PDPA vote is most likely to be
decisive.
<P>Besides this media report the setting up of several municipal councils
throughout the country. In Ohrid the Council is chaired by Lambe Arnaudov

<H3><A NAME="10">[10]</A> JUDGES RESPOND TO OPPOSITION ALLEGATIONS</H3>
With respect to objections aired on the work of judges involved in Election
Commissions and therefore the conducting of local elections by political
parties, the Executive Board of the Macedonian Judges' Association has
released the following statement which - among other things - claims that:
`In order to maintain the dignity of our profession, we consider these
assaults insinuations brought forward to discredit judges and subsequently
the judicial system, n order to improve one's own rating.
<P>The statement furthermore confirms the statutory and objective approach of
judges, compliant to the Constitutions and other acts of law - devoid of
the subjugation of any sort of pressure, ideologies and policies for the
sake of one purpose only: the ensuring that the Republic of
Macedonia operates and survives as a legal state.
<H3><A NAME="11">[11]</A> ALBANIAN STUDENTS OF PEDAGOGICAL FACULTY DEMANDING RESIGNATION OF DEAN
AND SECRETARY</H3>
As it is known the Albanian students of the Pedagogical Faculty of Skopje
have been boycotting lectures for several months, demanding entire
instruction in Albanian which is not the case presently. Even the
Macedonian Government has recently addressed their demands, evaluating them
as justified - whereas the Dean of the Faculty adheres to his
viewpoint to abide by legal provisions and the Constitution.
<P>MTV reports that Albanian students have augmented their list of demands by
requesting the resignation of both the Faculty's Dean and the Secretary.
According to faculty authorities the entire issue should be settled with
the enactment of the new law, currently still being debated. The
Dean claims that a certain part of Albanian students have re-commenced
their studies, and some of them have even entered the Students' Body at the
Pedagogical Faculty.
<H3><A NAME="12">[12]</A> SCIENTIFIC GATHERING DEDICATED TO CINC MIHAJLO APOSTOLSKI</H3>
On the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of Mihajlo Apostolski's (Commander-
in-Chief of the National Liberation Forces of Macedonia during WW 2) birth,
the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts (MANU) and the Institute of
National History staged a two-day scientific gathering on `The HQ of the
Macedonian Liberation War and POM from 1941 - 1945'. The event opening was
attended by President Kiro Gligorov and other high-ranking government
officials, eminent public personalities, etc. The opening declaration
itself was delivered by MANU Chairman Ksente Bogoev. This was entailed by
the analysis of the National Liberation War in Macedonia from several
differing perspectives.
<P><H3><A NAME="SUPPL">MILS SUPPLEMENT</A></H3>
<H3><A NAME="13">[13]</A> `Who Nurtures Evil Presentiments Regarding Macedonia?'</H3>
<H4>(`Nova Makedonija' - 19th December 1996)</H4>
<P>Henry Kissinger does not believe a new Balkan war is about to erupt, but
the Sofia paper `Standard' remains nevertheless `worried' about the fate of
Macedonia. The current situation in the country does not provide a
foundation for the resuscitation of such dark prophesies... is the opinion
of the MOD.
<P>It has not occurred for the first time, throughout these five years of
independence, that Macedonia has been prophesied a cataclysmic fate... It
appears that these days this has once again become the favourite pastime of
certain Bulgarian papers, headed by `Standard' which engages in this
most assertively. Using the recent interview given by former US Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger for the Zagreb paper `Globus', the Sofia paper has
spent days in speculating on different scenarios depicting the eruption of
a new Balkan war over Macedonia, instigated by separatist tendencies of
the Albanian population, drawing in Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece and Albania.
The outcome of this conflict is to be the genesis of an Albanian state on
the territory of Macedonia, whereas the remnant of the latter will incline
itself towards Serbia rather than `towards Bulgaria' which cannot
entail any guarantee that Sofia and Athens will remain quiet without having
their share of the cake'. In order to not leave this matter supported on
Kissinger's theses alone, the paper resorts to quoting a larger number of
both domestic and foreign - named and anonymous - diplomats and experts
for which, with but a few exceptions, the war over the new division of
Macedonia is just about to commence.
<P>Such tremendous concern on Macedonia's fate would even be touching had its
foundation - the statements given by Kissinger - not been distorted into
their antonyms. What has Kissinger actually said throughout his interview
for `Globus'? From a total of 20 questions constituting this
interview merely the last two referred to Macedonia directly. Both of them
are given subsequently, with their replies:
What will happen should war break out in Macedonia?
<P>`Such a conflict would most probably involve Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria and
Albania.'
<P>Do you consider this possible conflict more threatening than the Bosnian
one?
<P>`This conflict would indeed be far more dangerous. It would represent a
typically tragic Balkan war. I therefore think that the United States of
America are required to do everything they can to prevent the eruption of
such a conflict. I do not believe that this war will break out.
<P>Should the situation, however, deteriorate and a crisis emerge, the United
States would show its power. We have a very particular interest in
preserving the East wing of NATO from disintegrating.'
<P>All this indicates quite clearly that - first and foremost - the statements
of the US diplomat on Macedonia have practically been extorted by
journalists' queries, and that - secondly - Kissinger personally does `not
believe this war will break out. According to this the imminent Balkan war
over the division of Macedonia is not being predicted - as Sofia `Standard'
claims - by Kissinger but by the Bulgarian press. Why? What sort of
interest could anyone in neighbouring Bulgaria - country immersed into
political, economic and ethic bankruptcy - have in the disappearance of
Macedonia amidst the turmoils of a new - even bloodier - Balkan war than
the Bosnian one... a war which would inevitably involve Bulgaria?
<P>A high-ranking MOD official, when asked to comment upon the coverage by the
Bulgarian press, reminded of the fact that this is not the first instance
of media predicting `death and damnation' for Macedonia whereas these
predictions have never come true so far. The current situation in Macedonia,
according to this official, provides no ground whatsoever to renew such
prophesies: `The Republic of Macedonia has secured equal ranking within the
international community, it is successfully completing transformation
procedures within the political and economic system, it has made a giant
step forwards in terms of democratizing society, it has
considerably fortified its security position through a constructive
internal and foreign policy - policy of international tolerance and
conflict resolution through state institutions; as well as by the
subsequent construction of a defense system and the permanent
increasing of the ARM combat readiness by integration and active
participation within the `PFP' Programme and by the exceptionally fruitful
bilateral cooperation concerning the subject of defense with NATO and EU
member-states.' All this, our source continues, does not apply to some
neighbouring countries as - for example - Bulgaria. `It is not the first
time that a neighbouring country experiencing tremendous interior unrest,
attempts to divert the attention of its citizens outwards, towards a
foreign threat to their internal peace and stability, away form the threat
within.
<P>All such attempts only postpone the resolving of internal problems which
could explode and transcend into sources endangering peace and stability
within the entire region', reveals this source.
<P>If this phenomenon refers to Bulgaria only, an explication of this kind
would be sufficient. Augmenting the latter with a fact beyond the dignity
of an MOD state official, but not beyond that of a journalist: the latest
rekindling of dreams on a new division of Macedonia might also serve as an
efficient ethic `aqua vitae' to the Bulgarian Armed Forces in terms of a
national notion. There are, nevertheless, strong indicators to the
suspicion that this is not only being done in the `interest' of Bulgarias
preparation of the terrain for the `sixth Balkan conflict of the century'.
<P>The mere fact that Bulgarian press has devoured the `War in Macedonia'
issue, using and distorting Kissingers statements (i.e. those of a foreign
diplomat) throughout the process - in addition to the three-year-old
prophecies of yet another foreigner, Zbygnjew Bzhezhinsky, on the very
same subject and the forecasts of several other anonymous foreign diplomats
denotes the possible new war as not a `Balkan' conflict but a war on
Balkan territory in advance. As had been the case with the Bosnian war,
according to analyses. The existence of `third', non-Balkan interest in yet
another `Balkan' conflict can indeed not be obscured even by `Standard'.
The notion of a sixth Balkan war in the 20th century, states this paper
upon quoting a Bulgarian MOD expert by the name of a certain Maria
Chavdarova, has been fathered forth as early as 1993 in the USA; whereas
two years later during an international conference in Sofia it had been
explained in detail by an American scientific research worker through his
speech on `Preventing the Sixth Balkan War in the 20th Century'.
<P>Interesting, and on the existence of a third i.e. external `stake' rather
indicative, is the comment of this expert that the USA has been studying
the armed conflicts in the Balkans as early as 1992. `They impose the will
and zeal of a super-power based on their interests. The objective is
clear: a cold, cruel and most efficient completion of extracting out
advantages of the Cold War, in order to fill in voids within the Balkan
region created by Russia', says Chavdarova. According to her the US have
two means at their disposal to achieve this interest of theirs: genuine
weapons and the media. `Papers, satellites and the entire universe
revolve around American interests', are her words - and she rounds up
wisely by using another person's thought that `in a war of media, the first
casualty is truth'.
<P>What remains to be said, in this sense, on the media war almost
continuously waged against Macedonia, not only by `Standard' but other
Bulgarian papers as well? Whose interests do they `cater for'? Certainly
not those of Bulgaria; a country undergoing such deep political, economic
and ethic crises. It is certainly not to benefit of the heating up of yet
another - a mental crisis, i.e. the (self- ) deception of its own populus
that others in the neighbourhood are doing even worse; or the notion that
stirring up trouble abroad will remedy domestic ones...

<H4>Skopje, 19 December, 1996</H4>
<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> MAX VAN DER STUHL: 'ALL ETHNIC GROUPS INTERESTED IN STABILITY OF THE
COUNTRY'</H3>
The round table on 'Building Harmonious Inter-Ethnic Relations in
Macedonia' taking place in Skopje behind closed doors throughout the past
two days, under the auspices of the OSCE, caused a quite considerable
reaction and puzzledness among the public. Within this context OSCE
Minority Issues High Commissioner Max Van Der Stuhl issued this statement
yesterday: 'The Round Table provided an impetus for interaction on a
series of issues relevant to all different ethnic groups living in
Macedonia, and not in order to make any concrete recommendations - or adopt
any formal conclusions. It is my impression that all ethnic groups have an
interest in maintaining stability in the country. This Round Table
concentrated focused on the Albanian issue in Macedonia, particularly with
respect to the education system. Those invited to attend included
representatives of the Macedonian Parliament, the Government, Academic
circles and the Opposition - and the meeting was closed to the public as I
considered this practical and efficient.' During yesterday's press
conference Van Der Stuhl also emphasized that parties not represented
within the Macedonian Parliament had been invited, as well as that the
Albanian parties PDPA and NDP - though invited - had not attended the
meeting.
<P>Upon answering questions by the press, Van Der Stuhl expressed favourable
opinions regarding the Gligorov initiative on a Comparative Study of the
position of minorities in the Balkans while meeting the President, as
well as that questionnaires for all OSCE countries are being compiled -
especially on issues like language and education.
<P>In addition to this media report that the two-day Round table had been
attended by Foreign Secretary Ljubomir Frchkovski, Education and PE
Minister Sofija Todorova, Justice Secretary Vlado Popovski, PDP Chairman
Abduraham Aliti, Chair of the Albanian Writers' Association Ali
Aliu, the Secretary of the Tetovo Municipal Council Vulnet Kaloshi as well
as by the OSCE National Minorities High Commissioner Max Van Der Stuhl, the
Political Director of the Council of Europe Fuller and the Deputy of Gerd
Ahrens of the Conference on Former Yugoslavia Martin Lutz.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> RADIO TIRANA: 'THE UNIVERSITY OF TETOVO' CENTRAL THEMATIC FOCUS
OF THE SKOPJE ROUND TABLE</H3>
Radio Tirana broadcast its own information regarding the two-day Round
Table of Skopje yesterday, according to which 'The University of
Tetovo' was one of the main issues that had been discussed. A-1 TV quotes
Radio Tirana on airing that during this event - chaired by OSCE
Minority High Commissioner Max Van Der Stuhl - this issue had been analysed
within the context of the overall position of Albanians in Macedonia, i.e.
their rights in general.
<P>Radio Tirana furthermore informed of a festivity held to mark the 2nd
Anniversary of the 'Tetovo University' held two days ago, attended by
representatives of all Albanian parties in the country and the Albanian
Ambassador to Macedonia.
<P>'Dnevnik' reports that the Albanian radio underlined the unanimous
attitude assumed by all Albanian parties in Macedonia regarding the
'Tetovo University', which 'the Government refuses to recognise due
to possible misunderstandings with nationalist Macedonian parties'.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> NAME NEGOTIATIONS STILL DEADLOCKED</H3>
Based on information released by 'Makpress' the Ambassadors of Greece
and Macedonia - Christos Zacharakis and Ivan Toshevski - led the last round
of negotiations on the name-issue under the auspices of Cyrus Vance at New
York yesterday morning. By quoting Greek sources in New York the above
named agency reported that both sides firmly adhered to their viewpoints,
without discussing any alteration of the reference used within the UN for
Macedonia. A-1 TV reveals that both sides had been cautious throughout
negotiations due to the fact that with the ascension of the new UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan the mandate of mediator Cyrus Vance becomes
rather indefinite - as he had been appointed by the previous UN
Secretary-General Butros-Ghali. Due to this, 'Vecher' claims, it has
been insisted on denoting yesterday's talks as an 'informal
meeting'... This reference is to be used until the official appointment
of the mediator. New York sources state that this should again be Cyrus
Vance.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> BULGARIAN SIDE LOOKS TO SETTLE LANGUAGE-ISSUE WITH MACEDONIA</H3>
MTV reports that the improving of relations with Macedonia and the
determining of an option conducive to the ratification of 12 bilateral
cooperation agreements had been the main topics of discussion at the
Session of the Bulgarian Consulting Council on National Security. The
follow-up contained a recommendation to the Bulgarian Government to
continue looking for a solution to the language-issue with respect to
Macedonia. According to MTV the Deputy Foreign Secretary of Bulgaria Irina
Bokova stated that a solution to the problem would have to suit
both sides - adding that so far the Bulgarian viewpoint on this question
had not changed in a substantial manner.
<P>Based on the Sofia newspaper 'Duma' this consultative meeting followed
talks between Bulgarian Head of State Zhelju Zhelev and his Macedonian
counterpart Kiro Gligorov during the Lisbon Summit.
<P>Another Sofia newspaper - 'Trud' claims that one of the five proposal-
solutions to the language-issue with Skopje recommends the ratification of
agreements in both official languages - concordant to Articles # 3 and 7 of
the Constitutions of Bulgaria and Macedonia. The paper also
lists another variant of signing the papers in English or any other
international language, with corresponding translations into the official
languages of both sides.
<P>'Trud' furthermore claims that two authors form Skopje 'tore down the
Berlin Wall concerning this language-issue' by promoting their books at
the National Library of Bulgaria. The paper reveals that the books in
question are 'Heating Up Yesterday's Lunch' by Mile Nedelkovski and
'The Macedonian Faust' by Mladen Srbinovski, which have been published
with the assistance of the 'Trud' Publishing Firm and the Bulgarian
Ministry of Culture.
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> ON TENSIONS BETWEEN THE SERBIAN AND MACEDONIAN ORTHODOX CHURCHES</H3>
Yesterday the Macedonian Ambassador at Ankara, H.E.Amb. Trajan Petrovski, has been received by the Patriarch of the 'Fener' Patriarchate of Istanbul, Bartholomew I.
<P>Discussions focused on current issues in the Balkans, and on questions
linked to the activities of Orthodox churches and religious institutions.
Patriarch Bartholomew I. - as MTV reports - has stressed among other things
that it is of particular significance to further relations between
Orthodox churches that tensions between the Serbian and Macedonian Orthodox
churches be resolved.
<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> CONGRATULATIONS TO THE NEW 'UN' SECRETARY-GENERAL</H3>
Macedonian Head of State Kiro Gligorov congratulated Kofi Annan upon his
recent election for UN Secretary-General, wishing him success in carrying
out this highly- responsible function. The congratulatory note mentions
past meetings of Kofi Annan and Kiro Gligorov, as well as the visits of the
former to the Republic of Macedonia. He also underlined Kofi Annan's
commitment to peace and global cooperation, his highly-professional
qualities and his friendly sentiments towards the Republic of Macedonia.
<P>In this context the Macedonian President also invited the new UN Secretary-
General to an official visit of Macedonia. Congratulations have also been
forwarded by the Macedonian Foreign Secretary Ljubomir Frchkovski.
<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> NO APPREHENSION WITHOUT COURT ORDER</H3>
The Law on Criminal Prosecution Procedures - submitted to parliamentary
discussion as of yesterday - is to impede the forceful apprehension of
citizens by the police. This was revealed yesterday by Justice Secretary
Vlado Popovski in front of the assembled MPs, adding that such a legal
provision is concordant to both the suggestions aired by the Council of
Europe and the regulations codified by the Constitutional Court of
Macedonia, stating that nobody is to be apprehended and taken to the police
station without a court order. Minister Popovski also revealed that the
much contested clause on apprehension during investigation, which had been
part of the previous version of this act of law, has been omitted as it had
been concluded that provisions on 90 days imprisonment would
generate an negative impact on crime prevention. Therefore this issue is to
resolved through enacting a Constitutional Amendment. Yesterday MPs
completed the general debate, whereas the subsequent discussion on its
amendments and the putting it to a vote had to be postponed as a
'quorum' could not be provided. The only address. within the debate
stage had been delivered by PDP representative Mersim Biljali who stressed
that the law offered significant positive changes in terms of human
rights and liberties. One such alteration to the better is the provision
granting the right to the accused to speak in his native language during
criminal prosecution procedures.
<P>Yesterday the Parliament also voted in favour of the ratification of five
international agreements, four of which are bilateral ones with SR
Yugoslavia. With regards to the bilateral Agreement on International
Traffic between both countries, MPs pointed out that Belgrade
imposed too high pay toll and travel charges. Thus the Traffic Minister
stated that the Macedonian Government had already requested a reducing of
the same for Macedonian transports, in addition to an increasing of
transport contingencies on permits.
<P>Media furthermore report that Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov is to
address all MPs at the Session scheduled for 24th December, and to rapport
on his work. The same Session will also be marked by discussions on the
'97 Budget of Macedonia.
<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</A> NEW PRICES OF OIL DERIVATIVES DO NOT GUARANTEE PROFITABILITY OF
'OKTA' REFINERY</H3>
The raising of oil prices by 14% will not entail economic profitability of
the Skopje-based 'OKTA' refinery - stated its General Director
Zhantevski yesterday. He revealed that the refinery, which had stopped its
production several months ago, had demanded the increasing of oil
derivative prices in correlation to world market rates - which is not being
achieved by this latest measure. It was also mentioned that due to this
disparity of prices the refinery had lost 14 million dollars in profit last
year.
<P>For A-1 TV Zhantevski revealed that 'OKTA' will maintain its
production until the middle of next month.
<P>According to Finance Minister Taki Fiti this raising of oil derivative
prices is to affect inflation by app. 0.5% which is not to upset the global
macro-economic frame work. For MTV Fiti stated that this increase of prices
has been matched by a certain reduction of tax - in order to
control the height of the prices of final products.
<H3><A NAME="09">[09]</A> MACEDONIAN ECONOMY REQUIRES FRESH CAPITAL AND SECURE MATERIAL BALANCES</H3>
Macedonian businessmen have no divergent strategies from those of the
Government concerning economic policy.
<P>However, they think that our economy needs fresh capital and secure
material balances. Achieving stability is a fundamental prerequisite to
reach expected results regarding all procedures of subvencive production.
This has been stressed during yesterday's Session of the
Economy Chamber of Macedonia. Businessmen assessed unanimously that
Macedonia requires an open economy concordant to European standards and
quality, to be developed through loyal competition.
<P>It has also been registered that the overall export by Macedonian
firms has suffered a plunge by 30% throughout the first 8 months this
year, compared to last year. Import has been reduced by 3.5%. The only
positive export trend registered (by app. 17%) referred to export into
the former constituents of the Yugoslav Federation. As Development
Minister Abdulmenaf Bedzheti pointed out the draft-budget for '97
allocates 60 million dollars to the support of economic projects with
an export-orientation.
<P>In order to achieve an increase of the GNP by 5% - as prescribed within the
macro-economic policy of '97 - and to avoid an inflation rate between 10
and 15% it will become prerequisite to conduct a more relaxed credit,
monetary, customs duty and interest rate policy throughout the following
year... several businessmen concluded yesterday.
<H3><A NAME="10">[10]</A> RESEARCH OF NATIONAL STATISTICS INSTITUTE ON (UN)EMPLOYMENT IN THE
COUNTRY</H3>
In April '96 the labour force in the Republic of Macedonia amounted to
780 419, of which 533 441 are employed, and 246 978 are not. These data
were revealed by the National Institute of Statistics yesterday, based upon
its recently conducted study on this issue in Macedonia. Research has
also shown that most of the employed (14.93%) are aged between 35 and 39
years, whereas the majority of unemployed people belongs to the age group
from 20 to 24.
<P>According to this study most of the former category possess a degree on
completed secondary education (36.6%) and elementary education (qualified &amp;
unqualified workers) amounted to 44.6%. The latter category is comprised of
10.3% with a tertiary education diploma; and 45% of this total have been
unemployed for 4 years and more. The majority of such cases varies between
the age of 25 and 34. Data also indicates that employment rates covering
the taken time frame have suffered by 4% compared to last
year, whereas the number of people working abroad has increased by 13.6%.
<P>In April this year 32.46% received a net-income between 5 000 and 8 000
denars, 19.5% between 8 000 and 12 000 denars and only 0.43% an average of
40 000 denars or more.
<H3><A NAME="11">[11]</A> CONSTITUTIONAL COURT: 'PARLIAMENTARY DECISION NOT INFRINGING UPON
HUMAN RIGHTS'</H3>
The Parliamentary Decision passed on 4th June against the civic initiative
for early parliamentary elections in Macedonia does not represent any sort
of limitation of human rights... this ruling has been brought on by the
Constitutional Court of Macedonia yesterday, overruling the initiative of
former mayor of Skopje Jove Kekenovski who claims that this decision
violated the right on political association and action by Macedonian
citizens.
<H3><A NAME="12">[12]</A> IMRO-DPMNE: 'SDSM' ATTEMPTING TO EXHAUST VOTERS</H3>
It is the objective of the SDSM and government structures to permanently
repeat voting at municipalities where the opposition is in the lead. This
is being supported by the fact that objections had been submitted by the
SDSM at units where the opposition candidate has a minimum lead...
<P>This has been said by IMRO-DPMNE spokesperson Dragi Ivanovski at
yesterday's press conference, who added that the annulment of elections
in East Macedonia, i.e. a region where outcomes favour the opposition, is
being conducted in order to wear down the electorate.
<P>IMRO-DPMNE representatives have also emphasized that they had received
numerous complaints by municipal party committees, especially with respect
to the annulment proclaimed by the Courts of Appeals in Shtip and Skopje.
<P>'Those judges who are active members or affiliates - i.e. disciples - of
the SDSM supervise elections within commissions at several municipalities',
the IMRO-DPMNE pointed out yesterday. Examples to support this were
elections at Bogdanci, Probishtip and Radovish.

<H3><A NAME="13">[13]</A> 'Contingents goodbye!'</H3>
<H4>('Vecher', 17th December 1996)</H4>
<P>These days the Macedonian Government has approved 'Makpetrol' the
import of a certain amount of oil derivatives. This import will be realised
by the end of 31st December and according to the predications it should
satisfy all the customer needs in the country until 15-th January next
year. This refers to the import of 26.000 tons of petrol-98, 2.800 tons of
petrol-96, 2.000 tons of petrol without lead, 11.000 tons diesel -2, 10.000
tons of extra light petroleum, 2.000 tons kerosene, 2.500 tons
butane - propane and 30.000 tons of petroleum jelly.
<P>This amount of oil derivatives will be imported by 'Makpetrol' with
appliance of the import regime through 'contingents' which are approved
by the Foreign Affairs Ministry because on 1st January the new regime is
put into effect which understands giving 'consent' from the
Economy Ministry. In fact, this refers to realisation of the Government
Provision for Liberalisation of the Foreign Trade
by which a special attention is placed on the oil derivatives import and
export.
<P>The expectations from the new export-import regime are great, taking into
consideration the difficulties our country had in the derivatives trading
for the last few months which were resulting from several factors. Firstly,
starting from the time when the 'contingents' were introduced, the
Government commanded a payment of custom duty for the imported derivatives
amounting from 20 to 25% depending on the type of derivative while for the
unrefined petrolum continued the regime of free import with only 1% duty
payment.
<P>According to the manager of the Head Office for petroleum and petroleum
derivatives within 'Makpetrol' Milan Sotirovski with this situation in
the country an unbalance appeared in the derivatives with petrol deficit
and diesel sufficit. That's why 'Makpetrol' and the OKTA Refinery
reacted before the Government wishing to amortise the unbalance.
<P>Officials from these two firms stand behind the attitude that with
derivative import the disparity will be overcome but also that the import
should be realised under the same terms as the unrefined petroleum import.
Taking into consideration that 40% of the OKTA production goes on the
petroleum jelly due to the unbalance it turned out that the high price of
the petroleum at the world market is just a portion of the problem that our
oil-men faced.
<P>The Government met the demands of 'Makpetrol' and OKTA and approved
import but not of the amounts they demanded, most probably believing that
the world price of the petroleum will be stabilised. Regarding this, as
things are going at the moment, it seems that nothing is
changing. Namely, the day before yesterday the petroleum cost over 23
dollars per barrel at the world market which is considerably more than the
17 dollars on which the OKTA production is 'tuned in'. This time the
petroleum price is approaching the roof, above all, due to the Iraqi
inclusion into the world trade with petroleum and due to the recent
creation of large companies.
<P>- 'We are heavily burdened by the transport price because we are a
continental country. At the moment we are making maximal efforts to
continue providing the economy with the necessary fuels being aware that
any possible rise in the prices will be a blow to the economy because it
has already found itself in a very bad situation. However, it
is uncertain how long we will last with these prices' , says Sotirovski.
<P>Regarding the bank deposit of 3 million DM - which in accordance with the
Liberalisation Provision shall have to deposit every importer - it is
introduced in order to give guarantee that the import will really be
realised and besides this it partly presents a guarantee that the taxes
will be paid. The fact that the cited amount is quite high in fact brings
in surety that the future import will no longer be provisional i.e. it will
stop the illegal trade. With the current intensity of import
'Makpetrol' can always count on one week's accumulation which is
enough for a normal suppliant of the market and there is also the
possibility of using the storage premises of the foreign countries that are
at our disposal.
<P>-Possibly, says Sotirovski, problems may arise from the strike of the Greek
custom officers who announced to join the already striking farmers. In that
case we could find ourselves in a situation of not being able to import the
complete contingent of fuels which had been granted to us by the Government
with the time limit being the 31st of this December. But this should not
present any impeding problem in the impor. In that case we expect the
Government to prolong our decisions.
<P>Regarding certain information according to which there are possibilities to
see the world-wide known 'Shell' in our region 'Makpetrol' has the
following attitude: if 'Shell' comes into our republic the petroleum
derivatives market in the country will become even more stable and the
rivalry will make 'Makpetrol' work with a better quality.
<P>Otherwise, 'Makpetrol' has already made contacts with many oil
companies all around the world for possible mutual investments. The only
problem will present procuring security of the capitals invested - a
prerequisite required by the foreign governments. In any case, the
foreign firms are mainly interested in investing into the more frequent
town gas stations. If the legal regulation procures guarantee for the
invested capital the foreign presence will be welcome anyway.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> GREEK-MACEDONIAN NEGOTIATIONS POSTPONED</H3>
Macedonian and Greek ambassadors Ivan Toshevski and Hristos Zaharakis
yesterday did not have the appointed meeting in New York and the media
report that the date for a new round of talks will additionally be
established.
<P>According to A-1 TV the spokesman of the mediator in the talks Saurus Vens
stated that the mediator will propose change in the reference with which
Macedonia is addressed in the UN of which there have been speculations in
the media these days.
<P>The Greek media have not reported the postponed round of Greek-Macedonian
talks as they usually do, reports the `Makfaks' agency explaining this with
the wave of strikes in Greece. However the reason for the Greek media's
silence might also be the possible movement upon the question about the
name differences. At such a comment pointed the article published in the
conservative Athens paper `Katimerini' where the name dispute is assessed
as a mistake of the foreign politics which has condemned Greece
to senseless exhaustion due to `a proportional second degree issue'.
According to `Katimerini the solution may already have been found and it
cites that it will most probably be one official name for all international
uses and that only Greece will call Macedonia by a name
dictated to them by their patriotism. Maybe the solution is at hand but now
there is search for a formula to decrease the politic price of accepting
the resolution which was announced since the beginning of the dispute,
concludes `Katimerini'.
<P>Regarding the Greek-Macedonian relations the Macedonia media yesterday
pointed out the letter from the Greek Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos
who sent an invitation to his Macedonian colleague Minister Slobodan
Unkovski to participate in the solemn inauguration of Thessaloniki as the
European capital of culture in the following 1997. The invitation sent
through the Macedonian Liaison Department in Athens cites that the
manifestation will be of a Balkans dimension with a possible meeting of the
Culture ministers of the Balkans states which will deal with establishing a
Balkans culture net. The Greek Minister Venizelos cited in the invitation
that in the context of the Temporary Resolution in New York the
participation of Macedonia is of great significance both on bilateral and
Balkans level.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> MACEDONIAN-ALBANIAN DIALOGUE IN OSCE ORGANIZATION COMMENCED</H3>
In the `Kontinental' Hotel in Skopje yesterday commenced the two-day round
table on the subject `Building up harmonious inter-ethnic relations in
Macedonia' the initiator of which is the OSCE commissary for minorities
issues Maks Van Der Schtul. The media report that the suggestion for this
round table give by MR. Schtul was accepted by the Macedonian Government
while the Foreign Affairs Ministry appears as co-organiser. The two-day
Macedonian-Albanian dialogue is closed to the public and is divided in
three sessions in which introductory speakers will be one Macedonian and
one Albanian. The final word at the round table should be given by the
commissary Maks Van Der Schtul. Among the participants in the discussion
are the ministers Ljubomir Frchkovski, Vlado Popovski, Sofia Todorova,
Naser Ziberi and the leaders of the Liberal party Stojan Andov and the PDP
Abdurahman Aliti.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> ETHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION AT THE OSCE ROUND TABLE</H3>
Regarding the round table meeting on the subject `Building up harmonious
inter-ethnic relation in Macedonia' yesterday there was a reaction on the
part of the Ethnology Association which expressed protest assessing
that the round table has been organized incognito. `The round table has
been organized under a great pressure and demand on part of the political
parties of Albanian nationality in Macedonia and Albania directly which
openly stands in service of the Great-Albanian secessionism. The
paper `Fljaka e Vlazerimit' reports that in this unusual closed meeting
participate chosen Macedonian and Albanians and the itinerary covers issues
from the field of Albanian education and the usage of the Albanian language
in public life in the country an other serious inter-ethnic issues.
<P>We regret that not even one representative form the Macedonian ethnologist
was invited yet the ethno-political relations in our country will be
discussed dictated by the Albanian political subject.'
<P>The protest by the EAM Presidency further cites that with the issues
discussed behind closed doors the European political representatives
consciously or unconsciously impose partnership on Macedonia which carries
a fatal out- come
for the Macedonian ethnic region in all living areas in the country with
great consequences for the peace in the Balkans and wider.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> SOFIA `STANDARD' - MACEDONIA IN WAR WINDSTORM</H3>
After the statement given by the former State Secretary Henry Kissinger
that Macedonia is endangered by war the Sofia `Standard' reports
estimations from foreign diplomats that the situation in Macedonia is quite
intense and the US predict a new Balkans war. `Makpres' reports,
in the text titled as 'The Albanians in Macedonia create their own state
Ilirida' calling upon anonymous politicologists `Standard' emphasizes that
the real factor for a conflict in the Balkans are the Albanians in
Macedonia and Kosovo. The Albanian population in west Macedonia is very
separatist, claims the paper and adds: `They want to separate and join
Albania or Kosovo. The Albanian leader do not hide their wishes to create
their own federation in Macedonia in which they will get
autonomy leading towards creating a state `Ilirida'.  Citing this
`Standard' assesses that in that case the remaining part of Macedonia will
most probably gravitate towards Serbia not towards Bulgaria.
<P>`Standard', according to Makpres agency, in the same issue published the
statement of Marija Chavdarova - expert in the Bulgarian Defense Ministry -
who points out that the idea of a 6th war in the Balkans in the 20th
century had been begotten in the summer of 93 in the Institute for National
Strategic Researches by the University for National Defense of the US. She
also pointed out that the US have been dealing with the Balkans
war conflicts since 1992 .
<P>The complete war screenplay has bee published by Jeffrey Simon - expert and
researcher - in the material `Prevention of a 6th war in the Balkans in the
20th century', reports the Sofia paper. According to Simon the
current panicking situation in Serbia should light the fuse in Kosovo and
Macedonia. `Standard' calling upon anonymous diplomatic sources claims that
the Balkans politicians have been exploring the division of Macedonia
since 1993.
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> ACCREDITATION OF ISRAELI AMBASSADOR IN MACEDONIA</H3>
Macedonian Chief of State Kiro Gligorov yesterday received Israeli
Ambassador Ran Kuriel in Macedonia and also handed him the accreditation
letters. The Macedonian president in the welcoming speech emphasized that
the appointing of the first Israeli ambassador in Macedonia presents a
continuity of the historically confirmed traditional friendly relations
between the Macedonian and Jewish people as well as of the successful
development of the relations between the two countries. Presenting the
Israeli President's regards the Israeli ambassador expressed the
willingness of the Israeli Government to continue the development of the
relations between the countries in all areas.
<P>The newly appointed Israeli ambassador in Macedonia Ran Kuriel yesterday
was received by the vice-president of the Macedonian Parliament, Tito
Petkovski, the Premier Branko Crvenkovski and Foreign Affairs Minister
Ljubomir Frchkovski.
<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> COMPENSATION FROM IRAQI-KUWAIT WAR FOR MACEDONIAN FIRMS NEXT YEAR</H3>
Macedonian Government Vice-president Ljube Trpevski yesterday in Geneva
had e meeting with Executive Secretary of the Compensation Commission by
the Security Council Carlos Alzamora and they discussed the Macedonian
demand for priority in solving the compensation from the Iraqi-Kuwait war
for the Macedonian firms. The Macedonian Television reports,
Almazora stated that he expects the problem to be solved in the course of
next year emphasizing that he will do everything possible in the direction
of a positive resolution. Official attitude of the Compensation
Commission by the UN Security Council , as it was stated by Alzamora, is
the following: the international community and the UN have the obligation
to help in the reestablishing the order which had been broken and to
compensate the justified demands of the firms and the damaged workers.
<P>Regarding the construction company `Pelagonija' from Skopje ( which has the
largest demand of compensation) Carlos Alzamora expressed expectation to
see this company again in the international waters of construction building
where it has always held an excellent and high reputation.
<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> THE CONSTRUCTION BUILDER'S STRIKE APPROACHING CULMINATION</H3>
The construction workers of `Mavrovo' have been on strike 10 days already
demanding payment of their salaries, and starting from yesterday there are
500 construction workers from `Pelagonija' on strike as well, report the
media.
<P>More than a thousand revolted construction workers yesterday blocked the
entrance to the Urban Planning Ministry where a meeting was to be held
between minister Jorgo Shundovski and the managers of the company with the
striking Committee of the independent syndicate `Mavrovo'. However the
representatives of the independent syndicate did not agree with the
attitude of Shundovski to include the `state syndicate' in the negotiations
and they left the session.
<P>`Dnevnik' reports, since yesterday the building of the railway towards
Bulgaria has been stopped and the workers joined the strikers in Skopje.
According to the Vise- President of the Independent Syndicate Union Blazze
Stojanovski the events will reach culmination in the following 2-3 days
with a large protest in front of the Government.
<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</A> MINISTER ZIBERI - NO CHANGES IN THE PENSIONING CONDITIONS</H3>
Regarding the speculations that are circling in the public these days about
the alleged restrictive measures in the Law for pension and invalid
insurance the Macedonian Television yesterday asked for a statement from
Labor and Social Policy Minister Naser Ziberi. According to Ziberi a
false panic is created among the citizens about the alleged reduced rights
for pensioning i.e. that there will be
a reduction of the pension base or that the age limits for both men and
women will be equal.
<P>Minister Ziberi gave the information that the law base for pensions will
continue to be 80% from the average salary, but it will also be related to
the average salary in the non-economy businesses. There will be no changes
regarding equalizing the male and female age limits. The changes in
the law regard procuring funds for timely payment of the pensions and
overcoming the finance deficit in the Pension and Invalid Insurance Fund,
stated Minister Ziberi.
<H3><A NAME="09">[09]</A> MORE CHANGES IN TAX SPHERE</H3>
A-1 TV reports, the Macedonian Government at the session held the day
before yesterday established a package of changes referring to the tax
sphere. With them the rate of taxation on the income is being reduced from
30% to 15%, and the income which will be used for investing will
be totally tax free. With the new changes the double taxation of the
dividend will be avoided and the prior 4 rates of sales tax and services
tax will be replaced with one rate of 13%. In the future coffee and alcohol
taxes will have to be paid it the total sum and taxpayer will
be the importer while demands for changes in the tobacco taxes are waiting
for better times. With the new tax changes taxation of the demand interest
rates will be avoided and in the rest only the real interest rates will
be taxed.
<H3><A NAME="10">[10]</A> `PALER MACEDONIAN' DEMANDS JUSTICE THROUGH COURT</H3>
As the owner of the air-transport company `Paler Macedonian' Vanja
Bitoljanu has informed yesterday this company has pressed charges against
the Traffic and Connection Minister Dimitar Buzlevski for abusing his
official position and authorization. Charges are pressed against Goran
Pavlovski - Manager of the Head Office for Civil Air Transport, Aleksandar
Chepeljugin - Manager of the Public Firm for Airport Services `Makedonija-
Skopje' and Ilija Iloski - President of the Administrative
Committee of the Public Firm all for abuse of their official duties and
authorities and for creating monopoly positions and causing disturbance on
the market.
<P>According to Bituljanu the charges have been pressed due to the fact that
the accuser (`Paler Macedonian') wants to give a modest contribution to the
respecting of the laws in the state i.e. to the direction of commencing the
functioning of the `worn-out phrase law state'.
<P>`Paler Macedonian' has been grounded for a long time now due to unpaid
demands towards the Public Firm for Airport Services `Makedonija-Skopje'.
The workers are being taken by the air company `MAT' and the airplanes are
returned to the renter. Vanja Bituljanu - owner of `Paler
Macedonian' has pointed out for many times now that his company is unjustly
grounded and that the rivals `MAT' and `Avioimpeks' are being unjustly
favored by the authorities.
<H3><A NAME="11">[11]</A> LAW FOR PROTECTION AND IMPROVEMENT OF LIVING ENVIRONMENT ADOPTED</H3>
The Macedonian Assembly at yesterday's 55th session has drafted the Law for
protection and improvement of the living environment. According to Minister
Jorgo Shundovski, this small `eco - constitution' is the first
Law of this kind in the country and it regulates the rights and duties in
the protection and improvement of the environment. The law predicts
establishing: an information system for monitoring the quality of the
living environment, inspectorate and Institute for Environment
Protection and providing means for inciting preventive measures
for protection and a special fund for environment improvement will be
established.
<P>During the session in the Macedonian General Assembly in front of the
Assembly building there was a rally of the ecologists for support of the
Law. About 300 ecologists wanted to pressure the members of the Parliament
to draft the Law which is the fundamental prerequisite for
improving the living environment. in Macedonia.
<P>The Parliament members at yesterday's session drafted the Law for tobacco
but they did not succeed in drafting the La w for legal procedure due to
lack of quorum. In the amendment dispute for this law the demands of the
PDP Party were not accepted - they demanded the lawsuit
procedure to be carried out in the language of the nationalities unless the
client has command of the Macedonian language.
<H3><A NAME="12">[12]</A> GERMAN GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR PROTECTION OF OHRID AND PRESPA LAKES</H3>
The German Government, through its Agency for Technical Cooperation,
approved 600.000 DM. for commencing the project of economic development and
protection of the environment in the coastal area of the Ohrid and Prespa
Lakes, reported Radio Tirana yesterday. The funds for this project should
be approved by the European Organization for Protection of the Human
Environment and some other organizations, reports `Makpres'. This help
will also include Macedonia and Greece with the aim to gather the
citizens to work together on the economic development in these regions and
on the protection of the lakes regardless of their nationality.
<H3><A NAME="13">[13]</A> VANDALISM ON SEVERAL CHURCHES IN GOSTIVAR SURROUNDINGS</H3>
In the Gostivar village Vrapchishte a few days ago unknown doers entered
three churches and damaged them, reports `Vecher' From the church Sveti
Atanas the vandals stole money and some gifts - embroideries, and they lit
fire within the church `Sveti Ilija' thus destroying the
woodworks. The entrance doors of the churches were damaged by tools and
other objects.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> LATEST ISSUE OF OPPOSITION NEWSPAPER CONFISCATED IN ARMENIA.</H3>
The 18 December issue of <CITE>Ayzhm</CITE>, the newspaper of the opposition National
Democratic Union, has been confiscated by the Haymamul state-run
distributing agency, Groong reported on 18 December citing Asbarez-on-line.
<CITE>Ayzhm</CITE>'s latest issue contained an article critical of Haymamul's
activities. The agency, which has a monopoly over newspaper distribution,
has been repeatedly slammed by Armenian journalists for its allegedly
inefficient work, including delays in paying periodicals for copies sold.
Some journalists claim that the agency is used by the authorities as an
instrument of control over the media. -- Emil Danielyan
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> TURKMENISTAN SUSPENDS GAS SUPPLIES TO ARMENIA.</H3>
Turkmenistan has suspended natural gas supplies to Armenia because of the
latter's $15 million debt for 1996, Noyan Tapan and AFP reported on 19
December. Armenian Energy Minister Gagik Martirosyan said that Armenia's
energy sector now has debts of $75 million as a result of nonpayments by
enterprises, government agencies, and individuals. He added that Armenian
officials are currently negotiating with the Turkmen side and suggested
that gas supplies may soon resume. -- Emil Danielyan
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> IMF SUSPENDS LOAN TO UZBEKISTAN.</H3>
The International Monetary Fund on 19 December suspended a $185 million
standby loan to Uzbekistan, Reuters reported. Further disbursements have
been postponed because Uzbekistan failed to meet the fund's inflation
targets, according to Mark O'Brien, the IMF's resident representative in
Tashkent. Uzbekistan's target for 1996 was 25%, but inflation is estimated
to have exceeded 40%. Another factor was the introduction of draconian
foreign exchange controls in October. Further payments have been condtioned
on a &quot;very tight financial policy...combined with a full liberalization of
access to foreign exchange.&quot; -- Lowell Bezanis
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> HIGH PRICES FOR KAZAKSTANI BROADCAST FREQUENCIES.</H3>
Information obtained by Internews in Moscow suggests that prices at a
planned auction for broadcast frequencies in Kazakstan will prove
prohibitively high for independent stations. A decree signed by Deputy
Prime Minister Imangali Tasmagimbetov on 12 December lists annual fees and
auction starting prices for radio and television frequencies. Bidding for
radio frequencies with the weakest signals (FM 100-1,000W) will begin at
$30,857; radio stations will also have to pay an annual fee of $6,171. The
highest starting price--$114,285--is for UHF television frequencies (100-1,
000W). Companies will also have to pay an annual fee of $11,428. Discounts
will be available for stations broadcasting outside Almaty and Akmola.
Frequency licenses cost $500, and only Kazakstani companies can apply. Such
high costs are likely to force most independent stations off the air. --

<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> ONE MAN'S SOLUTION TO WAGE ARREARS IN KAZAKSTAN.</H3>
Kazhmurad Nagmanov, the head (<CITE>akim</CITE>) of the eastern Kazakstan region, is
encouraging heads of local factories to sell their cars in order to pay
their workers, Reuters reported citing an article in the 20 December
Kazakstani daily <CITE>Karavan</CITE> <CITE>Blitz</CITE>. Unpaid wages have become a chronic
problem in Kazakstan, triggering several demonstrations to protest living
conditions. According to <CITE>Karavan Blitz</CITE>, there was no indication that &quot;the
directors were rushing to take the akim's advice.&quot; -- Bruce Pannier

<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> FEDERAL YUGOSLAV FOREIGN MINISTER DOES NOT RULE OUT NEW ELECTIONS . .
.</H3>
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's foreign minister, Milan Milutinovic,
said on 19 December that yet another round of municipal elections in those
centers where the opposition Zajedno coalition originally scored victories
cannot be ruled out. But he added that such elections would be contingent
on an OSCE recommendation. &quot;Should the OSCE delegation which is coming here
[on 20 December] recommend new elections in Serbia after making a thorough
and impartial review, we would accept that,&quot; he said. Meanwhile, CNN
reported that Milutinovic also said that the strategy of the demonstrators
has outlived its usefulness. &quot;Here in Serbia, there is an old saying that
when the song is over, you stop singing,&quot; he said. -- Stan Markotich
<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> . . . AND DEMONSTRATIONS CONTINUE.</H3>
Across Serbia, meanwhile, mass demonstrations demanding that the regime
recognize the opposition electoral victories continued into a their 30th
day on 19 December. Radio Index reported that more than 200,000 people
marched in Belgrade in one of that city's largest single protest actions to
date. For their part, Zajedno leaders also used the occasion for a mass
celebration of St. Nicholas Day. On 18 December, some 37 students began a
march from Kragujevac, about 120 km from Belgrade, to the capital with a
protest letter they were intending to deliver to Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic. Meanwhile, pro-Milosevic demonstrations continued on 19 December
for a second day throughout small towns in Serbia, including Kosovo. So far,
such events have been attended by only a few thousand people, mostly
elderly and die-hard communists, and they have not taken place in Belgrade.

<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</A> CROATIA, VATICAN SIGN KEY AGREEMENTS.</H3>
Croatia and the Holy See signed three documents on 19 December to regulate
their relations, Croatian and international media reported. The texts cover
legal issues, education and culture, and the role of priests in the army
and police. The head of the government's religious affairs commission, Jure
Radic, said that Croatia has thus become the first former communist country
of Eastern Europe to establish &quot;full ties&quot; with the Vatican, Reuters added.
Cardinal Franjo Kuharic praised the agreements as legalizing the status of
the Roman Catholic church, and stated that the still-open question of
former church properties confiscated by the Communists could be solved
soon. More than 90% of Croats are nominally Roman Catholic, but polls
consistently show that, while Kuharic himself is well liked, there is
strong opposition to a larger political role for the church and to the
church's stand on abortion. -- Patrick Moore
<H3><A NAME="09">[09]</A> IZETBEGOVIC WARNS AGAINST SERBIAN BLACKMAIL OVER BRCKO.</H3>
The Muslim member of the Bosnian presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, has warned
the international community against yielding to Serbian pressure in the
upcoming arbitration over the strategic town of Brcko, Onasa reported on 19
December. The president of the Republika Srpska, Biljana Plavsic, had said
on 16 December that there will be war if anyone tries to take the formerly
majority Muslim town away from the Serbs (see <CITE>Pursuing Balkan Peace</CITE>, 17
December 1996). Izetbegovic has now responded that his forces could have
taken the town in late 1995 but accepted arbitration under the Dayton
agreement instead. He said he did so because he believes the legal
arguments are on his side, a point Dnevni avaz reiterated on 20 December.
Izetbegovic concluded: &quot;The only right that [the Serbs] stress is the right
of the stronger. This right exists no more, because they are not stronger
any more. If there really were a war for Brcko, there is no doubt who would
win it. -- Patrick Moore
<H3><A NAME="10">[10]</A> HERCEG-BOSNA SAID TO BE OFFICIALLY DISMANTLED . . .</H3>
Kresimir Zubak, the former president of the Muslim-Croat Federation and a
Croat member of the three-man Bosnian presidency, said on 19 December that
the Bosnian Croat para-state of Herceg-Bosna ceased to exist on 17 December,
the same day that the Bosnian republican government transferred its
functions to the federation, <CITE>Oslobodjenje</CITE> reported the next day. In a
letter to international peace envoy Carl Bildt and U.S. envoy John Kornblum,
Zubak said a special commission will be in charge of the details of
dismantling the mini-state. Zubak said all stamps, stationery, and other
documents will be withdrawn and requested that the same be done by the
Bosnian government. Zubak also asked that the information and documentation
agency, which the Croats claim is an espionage organization directed
against them, be dismantled. He said the Federation Forum, which he
prevented from convening last week, should meet as soon as possible to deal
with the question of implementing the federation. -- Daria Sito Sucic
<H3><A NAME="11">[11]</A> . . . BUT EVICTIONS OF MUSLIMS FROM MOSTAR CONTINUE.</H3>
UNHCR spokeswoman Ariane Quentier said an elderly Muslim couple was
expelled from the Croat-held part of Mostar on 18 December, thus bringing
the number of Muslims driven out since the beginning of the year to 73, AFP
reported on 19 December. The couple were forced out by men who showed them
&quot;a temporary authorization&quot; from Herceg-Bosna authorities to move into the
apartment. Meanwhile, the Croat mayor of Mostar, Ivan Prskalo, accused his
Muslim deputy, Safet Orucevic, of wanting to spark a conflict in the city,
saying that his statements &quot;only offer one option for the future: war,&quot; AFP
reported. In other news, Croatian Ambassador to the UN Mario Nobilo said
Croatia is not willing to support the Croat-Muslim Federation until the
alleged poor treatment of Croats in central Bosnia and Sarajevo stops,
<CITE>Oslobodjenje</CITE> reported on 18 December. -- Daria Sito Sucic
<H3><A NAME="12">[12]</A> RUGOVA MEETS BERISHA.</H3>
After concluding visits to the U.S. and France, Kosovar shadow state
President Ibrahim Rugova arrived in Tirana on 19 December for a meeting
with President Sali Berisha. Both sides said they &quot;wholeheartedly support
the active protests of the Belgrade students and the Serbian democratic
forces,&quot; adding that &quot;this movement is directed against the dictatorship of
[Serbian President Slobodan] Milosevic.&quot; The presidents concluded that &quot;the
democratization of Serbia in a democratic and peaceful way is an important
and positive development ... for peace and stability in the region.&quot; The
statement did not call on the Kosovo Albanians to turn out for street
protests. -- Fabian Schmidt
<H3><A NAME="13">[13]</A> ROMANIAN TROOPS TO STAY WITH BOSNIA FORCE.</H3>
Parliament on 19 December voted to keep the 200-strong Romanian engineering
battalion in NATO's new SFOR force in Bosnia and offered Timisoara's
airport, near the Serbian border, for possible use by SFOR. The decision
came in response to President Emil Constantinescu's formal request in a
letter to the legislature, Romanian and international media report.
Constantinescu said maintaining the force (which was first sent to Bosnia
in February as part of the former IFOR) will increase the prestige of the
country and enhance its chances of being included in the first wave of new
NATO members. -- Michael Shafir
<H3><A NAME="14">[14]</A> ION CEBUC LIKELY TO BECOME MOLDOVA'S NEXT PRIME MINISTER.</H3>
Infotag reported on 19 December that Ion Cebuc, the current chairman of the
State Accounting Chamber, is the candidate most likely to be designated the
country's next prime minister. Citing Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova
(PDAM) leader Dumitru Motpan, the agency reported that Cebuc's nomination
was discussed at a recent meeting between President-elect Petru Lucinschi
and the PDAM leadership. Motpan added that Cebuc has &quot;vast experience&quot; in
politics and managing the economy, having served at different times as the
head of Moldova's representation in Moscow, deputy foreign minister, and
deputy minister of the economy. Infotag added that Motpan himself has a
good chance of replacing Lucinschi at the head of the country's parliament.
-- Michael Shafir
<H3><A NAME="15">[15]</A> TRANSDNIESTER AMENDS ITS CONSTITUTION.</H3>
An amendment to the constitution passed by the Supreme Soviet of the
breakaway Transdniester region on 19 December will make it possible to hold
the 22 December presidential election as scheduled even if only one
candidate is running for the post. The previous stipulation required at
least two candidates. The amendment was passed after President Igor
Smirnov's electoral rival, Vladimir Malakhov, threatened to withdraw from
the race, arguing that his campaign had received &quot;unequal treatment&quot; from
the Smirnov-dominated media. In related news, the Russian ultra-nationalist
leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky appealed on Transdniestrian television to the
electorate, calling on it to back Smirnov. -- Michael Shafir
<H3><A NAME="16">[16]</A> ANTI-GOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATIONS IN BULGARIA.</H3>
Between 20,000 and 50,000 people demonstrated outside the parliament
building in Sofia on 19 December to demand the government's resignation.
The event was organized by the Union of Democratic Forces and the
&quot;Promyana&quot; alliance, <CITE>Standart</CITE> and <CITE>Trud</CITE> reported. The demonstrators
blocked downtown traffic, chanted slogans such as &quot;Red garbage,&quot; and burned
an effigy of Prime Minster Zhan Videnov. Speakers at the demonstration
appealed to Sofia's citizens to rally against the government. They also
announced that miners in Burgas have descended into their mines and gone on
hunger strike, threatening not to come out until the government resigns.
The demonstrators also protested against censorship in the national media. -

<H3><A NAME="17">[17]</A> NO CONSENSUS ON BULGARIA'S CURRENCY BOARD.</H3>
The parliamentary faction of the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) on
19 December rejected the opposition formula for a national consensus on the
adoption of the currency board adoption, <CITE>Standart</CITE> and <CITE>Kontinent</CITE>
reported. The United Democratic Forces proposal for early parliamentary
elections and the immediate resignation of the Bulgarian National Bank's
executive board in exchange for the opposition support of the currency
board idea, is &quot;strange and not understandable,&quot; BSP deputy Stefan
Gaitandzhiev said in parliament. Union of Democratic Forces deputy
Alexander Bozhkov said that if the BSP parliamentary faction rejects the
opposition proposal, the government should be ousted by street
demonstrations. -- Maria Koinova in Sofia
<H3><A NAME="18">[18]</A> ALBANIA FACES FOOD SHORTAGE DUE TO GREEK ROAD BLOCKADES.</H3>
Twenty-two days after Greek farmers set up road blocks all over Greece,
Albania is facing a food shortage, Reuters reported. The blockade has so
far inflicted $100 million worth of damage on the Greek economy and forced
several Albanian factories to shut down. It has resulted in price hikes of
up to 20% in Gjirokaster. Prices for oranges, apples, and potatoes have
gone up by 30%. -- Fabian Schmidt
<H3><A NAME="19">[19]</A> SECOND COLLAPSE OF ALBANIAN PYRAMID SCHEME WITHIN A MONTH.</H3>
Police prevented thousands of Albanians from storming the premises of the
Sude investment company in Tirana on 19 December, Radio Deutsche Welle's
Albanian language service reported. The four-year-old company was one of
many Albanian pyramid schemes offering monthly interest rates of up to 30%.
More than 10,000 Albanians are estimated to have invested in Sude. Many
cheated Albanians reportedly blamed the government for allowing the
companies to operate. Another pyramid scheme head disappeared with $13
million in November. -- Fabian Schmidt

An Armenian opposition representative, Vladimir Hakhverdyan, said that the
investigation into the 25 September protests in Yerevan is complete and
that trials will begin in January, Groong reported on 18 December citing
Asbarez-on-line. The protests were triggered by reports of alleged vote-
rigging in the 22 September presidential election. A number of supporters
of the defeated opposition candidate Vazgen Manukyan burst into the
parliament building and took the National Assembly speaker and his deputy
hostage. According to Hakhverdyan, a group of opposition activists arrested
in connection with the unrest, have been charged with inciting mass
disorder and illegally possessing arms. -- Emil Danielyan
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> RUSSIA UPSET OVER ADAMS/KHACHUKAEV MEETING.</H3>
Russia's Ambassador to Baku, Aleksandr Blokhin, told ITAR-TASS on 18
December he was displeased at the reported recent meeting in Baku between
Terry Adams, chairman of the Azerbaijan International Operating Company
(AIOC), and Chechen government official Eduard Khachukaev (See <CITE>OMRI Daily
Digest</CITE> for 18 December 1996). Blokhin argued that the export of Caspian
oil via Chechnya to Novorossiisk, which Adams and Khachukaev allegedly
discussed, was regulated under the terms of the existing agreement between
Transneft and the AIOC. A spokesman for Adams confirmed that he had met
with Khachukaev but denied that the two men had discussed transit tariffs. -

<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> ADZHAR SUPREME SOVIET DENIES REPORTS OF STATE OF EMERGENCY IN BATUMI.</H3>
On 18 December a spokesman for the Adzhar Supreme Soviet denied press
reports that a state of emergency had been declared in the capital, Batumi,
but said that military vehicles had been moved to the city on 18 December
to take part in maneuvers, according to ITAR-TASS of 18 December.
<CITE>Nezavisimaya gazeta</CITE> on 19 December quoted a source within the Georgian
parliament as claiming that all Russian troops stationed in Adzharia had
been placed on full alert in connection with an anticipated attempt to
assassinate Azdhar Supreme Soviet chairman Aslan Abashidze. -- Liz Fuller
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> NIYAZOV ON NATUAL GAS EXPORTS.</H3>
Speaking on state television, Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov said on
18 December he is pinning his hopes for an economic revivial on renewed
exports of natural gas to Western Europe, Reuters reported. He said that
gas exports in 1997 will almost double to 40 billion cubic meters and that
half the gas will be shipped to Western Europe via Russia, in accordance
with an agreement with Russia's Gazprom. Last year, Turkmenistan exported
24 billion cubic meters of natural gas. In the late 1980s, Turkmenistan
produced more than 80 billion cubic meters of gas a year. In 1993, Russia
stopped delivering Turkmen natural gas to Europe, leaving the country to
supply cash-strapped CIS countries. -- Lowell Bezanis
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> TAJIK OPPOSITION FREES CAPTIVES; MOSCOW TALKS DELAYED.</H3>
The Tajik opposition on 18 December released 39 hostages captured in recent
fighting, RFE/RL reported. Those freed were described only as &quot;high-
ranking&quot; officials. The move was agreed at a meeting of Tajik President
Imomali Rakhmonov and opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri on 10-11
December. Talks between the two leaders in Moscow scheduled for 19 December
have been pushed back a day as Nuri's departure was delayed by an
opposition meeting in Tehran on 18 December, according to Russian sources.
In a brief interview with <CITE>Nezavisimaya gazeta</CITE> on 19 December, Rakhmonov
said that a national reconciliation council must be set up but--a
stipulation of the original cease-fire agreement signed in Tehran in 1994--
but added: &quot;It's not our fault the agreement has not been realized.&quot; --

<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> SERBIAN OPPOSITION SUFFERS A SETBACK?</H3>
The electoral commission in the town of Smederevska Palanka on 18 December
ruled that the governing Socialists won the 17 November municipal elections,
<CITE>Nasa Borba</CITE> reported the following day. The commission's ruling comes
after a court decision recognizing a Zajedno victory in the town. A similar
court ruling in Serbia's second largest city of Nis which also recognized
opposition victories has not been contested by the local electoral
commission, at least for the moment. Meanwhile, at least 100,000 people
marched in Belgrade on 18 December, with some of the protesters walking
past the Russian Embassy to register their protest and anger at Moscow's
support for the regime. About 30,000 students tried to march to Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic's residence, but they were turned away by
police. -- Stan Markotich
<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</A> SERBIAN PRESIDENT STANDS FIRM<CITE>.</CITE></H3>
In the latest sign that Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic is standing
firm in his resolve to not recognize the opposition's victories in the
recent municipal elections, about 2,000 Milosevic loyalists demonstrated in
the village of Sremska Mitrovica, near Belgrade, to show support for the
regime, RTS 1 reported. The demonstrators, almost all elderly, showed their
support for the authorities by unfurling banners reading, &quot;We love you,
Slobo&quot; or &quot;Slobo--Peace and Progress,&quot; and injunctions against opposition
demonstrators such as, &quot;Think with your head, not your feet.&quot; -- Stan
Markotich
<H3><A NAME="09">[09]</A> ETHNIC CLEANSING REINFORCED IN BOSNIA.</H3>
Three houses belonging to Muslims but located on Croat territory were
dynamited last weekend, the UN police announced on 18 December. UN
spokesman Alexander Ivanko added that the explosions in Capljina brought
the total number of such incidents on Croat territory over the past three
months to 35. Ivanko charged that the authorities should try to prevent
such acts or at least try to catch the guilty parties. He noted, however,
that nobody has been caught to date, AFP reported. Meanwhile, the UNHCR
charged the Bosnian Serb authorities with preventing Muslims from returning
to their homes in the Sipovo area in western Bosnia, near Mrkonjic Grad.
The UN noted that the local Serbs had previously been helpful, and
suggested that the authorities in Pale may have meanwhile issued orders to
block any returns. The Dayton agreement provides for freedom of movement
and the right to go home, but those provisions have scarcely been enforced.

<H3><A NAME="10">[10]</A> NEW UN HEAD DEMURS ON UN POLICE FORCE TO CATCH WAR CRIMINALS.</H3>
Kofi Annan on 18 December said he doubts the UN International Police Task
Force (IPTF), currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina under a limited
mandate, is an adequate force to find and apprehend Bosnian war criminals,
AFP reported. Annan said the governments in the region must be pressed to
cooperate, a position already articulated by NATO. The head of the U.S.
joint chiefs of staff, Gen. John Shalikashvili, has promoted the idea of a
separate international police force to hunt down war criminals, saying the
NATO-led peace force in Bosnia is not trained for &quot;police work&quot; (see <CITE>OMRI
Daily Digest</CITE>, 17 December 1996). The still vague proposal suggests that
the new police force might operate under the EU, the UN criminal tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia, or the OSCE. But critics say none of those
organizations have the means or the experience to track down suspects. --

<H3><A NAME="11">[11]</A> CROATIA THREATENED BY FOREIGN FORCES WHO WANT YUGOSLAVIA?</H3>
The Croatian Defense and National Security Council on 17 December claimed
that &quot;pressure is still being exerted by those who support the existence of
Yugoslavia at all costs and who are against the creation of an independent
Croatian state,&quot; AFP reported. The council, chaired by President Franjo
Tudjman, stressed that those people have plans to push Croatia back into a
Balkan or southeast European &quot;melting pot.&quot; Those &quot;foreign scenarios&quot; aim
to stage simultaneous demonstrations in Zagreb, Belgrade, and Sarajevo. In
other news, Tudjman on 16 December replaced four government ministers who
were either considered to be too independent or suspected of corruption.
Senior police officers have pledged support for one of them, former
Interior Minister Ivan Jarnjak, saying he is the only person who would be
capable of handling the chaos that would ensue if Tudjman were to die in
office, AFP on 18 December, quoting the independent weekly <CITE>Globus</CITE>. --

<H3><A NAME="12">[12]</A> NEW ROMANIAN LIBERAL ALLIANCE.</H3>
The Liberal Party '93, the National Liberal Party-Democratic Convention
(PNL-CD), and the National Liberal Party-Campeanu Group decided on 17
December to set up a new alliance called the National Liberal Union (UNL),
Radio Bucharest reported. Dinu Zamfirescu of the Liberal Party '93 deplored
the fact that the National Liberal Party (PNL) is attempting to &quot;impose
unacceptable conditions&quot; on the unification of liberal formations. PNL
first deputy chairman Viorel Catarama said on 12 December that his party
must have a 60% representation in any future joint Liberal conference that
will decide on the unification of Liberal formations. The Party of Civic
Alliance (PAC) has also rejected Catarama's formula. It is unclear, however,
how the UNL will get its act together, since the PNL-CD is a member of the
Democratic Convention of Romania and the other two parties are not. PNL-CD
vice chairman Alexandru Popovici said on 18 December that any unification
must take place within the CDR.Question marks also loom over the future of
the National Liberal Alliance, set up by the Liberal Party '93 and the PAC
a few months earlier. -- Michael Shafir
<H3><A NAME="13">[13]</A> ROMANIANS PROTEST APPOINTMENT OF ETHNIC HUNGARIAN PREFECTS.</H3>
The leaderships of the Democratic Convention of Romania and the Democratic
Party-National Salvation Front in Harghita county have protested against
the appointment of an ethnic Hungarian to the post of county prefect, Radio
Bucharest reported on 18 December. Ethnic Hungarians form the majority of
the county's residents. The decision to appoint three members of the
Hungarian Democratic Federation of Romania (UDMR) as prefects was reached
as a result of discussions among the new governing coalition parties. UDMR
Senator Attila Verestoy told RFE/RL that based on its strength in
parliament, the UDMR was entitled to five prefects but has agreed to have
only three. <CITE>Adevarul</CITE> reported that President Emil Constantinescu and
Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea promised ethnic Romanian members of
parliament that they would &quot;be on guard&quot; against &quot;infringements of the
constitution and the country's laws&quot;--an allusion to the UDMR program that
calls for &quot;local, territorial, and personal autonomy.&quot; -- Michael Shafir
<H3><A NAME="14">[14]</A> RUSSIA, BELARUS, ABKHAZIA SEND OBSERVERS TO TRANSDNIESTRIAN ELECTIONS.</H3>
Responding to an invitation from the Tiraspol authorities, Russia, Belarus,
and Abkhazia will send observers to the 22 December presidential election
in the breakaway region, local and international media reported on 18
December. The Russian delegation will include members of the State Duma
from Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic faction and from the
Communist Party faction. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennadii
Tarasov said the presence of the delegation will &quot;not upgrade&quot; the &quot;purely
local character&quot; of the ballot. He said Russia continued to favor the
settling of the dispute by granting the region special status within
Moldova. The head of the OSCE permanent mission in Moldova, Donald Johnson,
said no OSCE observers will be delegated because the organization
&quot;supported and continues to support the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of the Republic of Moldova.&quot; -- Michael Shafir
<H3><A NAME="15">[15]</A> SOUP KITCHENS OPEN IN BULGARIA.</H3>
The city of Sofia on 18 December opened the capital's first 24 permanent
soup kitchens to serve free meals to the poor, RFE/RL reported. The
kitchens will offer warm soup and bread once a day to around 3,000 people.
Hundreds of thousands of Bulgarians live in increasingly miserable
conditions, with average monthly wages and pensions declining constantly,
the latter to 5,700 leva ($12.3). The previous day, the Polish Red Cross--
following a request from the Bulgarian Red Cross and Red Crescent--arranged
for two cargo planes to send 9 metric tons of food to Bulgaria. Meanwhile,
<CITE>Demokratsiya</CITE> on 19 December reported that of the 1.6 million Bulgarians
dependent on central heating, 111,000 have had the heating in their homes
turned off because they cannot afford it. <CITE>Standart</CITE> noted that all state-
controlled heating companies will face bankruptcy when the price of Russian
gas goes up in January. -- Stefan Krause
<H3><A NAME="16">[16]</A> BULGARIAN EMPLOYERS, TRADE UNIONS SIGN ACCORD.</H3>
The Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce (BSK) and the two big trade union
confederations on 18 December signed an accord stipulating that Bulgarians
receive their salaries every third day, if the country is hit by
hyperinflation, or weekly, if monthly inflation reaches 40-50%, <CITE>Standart</CITE>
and <CITE>Kontinent</CITE> reported. According to experts of the Confederation of
Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria, the inflation rate for 1996 is 300%,
and BSK Chairman Bozhidar Danev said inflation is running at 25-27% in
December alone. -- Maria Koinova in Sofia
<H3><A NAME="17">[17]</A> HIGH-RANKING ITALIAN LAW-ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS VISIT ALBANIA.</H3>
An Italian delegation led by Deputy Attorney-General Alberto Mariatti left
Albania on 18 December after meeting with various Albanian official bodies
to discuss greater cooperation in fighting organized crime, <CITE>Rilindja
Demokratike</CITE> reported. The largest problem both countries face is the
smuggling of arms, drugs, and people. In recent years, Albania and Italy
have drastically raised their level of cooperation and have engaged in more
mutual exchanges of crime-related information. Last week, the Italian and
Albanian interior ministers signed a cooperation agreement in Tirana. --

<H3><A NAME="18">[18]</A> ARAFAT VISITS ALBANIA.</H3>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat arrived in Albania on 18 December to meet
with President Sali Berisha to discuss strengthening ties. Arafat expressed
his commitment for the Middle Eastern peace process and thanked Albania for
its consistent support of the Palestinian cause, describing it as a
&quot;brotherly country,&quot; international agencies reported. Communist-era Albania
had sided with the Palestine Liberation Organization during its prolonged
armed struggle with Israel. Like most other Communist countries, it refused
to recognize Israel. -- Fabian Schmidt

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> FREEDOM HOUSE REPORT NOTES LACK OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL ASIA.</H3>
In its annual survey of freedom and democracy worldwide, the U.S.-based
Freedom House identified Tajikistan and Turkmenistan as among the 17 most
repressive regimes in the world, RFE-RL reported on 18 December. Uzbekistan,
which last year also appeared in the worst category, improved its record in
1996. Among the CIS countries, Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, Russia, and
Ukraine are rated &quot;partly free;&quot; and Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan are listed as &quot;not
free.&quot; Freedom House ratings are based on a check-list of political rights
and civil liberties, including the degree of autonomy for minorities, the
status of the opposition, the nature of electoral laws, and the degree of
freedom of assembly and freedom of the media. -- Lowell Bezanis
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> CHECHNYA DEMANDS SHARE OF TRANSIT TARIFFS FOR CASPIAN OIL.</H3>
Chechen government representative Eduard Khachukaev met recently in Baku
with the chairman of the Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC),
Terry Adams, to discuss the transportation of Azerbaijani oil through
Chechnya, Turan reported on 17 December. Khachukaev said that Chechnya
should receive a share of the transit tariffs from the transportation of
Caspian oil via the Baku-Chechnya-Tikhoretsk-Novorossiisk pipeline and that
it wants a share in the AIOC. Adams assured Khachukaev that he would raise
the issue with the Azerbaijani leadership. Under the terms of an agreement
signed by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and interim Chechen
Prime Minister Aslan Maskhadov on 23 November, the Russian and Chechen
authorities were supposed to conclude an agreement by 1 December on the
unimpeded transportation of oil through Chechnya. -- Liz Fuller
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> DEMONSTRATION IN KYRGYZSTAN.</H3>
About 300 people, mostly pensioners, gathered in front of the government
building in Bishkek on 17 December to demand compensation for savings lost
when several state banks collapsed, RFE/RL reported. The leaders of the
demonstration met with Kyrgyz Prime Minister Apas Jumagulov, but no
agreement was reached. One of the protesters, Topchubek Turgunaliyev of the
Erkin Kyrgyzstan Party, was detained by police as he left the government
building. Turgunaliyev was accused of embezzling state property, but
Jumagazy Usupov, leader of the Ashar movement, argued that Turgunaliyev's
detention was linked to his role in the recent formation of the &quot;For
Deliverance from Poverty&quot; movement. Usupov speculated that the detention is
aimed at stopping Turgunaliyev from organizing further protests and
preventing the new movement from holding a congress scheduled for 21
December. -- Bruce Pannier and Naryn Idinov
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> UN OBSERVERS IN TAJIKISTAN VICTIMS OF &quot;MOCK EXECUTION.&quot;</H3>
Two teams of UN observers in Tajikistan were stopped at a government
checkpoint, verbally and physically abused, and subject to forced to stand
in a line for a mock execution, according to an 18 December UN press
release. The teams were traveling to Garm to verify reports of cease-fire
violations in the area when they were stopped at the Saripul post. Their
communications equipment was confiscated and members of the teams were
ordered to line up in a field for execution. Government soldiers then fired
above and around the men. The UN team was able to escape when the
appearance of a car on the road diverted the soldiers' attention. This is
the second time this month that government forces have mistreated UN
observers. -- Bruce Pannier

<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> SERBIAN PRESIDENT MEETS WITH STUDENTS . . .</H3>
As mass demonstrations continued across Serbia and the independent trade
union Nezavisnost led another huge rally in Belgrade, President Slobodan
Milosevic met with students on 17 December. A student delegation which had
marched to Belgrade from Serbia's second largest city, Nis, delivered
Milosevic a protest letter and samples of spoiled ballots. The opposition
Zajedno coalition has accused of vote-rigging in the 17 November municipal
elections, costing it victories in a dozen municipalities. Milosevic
pledged to investigate allegations of electoral improprieties and a state
TV broadcast quoted him as saying, &quot;Mistakes are always possible ... I
assure you that this state will not protect someone who has broken the law,
whether that someone is a citizen or an official.&quot; -- Stan Markotich
<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> . . . BUT REMAINS DEFIANT.</H3>
Milosevic also told the students he would not tolerate their alleged
promotion of foreign meddling in Serbia's &quot;domestic&quot; affairs. &quot;We must be
completely clear, however much your leaders go to embassies and send envoys
and travel to world capitals, a foreign hand shall not rule Serbia,&quot;
Reuters quoted him as saying. Meanwhile, the OSCE confirmed on 17 December
that it would send a delegation, headed by former Spanish Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez, to Belgrade to investigate circumstances surrounding the
disputed 17 November election results. -- Stan Markotich

<H3><A NAME="09">[09]</A> MONTENEGRIN LEADERS LAUNCH COURT ACTION.</H3>
President Momir Bulatovic, Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, and
parliamentary Speaker Svetozar Marovic have filed lawsuits against several
leading opposition figures, alleging that they committed slander during the
3 November election campaign, Montena-fax reported on 17 December. The
legal action was undertaken just one day after the ruling Democratic Party
of Socialists proposed that several terms, including &quot;murderer,&quot; &quot;maniac,&quot;
&quot;fool,&quot; and &quot;traitor&quot; be banned from legislative debates. Novak Kilibarda,
one of the leading opposition figures named in the slander suit, said the
filing of the charges was little more than a ploy by the government to
divert public attention away from serious issues such as the &quot;catastrophic&quot;
state of the economy. -- Stan Markotich
<H3><A NAME="10">[10]</A> BOSNIAN SERB LEADERSHIP WELCOMES SFOR.</H3>
NATO gave final approval on 17 December to SFOR, which will formally
succeed IFOR on 20 December. It will be a 31,000-strong contingent with an
18-month mandate, with the largest individual contributions being 8,500
Americans, 5,000 Britons, 3,000 Germans, and 2,500 French, AFP reported.
The Serbian representative on the Bosnian state presidency, Momcilo
Krajisnik, said that IFOR had done well and that the Pale leadership had
worked hard to persuade the Bosnian Serb public to accept it. IFOR was &quot;a
force that protected peace and not one or the other entity in Bosnia-
Herzegovina,&quot; he concluded, adding that there were few serious incidents
during its mandate and that its record was better than that of its
predecessor, UNPROFOR. Krajisnik stated that all three sides agreed that
SFOR's mandate will be the same as IFOR's. -- Patrick Moore
<H3><A NAME="11">[11]</A> BOSNIAN WAR CRIMES UPDATE.</H3>
The Pale leadership has also rolled out the welcome mat to Judge Louise
Arbour, who heads the Hague-based International Criminal Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia. Prime Minister Gojko Klickovic has invited her to visit
the Republika Srpska, AFP reported on 17 December. Most of the war
criminals indicted in The Hague are Serbs, but three Muslims and a Croat
will go on trial on 28 January for crimes against Serbs at the Celebici
camp in 1992. For their part, the Serbs on 24 December will begin trying
Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic in absentia in Banja Luka for war
crimes, a move that the Muslims have strongly condemned as a propaganda
ploy. -- Patrick Moore
<H3><A NAME="12">[12]</A> RAIL WORKERS END STRIKE, TEACHERS DEMONSTRATE</H3>
. . . Croatian rail workers on 17 December ended a three-week strike after
the High Court rejected their appeal against an earlier ruling which
branded the action illegal, <CITE>Vecernji List</CITE> reported the next day. The High
Court ruled that the unions had failed to respect the Transport Ministry's
demands that they maintain a minimum traffic flow, AFP reported. Croatian
railway unions called the strike to demand higher wages and the payment of
an estimated $40 million in wage arrears. Meanwhile, about 1,000 to 2,000
teachers and research workers demonstrated the same day in Zagreb to demand
a 15% raise, <CITE>Novi List</CITE> reported the next day. The government had only
promised them a 5% pay hike. The average monthly wage in education is about
$350, or $50 less than the national average. -- Daria Sito Sucic
<H3><A NAME="13">[13]</A> . . . BUT IMF WARNS CROATIA TO BE &quot;CAREFUL&quot; WITH WAGE POLICY.</H3>
An IMF delegation on 17 December gave preliminary approval to the Croatian
government's economic program up to the year 1999, which could free up to
$500 million in loans, international and local media reported. Robert
Feldman, the head of the IMF mission, said the loans were contingent on
meeting the agreed targets set out in the program, such as real economic
growth of 5% and low inflation, AFP reported. The program calls for
maintaining macroeconomic stabilization, including a &quot;careful&quot; wage policy
with wage increases linked to increases in productivity. Feldman also said
the country would have to show significant progress on privatization and
restructuring, which would probably lead to more unemployment. But he said
that investment in infrastructure should create jobs, as would the creation
of new businesses. -- Daria Sito Sucic
<H3><A NAME="14">[14]</A> ROMANIAN GOVERNMENT DELAYS IMPLEMENTING ELECTORAL PROMISES.</H3>
Ulm Spineanu, the minister in charge of economic reform, said on 17
December that the government will have to delay the implementation of its
electoral promises concerning &quot;social measures&quot; aimed at improving living
standards, Romanian TV reported on 17 December. One day earlier, the daily
<CITE>Libertatea</CITE> quoted Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea as saying that as a resul
of talks with Paul Thompsen, the chief IMF negotiator for Romania last week,
the measures would be postponed until mid-January, when new parleys on an
IMF stand-by loan are scheduled. The IMF is opposed to increasing
allowances for children and minimum pensions for peasants to 50,000 lei
(about $13) and recommends immediate energy price increases, instead of the
gradual increasing envisaged by the government. -- Michael Shafir
<H3><A NAME="15">[15]</A> TRANSDNIESTRIAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION UPDATE.</H3>
Vladimir Malakhov, the only candidate running against President Igor
Smirnov in the 22 December Transdniester breakaway region's presidential
election, has threatened to withdraw from the race, Infotag reported on 17
December. Malakhov said &quot;equal rights conditions&quot; were not respected and
the Transdniester media were covering only Smirnov's campaign. He also
denied accusations that he would work with Moldova's president-elect, Petru
Lucinschi, for the unification of the region with Moldova. Malakhov said he
envisaged a federation &quot;in which both our republics would enjoy equal
status.&quot; Meanwhile, Lucinschi said the Transdniestrian elections will
change nothing, because the international community recognizes only the
Moldovan state. He reiterated the position that Transdniester should be
granted a &quot;special status&quot; that would include separate representative and
executive bodies &quot;for an efficient administration of the region.&quot; --

<H3><A NAME="16">[16]</A> FORMER BULGARIAN PRIME MINISTER DIES.</H3>
Communist-era Prime Minister Stanko Todorov died on 17 December at age 76,
<CITE>Duma</CITE> reported. He joined the Bulgarian Communist Party in 1943 and became
a Politburo member in 1961. After holding several government posts, he was
prime minister from 1971-1981, the longest-serving prime minister in modern
Bulgarian history. Todorov was parliament chairman from 1981-1990 and among
the Communist party leaders who in November 1989 ousted long-time Communist
dictator Todor Zhivkov. -- Stefan Krause
<H3><A NAME="17">[17]</A> SOLUTION TO THE BULGARIAN-MACEDONIAN LANGUAGE CONTROVERSY?</H3>
The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry has drawn up five possible ways of avoiding
language arguments between Bulgaria and Macedonia, <CITE>Trud</CITE> and <CITE>Kontinent</CITE>
reported on 18 December. A day earlier, the projects were discussed by the
Consultative Council for National Security, which was convened by outgoing
President Zhelyu Zhelev after his meeting with Macedonian President Kiro
Gligorov at the OSCE summit in Lisbon. Bulgaria refuses to recognize the
existence of a separate Macedonian language. Since 1992, the controversy
has postponed the signing of an inter-state treaty and 12 other bilateral
accords. Bulgaria will allegedly no longer insist on its proposal to draw
up documents in English or another official UN language, which Macedonia
had rejected as unacceptable. Gligorov proposed that the new contracts be
signed along the lines of the 1994 economic agreement, which was drawn up
in Bulgarian and Macedonian without explicitly stating which languages were
being used. -- Maria Koinova in Sofia

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> LEARNING THE FACTS</H3>
The multi-member delegation of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), headed by former Spanish Premier Felippe
Gonsales, arrived in Belgrade today. The OSCE representatives have come to
learn the exact situation in Serbia after the partial annulment of
municipal elections and to eliminate all potential reserves in the
relations between FR Yugoslavia and the international community. Delegation
members will meet with representatives of all political structures,
judiciary, media and other organizations they will deem competent in
helping them comprehend the true state of things in Serbia.

<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> SHILLING: BACK IN STOLAC - NEVER AGAIN</H3>
The International Mediator for the Moslem-Croatian Federation - Mr.
Christian Schwarz Shilling left the town of Stolac highly irritated and
deluded, because the local authorities rejected the agreement on the
enactment of the Constitution and the introduction of Federation laws in
the area. Mr. Shilling threatened that the international community
sanctions against Stolac will be made more drastic. &quot;I shall not return to
this town as International Mediator until the situation changes,&quot; said Mr.
Shilling. He accused the representatives of the Croats from Stolac of
obstructing the return of Moslems to the town, restricting their freedom of
movement and the use of property. According to data provided by the Moslem
Stolac County council (currently in exile), before the war there were 8.000
Moslems in the town of Stolac, and now only 16 elderly ones are left.

<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> HERZEG-BOSNIA ABOLISHED BUT STILL EXISTS</H3>
News agencies report that the President of the Moslem-Croatian Federation -
Kresimir Zubak stated yesterday that the self-proclaimed creation - Herzeg-
Bosnia, exists no more. In a letter addressed to the international
coordinator for Bosnia - Mr. Karl Bildt, he indicated that as of yesterday
the &quot;government and institutions of Herzeg-Bosnia&quot; have been placed out of
function. The self-proclaimed creation of the Bosnian Croats, recognized
only by Croatia, was to be dissolved in August, but the Croats did not
respect the agreement that was signed. Thus Mostar is still a divided city
where the Croatian checkered flag is flown.

<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> NO ALTERNATIVE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF HIGHWAYS</H3>
The modernization of the transport infrastructure is a precondition for the
revitalization of the national economy and its joining the international
market. Therefore, the decision to continue the construction of trans-
Yugoslav highways encouraged domestic companies and prompted the interest
of foreign ones - said Serbian Minister of Transports and Communications
Svetolik Kostadinovic at the session of the Coordinating team for of
transports and communications yesterday. He also reminded that a pan-
European ministerial meeting will be held next year in Helsinki and that it
will most probably indicate that road and railway corridors linking Hungary
and Bulgaria through Yugoslavia and the corridor from Nis to the Macedonian
border will be qualified as transport corridors of European importance.
&quot;Bearing in mind the importance of constructing railroads and highways,
especially in the sense that this will boost national economy and increase
the living standard of the people, these development projects really have
no alternative&quot;, stressed Minister Kostadinovic.

<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> MILUTINOVIC: DISTORTED PICTURE OF THE ELECTIONS IN SERBIA</H3>
&quot;We have invited the OSCE delegation to come to our country because a
distorted picture of the facts related to the elections in Serbia has been
created abroad. We called the delegation that it may, first of all, learn
the true facts and that ant reserves be eliminated in the relations we have
with the international community&quot;, said Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan
Milutinovic at a press conference held yesterday. Even though Yugoslavia is
not a OSCE member, we thought that OSCE is the optimum framework for such a
mission - said Mr. Milutinovic adding that the statements released by the
European delegation will be evaluated by competent Yugoslav institutions -
i.e. &quot;within the framework of our system&quot;. Responding to a journalist
question, the Foreign Minister underscored that as far as local elections,
and elections in general, are concerned, in our country the final word
isn't that of the courts nor that of the electoral commissions, but that of
the citizens. &quot;Consequently, any controversy will be settled by the vote of
the citizens, and there is no other solution&quot;, remarked Mr. Milutinovic.
The Reuters reporter asked about the damages Yugoslavia suffered
internationally by the events in Belgrade, and the Foreign Minister replied
that a distorted picture has been created in the world regarding all that
has happened in our country. &quot;An unfounded thesis has been launched, namely
that all elections have been annulled. It's not true that all election
results have been annulled - in fact the voters were newly called to the
polling stations to cast a ballot for the same candidates. We are not
talking about repeated elections with some new candidates, and the question
is why should anyone fear another verification of the will of the citizens.
The picture has been distorted in another sense as well. Opposition parties
accepted the third round of elections in the constituencies where it was
winning. Wherever they lost, they rejected the repeated voting&quot;, said Mr.
Milutinovic and added: &quot;Our country has suffered certain damages. It is
clear that we have to maintain a dialogue on all issues, but within the
framework of the institutions. Anything less would be non-democracy. It
would be an attack on those citizens that have a different opinion.

<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> CHINESE INVESTMENTS IN YUGOSLAVIA</H3>
The Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to Yugoslavia - H.E. Ju
Ankang, stated in an interview for the Novi Sad daily &quot;Dnevnik&quot; that &quot;...
the Chinese Government gives great importance to the development of
relations with Yugoslavia, and the Chinese people highly values the
friendship with the Yugoslav people.&quot;. Speaking about the economic
cooperation between China and Yugoslavia, Ambassador Ankang remarked that
all current contracts have been implemented as planned, with mutual
satisfaction. The Chinese Government is prompting Chinese companies and
provinces to send expert groups and delegations to Yugoslavia to personally
view the situation and the potentials, said Mr. Ju Ankang stressing that
the Chinese have plans to invest in Yugoslavia.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SESSION ON YUGOSLAV WTO MEMBERSHIP</H3>
The Federal Government discussed the draft documents concerning World Trade
Organization membership for Yugoslavia. This marks the practical part of
the procedure to make our country member of WTO. Current talks with the WTO
Secretariat indicate that conditions have been reached to initiate the
relations between WTO and FRY. It has been remarked that the Government and
the competent state bodies should finalize the memorandum on the Yugoslav
foreign trade system, the imports/exports liberalization program and the
list of customs concessions in the domain of agriculture and services.

<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> BULLETIN SUPPLEMENT: &quot;UNCLEAR INTENTIONS&quot;</H3>
Foreign media are carefully examining the current political events in
Serbia, indicating the latest moves made by President Milosevic to solve
the crisis and wondering more and more what is the true background of the
opposition protests and the true goals of the &quot;Together&quot; coalition. French
media give prime importance to the news that President Milosevic received a
delegation of college students from Nis. and thus made the first gesture
for the &quot;pacification&quot; of the situation created by opposition protests.
Paris dailies &quot;Le Figaro&quot; and &quot;Liberation&quot; quote in this regard the
statement made by Mr. Milosevic that &quot;all will be done to honor the law and
the will of the voters.&quot; French media also quote the statement made by
Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic - interpreted as an effort to settle the
current political crisis in Serbia quickly and justly. Reuters news agency
circulated a lengthy analytical commentary of the events after the local
elections in Serbia, indicating the cautious stand of the western countries.
The same source remarks that officials in various European capitals
indicated that this is due to the fact that President Milosevic is a key
figure in the implementation of the peace agreement for Bosnia. Diplomats
quoted by Reuters, stress that there is a discrepancy between the stands
assumed by the US, the leading European countries and Russia concerning the
position towards the Serbian opposition. The same British agency indicates
the official Russian position, namely that the crisis should be settled
internally, without foreign involvement. Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov - quoted by Reuters - asked the international community at the
beginning of this week to refrain from pressures against Belgrade, because
&quot;...this might generate more unfavorable conditions or serious difficulties
for the continuation of the peace process.&quot; The Guardian - a highly
influential London daily published an article authored by its reporter -
Julian Burger, about the nationalist grounds of the protests now organized
by the &quot;Together&quot; coalition. Offering a portrait of &quot;Together&quot; leaders:
Zoran Djindjic and Vuk Draskovic, the same journalist remarks that that
they are compromised by their efforts to charm the right-wing extremists.
Right from the start, Draskovic was opposed to the Bosnian Serb leadership,
but at the same time the movement he is heading advocated militant
nationalism and had paramilitary formations at the beginning of the war in
former Yugoslavia, turning to pacifism later on. The Vienna newspaper &quot;Der
Standard&quot; also analyzes thoroughly the behavior of Draskovic and Djindjic,
indicating a number of contradictions and incongruent actions in their
political efforts. The same daily affirms that Draskovic rejected all
political actions of the Belgrade authorities, aimed at normalizing the
relations with the international community and implementing the Dayton
Agreement. The German weekly &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; indicates that the opposition
alliance embodied by the coalition &quot;together&quot; is progressively falling
apart due to the differences the leaders of the three member parties have
regarding the national question. The same magazine also remarks that Adem
Demaci - one of ethnic Albanian extremist leaders - sent a message of
support to the Serbian opposition coalition.

<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> CROATIAN-SLOVENIAN BATTLE FOR EUROPEAN CORRIDORS</H3>
Ever since they seceded from former Yugoslavia and became independent
states, Croatia and Slovenia seem unable to settle major bilateral
controversies such as the border (especially in the Bay of Piran), the use
of the common nuclear power plant &quot;Krsko&quot; and the debt of Ljubljana Bank to
Croatian savings holders. These problems now include new ones, one of which
has been dubbed &quot;diplomatic incident&quot; by Zagreb newspapers. The two
neighboring countries are in &quot;direct contrast&quot; because of a document on the
construction of a railway and road corridor. In fact, EU, Italian,
Slovenian, Hungarian, Slovak and Ukrainian representatives signed a
protocol on the project that will link Venice, Trieste, Capo d'Istria,
Ljubljana, Budapest and Kiev. Recently the Croatian Minister of Transports
refused to sign the document because of Slovenia. Croatia had proposed that
that another ramification in the direction of Zagreb and Fiume should be
added to the corridor, but the motion was rejected because of Slovenian
objections, even thought he other partners were in favor. The Zagreb daily
&quot;Vjesnik&quot; remarks that the Slovenian political hard-liners want to affirm
the &quot;central role&quot; of Slovenia in the new axis Rome-Ljubljana-Budapest -
&quot;at the expenses of Croatia&quot;.

<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> SANCTIONS FOR LOCAL RULERS IN THE BOSNIAN FEDERATION</H3>
Mr. Christian Schwartz Shilling - international mediator for the
implementation of the Moslem-Croatian Federation, told the Moslem media
yesterday local the local authorities in certain Federation towns are
treating the minority population in an inhuman way, denying them the right
to work and the freedom of movement. He quoted the example of Jajce, Stolac,
Capljina and Livno - towns under Croatian control, and Bugojno and Vares
run by the Moslems. &quot;Local rulers in these counties are saying one thing
and doing the opposite, because what they have to do exists only on paper
and is not being implemented&quot;, said Mr. Shilling. Sanctions have been
introduced against these counties because they are ignoring the Dayton
Agreement. They will not receive funds for reconstruction projects and will
be given humanitarian aid only. Mr. Shilling also threatened all local
rulers who are ignoring the Federation Constitution and the Dayton document,
that they will be replaced.

<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> PROTEST FOR KISTANJE</H3>
The Association of Refugees in FR Yugoslavia, addressed a letter of protest
to the UN Security Council, the Contact Group members, Mr. Karl Bildt, and
Ms. Sadako Ogata, in reaction to the recent decision of the Croatian
Government, namely that the little town of Kistanje in former Republic of
Serbian Krajina - &quot;...a traditionally and typically Serb-populated zone in
Dalmatia&quot; should be settled by Croatian refugees only. The letter stresses
that this method of stripping people of their place of birth and property
is just another form of genocide perpetuated in peace time, and a drastic
breach of the peace agreement signed by Croatia and Yugoslavia.

<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> CIVILIANS MASSACRED</H3>
Hague Tribunal Judges, gathering witness statements on Croatian crimes
against Krayina Serbs, showed particular interest in the past several days
for the Croatian Air Force raids on the Krayina refugee columns in the
vicinity of Bosanski Petrovac. Various witnesses have given statements in
this regard. One of them was J.P. from the little town of Donji Lapac. He
was part of a column that had no military vehicles in it. &quot;We were some 12
kilometers from Bosanski Petrovac near the village of Bravsko. The column
stopped for a rest. Then a terrible explosion was heard. It was on August
6th last year. I was thrown out from the truck I was in and landed about 20
meters away.&quot; The same witness said that in the raid, several people were
killed: Krstan Vukovic and his son Darko, and two young children - Nevenka
and Zarko Rajic &quot;In front of the truck there was a car in flames. A four
member family died in it. &quot;I never found out how many people died then, but
about 100 meters of road were stained with blood. It reminded me of a
slaughter house&quot;, said J.P. A special investigations team will imminently
start interviewing witnesses of crimes committed against Serbs in Western
Slavonia during the &quot;Operation Flash&quot;. For the time being, the Hague
investigative judges are not prepared to reveal when the indictments for
these crimes will be made, maybe because they have realized that so many
were committed in Krayina.

The views on the events in Yugoslavia, which these last days on two
occasions were stated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia Yevgeny
Primakov, are reflecting the official stand of Moscow, stated yesterday the
official spokesman of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Genady
Tarasov. He stated this in view of the criticism expressed by one of the
leaders of the coalition &quot;Zajedno&quot; Vuk Draskovic on Russian Television,
regarding the stands of Minister Primakov, spoken in Lisbon and in London
concerning the events taking place in Belgrade. In the information program
of the Moscow TV channel NTV, Draskovic while accusing the authorities in
Serbia, also stated that Primakov &quot;has offended the democratic Serbia&quot;, and
expressed hope that &quot;this is not the support of democratic Russia&quot;. This is
no private opinion of Minister Primakov, but an official stand of Russia,
underlined Tarasov at the press conference. &quot;We hope that no one reasonable
will attempt to dispute this, especially not a citizen of some other
country&quot;, added Tarasov.

<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> HITLER'S PENSIONS FOR 3000 SLOVENIANS</H3>
Hitler's pensions are still being received by 3,000 Slovenians who as the
members of the ill-famed SS troops and Vermaht, were fighting during World
War Two in the Nazi units, claims the Alliance of Slovenians mobilized in
the German Fascist army. Precise data of this have been concealed for years,
and it is now estimated that the number of pensioners of the Hitler Germany
in Slovenia exceeds the official data of the Alliance. There are no
complete data even in the Slovenian Institute for Pension Insurance,
because such pensions most often are being collected either personally or
with the help of friends and relatives in Germany. According to the
documentation which is more and more coming into the public focus, Slovenia
is the second state in the world, after the United States, according to the
number of Hitler's pensioners. Ljubljana press in 1989 on several occasions
published names of renown Slovenians who were members of the elite Nazi
units. Among them is also the former high official of the former Yugoslavia
and a person of confidence of the-then Slovenian republican leadership -
Stane Dolanc.

<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> ZAGREB UNDERMINES EVERYTHING</H3>
During last year into the area of former Yugoslavia a much smaller number
of refugees has returned than expected, stated in Geneva the U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State John Cornblum at the international conference of the
Work Group for Humanitarian Affairs of the Council for Peace Implementation.
He especially underlined the problem of Serbian refugees from Croatia,
saying that the Croat authorities have allowed only a small number of
refugees to return to their homes. &quot;Croat authorities are also very slow&quot;,
said Cornblum, &quot;in issuing permits to those refugees who are willing to
return. Croats are continuing to harass Serbs who have remained in Krajina,
authorities are not protecting victims of such behavior and are in this way
practically sending messages to Serbs in Eastern Slavonia and those who are
in exile and wish to return.&quot; Cornblum also stated the following: &quot;Zagreb
must stop such behavior, because the international community will consider
the Croat authorities responsible for everything that they have failed to

<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> SECRET MUSLIM PLAN FOR SETTLING IN THE SEPARATION ZONES</H3>
Representatives of the Municipality of Zvornik had talks with the
representatives of the International Commission for Settling of the
Separation Zones and informed them of the real background of the problem of
forcible settling of Muslims in some villages of this municipality.
Presented were also true documents from which it is obvious what are the
true wishes and intentions of the Muslims: by seizure of Jusici and Dugi
Dio to cut off the Republic of Srpska and gain access to the place of
Kozluk which is situated immediately close to the Drina River. &quot;From the
secret Muslim documents it is seen&quot;, stated the representative of the
Serbian side Nikola Vukovic, &quot;that cutting off of the Republic of Srpska
into two parts should have been done by the use of civilians and disguised
military persons until the end of next year, and all this with the help of
the UNHCR and the other international organizations&quot;. &quot;Both the Muslim and
international representatives remained speechless when they were faced with
this undeniable proof of militarily planned settling of the parts of the
Municipality of Zvornik, which is in complete controversy with the Dayton
Accords&quot;, said Vukovic.

<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> DITUOUR CONDEMNS THE ANTI-SERBIAN CAMPAIGN</H3>
It is a virtue to support Serbs, reads the message of the speech pronounced
recently by the French author and academician Jean Ditour, whose extensive
excerpts are quoted yesterday in &quot;Le Figaro&quot;. At the annual session of the
French Academy, Ditour held an inspired speech about the virtue and thus,
among others, covered the question of the world campaign against Serbs,
conducted after the eruption of the war in Bosnia. Standing in the defence
of Serbs, for whom he says that all the sins and accusations for the
greatest crimes have been placed on their shoulders, Ditour goes back into
history in order to show the sufferings of the Serbian people in general,
not only in Bosnia, and in order to underline its virtues. &quot;The
philosophers, intellectuals, professional humanitarian workers, governments,
the United Nations, The Hague Tribunal and the entire world had suppressed
Serbs&quot;, says Ditour, asking himself whether justice and virtue are really
blind. &quot;Serbs are our brothers in arms&quot;, says the academician, adding that
&quot;the virtue must be&quot; - to continue the old alliance and &quot;to embrace Serbian
interests&quot;. Ditour forcibly strived for the French to return to this virtue.

<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> LILIC: THE AGREEMENT OF ALL PARTIES NECESSARY IN THE INTEREST OF
CITIZENS</H3>
President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Zoran Lilic during his
yesterday's visit to the Telecommunications PTT Center of Serbia, while
speaking of the actual political situation in the country after the second
round of the local elections, among others, stated the following: &quot;I am
convinced that all those who wish well to Serbia and Montenegro are looking
for the solution exclusively in the joint state. There is an enormous
responsibility both of the position and of the opposition in view of the
awakened hopes of separatists and some foreign factors that, on the discord
most of all of Serbs, they will finally succeed in achieving some targets
and de-stabilize Serbia bringing about its possible disintegration.&quot; All
the pressures and threats to come into power through unlawful means, are
not an honorable thing for any one thinking in such a way to break-down
Serbia, said Lilic. On the other hand, he continued, the position and the
party in power must accept, wherever there were determined irregularities
of its members, the justified demands of the opposition and initiate the
question of responsibility of their members.  Underlining that this is not
questionable, because what Serbia needs today above all are peace,
stability and not provocations and possible conflicts, Lilic added: &quot;What
is needed is the agreement of all the parties in the interest of citizens
who have not given a mandate to anyone to de-stabilize the country&quot;.

<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> MILOSEVIC: THE TRUTH - IN THE INTEREST OF ALL CITIZENS OF
SERBIA</H3>
Delegation of students of the University of Nis, requested yesterday an
audience with the President of the Republic Slobodan Milosevic. Three
members of the delegation, who underlined that they are not members of any
party, handed over to the President the letter of the students' protest
board of the University of Nis. During the talks with students, President
Milosevic stated that there is no fear that the truth will remain concealed.
&quot;On the contrary, I think that for all the state bodies the highest value
in the functioning of a state is the need to respect Constitution and
uphold laws and for those state bodies to function in accordance with the
Constitution and law&quot;. &quot;I wish to tell you&quot;, continued President, &quot;that
everything that will be done in every task, not only this one which is very
important, and concerns the elections, I think is in the interest of all
the citizens of Serbia to be resolved in the institutions of our Republic&quot;.
&quot;We are our own masters in Serbia and we must resolve our problems within
our own institutions. This, of course, does not mean that we do not wish
cooperation with the other countries. We think that our country can be a
good partner, but that it should not be anybody's servant, and neither
should it bow its head.&quot; President of the Republic submitted to the
Government of the Republic of Serbia documentation which was handed over to
him by the delegation of the students from Nis and requested the Government
that the Ministry of Justice examines thoroughly the entire submitted
documentation and presents to this effect a detailed report, with the
obligation for this report to be entirely made public.

<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</A> THEY PLAYED FOOTBALL WITH A SEVERED HEAD</H3>
Investigating judges of The Hague  Tribunal are to complete today hearing
of witnesses of the crimes which the members of the Croat Army and police
have committed against Serbs during the aggression on Krajina last year,
when more than 2,000 Serbs were killed or are missing. Hearing of the
witnesses in Belgrade is taking place in cooperation with the offices of
The Hague Tribunal and the Documentation Center of Krajina &quot;Veritas&quot;. Among
the monstrous crimes committed against Serbs is also the case from Pakostan
where Tudjman's soldiers were playing football with the severed head of
Djuro Cupic from Jagodnja Gornja. There are such and similar testimonies of
the Croat crimes against Serbs committed during the aggression on Krajina,
from Miljevac in 1992 until &quot;The Storm&quot; in 1995, and over 150 cases in the
documentation of the &quot;Veritas&quot;. Most of these files have been taken over by
The Hague Tribunal.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC RECEIVES AMBASSADOR OF FRANCE</H3>
President of the Republic Slobodan Milosevic received yesterday the newly-
appointed, extraordinary and plenipotentiary Ambassador of France to the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Stanislas Filiole. Satisfaction was
expressed because of the successful development of the bilateral
cooperation between our country and the Republic of France. It was
underlined that Yugoslavia and France are attaching great importance to the
strengthening of friendly relations and mutual confidence, on the basis of
equality and firm orientation towards peace and stability in the world, as
well as to strengthening of the process of linkage between states and
peoples. President Milosevic wished the Ambassador of France success in his
mission in Belgrade.

<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> BRCKO - THE KEY TO WAR AND PEACE</H3>
Ever since the main arbiter Robert Owen announced the possibility for Brcko
to be placed under the international protectorate, this city had become the
focus of attention of the entire world public. The spirits actually, were
greatly disturbed from the very moment when Serbs from the Republic of
Srpska told Mr. Owen that there can be no bargaining about this city and
that no protectorate whatsoever is possible. Realizing that passing of such
a decision would mean a new war, the main arbiter Owen extended the
deadline for the final decision until February 15, 1997. That the anxieties
of Serbs from the Republic of Srpska were not groundless and that around
Brcko some strange games are being played, is also confirmed by the latest
information coming from the Croat side. Showing until now that they are not
interested in entering the verbal duel between Serbs and Muslims, the
Croats in the latest edition of the &quot;Hrvatska revija&quot; (&quot;Croat Magazine&quot;)
are openly admitting that Brcko &quot;is the key to the new war or to final
peace&quot;, and that &quot;the one who loses Brcko in some way is also losing Bosnia-
Herzegovina&quot;.

<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> CARE FOR THE NEW GENERATIONS</H3>
Federal Minister and President of the Federal Commission for Cooperation
with the UNESCO, Margit Savovic, stated that the rights of children and
their protection will be one of the priorities of the policy of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia. By adopting the Declaration of the Federal
Government on the protection and promotion of the right of child in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on December 12 this year, this has marked a
successful completion of one year of work on the Yugoslav plan of action
for children until the year 2000 and onwards, said Margit Savovic. National
action plan should make possible better analysis of the state of protection
and development of children, increase of resources and better management
over funds allocated to children, a greater responsibility of the
institutions and local authorities in the change of policies for
improvement of quality of life of children and youth. Elaboration of this
plan started in a very difficult period, when because of sanctions,
secession and a war environment, there was a drastic fall of economic
activities, employment and a standard of living of the population. In spite
of all this, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a country-signatory of
the Convention on the Rights of Child and the World Declaration on
Protection of Children and Youth, is the first among the former Yugoslav
republics to pass this program.

<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> GROWTH OF PRODUCTION OF 7.3 PERCENT</H3>
During the eleven months of this year, in comparison with the same period
last year, the industrial production was increased for 7.3 percent,
reported Mirjana Rankovic, deputy director of the Federal Institute for
Statistics. In this period the growth of production was recorded in
metallurgy (44.4 percent) and in the production of non-metals and
construction materials (26.3 percent). In the sectors which have so far
recorded the fall of production (textiles, leather goods, rubber, food
stuffs industry, tobacco production) there was a stabilization and even a
significant growth of production.

<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> CHINESE DELEGATION IN THE CHAMBER OF ECONOMY OF SERBIA</H3>
Economic delegation of the Chinese province of Heilondjijang, headed by the
Deputy Secretary General of the Government of that province, Cai Dji, had
talks in the Chamber of Economy of Serbia with the representatives of our
companies about the promotion of the trade exchange and possibilities of
industrial cooperation. Together with the information about the economic
capabilities of China, the guests have especially underlined their interest
for import of steel, fertilizers, raw materials for textile industry,
machines and equipment. It was agreed that our businessmen in June next
year, on very favorable conditions, will take part at the general fair in
Harbin, at which they were until now presented only through the information
material.

<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> A TRADITIONALLY INDEPENDENT DEVELOPMENT PATH</H3>
Yugoslavia and Serbia have had their own interior development and course of
political events, and the events taking place now are greatly different
from the ones in the Eastern European countries over the past years. This
is stated in the commentary of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in which, as on a very
few occasions over the past days, a broader and a fuller picture is offered
to the American public about the events taking place in Yugoslavia. The
commentator states historical facts about the independent politics of
Yugoslavia in comparison with the countries of the Eastern European block
after World War Two. For such a political path there is a broad political
support in Yugoslavia, underlines the newspaper, admitting the fact that
war in the vicinity and economic sanctions have caused great economic
stagnation of the country. The newspaper also underlines some views on the
present-day Serbian opposition. It writes that over the past years it was
often having nationalistic coloring, that its targets are narrow and that
it has gathered only one part of the so-called middle class and a part of
the civil intelligentsia. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reports on the calls of the
leaders of Serbian opposition for help from abroad. During a number of
talks in the United States they were asking for assistance for the
realization of their political targets and the support of foreign circles,
even when such a support, as was reiterated on several occasions, would
mean an isolation and a difficult life of the citizens of Yugoslavia.

<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> PRIMAKOV: EVENTS IN BELGRADE ARE INTERIOR AFFAIR OF YUGOSLAVIA</H3>
Russia &quot;has the stand towards the latest events taking place in Belgrade as
towards an interior affair of Yugoslavia&quot;, stated Minister of Foreign
Affairs of Russia Yevgeny Primakov. He expressed his support to the
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy Lamberto Dini who recently visited
Belgrade and had talks with the President of Serbia Slobodan Milosevic.
Russia welcomes the idea of inviting to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
the mission of the O.S.C.E. in order &quot;to assess the situation&quot;, said
Primakov. In this he underlined that everyone is concerned with the problem
of human rights everywhere and democratization of this or that society, but
that this should not grow into interference in the interior affairs of
another state. According to the Interfaks report, Primakov pointed out at
the fact that the opposition had refused the proposal of President
Milosevic to have negotiations at a round table. &quot;I think that the world
community should correctly assess this move by Slobodan Milosevic and the
fact that he is not applying force towards the opposition&quot;, said Primakov
and added that &quot;all this should have an adequate reflection in the world
public opinion and the reactions of the other states&quot;.

<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</A> YUGOSLAVIA'S PLACE IN THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE</H3>
President of the Chamber of Citizens of the Federal Assembly, Milomir Minic,
received yesterday the delegation of the Parliamentary Assembly of the
Council of Europe headed by its Vice President Andrash Barsoni. Members of
the delegation stated that the purpose of their visit is continuation of
the dialogue with the Federal Assembly. They emphasized that they are
attaching great importance to the visit to our country, because it is the
best way to be informed of the stands of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
on the implementation of the peace process and the situation in the country
and in the region. Minic pointed out that the basic targets of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, further to the support to strengthening of peace,
stability and a dynamic economic development in the region in general, is
the equitable cooperation with other countries, an active participation in
all the international organizations and integrations. It was mutually
stated that it is necessary for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, i.e.
its Federal Assembly, to take part in work of the Council of Europe and its
Assembly. Delegation of the Assembly of the Council of Europe announced
that at its January session, which will debate the implementation of the
Dayton Accords, the delegation of the Federal Assembly will be invited to
attend.

<P><H3>NEWS IN DETAIL</H3>
<H4>Pangalos satisfied with British positions on Cyprus</H4>
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos expressed satisfaction yesterday over
his talks here with British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, noting that
Britain's positions on the Cyprus problem and Greek-Turkish relations are
very positive.
<P>Pangalos said it was now clear that Britain was not setting the settlement
of the Cyprus issue as a condition for the start of negotiations for
Cyprus' entry to the EU, or even the start of talks for a Cyprus settlement.&quot;
<P>&quot;But they (Britain) say, and this I will not have trouble accepting myself,
that if there is progress on the Cyprus problem then negotiations between
the Union and Cyprus would be much easier, conducted in a better atmosphere
and concern the entire population of Cyprus.&quot; &quot;We do not want a Cyprus' EU
accession to be to the detriment of the Turkish Cypriot community,&quot; Mr.
Pangalos added.
<P>Asked to comment on the British minister's statements regarding an &quot;arms
race&quot; in Cyprus, which Mr. Rifkind termed as &quot;a step in the wrong direction,
&quot; Mr. Pangalos said:
<P>&quot;Athens, and I believe Nicosia also, are in favour of a decrease in
armaments, in favour of demilitarisation of Cyprus. But demilitarisation
must first start from the mightier,&quot; he added.
<P>Mr. Pangalos said Turkey has not yet accepted the idea of the demilitarisation
of the island and retains there 300 tanks, heavy artillery and 40,000
Turkish soldiers.&quot;
<P><H4>Euro Court condemns Turkey for human rights violations in Cyprus</H4>
President Glafcos Clerides said a decision yesterday by the European Court
of Human Rights, which found Turkey guilty of continuing human rights
violations, will have immense effects on the Cyprus problem.
<P>Attorney General Alecos Markides described the decision as &quot;historic&quot;.
<P>Yesterday's ruling by the Strasbourg-based court marks an unprecedented
move which offers the opportunity to hundreds of Greek Cypriot refugees to
claim their right to use and enjoy their property in the Turkish-occupied
part of the island republic.
<P>The court's decision was warmly welcomed by lawyer Achilleas Demetriades,
who argued the case before the European Court on behalf of his client,
Greek Cypriot refugee Titina Loizidou, a summer resident of the currently
Turkish-occupied port city of Kyrenia.
<P>Describing the decision as a &quot;great success&quot;, President Clerides noted that
Ms Loizidou's case was justified.
<P>The decision also states that the &quot;Republic of Cyprus remains the sole
legitimate government of Cyprus&quot; and that the international community does
not regard the puppet regime in occupied Cyprus as a state under international
law.
<P>Mr. Demetriades, who took Turkey to the court seven years ago, told the
press conference that the ruling acknowledges that the property in question
&quot;was, is and will remain the property of my client.&quot;
<P>He explained that he has already asked for half a million Cyprus pounds in
compensation (about one million US dollars) with regard to the denial of
access to the property and has also asked to exercise freely the right to
peacefully enjoy her property.
<P>Should Turkey refuse to pay damages, the applicant can ask for yesterday's
ruling to be implemented with regard to Turkey's property or funds
allocated to the country by international organisations.
<P><H4>Talks between Greece, FYROM resume</H4>
Talks between Greece's permanent representative to the United Nations,
Christos Zacharakis, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's
(FYROM) representative, Ivan Tosevski, resumed here yesterday on the issue
of the one-time Yugoslav republic's name.
<P>The talks were being held under the aegis of special UN mediator Cyrus
Vance who said that &quot;the two sides are expected to meet again in January,
at a date to be detemined in the near future.&quot;
<P><H4>Diplomatic corps' strike suspended</H4>
A strike called by the foreign ministry's diplomatic employees will be
suspended as of Monday after the Union of Diplomatic Employees' general
assembly reached a majority decision on the issue yesterday. Diplomats will
not turn up for work today and tomorrow.
<P>According to reports, the diplomats' representatives received assurances
from the government that their claim that an overseas bonus should not be
taxed will be examined in January, before the tax bill is tabled in
Parliament.
<P>The diplomats' union provided special permission for diplomats to accompany
President of the Republic Kostis Stephanopoulos on his four-day official
visit to Egypt, which begins tomorrow.
<P><H4>Farmers dismantle roadblocks in northern Greece</H4>
Farmers in northern Greece began to dismantle roadblocks which have stood
in place since the beginning of protests three weeks ago.
<P>At midnight Tuesday night, farmers and stockbreeders in the southern part
of Evros prefecture suspended their protest action and lifted a roadblock
at the Ardanios junction, freeing the flow of traffic between Alexandroupolis
and the Greek-Turkish border.
<P>The decision meant that 110 international transport trucks coming from
Turkey, which had been stranded at the Kipi border post for a fortnight,
could continue their journey to Greece and other European countries.
<P>The farmers' coordinating committee for Macedonia and Thrace decided to
lift their blockade of the road linking Thessaloniki with the Macedonia
International airport as goodwill gesture to the government.
<P>The committee, however, decided to maintain the blockade of other roads in
the prefectures of Thessaloniki, Imathia and in central Macedonia until
Friday, when it will reconvene to examine the situation.
<P><H4>SEB estimates losses</H4>
The value of industrial production lost as a result of farmers' mobilisations
amounts to 56 billion drachmas, a sum representing 0.7 per cent of the
estimated total for 1996, Association of Greek Industries (SEB) President
Iason Stratos told reporters.
<P>He added that deliveries of industrial goods were down by 134 billion
drachmas, of which 84 billion were destined for the domestic market, and
the rest abroad, while 208,000 working days had been lost, corresponding to
some two billion drachmas.
<P><H4>`97 budget follows `necessary` economic policy</H4>
National Economy Minister Yiannos Papantoniou outlined the government's
economic policy on the second day of Parliamentary debate on the 1997 state
budget yesterday, stressing that it would be a difficult year.
<P>Appearing optimistic over the outcome of economic policy, Mr. Papantoniou
called on businessmen, working people and property owners to de-escalate
their nominal incomes claims, so as to safeguard their real incomes in a
better way with a decrease in inflation. Referring to the economy in
general, he said inflation decreased by 5.9 percentage points, the economy
recovered by 6.2 points over the last three-year period of economic output
anticipated by the Convergence Programme, while the deficit was decreased
by 6.6 units of the GDP.
<P>Mr. Papantoniou said that despite progress achieved, the country still had
a great deal of ground to cover to achieve real and nominal convergence
with its other European partners.
<P><H4>Traffic measures for Xmas exodus</H4>
Traffic police will introduce special measures to facilitate the exodus of
holiday makers from Athens during the Christmas holidays and the circulation
of vehicles and pedestrians in the city.
<P>An extra lane will be introduced for outgoing traffic from Dafni to the
Elefsina toll station on the Athens to Corinth highway between 2 p.m. and 8
p.m. on Christmas Eve and on Jan. 3, and at the same times and place on
Sunday, Dec. 22. The same measures will be applied on the same dates and
times at several stretches of the Athens to Lamia highway.
<P><H4>SOS on Turkish plans for nuclear plant</H4>
The environmental organisation &quot;Mediterranean SOS&quot; yesterday warned of the
dangers posed by Turkish plans to build the country's first nuclear power
plant at Akkuyu in the area of Mersin on its eastern Mediterranean coast.
The organisation called on local government, ecological groups and citizens
in Greece, Turkey and Cyprus to cooperate in protesting the planned
construction.
<P>Mersin lies to the north of Cyprus and just 300 kilometres from the
Dodecanese islands.
<P>Mediterranean SOS condemned what it called &quot;the promotion of unsafe
technology in the Balkans by the nuclear lobby and the nuclear mafia&quot; at a
time when nuclear energy is being abandoned in countries with a strong
ecology movement.
<P><H4>Glory of Byzantium to go on show at NY's Met</H4>
A major exhibition entitled &quot;The Glory of Byzantium&quot; will be held in March
1997 at the Metropolitan Museum of New York.
<P>Among the treasures to be sent to New York for the exhibition is the 13th
century Liturgy of St. Basil from the Library of St. John's Monastery on
the island of Patmos.
<P>The cross on the frontspiece of the liturgy has been selected by renowned
Greek jeweller Makis Mihalas as his 1997 good luck charm, in honour of the
event.
<P><H4>Museum exhibit</H4>
Approval has been granted for the exhibition &quot;Aidonion Treasure&quot;, to be
presented again at the National Archaeological Museum, by order of the
culture ministry.
<P>The exhibition will open in the museum's periodical exhibitions hall
tomorrow and will continue until May 31.
<P><H4>Onassis Foundation honours Olympic medallists</H4>
Athens 19/12/1996 (ANA)
<P>The Alexandros Onassis Foundation honoured several athletes and their
coaches yesterday that distinguished themselves in the recent Atlanta
Olympics.
<P>The foundation is the sole private body which has begun an effort over the
past 10 years to support sports in Greece by offering athletic scholarships,
up to 83 so far. Among those studying with the foundation's scholarships
are gymnastics Olympic gold medallist Yiannis Melissanidis, national high-
jumping champion Lambros Papakostas and wrestling champion Iordanis
Constantinidis.
<P>Speaking at the event, the foundation's President Stelios Papadimitriou
said the board will also provide scholarships for the children of the
Olympic champions. Namely, a full university scholarship in Greece and then
an overseas scholarship for post-gr aduate studies.
<P><H4>Melbourne Greeks to celebrate their centenary</H4>
The Greek communities in the city of Melbourne and state-wide will mark the
first hundred years since the Greek community's foundation with a series of
events lasting throughout 1997, it was announced yesterday.
<P>Events include cultural conferences with the participation of Greek
intellectuals from Greece and expatriate communities abroad, photographic
and art exhibitions, sports events, lectures, concerts, theatre performances
and a world conference entitled &quot;H ellenism in the 21st century.&quot;
<P><H3>WEATHER</H3>
Improved weather is forecast for most parts of Greece with scattered rain
in the western regions and the Aegean islands, but improvement is expected
later in the day. Athens will be partly cloudy with sunny spells and
temperatures ranging from 10-16C. Same for Thessaloniki with temperatures
between 6-13C.

<H4>Greek Ambassador among Peru hostages</H4>
Greece's Ambassador to Peru Alkiviades Karokis is among the approximately
200 hostages held by Peruvian rebels at the Japanese Ambassador's residence
in Lima, Foreign Ministry sources confirmed today.
<P>Guerrillas from the Cuban-inspired Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement
(MRTA) stormed the Japanese Ambassador's residency late Tuesday in an
operation called 'Breaking the Silence&quot;, demanding the release of jailed
comrades.
<P>The hostages, which include the Peruvian Foreign and Agriculture Ministers,
local legislators and numerous ambassadors and diplomats from around the
world, were attending a recpetion in honour of the Japanese Emperor's
birthday.
<P>The same sources said Ambassador Karokis' wife was among the approximately
80 women and old people released.
<P><H4>Port workers ban on foreign-flag ships 'unacceptable,' minister says</H4>
Merchant Marine Minister Stavros Soumakis said today it was unacceptable
for foreign-flagged vessels to be prevented from entering or leaving Greek
ports by the ongoing nationwide dockworkers' and seamen's strike.
<P>''This kind of logic serves neither the interests of the seamen nor of
shipping in general...,'' Soumakis said, when asked to comment on the
decision of the Panhellenic Seamen's Federation (PNO) yesterday to extend a
48-hour strike which began on Monday for a further two days.
<P>In a related development, minor incidents broke out at Igoumenitsa, western
Greece, when two foreign-flagged ferry-boats headed for Ancona, Italy tired
to dock at the port to let off passengers.
<P>The two vessels, the ''Ionian Star'' and the ''Brindisi'', both of which
belong to Greek companies, had previously been given permission by the PNO
administrative board to dock at Igoumenitsa, because they were sailing
under foreign flags.
<P>However, when the first ferry-boat let its ramp down, about 20 striking
dockworkers boarded her and tried to persuade the few Greek crew members to
join the strike. At the same time, dozens of trucks began to move towards
the ramp to disembark, triggering strong protests from the striking
workers.
<P>The port police intervened to restore order and arrested three striking
dockworkers who were released shortly afterwards.
<P>A similar incident took place at Piraeus when five trucks tried to board
the ferry-boat ''Daedalus'' with destination Crete. Again, scuffles broke
out between drivers and striking dockworkers until order was restored by a
public prosecutor.
<P>Meanwhile, more than 300 trucks were stranded at the central port city of
Patras this morning as seamen extended a 48-hour strike that began on
Monday for another day.
<P>The trucks were scheduled to board ferry boats to Italy and Piraeus.
<P><H4>Airport employees strike</H4>
Airport employees will stage a 24-hour nationwide strike on Friday
demanding improvements in their wages and other fringe benefits, the
Federation of Civil Aviation Employee Associations (OSYPA) announced
today.
<P>The announcement said that the employees are demanding that four benefits
they recieve be excluded from the new salary scale, an 8% salary increase,
and legislation of overtime and holiday remuneration.
<P>Olympic Airways (OA) officials said they expected only minor problems on
tarmacs from the stoppage, as Air Traffic Controllers and civil aviation
technical staff were not taking part in the strike.
<P><H4>Farm minister announces compensation for crop losses</H4>
Agriculture Minister Stephanos Tzoumakas announced today that farmers who
have incurred losses due to bad weather would receive compensation, as
farmers continued to blockade roads around the country for the 20th
consecutive day.
<P>Speaking at a press conference, Tzoumakas said that compensation payments
would be made in January to farmers whose crops or installations were
damaged by recent bad weather.
<P>He said the ministry was in the process of drawing up lists of the damage
which will be sent to the European Union in order for the corresponding
compensation to be approved.
<P>The compensation, estimated at 10 billion drachmas, will be given to
farmers in Thessaly, Karditsa, Trikala, Larissa, Volos, Xanthi, Mytilene
and other areas of the country.
<P>Replying to questions, Tzoumakas clarified that the funds would be made
available from the Second Community Support Framework, a procedure which
had been approved by the European Commission.
<P>Tzoumakas also announced that the Agricultural Policy Council would be
convened for the first time on 10 January, the sessions of which would be
opened by Prime Minister Costas Simitis.
<P>Opposition party leaders and 43 representatives of the producer classes,
mainly farmers, exporters and industrialists active in the agricultural
sector, have also been invited to attend the council.
<P>Although no agenda has yet been prepared, it is expected that the meeting
will discuss all the problems facing the agricultural sector.
<P>Meanwhile, the board of administration of the union of truck drivers was
scheduled to meet at 18:00 local time today to decide whether or not they
would use their vehicles to block roads to Athens tomorrow in order to
prevent farmers from reaching the capital to take part in a protest
rally.
<P>If the truckers decide to block access to the capital, it will be in
protest against the 20-day blockade of roads by farmers which has left
hundreds of drivers stranded.
<P><H4>President to visit Egypt</H4>
President Kostis Stephanopoulos leaves on Friday for a four-day official
visit to Alexandria and Cairo at the invitation of his Egyptian counterpart
Hosni Mubarak.
<P>The two heads of state will have talks on Saturday in Cairo covering
bilateral relations, international developments and problems in the region
of the southeast Mediterranean.
<P>Stephanopoulos is also expected to brief Mubarak on major Greek foreign
policy issues such as the Cyprus problem and Greek-Turkish relations.
<P>Mubarak will most likely brief Stephanopoulos on developments in the Middle
East problem, given Egypt's leading role in the Arab world.
<P>Stephanopoulos' visit to Egypt takes on special significance in view of
Mubarak's visit to Turkey in July and Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan's visit to Cairo in October..
<P>During his stay in Egypt, Stephanopoulos will meet with members of the
Greek community and visit Luxor.
<P>It is the first visit to Egypt by a Greek president since March 1984, when
Constantine Karamanlis had talks with President Mubarak.
<P><H4>Athens comments on Rifkind statements</H4>
The government said today that a statement by British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind in which he referred to the possibility of a war between
Greece and Turkey in the Aegean was the minister's ''personal opinion''.
<P>''This opinion does not reflect the actual situation,'' government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said, stressing that the policy proposed by
Greece for de-escalating tension between Athens and Ankara could constitute
the basis for peace in the region.
<P>''The prospect of a military conflict is a long way off,'' Reppas
added.
<P><H4>Parliament debate on budget</H4>
Parliamentary debate on the government's new 1997 state budget began
yesterday as the General Confederation of Workers of Greece (GSEE) staged a
protest rally outside the legislature against the government's economic
policy.
<P>A vote on the budget will be taken midnight Saturday. The debate was
accompanied by a 24-hour nationwide strike called by the Civil Servants
Supreme Administrative Council (ADEDY).
<P>A delegation of ADEDY met with National Economy and Finance Minister
Yiannos Papantoniou, who did not rule out the possibility of improvements
being made to the unified salary scale.
<P>The Panhellenic Seamen's Federation (PNO) decided to continue the 48-hour
strike called on all Greek-flagged vessels.
<P>The government has ruled out the possibility of Prime Minister Costas
Simitis meeting the farmers for as long as tractors remain on the
streets.
<P><H4>Athens` commitment to Bosnia peacekeeping forces</H4>
National Defence Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos reaffirmed yesterday that
Greece had participated and will actively participate in NATO's peacekeeping
forces in Bosnia.
<P>Speaking to reporters after a council of NATO's defence ministers in
Brussels, Mr. Tsohatzopoulos also referred to aggressive statements
recently made by Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller, saying she was
slipping from political reality for reasons of domestic consumption in
Turkey.
<P>Yesterday's session, attended by France after many years and by Spain for
the first time, focused on granting approval for NATO's new mission in
Bosnia under the name SFOR, to replace NATO's current force IFOR.
<P>One of the issues discussed was responsibility for NATO's southern
administration, where there are conflicting views between the US and
France.
<P>&quot;It appears we are headed for the creation of four regional inter-branch
and multinational headquarters - one each in Greece, Spain, Italy and
Turkey,&quot; he said.
<P>Mr. Tsohatzopoulos said the Turkish side reiterated its proposal for the
creation of a branch headquarters (naval or air) in Izmir, which will be
responsible for the entire Mediterranean region. He said the Greek side
reiterated its disagreement with the Turkish proposal considering it a
significant change in NATO's existing administrative balance.
<P>He further said Greece presented its own six-point proposal on NATO's
future structure, adding that despite the need for cooperation between the
two organisations each enjoyed its own autonomy.
<P><H4>Parthenon Marbles</H4>
Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos has announced that Greece will
officially submit an application for the return of the Parthenon Marbles
from the British Museum.
<P>&quot;I explained to my British counterpart that in the next few days he will
receive a letter with Greece's official demand for the return of the
marbles,&quot; the Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted Mr. Venizelos as saying
after the EU Culture Ministers' Council session in Brussels yesterday.
<P><H4>State Dept. avoids comment</H4>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns avoided comment on threats
recently made against Greece by Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller,
saying he had not seen her statements, but made an overall statement on
threats of such a nature. &quot;Firstly, the US expects from all its allies,
including Greece and Turkey, to have relations of cooperation without any
kind of threats of force or use of force. This is a basic principle in
relations between allies and all our allies in NATO will agree with us.
Secondly, we support absolutely Turkey's inclusion in European mechanisms
and we made this known both to the European Union and to European countries
at a bilateral level. &quot;We do not support any kind of threats by one
NATO ally against another... NATO is not an organisation whose members
fight against each other,&quot;he said.
<P><H4>Diplomats to consider further strike action</H4>
Union representatives from the foreign ministry's diplomatic and administrative
employees will convene general assemblies at noon today to consider whether
or not to continue their strike.
<P>The strike, and primarily that of the diplomatic corps, has created serious
problems for the country's diplomatic missions abroad as well as for
communication between Greek embassies with Athens.
<P>According to reports, Foreign Undersecretary Christos Rozakis had a meeting
with a representation of diplomatic officials on Monday. Mr. Rozakis said
the government is examining the demand that an overseas bonus for diplomats
should not be taxed, which Finance Undersecretary Nikos Christodoulakis
rejected last week.

<H4>Aris-Besiktas game to be replayed</H4>
Basketball's governing body, FIBA, has ordered a Korac Cup match between
Aris of Thessaloniki and Besiktas of Istanbul to be replayed in Athens on 7
January without the presence of supporters.
<P>The second leg of the tie was held in Thessaloniki on 11 December but was
abandoned shortly after the start of the second half when Besiktas'
American forward, Gary Alexander, attacked Aris' Dinos Angelidis.
<P>Aris was ahead 40-31 when the match was abandoned.
<P>FIBA also suspended Angelidis for three matches, Alexander for four and
fined Aris 45,000 marks, that is, about 6.8 million drachmas.
<P><H3>WEATHER</H3>
Overcast with rainfall and possible storms in the western and eastern
regions and the islands, but improvement of the weather expected later in
the night. Athens will be cloudy with possible rain in the evening and
temperatures ranging from 11-17C. Thessaloniki will be partly cloudy with
temperatures between 7-14C.

<H4>Parliament debate on budget</H4>
Parliamentary debate on the government's new 1997 state budget began
yesterday as the General Confederation of Workers of Greece (GSEE) staged a
protest rally outside the legislature against the government's economic
policy.
<P>A vote on the budget will be taken midnight Saturday. The debate was
accompanied by a 24-hour nationwide strike called by the Civil Servants
Supreme Administrative Council (ADEDY).
<P>A delegation of ADEDY met with National Economy and Finance Minister
Yiannos Papantoniou, who did not rule out the possibility of improvements
being made to the unified salary scale.
<P>The Panhellenic Seamen's Federation (PNO) decided to continue the 48-hour
strike called on all Greek-flagged vessels.
<P>The government has ruled out the possibility of Prime Minister Costas
Simitis meeting the farmers for as long as tractors remain on the
streets.
<P><H4>Avramopoulos to Albania</H4>
Athens Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos leaves for Tirana today at the
invitation of his local counterpart.
<P>He will also meet with Albanian president, Sali Berisha, and visit the town
of Sarande, with a sizeable ethnic Greek population.
<P><H4>Athens` commitment to Bosnia peacekeering forces</H4>
National Defence Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos reaffirmed yesterday that
Greece had participated and will actively participate in NATO's peacekeeping
forces in Bosnia.
<P>Speaking to reporters after a council of NATO's defence ministers in
Brussels, Mr. Tsohatzopoulos also referred to aggressive statements
recently made by Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller, saying she was
slipping from political reality for reasons of domestic consumption in
Turkey.
<P>Yesterday's session, attended by France after many years and by Spain for
the first time, focused on granting approval for NATO's new mission in
Bosnia under the name SFOR, to replace NATO's current force IFOR.
<P>One of the issues discussed was responsibility for NATO's southern
administration, where there are conflicting views between the US and
France.
<P>&quot;It appears we are headed for the creation of four regional inter-branch
and multinational headquarters - one each in Greece, Spain, Italy and
Turkey,&quot; he said.
<P>Mr. Tsohatzopoulos said the Turkish side reiterated its proposal for the
creation of a branch headquarters (naval or air) in Izmir, which will be
responsible for the entire Mediterranean region. He said the Greek side
reiterated its disagreement with the Turkish proposal considering it a
significant change in NATO's existing administrative balance.
<P>He further said Greece presented its own six-point proposal on NATO's
future structure, adding that despite the need for cooperation between the
two organisations each enjoyed its own autonomy.
<P><H4>Parthenon Marbles</H4>
Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos has announced that Greece will
officially submit an application for the return of the Parthenon Marbles
from the British Museum.
<P>&quot;I explained to my British counterpart that in the next few days he will
receive a letter with Greece's official demand for the return of the
marbles,&quot; the Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted Mr. Venizelos as saying
after the EU Culture Ministers' Council session in Brussels yesterday.
<P><H4>Clinton-Cyprus conflict</H4>
President Clinton on Monday called on Greece and Turkey to re-examine their
positions and reach out to one another.
<P>&quot;I intend to do whatever I can in these next four years to try to help work
out the situation in Cyprus, and work out the problems generally between
Greece and Turkey,&quot; President Clinton said at a news conference with
European Commission President Jacques Santer and Irish Prime Minister John
Bruton.
<P>&quot;I believe that the future of the European Union and the future of the
United States will be much brighter and much less troublesome if these
issues can be resolved,&quot; he said.
<P>&quot;Greece and Turkey,&quot; he added, have a lot more in common when facing the
future than those separating them. It is the past which continues to poison
their relations,&quot; President Clinton said, noting that Greece and Turkey are
two very important countries for a &quot; stable 21st century.&quot;
<P>Mr. Santer said that Cyprus' accession talks to the European Union were
expected to start in 1998. &quot;The position of the European Union in this is
very clear,&quot; he said.
<P><H4>Farmers` blockades drag on for 20th day,gov`t remains steadfast</H4>
Farmers in Viotia prefecture yesterday appeared to be scaling down their
protests as they lifted their main roadblock on the Athens-Lamia national
highway at the Kastro region, while protesting farmers elsewhere continued
mobilisations for the 20th consec utive day.
<P>Two smaller blockades at Akraifnio and Thebes, as well as roadblocks in the
area of Domokos and Neo Monastiri, Fthiotida remained in place.
<P>Meanwhile, the old and new highways to Patra continued to remain blocked at
Aigio, while farmers in Fthiotida approved the decision of the Pan-Thessaly
coordina-ting committee and will participate together with their families
in the farmers' protest ral ly in Athens on Thursday.
<P><H4>Papantoniou</H4>
In discussing the farmers' protests, National Economy Minister Yiannos
Papantoniou told Reuters Television that the government was deeply
concerned about the 20-day-old road blockades, which he said were crippling
the economy, but added that the government would not give in to the
farmers' demands.
<P>&quot;The consequences are quite substantial...The governnment is really very,
very worried about the situation. Our patience is wearing thin,&quot; he
added.
<P>Mr. Papantoniou said he hoped that on Thursday there would be a turning
point in the confrontation after farmers march to Athens in a protest
rally.
<P>Farmers are demanding lower fuel rates, higher price supports, lower Value
Added Tax (VAT) on their equipment and re-scheduling of some US$1.3 billion
in debts.
<P><H4>Fischler favourable to support for beleaguered Greek farmers</H4>
European Union Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler yesterday expressed
full understanding with Greek farmers' problems, and the intention of the
Commission to help in a spirit of Community solidarity.
<P>The Commissioner's statement came in response to problems besetting flood-
and disease-stricken farmers and cotton growers, as set out in a letter by
Agriculture Minister Stephanos Tzoumakas. He had asked for direct subsidies
to cotton farmers, and that penalties imposed for excess production be
imposed on the farmers and areas specifically responsible.
<P>Mr. Fischler said during the Farm Ministers' Council that the Commission
would examine as soon as possible and in a positive spirit all Greek
proposals, so as to amend the Greek Support Community Framework, and
support flood-stricken producers directly through the 1996 budget.
<P><H4>Greek tobacco growers in Brussles</H4>
Hundreds of Greek, Italian, Spanish, French and German tobacco growers
blocked a central square in Brussels yesterday prior to a European
Commission discussion today, expected to focus on the common tobacco market
organisation within the framework of anti-smoking campaigns.
<P>Greek protesters from the tobacco-producing regions of Macedonia, who flew
to Brussels on Sunday, joined their European Union colleagues in front of
the European Commission building.
<P>Shouting slogans, the Greek protesters handed a memorandum to Greek EU
Commissioner Christos Papoutsis, disputing anti-smoking arguments and
requesting that their demands be met.
<P><H4>State Dept. avoids comment</H4>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns avoided comment on threats
recently made against Greece by Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller,
saying he had not seen her statements, but made an overall statement on
threats of such a nature. &quot;Firstly, the US expects from all its allies,
including Greece and Turkey, to have relations of cooperation without any
kind of threats of force or use of force. This is a basic principle in
relations between allies and all our allies in NATO will agree with us.
Secondly, we support absolutely Turkey's inclusion in European mechanisms
and we made this known both to the European Union and to European countries
at a bilateral level. &quot;We do not support any kind of threats by one
NATO ally against another... NATO is not an organisation whose members
fight against each other,&quot;he said.
<P><H4>Diplomats to consider further strike action</H4>
Union representatives from the foreign ministry's diplomatic and administrative
employees will convene general assemblies at noon today to consider whether
or not to continue their strike.
<P>The strike, and primarily that of the diplomatic corps, has created serious
problems for the country's diplomatic missions abroad as well as for
communication between Greek embassies with Athens.
<P>According to reports, Foreign Undersecretary Christos Rozakis had a meeting
with a representation of diplomatic officials on Monday. Mr. Rozakis said
the government is examining the demand that an overseas bonus for diplomats
should not be taxed, which Finance Undersecretary Nikos Christodoulakis
rejected last week.
<P><H4>Turkeys seized by health officials</H4>
Health officers yesterday seized 10 tonnes of US-originated turkeys, whose
consumption date had expired, owned by the Veropoulos supermarket
chain.
<P>According to reports, market checks in view of the holiday season are
intensifying.
<P><H3>WEATHER</H3>
Overcast with rainfall and possible storms in the western and eastern
regions and the islands, but improvement of the weather expected later in
the night. Athens will be cloudy with possible rain in the evening and
temperatures ranging from 11-17C. Thessaloniki will be partly cloudy with
temperatures between 7-14C.

<H3>NEWS REVIEW, REPUBLIKA SRPSKA</H3>
<STRONG>SARAJEVO</STRONG> - The head of the General Staff of the Republika Srpska Army (VRS),
general Pero Colic, stated that the essential aim of the Army's
reorganisation is creation of a professional and highly trained units to
correspond all challenges. While being guest to Serb TV programme, general
Colic stated that the VRS transformation is ongoing strictly according to
the plan, &quot;even though certain problems characterised the early stage
of the transformation&quot;. &quot;The transformation must to adopted to
existing conditions, as is the geo-strategic position of RS&quot;, stated the
head of the VRS General Staff, adding that &quot;war-time and peace-time troops
have never been the same thing&quot;.
<P><STRONG>SRBINJE</STRONG> - Srbinje mayor, Petko Cancar, talked with deputy IPTF commander
for Gorazde District, captain Peter Finning, and coordinator with the
Matkovic-based Danish Council for Refugees, Badrik Rian, on violations of
right to freedom of movement. At the meeting, convened to discuss the
frequent Muslim armed and other attacks on Serb civilians travelling
through Federation territory, it was concluded that Muslim civilians did
not have similar problems while travelling through Serb territory.
<P><STRONG>SARAJEVO</STRONG> - One of the best-known writers in German language, Peter Hendke,
who is in visit to RS since December 19, was received by the RS foreign
minister, Aleksa Buha. &quot;I came here as a fried, and I did not come to talk,
but to listen to what the Serbs have to say&quot;, stated Handke after his
meeting with minister Buha.
<P><STRONG>ZVORNIK</STRONG> - The Municipal Board of the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) held a
meeting to address Muslim illegal settling of the villages of Jusici and
Dugi Do and accommodation of refugees from collective centres in Petkovci
and Kiseljak. The president of the SDS Zvornik Municipal Board, Stevo Radic,
and Zvornik mayor, Jovan Mitrovic, said negotiations with the Muslims
and International Commission for Settling of Zones of Separation,
showed that the Muslims have no interest in overcoming the present tense
situation.
<P><STRONG>STOCKHOLM</STRONG> - The IFOR Nordic-Polish Brigade commander, colonel Jan Berngsten,
stated after his return home from Doboj that IFOR has accomplished its task,
writes the Stockholm paper &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot;. According to him, the

possibility of a Muslim attempt at cutting off the Ozren pocket.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> Government welcomes Clinton's statement</H3>
The Cyprus government has welcomed a statement by US President Bill Clinton
reiterating his commitment to work towards a solution of the Cyprus
problem.
<P>In a statement after the conclusion of a US-European Union summit in the
White House on Monday (16.12.96), President Clinton expressed his intention
to do whatever possible, during his second term, in order to promote a
solution of the protracted Cyprus problem.
<P>''I can only say, from my part, that I intend to do whatever I can, in
these next four years the American people have given me, to try to help
work out the situation in Cyprus and work out the problems generally
between Greece and Turkey,'' he said.
<P>''The fact that President Clinton reiterates his personal interest in
finding a solution to the Cyprus problem, is something we consider positive,
'' Government Spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said yesterday.
<P>He said the Cyprus problem was raised at the meeting because of the
island's application for accession to the EU, and reiterated the government's
view that the US and the EU must co- ordinate their efforts to facilitate a
Cyprus settlement.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> Cyprus' defence is its own affair, says Government Spokesman</H3>
The island's defence &quot;is to be decided by the Cyprus government and not by
third parties&quot;, Government Spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said yesterday.
<P>Commenting on a statement by British Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind,
that the Republic's arms purchase programme is &quot;a big step in the wrong
direction&quot;, Cassoulides said the security of the Republic of Cyprus is
related to the strength of the Turkish occupation army.
<P>''It is understandable that third parties may be concerned about our arms
programme because our defence capability is upgraded but it should be
understood that Cyprus has the right to defend itself,'' he stressed.
<P>He reiterated the government's readiness to reconsider and discuss issues
relating to its arms programme, if there is agreement on the complete
demilitarisation of the island.
<P>&quot;We do not intend to attack anyone and our weapons will only be used for
defence purposes,&quot; Cassoulides stressed.
<P>He said the government would have been happier if the international
community had acted earlier on this matter and not now, at a time when we
have to arm ourselves for defence purposes.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> Turkey guilty of human rights violation, says European Court</H3>
The European Court of Human Rights today ruled that Turkey had violated the
right to property of a Greek Cypriot woman who lost access to her land in
the northern part of Cyprus when Turkish troops invaded the island in
1974.
<P>Titina Loizidou brought her case against Turkey in July 1989 alleging
violation of her right to &quot;peacefully enjoy&quot; her property in Kyrenia, which
is situated in the Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus.
<P>She claimed that Turkey violated Article 8 and Article 1 of Protocol 1 of
the European Convention of Human Rights.
<P>Article 1 provides that &quot;every natural or legal person is entitled to the
peaceful enjoyment of his possessions&quot; and Article 8 stipulates that
&quot;everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life&quot;.
<P>In a case which is expected to set a precedent, the Court ruled, by 11
votes to six that Turkey had violated Titina Loizidou's property rights by
denying her access to plots of land in Kyrenia.
<P>It dismissed Turkey's argument that the European human rights convention
did not apply to its occupation of the northern half of the island since it
occurred before Ankara accepted its jurisdiction.
<P>There are approximately 200.000 people who were deprived of their homes and
property as a result of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> Cyprus Government's reactions to British Foreign Secretary's ten-point
document</H3>
The Government of Cyprus does not believe that the elements contained in a
10-point document read out by British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind
before his departure from Cyprus (16/12/1996) are meant to be seen as the
common ground sought after before peace talks begin. Government Spokesman
Yiannakis Gassoulides commenting extensively during his press briefing
Tuesday (17/12/96), pointed out that the 3-page document is an outline of
Britain's views which could form the basis for progress. He added: It is
not a question of agreeing or disagreeing with Rifkind's elements. We have
our own views, and we agree with some of the points he has made and
disagree with outhers, adding that we still need a lot of work in the
context of an intensive preparatory process to hope for an agreement
between the two sides on the main aspects of the Cyprus question (security,
guarantees, territory, and constitutional matters). Cassoulides then went
on to express the Cypriot Government's position, taking the Rifkind
statement point-by-point. On the first point he said there is no disagreement
that the basis for a solution are the High Level Agreements (1977, 1979)
and the UN resolutions on the principle of a bicommunal, bizonal federation.
On the second point, of political equality, the Spokesman said our
position is known, that we agree on the issue of political equality, as it
is defined by the UN Secretary-General and that we do not consider it the
same as numerical equality.
<P>On the third point of the Rifkind document, Cassoulides said: We support a
federation, which will have one sovereignty, one international personality
and one citizenship, as it is defined by UN resolutions. We do not disagree
with having two separate referenda by the two communities which will
approve the solution to the Cyprus problem. The question of sovereignty
was a much-contested issue during previous talks, which Rauf Denktash
brought to a deadlock when he insisted that sovereignty for the future
state should derives separately from the two federated sides. British
Foreign Secretary's 10-points did not use the term sovereignty at all,
referring instead to a single international personality. Rifkind's
avoidance of the term was one two main points of all-round critisism of his
document by Greek Cypriot political party leaders. The other point that
drew negative reactions was his position of not distinguishing between the
size and role of Turkish occupation army and the Government's arms
purchasing as legitimate defence. Repeating the Government's position of
the issue of sovereignty Spokesman Cassoulides said on Tuesday (17/12/1996)
Sovereignty, as it had been given to the Republic of Cyprus following the
relinquishment of British sovereignty, will pass on from the Republic to
the future Federal Republic of Cyprus. He stressed that it cannot be the
case that the Republic of Cyprus will be dissolved, even if the referenda
for a new state are negative, what will remain again is the Cyprus
Republic adding that he does not read anything about a dissolution of the
Republic in Rifkind's document. Replying to questions, the Government
Spokesman said: Do not seek from me any government positions that are
different from the 1989 unanimous positions of the National Council,
because there has been no decision for a change.
<P>Going on to the fourth point in Rifkind's document, Cassoulides said we
absolutely agree that the future Republic will not allow secession,
partition or one side's domination over the other. He stressed that it is
wrong for the Turkish side to allege that the Greek Cypriot side wants to
dominate them. On the fifth Rifkind point, that of security, the Government
Spokesman said the government backs the demilitarisation of the island and
the stationing of an international force to ensure the implementation of a
settlement and to safeguard peace. On the question of guarantees, he said
that for a federal Cyprus they could increase in numbers and abolish the
right of unilateral intervention on the part of Turkey. The present system
of guarantees names Greece, Turkey and Britain as the three guarantor
powers. On the territorial issue, which was point six in Rifkind's document,
Cassoulides said a settlement must allow the return of two thirds of the
Greek Cypriot refugees to their homes under Greek Cypriot administration
and secure the right to return and to property for the remaining one third.
On point seven, Cassoulides stated that the Cyprus government is ready for
a face-to-face dialogue with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, after a
systematic period of preparation for a common ground on which a constructive
dialogue can be built. On Rifkind's point 8, Cassoulides said: We agree
on the need for measures which will reduce tension along the ceasefire line,
that is why we engage in a military dialogue and discuss the three question
mentioned in point eight, of unmanning, unloading and of military
conduct.
<P>Commenting on Rifkind's position in point 9, relating to European Union
accession prospects, Cassoulides said we adhere to the European Union
decision of March 1995, stipulating that accession talks will begin six
months after the end of the Intergovernmental Conference, and that
accession will have benefits for the whole of the Cypriot people, Greek and
Turkish Cypriots. He also agreed that any negotiations would take into
account the benefits the Turkish Cypriot community will obtain from
European Union accession. On the 10th point, Cassoulides said: If we reach
a settlement within 1977 then the federal Republic of Cyprus will negotiate
the terms of accession. If not, the internationally recognised government
of the Republic will conduct the negotiations, he pointed out.
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> Malcolm Rifkind's new statements following visit to Cyprus</H3>
With comments made after his return to London British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind has clarified that his reference to a federal Cyprus with a
single international personality also implies a single sovereignty, as
provided by UN resolutions. I do not think there is any conflict between
the two, Rifkind said in an interview with London Greek Radio (LGR) and
reported by Cyprus News Agency (17/12/1996), when asked to explain his
statement that the federation will have a single international personality,
which UN resolutions also call for a single sovereignty. He added
further: there will be one international state called Cyprus which will
be federal and will have a sovereign personality on that basis, adding
that there will be two autonomous zones in this state. That, I think, is
common ground between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, he said, noting that the
two communities should discuss the precise way to move forward.
<P>In the same interview the British Foreign Secretary expressed the hope that
the objective of direct negotiations early next year will be achieved, and
pointed out the need for political will, fundamental agreement on certain
aspects of policy and a lot of preparatory work. No settlement can be
imposed on Cyprus, the British official said, stressing that an agreement
will only be reached if the two communities and their respective leaders
strive in that direction. Speaking on the role of the US and the European
Union (EU) in efforts for a solution, Rifkind said the international
community should act as a single force in this respect. The UN takes the
lead, Britain, the US and the EU all have contributions to make, he said,
adding that they could preside over talks and coordinate the positions of
the various parties.

l'Italie, l'Espagne, le Portugal, la France, l'Allemagne, et la Belgique</H3>
La Commission europenne a dcid de poursuivre des procdures d'infraction
 l'encontre de la Grce (deux cas), l'Espagne (deux cas), le Portugal,
l'Italie, la France, l'Allemagne, et la Belgique pour des violations du
droit communautaire dans le domaine de la libert d'tablissement et la
libre prestation de services pour les professions dont l'exercice est
subordonn  des qualifications (diplmes et exprience).  Les infractions
concernent lexigence de certificat grec pour louverture dcoles prives

Justice), la formation des pharmaciens (Italie - mise en demeure pour non-
excution dun arrt de la Cour), la reconnaissance de diplmes de
dentistes dlivrs par des pays latino-amricains (Espagne - saisine de la

derniers cas, il s'agit de dcisions d'envoyer des avis motivs (la
deuxime tape de la procdure d'infraction en vertu de larticle 169 du
Trait CE).  En l'absence d'une rponse satisfaisante dans un dlai de deux
mois suivant rception par l'Etat membre en question d'un avis motiv, la
Commission pourrait saisir la Cour de justice.

non-Italian foreign language lecturers working in Italian universities</H3>
The European Commission has decided to open fresh infringement proceedings
against Italy concerning the treatment of foreign language lecturers in
Italian Universities. For many years a group of non-Italian European
citizens working in Italian universities as foreign language lecturers have
claimed that they were being discriminated against. In particular, they
were obliged to accept short term and temporary contracts which had to be
periodically renewed. This treatment had clear adverse consequences on
their working conditions.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> Dcisions prises par la Commission en matire d'infractions dans le
domaine social</H3>
La Commission europenne a pris une srie d'initiatives  l'encontre de
certains Etats membres concernant des infractions   en cours dans le
domaine social. Ces mesures concernent la Belgique et les Pays-Bas ainsi
que l'Espagne, l'Irlande, le Portugal et la Grce.

transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.</H3>
Responding to the urgent need for research in transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSE), the European Commmission has launched a specific
call for proposals for Research and Technology Development (RTD) in the
area of animal health. This call is part of the plan of action for research
into bovine spongiform encephalopathies (BSE) and other prion diseases
submitted to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. The
budget foreseen for the call is of ECU 8,8 million to be redeployed from
the available budget for research in the area of agriculture, forestry and
rural development.

<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> Accords modifis sur le commerce du bois rond en Finlande : la
Commission accorde 5 ans d'exemption</H3>
Suites aux importantes modifications consenties par les parties, la
Commission europenne a dcid d'accorder une exemption d'une dure de 5
ans aux accords finlandais sur le commerce du bois rond qui avaient t
considrs, en Novembre 1995, comme tant restrictifs  la concurrence. Les
entreprises de l'industrie forestire ont accept de mettre fin  leur
coopration en matire de prix. Les propritaires forestiers, pour leur
part, dsigneront des reprsentants chargs de ngocier individuellement
avec chaque acheteur. L'objet de ces ngociations ne consistera plus 
donner des recommandations de prix ou  fournir des prix de rfrences mais
plutt  parvenir  une vue commune sur les prvisions d'volution des
prix. La Commission rexaminera toutefois ces accords  l'expiration de
cette priode de 5 ans.
<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> Commission initiates detailed investigation into Ango American
Corporations shareholding in Lonrho</H3>
The European Commission has, decided to initiate a detailed investigation
of the shareholding of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa
Limited (AAC) in Lonrho PLC (Lonrho). AAC and companies related to AAC
acquired some 10% of Lonrho's shares in March and April. On the 7 November
AAC acquired a further 18.4% through the exercise of an option. A
shareholding of 28% would give AAC de facto control over Lonrho within the
meaning of the Merger Regulation. The operation was subsequently notified
to the Commission in mid-November.

<H3><A NAME="I">[I]</A>  Rsultats de la Commission de ce jour  - Outcome of today's Commission
meeting</H3>
<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> Commission concludes that EU's tobacco policy must be fundamentally
reformed</H3>
The European Commission concluded that EU's tobacco regime should be
fundamentally reformed in order to promote the production of higher quality
tobacco and allow farmers to cease production.  The Commission adopted a
report which analyses different options for the future of the regime and
outlines the economic importance of the tobacco sector together with an
assessment of the economic impact of the EU support for raw tobacco
production.  While accepting the perceived contradiction between the EU's
policy on reducing tobacco consumption and the support for raw tobacco
production, the report points out that abolishing support would herald the
end of raw tobacco production with serious consequences for some 200,000
jobs involved in its production and processing.  Given that approximately
77% of tobacco consumed in the EU is imported, the regimes abolition would
merely lead to 100% of EU tobacco demand being met by imports and to our
export markets being supplied by tobacco produced outside the EU.
Furthermore around 80% of the EU's tobacco is produced in economically
fragile regions of the Union on plots of land (which average 1.1 ha) which
are so small as to offer little alternative in terms of diversification.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> Combating tobacco consumption: Commission examines available options</H3>
The European Commission adopted a Communication on combating tobacco
consumption.  It reviews the EU's strategy to protect human health from the
harmful effects of tobacco and outlines the available policy options for
combating tobacco consumption.  These options include the upward
approximation of prices across the Union, and the examination of possible
toxicity and health consequences arising from additives to tobacco
products.  The Communication also considers the case for a reduction of
permissible tar and nicotine content, and improvements to labelling of
packaging.  For example, it is worth examining whether the description &quot;low
tar&quot; or &quot;light&quot; is misleading to consumers.  Another area for attention is
the respect for non-smokers rights, particularly in the workplace and in
commercial airline flights.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> Union de Myanmar (Birmanie): retrait du bnfice du SPG</H3>
La Commission europenne a adopt une proposition de rglement du Conseil
retirant le bnfice du schma communautaire de prfrences gnralises
(SPG) dans le secteur industriel  lUnion de Myanmar.  Cette dcision fait
suite  la conclusion d'une enqute mene par la Commission sur des
pratiques de travail forc dans ce pays.  La Commission propose que cette
mesure reste en vigueur jusqu' ce que les pratiques de travail forc
soient abolies.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> Reconstruction et dveloppement de l'Afrique du Sud - 750.000 Ecus
pour l'envoi de 50 jeunes mdecins europens volontaires</H3>
Dans le cadre du &quot;Programme europen pour la reconstruction et le
dveloppement en Afrique du Sud, la Commission europenne vient de dcider
le financement d'un projet dans le secteur de la sant pour un montant de
750.000 Ecus.  Il s'agit de l'envoi de 50 jeunes mdecins europens
volontaires qui doivent pallier temporairement au manque d'effectifs dans
certaines rgions du Nord du pays.
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> Deuxime oprateur GSM en Espagne: la Commission demande des
explications aux autorits espagnoles</H3>
La Commission europenne a dcid de demander des explications aux
autorits espagnoles au sujet du versement initial impos  Artel Mvil
pour l'octroi de la seconde concession de services GSM en espagne.  Ce
second oprateur qui a commenc  oprer en octobre 1995 avait t
slectionn sur base d'un processus d'enchres le forant  verser 85
milliards de Pesetas alors que l'exploitant public Telefnica avait t
autoris  fournir ses services GSM sans devoir payer pour cette
autorisation.  La Commission estime que ce montant initial est de nature 
fausser la concurrence en faveur de Telefnica et donne trois mois au
gouvernement espagnol pour lui communiquer les mesures qu'il prendra pour
assurer la parit de conditions entre les oprateurs GSM sur le march.
<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> Forges de Clabecq: la Commission dclare les mesures de la rgion
wallone incompatibles avec le code des aides de la sidrurgie</H3>
La Commission europenne a dclar les mesures prises par la rgion wallone
en faveur des Forges de Clabecq - notamment un apport de capital de 1,5
milliard de FB, mais aussi l'octroi d'un crdit-relais de 700 millions,
l'abandon de crances pour plus de 800 millions et le rchelonnement des
dettes de l'entreprise - comme tant incompatibles avec le march commun.
La Commission a considr que ces mesures ne peuvent reprsenter un
vritable apport de capital  risque selon la pratique normale en conomie
de march mais constituent plutt des aides incompatibles avec le Code des
aides  la sidrurgie - qui ne prvoit que des aides  l'environnement, 
la recherche-dveloppement ou  la fermeture.  Les aides dj indment
reues par l'entreprise devront donc tre rembourses.
<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> La Commission ouvre une procdure d'examen des mesures de soutien de
l'Etat en faveur de Thomson SA et de Thomson multimdia</H3>
La Commission europenne a dcid douvrir une procdure formelle au titre
du contrle des aides dEtat sur des mesures de soutien en faveur du groupe
dlectronique Thomson notifies en octobre dernier par les autorits
franaises, en pralable  la privatisation de lentreprise.  Les mesures
en question consistent en une injection en capital denviron 11 milliards
de francs dans la maison mre du groupe, Thomson SA, dont la situation
financire requiert une recapitalisation.  A ces mesures notifies, la
Commission considre quil convient dajouter le rachat par lEtat
dactions du Crdit Lyonnais dtenues par Thomson SA, susceptibles
dinclure une survaleur reprsentant un lment daide.
<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</A> Exonrations fiscales pour les biocarburants en France</H3>
La Commission europenne a adopt une dcision finale ngative  l'encontre
d'une aide d'Etat introduite par le gouvernement franais en faveur du
secteur des biocarburants.  Les mesures en cause consistent en, d'une part,
une exonration de la taxe intrieure sur les produits ptroliers (TIPP)
destins  tre utiliss comme carburants ou combustibles et, d'autre part,
une garantie de montant de cette exonration grce  des conventions de
progrs.  Cette dcision finale ngative ne met nullement en cause
l'engagement de la Commission en faveur du dveloppement des nergies
renouvelables, et des biocarburants en particulier.  Dans ce contexte, la
Commission examine actuellement un nouveau projet d'aide pour les
biocarburants soumis par les autorits franaises.
<H3><A NAME="09">[09]</A> Commission clears a DM 9 million soft loan by the Bavarian authorities
with a view to restructuring ADIS</H3>
The European Commission has decided to clear a project of the regional
authorities of Bavaria to award a soft loan amounting to DM 9 million at an
interest rate of 5.1% in favour of ADIS Integral Structures GmbH (ADIS), a
subcontractor in the aerospace industry located in Neuaubing which was
facing economic problems in 1993.  Taking into account the drastic
reduction in capacities which will be carried out, the fact that viability
of the enterprise will be ensured by already concluded long term contracts
and the fact that the aid element in the soft loan covers less than 2% of
the overall investment costs which will exclusively covered by the firms
new owners, the Commission decided not to raise objections against the
proposed aid.
<H3><A NAME="10">[10]</A> Peat industry in Ireland: no aid involved in favour of Bord na Mna</H3>
The European Commission has decided that the state owned Irish company,
Bord na Mna, which is producing peat for the energy, environment and
horticultural sectors is not in receipt of state aid falling under EC
competition rules.  The investigation, initiated by the Commission in 1995
following several complaints and the notification by the Irish authorities
of a financial restructuring programme, was related the company's
restructuring plans involving the taking over by the National Treasury
Management of a large portion of its debt, to allegations that the company
may receive state aid through its sale of peat to the national state-owned
Electricity Supply Board (ESB) and to alleged cross-subsidisation into its
horticultural activities.
<H3><A NAME="11">[11]</A> La Commission autorise l'aide  Diano mais s'oppose aux aides en
faveur de quatre autres entreprises sidrurgiques en Italie</H3>
La Commission europenne a dcid de clore la procdure relative aux
mesures d'aides d'Etat que le gouvernement italien avait envisag
d'octroyer  cinq entreprises dans le cadre du programme de fermeture dans
le secteur sidrurgique priv italien connu sous le nom de &quot;loi Bresciani&quot;.
La Commission a dcid d'autoriser l'aide  Diano mais, constatant que la
condition de rgularit de production prvue par le Code des aides  la
sidrurgie n'tait pas remplie pour Lamifer, Demafer, LMV et Sidercamuna,
elle a dclar les interventions publiques en faveur de celles-ci
incompatibles avec le march commun.
<H3><A NAME="12">[12]</A> Des aides au sauvetage pour 4,8 millions de DM au bnfice de
Thringer Motorenwerke GmbH suscitent des &quot;doutes srieux&quot; de la Commission</H3>
Entre juillet 1995 et avril 1996, le Land de Thringen a accord, sous
forme de prts, trois aides au sauvetage successives  Thringer
Motorenwerke GmbH alors que lencadrement communautaire des aides au
sauvetage et  la restructuration des entreprises en difficults souligne
que ce type d'aide est en principe une opration exceptionnelle et que, ds
lors, une srie dactions qui se bornent  maintenir le statu quo ou 
retarder la faillite est inacceptable.  En consquence, devant les doutes
srieux quelle prouve quant  la lgalit des aides en question, la
Commission europenne a dcid dengager une enqute dtaille.
<H3><A NAME="13">[13]</A> La Commission autorise des aides  la recherche dans les nouveaux
Lnder pour un montant de 662 millions de DM</H3>
La Commission a autoris loctroi daides  la recherche dans les nouveaux
Lnder pour un montant de 662 millions de DM conformment aux rgles
relatives aux aides.  Ces aides consistent, dune part, en prorogation de
cinq ans et en simplification du programme daides  la recherche en faveur
des petites et moyennes entreprises et, dautre part, en un programme pour
les petites entreprises axes sur la technologie pour les annes 1996 
2003 dans les nouveaux Lnder.
<H3><A NAME="14">[14]</A> Commission adopts a new steel aid code for the years 1997-2002</H3>
The European Commission adopted a new Steel Aid Code covering the period
from 1997 up until the expiry of the Treaty establishing the European Coal
and Steel Community in 2002.  The new rules stipulate that Member States
may grant aid to steel companies only for Research and Development,
Environmental Protection and full or partial closures of capacities.  A
special provision allows Greece to grant up to ECU 50 million for the
restructuring of its steel companies up until the end of the year 2000.  A
strict procedure is established to ensure full transparency and to prevent
circumvention.
<H3><A NAME="15">[15]</A> Commission approves the redefinition of regional aid areas in Germany
for the period 1997-1999</H3>
The European Commission has approved the redefinition of the regional aid
areas for Germany for the period 1997-99.  As a result of this redefinition,
the regional aid status of the five east German Lnder of Brandenburg,
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia is
maintained.  In addition, Berlin, which has hitherto been only partially
eligible for aid, is to become a full aid area.  As in the past, 20.8% of
the population of the ten west German Lnder will live in regional aid
areas.
<H3><A NAME="16">[16]</A> Commission approves regional aid to Ford Motor Company in support of
an investment project in Bridgend, South Wales</H3>
The European Commission decided to approve 10m regional aid to Ford Motor
Company, in support of the expansion of Ford's engine production capacity
at Bridgend in the South Wales (United Kingdom).  The investment project is
concerned with setting up a production plant with a capacity of 550,000
engines for primarily 1.6 litre Zetec-SE engines as well as to support the
previously started production of 1.4 litre engines in Valencia, Spain.  The
new production will furnish with engines for new world Escort model which
will be launched in 1999. The investment project will lead to a creation of
580 new jobs and will help to safeguard the remaining 1,227 jobs in the
region.  The Commission concluded that the project complies with the
criteria for regional aid set out in the Community framework for State aid
to the motor vehicle industry.
<H3><A NAME="17">[17]</A> La Commission dcide de prolonger de six mois l'accord Andreatta-Van
Miert afin de mener  bien la rduction de l'endettement de l'IRI</H3>
La Commission europenne a dcid de proroger de six mois -  savoir
jusqu'au 1er juillet 1997 - l'accord Andreatta-Van Miert, conclu  la fin
de 1993, qui vise la rduction progressive de l'endettement de la holding
publique IRI ainsi que la privatisation de ses diverses filiales.  Il tait
convenu que ce processus de rduction de la dette soit achev pour fin 1996,
avec toutefois prorogation possible compte tenu de la situation du march.
<H3><A NAME="18">[18]</A> La Commission dcide de maintenir les plafonds d'aide  la
construction navale</H3>
La Commission europenne a dcid qu' partir du 1er janvier 1997 et au
plus tard jusqu'au 31 dcembre 1997, le plafond d'aide  la construction
navale serait maintenu  9% pour les grands navires et  4,5% pour les
btiments plus petits ainsi que pour les transformations.  L'accord OCDE
sur les conditions normales de concurrence dans l'industrie de la
construction et de la rparation navales marchandes n'est pas encore entr
en application en raison de la non-ratification des Etats-Unis.  Cette
dcision est la suite logique de la rcente dcision du Conseil des
Ministres de l'Industrie de l'UE de prolonger les dispositions de
l'actuelle directive d'aide  la construction navale jusqu' l'entre en
vigueur de l'accord et jusqu'au 31 dcembre 1997 au plus tard.  Elle est
conforme  l'objectif de la directive qui est de rduire progressivement le
niveau du plafond (tant donn que sa couverture de l'cart cot/prix a
diminu) et souligne l'engagement de la Commission  l'gard de l'accord
OCDE.
<H3><A NAME="19">[19]</A> La Commission prend une dcision partiellement ngative  l'gard des
aides en faveur de la construction navale dans les DOM-TOM</H3>
La Commission europenne a pris une dcision partiellement ngative, 
l'encontre d'une mesure fiscale en faveur des Dpartements d'outre mer
(DOM) et des Pays et Territoires d'outre mer (PTOM) destine  favoriser
les investissements dans la construction de navires de croisire.  Elle a
dclar compatibles avec le march commun plusieurs cas concrets
d'application de cette mesure, notamment en ce qui concerne les paquebots
&quot;Club Med I&quot;, &quot;Club Med II&quot; et &quot;Le Ponant&quot; immatriculs dans les PTOM, o

The European Commission has decided to extend this year's textiles
agreement with Russia until next April, and is adding a series of measures
to open the European market to Russian exports of textiles and clothing.
This involves rolling over an existing agreement which was due to expire at
the end of 1996.  Russia will therefore now enjoy quota-free access on 5
products - including skirts, dresses and tracksuits - and a 15% increase in
quotas on all other products. This is an autonomous measure taken by the
Commission with no counterpart required from the Russian side, although it
is only a temporary arrangement and the Commissions ultimate objective
remains to find a long-term agreement with Russia on the gradual
elimination of all textiles quotas on Russian exports.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> President Rugova Meets Senior French Officials in Paris</H3>
President of the Republic of Kosova, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, had yesterday
(Wednesday) on Paris separate meetings with Bertrand Dufour, General
Secretary of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Jean-David Levy,
special advisor of President Jacques Chirac of France.
<P>President Rugova said the situation in Kosova is very grave as a result of
the systematic repression and violence of the Serbian regime. The people of
Kosova have responded to this by building up its independent democratic
institutions, he pointed out, noting that peaceful and political means have
been resorted to. Kosova has for seven years now suffered Serbian
domination, but an institutional life, a pluralistic society, has been
maintained, the President said.
<P>President Rugova recalled that in the aftermath of the disintegration of
the former Yugoslav Federation, Kosova, just like other federal units,
opted to go its own way, declaring independence which was confirmed in a
national referendum. This political will has been verified by other acts of
democratic expression, too, such as the free parliamentary and
presidential elections of four years ago.
<P>During the meeting in Quai d'Orseille as well as the discussions with
President Chirac's aide, President Rugova of Kosova expounded on the modes
for the resolution of the question of Kosova issue. An independent and
neutral state, open to both Albania and Serbia, is the optimal solution, he
said, pressing for an interim international civil administration in Kosova,
which would create the conditions for a negotiated settlement to the Kosova
issue. The General Secretary of the French Foreign Ministry, Mr. Dufour,
said his government is concerned about the developments in Kosova. He said
the French government supports a solution, &quot;compatible with the
aspirations of the people of Kosova&quot;.
<P>President Chirac's advisor for diplomacy, Mr. Jean-David Levy expressed his
appreciation for the non-violent policies being pursued in Kosova. The
French President follows closely the situation in Kosova, he said, adding
that France stands for a negotiated settlement to the Kosova issue, which
would be acceptable by the people of Kosova.
<P>Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, who received a Doctor Honoris Cause by the University
of Paris-XVIII on Monday, thanked President Chirac of France for his
concern over and preoccupation with Kosova. Meanwhile, President Rugova
met Tuesday in Paris with the President of the &quot;France-Libert=82&quot;
foundation, Danielle Mitterrand, to discuss the situation in Kosova.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> Albanians Schoolchildren Protest the Killing of Albanian Teacher</H3>
Albanian schoolchildren and teachers of all levels of education in Kosova -
elementary, secondary and university - protested today (Wednesday) the
killing by the Serbian police of a Kosova Albanian teacher Feriz Blak^ori.
In all the Kosova schools, a minute of the silence was held.
Teachers and students deplored the Serbian regime violence against the
Albanian people of Kosova, expressing their commitment for Kosova's
independence with peaceful means. The entire fist class in all the Kosova
schools was dedicated to Feriz Blak^ori and other victims of the Serbian
regime.
<P>Sources said that a particularly sad atmosphere was at the &quot;Zenel Hajdini&quot;
elementary school in Kosova's capital Prishtina, the late Feriz Blak^ori
taught. Feriz Blak^ori (34), teacher with a Prishtina elementary school
and LDK activist, died last Tuesday in the Prishtina hospital after
having been tortured in a Serbian police station.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> Serbian Authorities Deny Four Albanians Entry to Kosova</H3>
Four young Albanians from Opoja, southern Kosova - Vaidin B. Krasniqi,
Senat A. Krasniqi, Samidin Kryeziu, and Muharrem T&amp;rsnjaku - were
held up and ill-treated at the Prishtina airport upon their arrival from
Germany, today's Albanian-language Bujku newspaper reported.
<P>Family members told Bujku correspondent that the four Albanians have been
held up at the airport since 14 December. The intention of the Serbian-
installed authorities is to return them back to Germany, Bujku said,
quoting family members.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> Educational Activist to Appear before Serb Supreme Court</H3>
Zehadin Shemsedini, chairman of the Municipal Educational Council in
Prizren, was summoned to appear before Serbian Supreme Court, &quot;Bujku&quot;
reported today. Dr. Shemsedini was sentences to two years in prison in
1994 und6er the alleged charges of being member of a so-called &quot;defence
ministry&quot; of the Republic of Kosova. He was released pending appeal.
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> Serbian Police Oppresses Albanian Village in Skenderaj</H3>
The Prishtina-based Council for the Defence of Human Rights and Freedoms
(CDHRF) reported yesterday that the Serbian police has been constantly
oppressing an Albanian neighborhood, Zenelaj, at Prekaz i Ep&amp;rm village of
Sk&amp;nderaj. The Serbian police, under the pretext of being in possession
of arms, arrested Ekrem Sejdiu. He was held at the police station for
nine hours, and was ordered him to report again today. Muhamet Ahmeti,
Halit Ukshini and his son Nuredin Ukshini, were also arrested. The Serbian
police summoned for interrogation Bedri Bilalli and Veli Salihu
from Tic&amp; village, too.
<P>The CDHRF says that several detained persons refused to disclose their
identity, fearing of further police persecution.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> President Rugova Ends Diplomatic Trip, Arrives in Tirana</H3>
President of the Republic of Kosova, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, said Wednesday his
trip to several European capitals and the U.S.A was successful.
<P>Dr. Ibrahim Rugova told the Albanian TV, upon his arrival in the Albanian
capital Tirana, that the discussions he had with U.S. Secretary of State
Christopher and other administration officials, as well as Norwegian and
French officials, were important.
<P>The U.S. assured us on their continued support for Kosova and the
commitment to the resolution of the issue, President Rugova said.
<P>Norway pledged concrete support for Kosova, he said, noting the experience
of the Scandinavian countries in assisting towards resolution of problems
in peaceful ways.
<P>&quot;I pressed France and other countries of the European Union to establish a
direct presence in Kosova and work on the resolution of this flash-point&quot;,
the Kosova President said.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> Alarming Environmental Situation in Mitrovica</H3>
The environmental situation in Mitrovica is alarming, with catastrophic
consequences to the health of a 200.000 population.
<P>The Belgrade-based &quot;Dnevni Telegraf&quot; said today.
<P>The newspaper says that in a meeting of experts on ecology held Thursday in
Mitrovica it was said that the presence of lead in the air in the are is 60
times higher than the permitted maximum. None of the chimneys of the
&quot;Trep^a&quot; mining and industrial company have filters, while the Serb-
installed director, Novak Bijelic, had been preventing doctors from
conducting analysis on the intoxication of workers.
<P>The newspaper quoted a serb gynecologist, Dr. Radisa Vlaskovic, as telling
the conference that the number of persons suffering from cancerous diseased
and children's anemia has been drastically increasing in Mitrovica. While,
a Serbian high-ranking official Ferid Hamidovic, referred to &quot;Trep^a&quot; as a
&quot;black ecological spot&quot;.
<P>Dr. Momcilo Mikic, director of the Bureau for Health Protection in Zve^an,
a mine within the &quot;Trep^a&quot; company, is quoted to have stated that his teams
have been prevented to conduct analyses in &quot;Trep^a&quot; plants and mines,
notwithstanding the fact there has been an ever-increasing incidence of
workers' intoxication. As many as 7 tons of lead, 6 tons of zinc, as well
as other dangerous minerals such as mercury, indium, arsine and cadmium,
come out of &quot;Trep^a&quot; chimneys every year, Dr. Mikic is quoted to have
said.
<P>School Term in Kosova Ends Saturday without Progress on Implementation of
Education Accord In two days' time, on Saturday, will end the first
(winter) school term of the 1996/97 school year, the Ministry of Education
of the Republic of Kosova said.
<P>The school holidays for some 350.000 pupils and students in 840 elementary
schools and 66 secondary schools will last till 13 January 1993, when
classes resume in the second (summer) term.
<P>The University of Prishtina will have completed the first term by mid-
January.
<P>The Albanian students and teachers are about to complete yet another school
term in compellingly hard conditions amidst the Serbian regime's crackdown.
This is the sixth year in a row that the mainstream Kosova education system
has to operate in private homes and community centers, as a system which
some have mistakenly called a 'parallel' system, others 'underground'. The
local Serbs in Kosova, sponsored by the Belgrade regime, have in fact
established a parallel system of education in Kosova and, with the help of
Serb police, took over the public school buildings, the libraries, the
students dormitories, and canteens.
<P>There were hopes early in September that the Albanians will eventually be
able to go back to their own school buildings and the University of
Prishtina campus. Such hopes and expectations were raised by an educational
accord reached by the Kosovar and Serbian sides, confirmed by presidents
Rugova and Milosevic, which envisaged an unconditional return of Albanian
students and teachers back to their premises.
<P>The Serbs reneged on their promises, they failed to deliver. The signing of
the Accord served Milosevic boost his image before the world in the run-up
to the lifting of the international sanctions.
<P>The Albanians in Kosova will have to look for ways to restore some
normality to their educational life. Going back to the school buildings is
the first, necessary step. Some political forces have called for a tougher
stance, arguing that the schools will have to be 'recaptured' in the face
of the continued Serbian regime's intransigence.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> Repatriated Albanians Being Held at Prishtina Airport</H3>
Since last Saturday, several Kosova Albanians, repatriated from Germany,
have been held at the Prishtina airport.
<P>The Prishtina-based Bujku said today that the Serbian police at Prishtina
airport have not so far provided any explanation as to the reason or the
number of people being held there.
<P>Referring to unofficial sources, Bujku said that seven person are still
being held at the airport since last Saturday.
<P>Meanwhile, the Prishtina-based Council for the Defence of Human Rights and
Freedoms (CDHRF) said earlier this week that 16 Albanians, including a
mother with two children were being held in Prishtina airport since 7
December 1996, under the pretext they were not in possession of valid
travel papers.

<H3><A NAME="01">[01]</A> LDK Press Conference</H3>
Vice-chairman of the Democratic League of Kosova (LDK), Dr. Fehmi Agani,
hailed today (Friday) the meeting President of the Republic of Kosova Dr.
Ibrahim Rugova had with French and Albanian officials.
<P>Granting Dr. Rugova the Doctor Honoris Causa degree by the University of
Paris-VIII means honoring not only Rugova himself, as an intellectual and
politician, but also the non-violent policies he has advocated in the
pursuit of the legitimate rights of the people of Kosova, the LDK vice-
chairman said, highlighting the reported position of the French officials
supportive of a solution to the Kosova issue &quot;compatible with the
aspirations&quot; of the people.
<P>The meeting President Rugova of Kosova had Thursday in Tirana with
President Berisha of Albania reconfirmed the unrelenting support of Albania
to the Kosova issue, Dr. Fehmi said during a press conference. He hailed in
this context the adoption of a resolution on Kosova by the U.N. General
Assembly and the role of the Albanian delegation to the U.N. in its
promotion.
<P>The LDK vice-chairman deplored the silence with which the Serbian regime
have surrounded the killing of the Albanian teacher, Feriz Blak^ori, &quot;a
victim of the Serbian chauvinist terror&quot;.
<P>The Serbia state-sponsored terror in Kosova has been continuing, Dr. Agani
said, referring to reports of persecution by the Serbian security and
police of Albanian citizens and activists alike. &quot;A fresh check-point for
the ill-treatment and harassment of Albanians is in the making, a the
Prishtina airport&quot;, the LDK official told reporters, adding that the Serb
regime authorities have been holding up Albanian returnees, although
possessing all the due valid documentation. Such people, under trumped up
excuses, are being held up and threatened with deportation to third
countries, he said. &quot;The goal is clear: to create the feeling amongst the
Albanians abroad that they cannot return back home in Kosova&quot;, Dr. Fehmi
Agani said, pointing out that this is in keeping with the genocidal
policies of the Serbian regime which is after seeing as many Albanians out
of Kosova.
<P>Commenting on the current developments in Serbia, the opposition rallies
and the regime's reaction, the LDK vice-chairman noted that the gist of the
Milosevic's regime is to restore the 1987-like situation, resorting to the
same rhetoric - &quot;xenophobia, pseudo- patriotism and primitive anti-Albanian
drive&quot;. The alleged (non- existing) collaboration of the opposition with
the Albanians is being used by the Serb regime to accuse the political
opposition, the LDK vice-chairman said.
<P>While we have been trying to maintain a distanced stance, being sympathetic
of all democratic efforts, the instigation of an anti- Albanian hysteria
and the efforts to stage pro-regime rallies in Kosova on the basis of a
hegemonist triumphalism, may result in unprecedented and dangerous
implications, Dr. Fehmi Agani said.
<P>The opposition movement in Serbia is quite heterogeneous, he remarked,
adding that the support the Albanians in Kosova and Albania may give, is
&quot;support for the democratic streak&quot;, that is against the electoral frauds
of the totalitarian regime. This is positive, but this does not mean
standing fully behind the opposition. The support should be commensurate
with the democratic streak in it, Dr. Fehmi Agani stressed, commenting on
the qualified support for what the Serb opposition.
<H3><A NAME="02">[02]</A> Liberal Party of Kosova Marks Fifth Anniversary of Founding</H3>
The Liberal Party of Kosova (Partia Liberale e Kosov&amp;s - PLK) marked today
in a solemn gathering five years of its activity.
<P>Numerous representatives of institutions of the Republic of Kosova,
political parties and associations attended the solemnity.
<P>Addressing the solemnity, Mr. Gjergj Dedaj, PLK chairman, said that the
Liberal Party of Kosova from it outset has been endeavoring in
internationalizing the Kosova issue, and has pressing for a just solution
of the Kosova issue in compliance with the will of the people. The PLK will
never give up its struggle for an independent Kosova, he said.
<P>The PLK has been traditionally awarding domestic and foreign institutions
and public figures with the &quot;Marie Shllaku&quot; Reward.
<P>This year's recipients of the Award were U.S. Congressman Eliot Engel, Co-
chairman of the Albanian Issues Caucus at the U.S. House of Representatives,
Dr. Michael Weninger, Ambassador of Austria in Belgrade, British MP Sir
Richard Moore, and the Prishtina-based Kosova Information Center (KIC).
<P>In a letter sent to the PLK, Sir Richard Moore said he could not attend the
manifestation for he had been refused a visa by the &quot;FRY&quot; authorities. &quot;It
is with both sadness and anger that I have to tell you that no visa has so
far been forthcoming from Belgrade regime, although it was applied for
three weeks ago&quot;, he said.
<P>Wishing PLK s successful manifestation Sir Richard Moore notes that &quot;as
long as the extreme injustice, to which you are subjected by the Belgrade
regime, continues, peace is in peril and it is the duty of all Liberals and
Democrats to insist that freedom should reign in Kosova&quot;.
<P>Rep. Eliot Engel, regretting he could not personally be in Prishtina to
accept the reward said that he was deeply honored. &quot;As you know, my
feelings about Kosova are as strong as ever. I firmly believe that the full
spectrum of internationally guaranteed human and political right must be
immediately and unconditionally restored to the people of Kosova. Until all
the Kosovars are able to determine their own future, the United States and
the international community must keep real pressure on Serbian dictator
Slobodan Milosevic and must not lift the outer wall of sanctions against
Belgrade&quot;, Engel said in his letter.
<P>CDHRF Monthly Report on Serbian Regime Repression in Kosova In a monthly
report [November 1996] on human rights situation in Kosova, the Prishtina-
based Council for the Defence of Human Rights and Freedoms (CDHRF) said the
Serbian regime and police repression against Kosova Albanians has continued
with impunity.
<P>All strata of population, including children and women, were subjected to
various Serbian regime practices during the last month.
<P>One ethnic Albanian, Gani Bilall Memqaj (43), was killed by the Serbian
army at Pashtriku mountainside, at the Kosova-Albania border zone, while
the Serbian-installed authorities have so far produced no explanation as to
the incident, the report said.
<P>During November this year, the CDHRF has registered 129 cases of physical
ill-treatment of Albanians by the Serbia police, of whom 84 under the
pretext of arms searches. 4 persons suffered heavy body injuries, 67 were
arbitrary arrested, 50 persons were summoned to report at the Serbian
police stations, 30 political, sports and trade-unions activists ill-
treated.
<P>The Serbian police raided on Albanian-language school on three occasions,
said the report. In addition, Albanian schoolchildren were harassed and
threatened by armed Serb civilians, said the report illustrating it with
the occurrence of 19 November, when a Serb civilian named Slobo Kastratovic,
opened arms fire near the elementary school &quot;Emin Duraku&quot;, in Gjakova. He
fired shots on the air and threatened he would &quot;kill all Albanians&quot;.
<P>The CDHRF notes that the Serbian court authorities have resumed court
proceedings against 13 Albanians from Peja, accused for having protested
the closing down of Albanian schools by the Serbian regime. 28 trade-union
activists were summoned to appear on 26 December before the Supreme Court
in Belgrade.
<P>The Council offers over a dozen dozens of illustrative case of Serbian
police harassment of Albanians having occurred in November this year.
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> LDK Activist to Serve 6 Month in Prison</H3>
As reported earlier, on 13 December the Serbian police arrested Muhamet
Latifi, chairman of the LDK sub-branch at Pollata village of Podujeva.
<P>Today's Prishtina-based &quot;Bujku&quot; said that Mr. Latifi was initially held at
the police station in K&amp;rpimeh and later Podujeva. He was then sent to
prison in Leskovac (Serbia) to serve a six month prison sentence.
<P>In late 1994, during a raid on his house at Pollata village, Muhamet Latifi
was beaten up severely both in front of his family members and at the
police station. Although in very difficult health conditions he was
transferred to the Serbian police HQ in Prishtina, and from there he was
immediately sent to prison in Prokuple (Serbia). He was held then in prison
for 25 days, and while in prison, under the charges that he had been in
possession of arms, was sentenced by the Serbian Court in Prokuple to 6
month in prison.
<H3><A NAME="04">[04]</A> Dozen of Albanians Being Held at Prishtina Airport Fear Deportation</H3>
A dozen of Kosova Albanians, repatriated from Western Europe, have been
held at the Prishtina airport since 7 December.
<P>Bujku said today that the Serbian police has been preventing family members
and reporters from having any contact with the persons who are being held
in the airport. Bujku failed to obtain names of the detained persons. Yet,
it quotes police authorities at the airport as saying that some Albanians
have been held under the pretext of not being in possession of valid
travelling papers.
<P>The newspaper said that many people have been going every day to the
Prishtina airport in order to try find out whether their family members are
amongst those being held there. Referring to unofficial sources and various
speculations, Bujku says that the returnees may be deported to other
countries, Turkey mentioned as one of the most possible countries.
<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> Serbian Police Interrogates Repatriated Kosova Albanians</H3>
On 13 and 16 December, an Albanian couple Rexhep and Fiz&amp; Krasniqi from
Kishnareka village of Gllogovc, recently repatriated from Germany, were
interrogated by the Serbian state security in Gllogovc.
<P>LDK sourcesin Gllogovc said Mr. and Mrs. Krasniqi have been living in
Germany since 1993 and were repatraied after the agreement signed between
Germany and &quot;FRY&quot; authorities. They were both interrogated about their
whereabouts in Germany and whether they had been involved in any political
activity while there.
<P>Meanwhile sources in Suhareka said that Mejtim Sh. Byty^i from Reshtan
village, as well as several other Albanians from Suhareka who were returned
from Germany last month have been interrogated several times by the
Serebian police.
<P>LDK information commission in Suhareka said that Mejtim Byty^i was
threatened by the police that penal proceedings would be inistituted
against him.
<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> Repression Chronicle</H3>
Prishtina: On 17 December, the Serbian police raided on the home of Salih
Krasniqi in Prishtina. As Mr. Krasniqi was not at home, to police arrested
as hostage his son Naim Salihu.
<P>Salih Krasniqi appeared later himself at the Serbian police station where

same day but ordered to report back the next day.
<P>Kamenica: On 10 December, the Serbian police searched for arms the
household of Mufail Tha^i at Mu^iv&amp;rca village. Mr. Thaqi was later taken

and 1993. During his stay, Rafsanjani will visit Izmir, Trabzon and
Sanliurfa, and will make a stop at the South Eastern Anatolia (GAP)
project as well. President Demirel, speaking at a welcoming ceremony,
said that there had been regular meetings with Rafsanjani and that,

Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller has completed
her official visit to Russia. Speaking at a press conference at the
end of her visit, Ciller called the trip a &quot;generally successful one
with the potential to bestow many benefits on Turkey.&quot; Ciller's visit,
which began on December 17, focused on creating an environment of
confidence in political ties and establishing partnership on economic
issues. Ciller said that Russia had promised not to obstruct the
construction of the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline with political excuses. She

joint document on approaches to finding a peaceful solution to the
Nagorno-Karabakh issue. <STRONG>/Hurriyet/</STRONG>
<H3><A NAME="03">[03]</A> PARLIAMENT TO DECIDE ON OPC REPLACEMENT</H3>
The Turkish Parliament will retain the power to make decisions
concerning the proposed multinational air force which will replace the
the Turkey-based Operation Provide Comfort force when the latter's
mandate expires on December 31, 1996. During the talks between
Turkish and American military officials which began in Ankara two days
ago, the Turkish side turned down an American suggestion that the
power to make that decision be delegated to the Turkish government.
According to the agreement reached by the two sides, the US, Turkey,
Britain and France will take part in the proposed force which will
check whether the Baghdad regime complies with UN restrictions. The
number of planes, weaponry and rules on 'engagement in case of radar
lock-in' will be finalized during talks between military delegations.

The U.S. State Department has repeated its support for Turkey's

Under conditions of massive secrecy, the Greek government has
transferred 220 PKK terrorists from the Lavrion camp near Athens

<P>The move is seen as an attempt by the Greek government to hide
the fact that Greece supports the PKK. Disguised as a sort of
Red Cross aid operation, the move has created much unease in
Greek governmental circles. On the other hand, the Lavrion camp
has long been a source of embarrassment to Athens, especially as
Turkey has frequently exposed the Lavrion-PKK connection.

<H3><A NAME="05">[05]</A> DENKTAS TURNED DOWN RIFKIND CALL FOR NEW GUARANTEE
PLAN FOR CYPRUS</H3>
The Turkish REpublic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) on Monday
rejected British Foreign Secretary Malcom Rifkind's proposal to
&quot;reinterpret the guarantorship&quot; with respect to the Cyprus issue.
<P>Rauf Denktas, president of the TRNC, in reply to Rifkind's
proposal to extend the guarantorship in a way that meets the
demands of both communities, said that the agreement of
guarantorship did not lead to any problems on the island. &quot;On
the contrary, it prevented the Greek invasion of the island and
the annihilation of Cyprus Turks. It is a good system; there
cannot be an alternative. We cannot give up on the guarantorship
of Turkey because we cannot give up on the bsic rights granted
to us in the 1960 agreements,&quot; said Denktas.
<P>Denktas also warned the European Union that if they continue to
act with ignorance only southern Cyprus, not Cyprus as a whole
would end up joining the EU, the Anatolia news agency reported.
Speaking on Turkish Cypriot television Denktas said there was
no such country as Cyprus, but a Northern and Southern Cyprus.

<H3><A NAME="06">[06]</A> ANKARA WELCOMES CLINTON REPORT ON CYPRUS</H3>
U.S. President Bill Clinton's report on Cyprus point out that
it is the Greek Cypriots who are creating tension on the divided
island, according to Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer
Akbel. At his weekly press conference on Monday, Akbel said the
U.S. presidential report, which looked at the events of August
and September, blamed the tension on the Greel Cypriots. Akbel
said the report mentioned that Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus (TRNC) President Rauf Denktas had called for bilateral
talks between the leaders of two societies on the island and
that this implied that it was the Greek Cypriots who did not
want to negotiated.<STRONG>/Milliyet/</STRONG>
<H3><A NAME="07">[07]</A> AMBASSADOR LAKE SEES NO RISK FOR EUROPEAN INVESTORS IN TURKEY</H3>
The European Commission's representative in Ankara, Ambassador
Michael Lake, dismissed European investors' unwillingness to
invest in Turkey as founded and said Turkey carried no political
risk for foreign capital. Lake met with Ahmet Uyanik, head of
the Parliamentary commission on the State Economic Enterprises,
on Monday to discuss the Turkish privatization program. &quot;You
should actively encourage European investors to come and invest
in Turkey. Foreign trade has increased 80 percent in the past
three years but there is need for more foreign investment,&quot;
said Lake.<STRONG>/All papers/</STRONG>
<H3><A NAME="08">[08]</A> BIGGER NATO ROLE FOR TURKEY</H3>
Since the end of the cold war, NATO has been extending its
sphere of influence and with plans afoot to develop NATO nuclear
strategy, it looks as though Turkey could well have its own area
of influence increased.
<P>Within the framework of NATO expansion, Turkey is increasingly
being seen as a vital barrier to &quot;high risk&quot; countries like
Libya and Iran with growing responsibilities in the region.
Britain's Independent newspaper points out that Turkey could
have a &quot;key role&quot; in the specific plans that NATO has for future
expansion. <STRONG>/Milliyet/</STRONG>
<H3><A NAME="09">[09]</A> TURKEY WELCOMES ATRUS CAMP CLOSURE</H3>
Turkish government officials have declared that Turkey welcomes
the decision of the UN High Commission for Refugees to close
down the Atrus refugee camp in northern Iraq.
<P>During a press meeting for foreign journalists in Ankara,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel said that Turkey welcomed
the decision and hoped that the camp would be closed down as
soon as possible. <STRONG>/Sabah/</STRONG>
<H3><A NAME="10">[10]</A> GERMANY TAKES HARD LINE AGAINST PKK</H3>
German authorities have declared that PKK terror organization
cells operating in Germany will be forced to stop using weapons
and their activities further restricted.
<P>This tougher line is seen as a response by the German
authorities to a PKK letter sent to German Prime Minister
Helmuth Kohl who has turned down a PKK request calling on him
to mediate a new deal with Turkey.
<P>Even while Germany takes a hard line against the PKK, reports
from Kazakhstan say that the PKK has opened a &quot;Kurdish House&quot;
there. These so-called culture centres are known to be used by
the PKK to direct operations in the regions where they are
sited.<STRONG>/Sabah/</STRONG>
<H3><A NAME="11">[11]</A> DRUG REPORTS FINGER PKK</H3>
Reports by the international Associated Press news agency show
that the PKK terrorist organization has a huge share in the US
drug market. The news agency describes the PKK as a terrorist
organization responsible for many murders, and adds that it has
a tight grip especially on heroin trafficking.
<P>Other reports also suggest that the PKK is one of the four
leading world drug smuggling organizations with major
connections to Afghanistan. <STRONG>/Sabah/</STRONG>
<H3><A NAME="12">[12]</A> JUSTICE MINISTER ASSURES THE EUROPEANS</H3>
Minister for Justice Sevket Kazan has assured European
parliamentarians that Turkey's new press laws will not lead to
censorship or gag the press in defiance of democratic freedoms.
<P>Sevket Kazan said that any fears that press freedoms would be
restricted were unfounded, and that debate in some European
circles about the issue were needless. In a four page letter to
the president of the European Parliament, Klaus Haensch, Kazan
clarified the matter and extended assurances that Turkey was
not about to restrict the press. <STRONG>/sabah/</STRONG>
<H3><A NAME="13">[13]</A> INDONESIAN ADMIRAL VISITS TURKEY</H3>
Indonesian Naval Force Commander Vice Admiral Arief Kushariardi
has arrived in Turkey for an official visit. He met yesterday
with Turkish Naval Forces Commander Admiral Guven Erkaya. During
the meeting issues related to bilateral cooperation in military
training and the defence industry were discussed. <STRONG>/Cumhuriyet/</STRONG>
<H3><A NAME="14">[14]</A> GREECE WILL BLOCK TURKEY'S WEU MEMBERSHIP</H3>
Greek Defence Minister Akis Cohacopulos, who left yesterday for
Brussels to participate in a NATO Defence Ministers meeting,
discussed in a press meeting at Athens airport the possibilities
for granting Turkey full WEU membership. Cohacopulos said that
Greece was determined to block all Turkish efforts in this
respect and that Greece would not change its former stance on
this.<STRONG>/Cumhuriyet/</STRONG>
<H3><A NAME="15">[15]</A> TURKEY DISCUSSED AT EU-US SUMMIT</H3>
In a summit meeting with EU Term Chairman Irish Prime Minister
John Bruton and EU Chairman Jacques Santer, US President Bill
Clinton said he was ready to exert every effort to resolve
disagreements between Turkey and Greece. He urged Turkey and
Greece to give up on insisting on bringing up former problems,
and review possibilities for improving their relations.

<H4>FARMERS</H4>
As the standoff between the farmers and the government wears on, tempers
are becoming more and more frayed.
<H4>SEAMEN</H4>
As we heard there, truck drivers are exasperated. They're also frustrated
by a seamens' strike that's preventing them from getting out of the country,
even if they manage to make it to the port.
<H4>SIMITIS</H4>
Prime minister Kostas Simitis told the nation's president that he's pleased
with the way things went for Greece at last weekend's European Union
summit.
<H4>PERU</H4>
The government of Peru is trying to negotiate the release of several
hundred foreign diplomats being held hostage in the Japanese embassy in
Lima.
<H4>TURKEY WOLVES</H4>
The Turkish right-wing extremist organisation the &quot;Grey Wolves&quot; is well-
known to Greeks and Cypriots. There have been reports that the Wolves have
set Greek forests on fire; and that they were among those who attacked
peaceful Greek-Cypriot protestors in Cyprus's neutral zone.
<H4>ALIKI THEATRE</H4>
The lights will soon be turned back on at the theatre started by late
actress Aliki Vouyouklaki. The popular star's son is raising the curtain at
the Athens theatre with a series of performances, the first on Christmas
day.
<H4>CULTURE</H4>
The Hilton Hotel in Athens is ALSO a cultural centre these days. &quot;Art at
the Hilton&quot; is the title of a series of events being hosted there.
<H4>BOOKS</H4>
More in a series of books containing accounts of the personal lives of well-
known Greek artists and writers are out.

<H3>DEC. 22, 1996 DAY</H3>
<H3>NEWS REVIEW, REPUBLIKA SRPSKA</H3>
<STRONG>LONDON</STRONG> - Humanitarian aid, which has been flowing into the Dayton B-H
during the war, contained &quot;hundreds of tonnes of unusable medicines &quot;,
reveals Sunday Times. The majoror portion of aid, according to the
Medicines Sans Frontieres, arrived from the USA, according to the paper.
<P><STRONG>BEOGRAD</STRONG> - The OSCE delegation found out that the results of the second
round of municipal elections were &quot;modified to the detriment of opposition
in 14 municipalities, i.e. major Serbia's cities&quot;, claim diplomatic sources,
close to the delegation.
<P><STRONG>BEOGRAD</STRONG> - The Serbian Radical Party (SRS) believes that it is sad that the
election results in Serbia are being verified by foreigners. &quot;We think that
a statement of OSCE delegation chief, Philippe Gonzales, that the available
data provide the right decision about the elections in Serbia, represents
the best proof of a brutal involvement in interior matters of our country&quot;,
writes SRS announcement.
<P><STRONG>BEOGRAD</STRONG> - The power hand-over would be carried out by 1997, stated
president of the Democratic Party (DS), Zoran Djindjic, who said in front
of 100,000 gathered demonstrators that, &quot;it is known who won in Serbia,
which will, as early as the first week of 1997, enter the 21 century.
&quot;
<P><STRONG>TRAVNIK</STRONG> - The Croatian Municipal Council of Travnik, asked for help and
protection from the latest Muslim terror against Croats in central Bosnia,
especially in Travnik and Zenica. In a communique, transmitted by Croat
media, the Council said that Muslim extremists removed all signs of the up-
coming Christmas celebration.
