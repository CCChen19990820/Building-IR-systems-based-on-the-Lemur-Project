Zvornik-Bratunac, 20th June: All-out Muslim attacks, including the use of poisonous gases, against the Serb side in the Ozren [Bosnian Serb enclave south of Doboj, almost completely encircled by Muslim forces], Vozuca [southern part of the Ozren enclave] and Srbobran [former Donji Vakuf in western Bosnia] areas were continued, Tanjug has learned form sources in the Serb Republic Army...<p>

Muslim forces are using all available weapons in the attacks, including tanks, heavy artillery, multiple rocket launchers and shells charged with poisonous gases.<p>

On Saturday [18th June], the Serb side lodged a protest with Unprofor's command today.  Unprofor has warned again about the most serious Muslim violation of the Geneva agreement on a four-week truce from 10th June and about the use of poisonous gases banned by all valid international legal provisions.<p>

<h2>HEADLINE: Bosnians Said To Be Using Chemical Grenades In War</h2>

A Bosnian Muslim commander bragged to U.N. personnel in Tuzla his forces were using chemical grenades against the Bosnian Serb army, according to a report to the Security Council disclosed Thursday.<p>

But council sources, who received the report, said UNPROFOR could not confirm independently whether any chemical weapons had been used by Muslim forces or others in the Bosnian conflict.<p>

The report from the U.N. protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslavia said the commander of the 126th Brigade told the U.N. military observers that chemical grenades were used against Bosnian Serb forces to demonstrate "the capability" of the Bosnian government army.<p>

Croatia's U.N. mission, in a press statement, quoted its own chemical warfare experts as saying that Bosnian MUslim forces have used "sensitive narve gases, most likely chlorine," a poison used in World War I.<p>

A second UNPROFOR report to the council complained that the Bosnian army south of Tuzla had been painting military vehicles white, evidently to disguise them as U.N. transport.<p>

Serb commanders have threatned to shoot at all white vehicles and UNPROFOR has protested to the Muslim dominated army, the sources said.<P>

<h2>Headline: U.N. Says Non-Lethal Gas Shells Fired in Sarajevo</h2>

A U.N. spokesman said on Wednesday that shells apparently containing riot-control gas had been fired in Sarajevo, but there was no evidence any side was using poison gas in the Bosnian conflict.<P>

Barry Frewer, spokesman for the U.N. Protection force (UNPROFOR), siad U.N. military observers had seen some shells which sent up white clouds during fighting on Tuesday on Zuc hill, where the Moslem-led Bosnian army has been pounded for several days by Serb artillery.<P>

"Our UNMOs observed some shells which sent up white clouds which were assessed to be non-poison gas, probably CS (riot control) gas or something like that," Frewer told a news briefing.<P>

"We have no knowledge of the use of poisonous gases," he said.<p>

The Moslem-led Bosnian government has accused Serbs of using chemical shells in the Zuc battle and on other fronts in the republic's civil war.<p>

In Belgrade, deputy UNPROFOR chief Cedric Thornberry told a news conference the U.N. would be investigating "what was different about the shells and their contents and see who fired them."<P>

"We have learned not to jump to conclusions," Thornberry said, adding that UNPROFOR was treating the incident "very guardedly."<P>

Reuters television on Wednesday filmed what the Bosnian army alleged was an unexploded chemical shell which had landed in Kobilja Glava, a Moslem-held suburb in the north of Sarajevo.<p>

The film showed a U.N. military observer approach the 122mm shell wearingsd a gas mask in order to photograph its markings.<p>

UNPROFOR headquorters in Sarajevods said it was not immediately aware of the discovery.<P>

Earlier this month, the British government said it believed all three sides in the Bosnian civil war possessed improvised grenades containing riot-control gas but not confirm reports they had been used by Moslems against Croats.<P>

Thornberry also said Moslem-led government forces fighting to prevent Serbs widening a strategic corridor in northern Bosnia around Brcko had threatened to use chlorine gas if the Serbs did not stop using rockets.<P>

The Moslem side has threatened before to use chlorine, produced in a large industrial chemical plant in the Moslem-held north Bosnian town of Tuzla.<P>

But the U.N. has cast considerable doubts on its effectiveness as a battlefield weapon.<P>

Zvornik, 22 October: Muslim artillery units resumed their shelling of the territory of the Serbian Republic [in Bosnia-Hercegovina] some 15km northeast of Zvornik [northeastern Bosnia] shortly before 1200 [1100 gmt] today.  Tanjug's correspondent was told by the command of the Zvornik garrison of the army of the Serbian Republic that Muslim forces used shells with toxic charges in today's attacks, as well as in the course of the previous day [21st October].<p>

Serb military sources have said that, owing to yesterday's several-hour-long Muslim attack and the use of prohibited toxic weapons, a UN military observer commission has been assigned to carry out an on-the-spot investigation and collect all the necessary samples.<p>

Several dozen mortar shells of different calibres were fired from Muslim strongholds in [the villages of] Vitnica, Kovacevici, Nezuk and the hamlet of Zaseok from 0900 [0800 gmt] to 1500 [1400 gmt] yesterday [21st October].  today's attack came from the same diractions.<P>

According to the commander of the Zvornik garrison of the army of the Serbian republic, maj Vinko Pandurevic, more than 60 shells were fired in the course of yesterday's attack - at least one third of them charged with toxic substances based on chlorine....<P>

...... Reporting from Tuzla, Salih Brkic said that "the members of the Bosnia-Hercegovina army Second Corps have continued with intense preparations for using chemical agents for defense purposes and the use of chlorine unless the criminal attacks on the free Brcko territory cease.  Since the material has been taken out to the front earlier, now the Second Corps command has sent out detailed instructions and orders.  It has been decided that if the Chetnik attacks on the free Brcko territory do not stop immediately, first only warning amounts of chlorine and other highly dangerous chemical agents will be released and then those from the large containers, each with several tonnes of such agents.  the containers are also ready.  They are positioned close to the places where they should be activated.<p>

The Second Corps command is warning the civilians in the temporarily occupied territories that, if the monstuous Chetnik attacks continue, they will be in the zone of influence of the chlorine and other chemical agents and the aggressor's leaders will be to blame.  that is why the Second Corps command is warning the civilians in the occupied regions of Brcko, Mrkvica, Loncari, Porebrice and Obudovac to evacuate promptly all the children, the old and the ill and to [words indistinct].".................<p>

<h2>HEADLINE: Did U.S. head off chemical war in Bosnia? Fears of illegal attacks may have led to warning</h2>

Washington: U.S. officials collected enough evidence that Bosnia was on the verge of chemical warfare this summer to issue secret warnings to two of the three warring parties.<p>

The State Department learned in July that Bosnian army commanders in the field, having lost ground to rebel Serbs in the spring, were threatening to strike back with chemical weapons, according to Marshal Harris, the chief desk officer for Bosnia-Hercegovina at the time.<p>

Meanwhile, he said, U.S. officials in former areas of Yugoslavia received "credible evidence" that traces of chemical weapons had been detected in shell casings left at Serb artillery positions around Bosnia's capital, Sarajevo.<p>

Harris could not recall the types of chemicals detected in the shell casings.<P>

"We were concerned enough to send a warning to the Bosnian government... And the same warning went out to the Serbs," said Harris, who resigned in early August to protest U.S. policy in the Balkans.  He is now an aide to Rep. Frank McCloskey (D-Ind.).<P>

The State Department had no official comment on the matter.<P>

A U.S. diplomat familiar with the situation, however, recalled "escaleting concern" in July that both sides would launch cjemical weapons attacks.  he added that it was unclear what types of chemical weapons either side possessed or whether they had arsenals of sufficient size to cause widespread death and suffering.<P>

The Bosnian government and the Serb rebels waging war against it have accused each other at various times of using chemical weapons in fighting in the past 19 months.<P>

On Monday, representatives of both sides insisted they do not possess, and have never used, chemical weapons.<P>

Harris said the U.S. warning to the Muslim-led Bosnian government was issued by Victor Jackovich, U.S. ambassador to Bosnia, who cautioned that such an attack would violate the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which bans the use of mustard, chlorine and other lethal gases.<P>

Jackovich, now in Vienna, Austria, could not be reached Monday for comment.<P>

A similar diplomatic demarche was delivered to Serbian government officials, said Harris, who added that he read cables relating to the chemical weapons threat.<P>

The Serbian-dominated government of Yugoslavia, which backs Serb rebels fighting the Bosnian government, denies ever having had chemical weapons of supplying them to the Serb rebels.<P>

"It's never been available to the Serbs in Bosnia and they never used it, and there is no single evidence that they did," said Nebojsa Vujovic, press spokesman for the Yugoslav Embassy in Washington.<P>

Even before Yugoslavia split into several independent republics, the country's defense strategy relied upon conventional weapons, not chemical arms, Vujovic said.<P>

In the savage war over disputed territory across former areas of Yugoslavia, U.N. observers have occasionally looked into claims that Bosnian government forces and Serb rebels have used chemical weapons.  There have been no documented instances, however.<P>

Following heavy Serb shelling of Sarajevo in October, for instance, local television footage showed unusually thick smoke rising from a blast site, causing speculation that chemicals may have been used.<P>

U.N. observers visited the site but found no evidence of a chamical attack.<P>

Earlier this year, a Bosnian government commander in the government-held city of Tuzla threatened to deploy a chemical-based "doomsday" weapon as a last-resort defense against Serb attacks, said former State department official George Kenney, now a Balkans specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in washington.<P>

Tuzla has one of the largest chemical factories in the Balkans, Kenney said.  although the factory isn't set up to produce weapons, it is capable of producing lethal chemicals.<P>

<h2>HEADLINE: Bosnian Serb commander charges Moslems make chemical arms</h2>

BELGRADE, Dec. 1 (AFP) - The commander of Bosnian Serb forces charged Wednesday that mainly-Moslem Bosnian government forces were making banned chamical weapons in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Tanjug news agency said.<p>

General Ratko Mladic, in a letter sent Wednesday to General Francis Briquemont, commander of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia accused the Moslems of producing chemical arms in a factory in the northeastern industrial town of Tuzla.<P>

The arms included warheads filled with chlorine, he charged, according to Tanjug.<P>

The region is "under your protection" and "should have been demilitarised, under terms of agreement signed by the parties in conflict," Gen. Mladic wrote.<P>

He called on Gen. Briquemont "to undertake effective measures to dismantle these installations."<P>

Bosnian Serbs have accused the Moslems several times in the past few months of using chemical weapons in eastern Bosnia, particularly the Zvornik region.<P>

UNPROFOR military observers recently went to the region to probe the allegations but their findings have not yet been published.<P>

<em>The following material was published by Slobodan Kljakic in December 1991 and The Museum of Applied Arts in Belgrade in the Summer of 1992</em><P>

On the eve of liberation of Vukovar, civilians, ethnic Serbs, were dragged out of cellars and shelters in which they had been hiding; they were killed in front of their homes in the very center of the town.<P>


<h2>The Statement of Milica Zvjerec, Ana Lukic's neighbor</h2>

Having been requested to say everything known about the case, the witness stated as follows:<P>
<em>I live in 47 Vinkovacka St. in a private house; when the fighting started in Borovo Naselje, I was staying in the cellar with my two daughters.  Ana Lukic lived in my neighborhood, at 37 Vinkovacka St.  She was alone in her cellar, where she sought safety and from where she was able to look after the house and feed the pigs.  her husband and four sons were not there; they had had to run away earlier.  Every other day, I took bread and water to Ana in her cellar because we were neighbors and close friends.<P>

Ana told me that way back in October 1991, she had been visited by the wife of Danijel Rehak (known as "Danika-mongol", who was also named Ana; later on she was also visited by Daniel's sister Magda.  They wanted her to work in the Vukovar hospital.  Ana told them that she was too scared to go there, because artillery shells were falling everywhere.  Several days later some ZNG members came to Ana and searched her house thoroughly.  They searched it from the cellar to the attic, allegedly looking for a radio transmitter/receiver.  Ana told me this a day later, when I brought bread and water to her.<P>

Several days later, Ana told me that her house had been searched again by ZNG members and that they had taken away all valuable items with them, including a clothes dryer, a color TV set, a music line and a bidet.<P>

I went to see Ana and saw that ZNG members had left a lot of cigarette stubs in the ashtray and that they had been drinking cognac, since a bottle was on the table.  Ana was very scared.<P>

Following this event, Ana went to Braca Durdevic local community office, which was subsequently renamed into Braca Radic, in order to complain about the ZNG members who had stolen her property.  She talked there to to Ivica Katic and a certain Bracic; they told her that her property would be returned to her.  They asked her about her husband and sons.<P>

After a while Ana was visited by the ZNG members for a third time; they requested that she start working at the hospital.  By the way, she used to work in the hospital accounts department.  She was afraid to go and said that she couldn't leave her pigs.  When ZNG told her that they would take her pigs away, she agreed to go.<P>

In the morning of 11/7/1991, my children and I moved to the "Obucara" shelter on the ground of Borovo Works.  Ana came to this shelter in the evening of the same day.  She came from a neighboring shelter, the so-called "Komerc".  She told me on that occasion, in confidence, that in the night between November 6 and 7, 1991, she had been visited in her cellar by a ZNG member.  He was tall and fair-haired and she did not know him.  She said that he had come once before alone, two days before ZNG tried to persuade her go to work and when she agreed to do so.  The mentioned ZNG member raped Ana that night; at about 2a.m. she managed to escape from the cellar to the "Komerc" shelter.  Ana was very excited, upset and she was crying.  She told me all this quietly, so that nobody in the shelter could hear us.  She said that the man who had raped her was very rough.  She didn't tell me any details about the rape, because that would have been very dangerous for both of us.  She told me not to see her or speak to her under any circumstances, because she was kept under surveillance.  She told me that after the arrival to the "Komerc" shelter she had been interrogated by Martin Sablic in person.  He was the commander of the "Komerc" shelter and was later put in charge of the "Obucara" shelter.  In the "Obucara" shelter, I was assigned to Dormitory 2 and Ana to Dormitory 4.  Ana told me that she was being followed and that, in order not to get me in trouble, we shouldn't see each other any more.  I had noticed a woman whose name was Anda; she always kept an eye on my movements; on one occasion she told me "I know that you are a Serb."<P>

On November 16 or 17 1991, I was on duty as a cleaning person in the shelter;  I was assigned to lavatory cleaning duty by Martin Sablic, who was known as "Car" (The Emperor).  On that day, when I was passing the dining room, where Martin's office was, I saw Ana Lukic and Vida Jakovljevic.  While passing next to them, I noticed that Ana was very excited and scared; she gave me a signal with her eyes not to approach her.  This made me very worried; as if I had a premonition that something would happen to the two of them.  I took a bucket of water as an excuse and made my way toward the other lavatory; I passed in front of dining room where Ana and Vida were sitting.  This happened at about 11 p.m.;  I am quite confident about the time, since I started my duty at 10p.m..  After this I never saw Ana and Vida again.<P>

In the evening of November 16 or 17 1991, I was in the shelter when a female ZNG member went from one dormitory to another, reading out loud 15 names and ordering that these people report to Martin Sablic in front of the dining room.  Having done this, she said that "anybody failing to report will get a bullet in his forehead."  On the basis of the personal names and surnames she had read, and my personal acquaintance with some of the people on the list, I concluded that all of them were Serbs.  The list included Neducic from Lusac, Jova Markov and thirteen other men.  Jova Markov's wife, Liza, was with him.  These men were taken out of the "Obucara" shelter and never came back.  I know quite well that Neducic and Jovan Markov have not been found to this day.  The woman who was reading the list was in the company of an armed man in ZNG uniform.  I don't know who he is, because he was standing further away from me and I was unable to see him well.<P>

As for Martin Sablic, I can say that he was in charge of the shelter and that nothing could be done in the shelter without his approval.  He kept a record of all people going in and out of the "Obucara" shelter.  Martin was always in the company of Nikola Cibaric, a certain Bartol, a short ZNG member from Zagorje (he always emphasized where he was from), and a tall, fair-haired ZNG member wearing a pony tail.<P>

On the day following the night when 15 men were taken away from the shelter, Jova Markov's wife asked Martin Sablic when these men would return.  I witnessed this conversation because I happened to be passing by.  Martin said that "they should come back tonight by 2a.m., but since commander Nikola was killed - murdered, I don't think they'll come back."  He was referring to Nikola Cibaric, because we had been told that Nikola Cibaric had allegedly been killed.  I have not seen Cibaric after that.<P>
...<P>

Ana Lukic wore a light-blue blouse under a long cotton sweater; on top of that she had a grey-blue track suit top.  She told me that the track suit top belonged to her son.  She wore red slippers on her feet.  That's what she wore last time I saw her;  she told me earlier that the track suit was her son's because she had been wearing it earlier as well.</em><P>

...<P> 

Completed at 1p.m. 
Milica Zvjerec was born on 1/1/1947; she was employed at Borovo Works in Borovo near Vukovar<P>
<hr>

Corpses of Jovan Markov and Uros Neducic were found in the yard of the kindergarten "Pcelica". They were killed on November 18 1991.
Ana Lukic was killed at the railway station in Borovo.  Her corpse was found next to that of Vida Jakovljevic.  They were allegedly murdered by Nikola Cibaric and Bartol Domazet on November 16 1991.

<hr>

<IMG SRC="/info/students/marko/pictures/vukovar7.gif"><P>

Uros Neducic was born in 1943.  He was tortured and slain in the "Pcelica" kindergarten yard on November 18 1991.<P>

<h2>Statement given to the investigating judge by Katica Neducic, Uros Neducic's wife</h2>

<em>...  I am Uros Neducic's wife.  During this war we resided in Vukovar, in Luzac housing estate.  In mid-October, all residents of Luzac were evacuated, allegedly for reasons of security, and moved to Borovo Naselje.  Having got there, we stayed in various shelters - cellars, and on November 18 1991 we were taken out of the shelter by guardsmen and escorted to the "Nova Obuca" shelter.  This was a big shelter containing about 7,000 people.  Uros and I were accompanied by our two daughters.  I wish to say that my husband did not take part in fighting.<P>

Between 11:30p.m. and midnight on the day of our arrival, 11-12 names were read out and all those whose names were read out, including Uros, had to report to a room, the dining room.  Uros was called out and reported as requested.  Some of the men whose names were read out were not present; only Serbs were called out.  I am a Roman Catholic, but I am openly saying that, according to the names read out, only Serbs were involved.<P>

As I have already said, we had just arrived to the shelter; there were many people; soon afterwards we were freed by members of JNA, so that I was unable to establish at that time who else was taken away together with Uros.  I can remember that in addition to Uros, Milorad Neducic and Ljuban Miscevic were also called out, although neither of them was in the shelter; I really cannot remember the names of the men who were called out and taken away subsequently; I was simply unable to take in the names of other men involved.<P>

About 2a.m., Uros and 5 or 6 men were taken out of the shelter.  As he was being escorted out of the shelter, he passed by me and told me quietly that he was being taken to the headquarters.  He took off his spectacles and took out his cigarette lighter, a pen knife and 1,500,000 dinars and put it all in my lap.  His identity card and medical card remained in his pocket.  Uros wore a blue jeans jacket lined with white fur, track suit trousers and boots; the track suit trousers were dark blue.<P>

I only clearly saw one man escorting Uros and others, although there were a few of them, I think three.  The one I saw  didn't have a uniform; he was wearing a black head band, black leather jacket, jeans and army-issue boots; he had a rather curly black hear, which was cut short.<P>

I would also like to say that in the shelter, I was with the mother of Damir Breznjak, a guardsman who treated us properly.  Damir came into the shelter after Uros was taken out and asked me where Uros was.  I told him that Uros had been taken away.  Having heard that, Damir went to the other room, the dining room, and stayed there for a short while;  afterwards he he came out angry and slammed the door behind him.  He said nothing to me, just went by cursing.  Damir could know who else was taken away.<P></em>

The witness subsequently identified the corpse of her husband Uros Neducic, from photographs.<P>

The members of mutually related families of Pavlovic, Pavic, Trajkovic, Toskovic and Travas were hiding in the cellar of the house owned by Milos Novakovic, at 74 Nikola Damonja St., in Borovo Naselje near Vukovar.  All were killed on November 15 or 16 1991.  When the fighters of Yugoslav Peoples Army liberated Borovo Naselje, they found the sole survivor inside the house; Milica Trajkovic, who had been wounded and remained in the cellar, lived to see the liberators.<P>

The following persons were massacred:
<ol>
<li>Nada Pavlovic
<li>Zoran Pavlovic, Nada Pavlovic's son
<LI>Zorica Pavlovic, Nada Pavlovic's daughter
<LI>Milojka Pavlovic, Nada Pavovic's mother
<LI>Teodor Toskovic, Nada Pavlovic's common-law husband
<LI>Radoslav Pavic, Zorica Pavlovic's husband
<LI>Sava Pavic, Radoslav's step-mother, killed in the cellar
<LI>Velimir Trajkovic, Milica Trajkovic's husband
<LI>Milan Travas, neighbor of the Pavlovic family

They were all massacred in the courtyard, having been dragged out of the cellar.  Sava Pavic was killed and Milica Trajkovic was wounded in the cellar.  Teodor Toskovic was killed in the field behind the house.  Milica Trajkovic is now the sole surviving witness to these events.  According to her testimony, in addition to her, there were also eight people hiding in the cellar: her husband Velimir Trajkovic, her aunt Sava Pavic, her cousin Radoslav Pavic and the Pavlovic family: grandmother Milojka, Nada's children Zoran and Zorica, Nada's unmarried husband Teodor Toskovic and Milan Travas, a neighbor of the Pavlovic family.  On November 15 of 16 1991, the voice of an unknown man was heard from the entrance to the closed cellar asking whether there was anybody inside.  he was told that there were only civilians inside.  Then the unknown person stormed inside cursing them and made them all go outside.  The last but one was Sava Pavic, who was too scared to leave the cellar and kept saying "I'll come out in a minute, son, in a minute."  The unknown man shot her on the spot.  That was when Milica was also wounded.  As she was falling down, she managed to pull a thick quilt over her head and lay like that for several days until she was taken out of the cellar by her liberators, including her cousin Miroslav Pavic.  Miroslav helped her to get outside and carried out his dead mother, Pava.<P>

<TITLE>Vukovar Hospital</TITLE>

<H2>Medical Testimony of the Vukovar Tragedy</h2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">Croatian Medical Journal, Zagreb 1992<P>

This publication was conceived and produced as a separate edition of the Croatian medical journal.  Like all Croatians throughout the world, we want to cherish the memory of a beautiful town of Vukovar destroyed to the last house, and the battle in which a handful of Croatian soldiers effectively neutralized the third strongest army in Europe for full three months.  As medical professionals, we also want to document honorable deeds and heroic efforts of our colleagues from Vukovar medical center.  Their stories are telling about the achievements of the Croatian medicine, at the same time leaving deep traces for the generations of medical professionals to come.  Their struggle to save human lives, not asking for nationality, religion or political beliefs, bears the greatness and solemnity of the Croatian soldiers defending our homes and our freedom.  For the homeland, the battlefield is one and the same for all.<P>

...  The preparation and printing of this publication was accomplished during the first half of December 1991.  It is a small token of our affection for Vukovar and its brave people, and thus a nonprofit issue.  We expect everybody to treat and use it with respect.  The material may be reproduced under provisions that it is not altered, and that its source is properly cited.<P>

<h3>Attacks on the Hospital - Sequence of events</h3>

The old and the new wings with inpatient wards as well as other hospital premises were directly shelled from multiple rocket launchers, mortars and tanks.  At first, particular parts of the hospital were intentionally targeted to be destroyed.  Consequences of the grenade explosions were also visible in the hospital yard, despite the fact that a large white sheet with a Red Cross in the middle was stretched over the AA-shelter after the Red Cross signs on the hospital roof had been destroyed.  The holes in the walls and broken windows were stuffed with bedsides, cardboard and plastic sheets.<P>

In the beginning, the wounded were stationed in the first-floor corridors and descended to the underpass during alarms.  Soon, they had to stay there all the time.  First floor was only used when the basement and the underpass were overcrowded.  At the beginning of October, 80 wounded were examined in a single day.  The hall of the admission room was flooded with blood - it was swept away by a broom.  On that occasion, 40 admitted wounded persons were placed in the first floor.  As grenades hit just that part of the hospital, they were quickly removed to a lower floor.  They lay in twos in beds, on the floor, under the beds...  Practically, they were hardly accessible.  The first-floor walls swayed and threatened to crush down.<P>

We were expecting the first convoy for evacuation.  It did not come.  When the second convoy arrived, the wounded were transferred in the rain to the trucks covered with tarpaulin, with styrofoam on the floor.  For as long as it was possible, lightly wounded were transferred to the ward in the <em>Borovokomerc</em> shelter, but this connection was soon cut off.  All the wounded had to stay in the hospital.  Toward the end of October, the hospital was hit by 250-kg bombs.  The building quivered, the walls swayed as on the waves, the door-posts and window sashes were thrown out.  In the ground-floor, glass from the compartment walls showered upon the patient beds in the hall.  Four sacks of glass were gathered there.  One bomb fell along the outer part of the building setting two cars on fire (one ambulance and one private car).  through broken windows of the Surgical and Internal Medicine Wards, black smoke poured out.  The patients in the ground-floor drew their infusion catethers out, cried for help, jumped, and those immobile crept out of their beds.  Another bomb pierced the loft and the ceiling of the Surgery and Internal medicine Wards, and the ground-floor, and fell unexploded on the bed, between the legs of one patient (P.V.).  The patient with an upper arm injury jumped from his bed.  Extremely astonished, a nurse asked where that oxygen bomb had come from, right onto the bed (she did not even realize at first what it actually was!).  In the Intensive Care Unit in the AA-shelter, a "strong air wave" blew the hair in our faces.  Later we saw the sky through a hole in the ground-floor ceiling.<P>

Over the last 15 days, the Hospital was daily exposed to fierce several hour ceaseless attacks.  In the AA shelter, the patient beds quivered, the boxes we set upon swayed.  During one of the attacks, the concrete fell down in front of the shelter entrance and one patient was lightly injured.  It was the only injury inflicted upon the patients during all those attacks on the hospital.<P>

Two days before the fall of Vukovar, the premises of the Police Station and the Court, that partially protected our building, were set on fire and demolished.  Now, the hospital was a plainly exposed target for the Yugoslav Federal Army (YFA) artillery from across the river Danube.  We expected them to set the hospital on fire.  the wounded were not brought in anymore.  Later we learned they had all been referred to the Borovo Naselje shelter, because all ways to the hospital were cut off.  Conditions in that shelter, however, were inadequate for proper care of the severely wounded.<P>

<em>The End</em><P>

When Vukovar fell, YFA "evacuated" 300 wounded along with some 1,000 civilians, and transferred them to Borovo Selo, a village occupied by Chetniks.  The wounded were not escorted by Red Cross members.  We know nothing about their fate.  Only one nurse has managed somehow to reach Zagreb.<P>

At that time, before the fall of Vukovar, Dr. Bosanac contacted major Mrksic, commander of the Vukovar Garrison, asking him to protect the wounded and the hospital staff from possible insults by the Chetniks.  She mentioned the possible evacuation on Sunday, at 2a.m., to us.  On November 20, 1991 the YFA officers were first to walk through the hospital door accompanied by the former hospital porter, a Serb, now in military uniform.  The hospital was surrounded by YFA soldiers who forbade anybody to get out.  They demanded all the rooms to be searched through and all arms to be given up.  They took complete medical records on all the patients, wounded and dead.  Nine YFA soldiers treated at the Hospital were immediately taken away.  Soldiers walked around with "Scorpions" lifted high in their hands.  They did not contact us nor made any comments.  They were quite correct.  We do not know how they behaved toward the wounded, because we were not allowed to contact the later.  The day passed quietly.  The next evening, the cast-makers M.M. and Z.V., who had taken photographs of the hospital, were taken away, and so was the court inspector.  They were told to give all the photo material up.<P>

The following morning, Dr. Lj.S., anesthesiologist, informed us all to gather in the cast-room at 7:30.  We, the doctors, and nurses were separated from other hospital staff.  YFA offices Veselin Sljivicanin gave a political speech, explaining that they had come to liberate us.  he acquitted Dr. Bosanac of the duty and appointed a new director.  During that time, a part of the wounded were taken out through the emergency exit.  We were not allowed to check who was left and who was transferred to the YFA barracks.<P>

We had four options: to go to Sid, to Novi Sad, to Zagreb <em>via</em> Dakovo or to stay in Vukovar.  We did not see Drs. Bosanac and Njavro anymore.  We brought only the most necessary personal things along and left the shelter with about 180 wounded.  We were crowded in buses and army transporters, and escorted by Red Cross and European Community Monitoring Mission (ECMM) members; we saw them within the hospital premises for the first time.  At that moment, we did not know that they had been forbidden by YFA to enter the hospital the day before.<P>

Patient lists with diagnoses were prepared the day before.  Seven doctors and three nurses were cut off in Borovo.  Dr. Bosanac told us she would wait for their evacuation since she could not leave them and just go.  We did not see her anymore.<P>

We left the ruins of Vukovar.  Three vehicles were lost on the way, their YFA drivers "got lost".  Later on they rejoined us.  In Bijeljina, after we had passed Sremska Mitrovica, a group of some 200 people, civilians and Chetniks (the so-called Arkan's Chetniks) waited and halted us.  The army transporters and buses stopped, we had to go out, where we were insulted, attacked, threatened, in front of YFA and local police who just stood aside and watched.  A Chetnik entered the bus and yelled at an old man that he was Arkan's Chetnik, another one recognized one of the wounded and threatened he could kill him on the spot.  These were incidents on our way back.  As advised by the EC officials, we returned to the buses.  Our ambulances and buses were stoned.  We headed for Dakovo and then for Zagreb.<P>

<h3>The Wounded</h3>

All the wounded were equally treated, regardless of their religion and nationality.  Civilians comprised two thirds of them.  Children were also wounded, the youngest patient aged 6.5 months; she was injured by a grenade.  She survived and was evacuated with us.  We also treated nine YFA soldiers.  Three of them were placed close to Dr. Bosanac's office, with special guard.  During one of the attacks, the watchmen rushed to the room together with the wounded and took those YFA members out.  Then, the outer wall of the room fell down when hit by a grenade.  These soldiers were even much better treated than the Croatian Guardsmen or civilians: they were given more food and cigarettes.<P>

One YFA soldier was all alone, without his parents and brother who had been killed in a traffic accident, and his grandmother had died during the war.  He died from gaseous gangrene, after high above the knee amputation.  He did not even wake up from anesthesia.  There were several wounded who remained paraplegic.  We believed the condition was transitory, consequential to the post-traumatic endema.  There was no overt spine injury.  Unfortunately, neither were there any signs of reinnervation.<P>

Two YFA soldiers died at the Intensive Care Unit; one from a severe head injury.  He was admitted with pulse of 40bpm, unconscious, with hopeless prognosis.  We kept him on the only respirator for 7 days.  The other mentioned above, died from gaseous gangrene.  before that he was given six bottles of blood, although the others received one bottle each, regardless of indications.  Gaseous gangrene caused three deaths, and six patients had to undergo amputation; one of then was an Orthodox priest...<P>

<h3>The Fall of Vukovar</h3>

By November 19,1991, we were aware that Vukovar had fallen.  YFA entered the town, and we were told not to leave the hospital during the night.  YFA guarded the Center, both regular soldiers and Serbian irregular reservists.  Among them there was a number of our neighbors and friends of Serbian nationality.  Several members of the hospital staff were taken away that night.  The night was otherwise silent with only faraway detonations.<P>

<h3>The Evacuation</h3>

The evacuation was organized and surveilled by Serbian Red Cross only.  International Red Cross team spent an hour or two in the hospital yard in the morning.  EC mission members just observed the events.  In the morning of November 20, 1991, the medical personnel was ordered to gather in a room at 7:30.  A YFA officer announced that from now on the military rules were in order, and that Dr. Bosanac is acquitted of her function.  He gave a speech on Yugoslavia and YFA.  During that time, as we later learned, ambulant patients were taken away in buses to the YFA base.  Several members of the hospital staff and husbands of our female personnel, who came to the hospital to be with their children and wives and helped in the hospital, were also taken away.  Upon our protests, few of them were released.<P>

The remaining patients were loaded into the trucks by medical personnel.  The convoy was formed and headed for Petrijevci.  It turned later toward Negoslavci (opposite of the way that was agreed upon).  We were told that the Croatian officials do not want to receive us, and since we had wounded with us we would be headed to Sremska Mitrovica to stay overnight until negotiations were over.  The wounded were transferred to the medical unit of the local garrison.  Two of them were soon transferred to Belgrade by a helicopter because of their condition.  We slept in the busses, because we did not want to be separated.<P>

Next morning, around 11 a.m., we headed for Raca, near Bijeljina in Bosnia.  Banjski Dvori were the place of the transfer to Croatian vehicles.  The YFA left us and Bosnian police took over the control of the convoy.  I was in the front of the convoy and did not see what happened behind, where two ambulances were destroyed and wounded and personnel attacked by a group of local citizens and Chetniks.  EC delegates intervened and stopped the attack.  We felt great joy and relief when we crossed the bridge over the Sava river and finally entered the free Croatian territory.<P>

<h3>Supplies</h3>

In general, the supply with medical material and food was organized and timely.  For the last 20 days, water was the main problem.  We did not have running water for two months.  Fire-fighters transported water from Borovo.  They were the target of constant attacks, so that three of them were killed and several tank lorries destroyed.  For the last 20 days, we went out during the night and collected rain water and water from wells.  The shortage of water caused sanitary problems.  We were allowed a liter and a half of water a day.  With this, I managed to wash my hair, face and body, shave and use the dirty water to wash my feet.  Washing of the clothes was almost impossible, although we tried our best.  All personnel wore white overalls and I think we succeeded in keping decent outlook.  The kitchen was attacked twice.  The food consisted of tinned meat brought in by civilians or members of the Croatian national Guard.  Several pieces of meat were accompanied by a handful of boiled rice of potatoes.  For the last ten days, when the communication with Borovo was cut off, the bread presented the main problem.  Women made bread without the yeast.  We got one and a half slice of bread per day.  The sterilization unit was attacked several times.  We would repair it and transfer it to some other part of the hospital, but YFA always learned about its new position and attacked it again.  As for the medical supplies, the main problem was the lack of antibiotics, blood and plasma.  People came in to give blood, but we could not use it because they were actually the ones who needed blood transfusions - their blood counts were abnormal after months of starvation.  We did not have enough electricity for all the freezers, so we could not make any supplies and even lost some.  The only test we could perform for the last two months was the blood cell count.<P>

<h3>Medical Staff</h3>

The total of around 300 persons worked in the hospital.  This included the personnel within other shelters that served as small medical units (Olajnica, a good shelter; Police Headquarters cellar; the <em>Universal</em> factory; <em>Borovokomerc</em> in Borovo, with more than 1000 civilians and 200 wounded).  Some 40% of the personnel were Serbs.  In their duties they were correct and loyal.  Whether they were loyal in their spare time I could not say, but there are several indications that the information leaked out of the hospital and was used for its destruction.  Whenever we made any transfer of the material, patients of equipment, the agressor's attack was aimed in that direction.  Approximately 30% of the Serbs had family members on the other side, appearing on the hospital premises in military or paramilitary uniforms.  As an example I will tell the following anecdote: for the last ten days, three YFA soldiers, including one officer, were stationed in the basement room with a nurse who took care of them only.  YFA knew they were there because one day a mortar shell flew directly into the room, hit the cement floor and destroyed parts of the floor and wall.  The room was in smoke and dust.  Luckily, the patients were not hurt.  the nurse took one patient from his bed and the other patients were taken out in the arms of nearby civilian and Croatian Guardsmen patients.  The soldiers were transferred into an undamaged room.  The next morning, we took them to the hall to other patients.  The same afternoon, a grenade of large caliber fell half meter from the outer wall and destroyed their room.  We knew that their deaths would be ascribed to us.  These three soldiers were treated with extra care: they got a pack of cigarettes per day, while our soldiers got only three cigarettes, they got extra piece of meat in their rice.  On of them fell in love with the nurse, and said he would not leave us.  On the morning when YFA entered the hospital, they were immediately taken away.  Another example: one of our patients was a retired orthodox priest, Dorde-Doka Sijakovic, whose leg had to be amputated because of gaseous gangrene.  He was a prominent citizen of Vukovar, beloved by all, regardless of their religion.  He would share one cigarette with Croatian soldiers and doctors.  After the siege, he expressed his wish to be transferred and teated in Zagreb.  I do not know what happened to him.  I could tell many stories like this, about human courage, solidarity and friendship....<P>

<h1>Croats Give an Extra Twist to the Cycle of Brutality</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Ian Traynor<br>  Guardian, 2/15/92, London</i></h2><p>



<hr>

<FONT SIZE="+2">Zagreb: Mile Vujnovic was found on a craggy precipice in the woods outside the town of Gospic in December, a corpse covered with stones, his legs bound with rope, his hands tied behind his back, his right fist a bloody mass, several bullet wounds in the chest.  Vujnovic, 70 when he died, had been lying there for a couple of months.  His corpse and those of his two younger companions were rotting.<p>

According to the Croatian police documents shown to the Guardian, the corpses were found on December 3.  All three men were Serbian civilians from Gospic, a town south-west of Zagreb that was split between Serbs and Croats and that is now a rubble-strewn disaster zone.<p>

The Zagreb police say a Croatian police reservist has been arrested for the murders of the trio, which they assert, goes to show that they are serious about prosecuting Croats guilty of crimes against Serbian civilians during the war.<p>

Others scoff at the notion.  Like Milorad Pupovac, a prominent Zagreb Serb, a moderate and a liberal, who is convinced that Croatian police investigations of Croatian crimes against the Serbian minority are purely politically motivated, for foreign consumption.<p>

It is meant they say, to offset the kind of criticism made in yesterday's Helsinki Watch report with its evidence of summary executions and torture of civilians.<p>

The problem with the Vujnovic case is that it appears to be just the tip of an iceberg and that a lot more than three corpses are involved<p>


Mr Pupovac says that up to 180 local Serbs have disappeared from Gospic and its surrounding villages in the past few months, mainly abducted by masked Croatian gunmen while sheltering in basements from shelling.  An earlier figure in widespread circulation is 120.<P>

The dissident Zagreb press has listed more than 60 missing Serbs.  Yesterday's Helsinki report says 29 Serbian corpses, many mutilated, have been recovered, and identified, and that many more are missing.  The weight of circumstantial and witnesses' evidence about the atrocities in Gospic is heavy.<p> 

That is why the Croatian police were ordered to investigate.  But several months after the investigation was launched, it remains inconclusive, and the police say they cannot confirm the testimony of witnesses.<p>

``I state that it is not the truth that 120 people were surrounded and killed in Gospic," says Smiljan Reljic, head of the Croatian CID.  He has been to Gospic himself to supervise the investigation.  The Helsinki Watch report, he thinks, is probably based on rumour.  The Helsinki researchers interviewed local witnesses and relatives of the victims.<p>

In a separate interview, Marijan Benko, Commander Reljic's deputy, said:``We haven't established that 120 people were abducted in Gospic.  We have records of some being missing, but nothing on that scale."<p>

One of the 29 corpses found and identified is that of Branko Stulic, a prominent Gospic Serb who was a local judge.  He ``appeared to have been stabbed in the back by a knife', the Helsinki Watch report says.<p>

As far as Mr Benko is concerned, judge Stulic is missing, but his death has not been confirmed.  And whatever happened to him, ``for sure, the Croatian side didn't do it".<p>

The Croatian CID insists it is doing everything possible to get to the bottom of the Gospic incidents, but there is a war on, it is under-staffed, and with hundreds of thousands of people homeless and many missing, the investigation faces huge obstacles.<p>

Mr Pupovac and the Serbian Democratic Forum he heads have for months been amassing and collating information on the treatment of the Serbian minority in Croatia.  Four months into the police investigation, Mr Pupovac says that not once have the Zagreb police asked him or his colleagues to help with their inquiries by, for example, providing their documented evidence.<p>

``The Gospic investigation has been going on for months and has got nowhere.  They don't intend to do anything about it," says a western diplomat in Zagreb.  ``The Croats are very sensitive on the human rights problem.  But they don't see it as a priority right now."<p>

Mr Pupovac acknowledges and deplores the atrocities committed by Serbs in Croatia, but fears an endless cycle of tit-for-tat brutality.<p>

``The Serbs in Croatia at the moment are without physical security and without the protection of the law," he says.  ``These events are the immediate responsibility of the Croatian state.  It must protect its citizens equally."<p>

President Franjo Tudjman told the Guardian he was determined to ''eliminate atrocities, even on the part of Croats.  We are fully for constitutional order."<p>

But he described the Gospic events as ``a life and death struggle imposed by Serbian extremists in Croatia," and adding a new twist to the Gospic controversy, said:``there is even a possibility that it was some agents provocateurs in order to compromise the Croatian authorities.  We know there were military intelligence agents there, as well as foreign intelligence agents involved in that particular incident."<p>

And while the police complain that they do not have enough time or resources to devote to the case in the midst of a war, the Croatian parliament and Mr Tudjman have this week been preoccupied with the rehabilitation of Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, the head of the Croatian Catholic Church under the puppet fascist regime during the second world war.<p>

After the war, the communists sentenced the cardinal to 16 years in jail for collaboration.  He served two years.<p>

``Why has the parliament been preoccupied with Stepinac and not Gospic?" asks the Western diplomat.  ``For a long time to come, it's not going to  be comfortable to  be a Serb in this country."<p>

<h1>The crimes committed in Gospic</h1>

<em>Dr. Zoran Stankovic, pathologist</em><P>

From October 16 to 18, soldiers wearing camouflage uniforms and masks on their faces were abducting civilians, mostly Serbs, in Gospic and its surrounding communities, and taking them to unknown destinations.  Later on, the members of JNA and a territorial defense unit from the village of Siroka Kula found 24 mostly charred corpses at a place called Kukin Do.  Some corpses were recognized as those of people taken away from Gospic in the above mentioned period.  There were 15 men and 9 women, and 11 corpses could not be identified nor was it possible to detect injuries which had caused their death.  All of the identified persons were Serbs from Gospic, who had disappeared between October 16 to 18, 1991.<P>

Bullet wounds, lashes caused by the blade of mechanical instruments, piercing wounds caused by the point and blade of mechanical instruments and inward fractures of the skull caused by the blunt side of mechanical implements were some of the injuries identified.  In the case of 18 corpses, it was not possible to establish reliably the exact number and type of injuries, because some of their parts were missing, while the corpses were charred...<P>

<h1>The statement of Marija Kljajic, wife of missing journalist Simo Kljajic</h1>

"It all began on 30 August 1991.  Many Serbs gathered and then left Gospic.  My husband and I remained.  We expected that nobody would bother us after all.  My husband disappeared on 12 October.  At 8 a.m., he went out to buy newspapers.  He brought them home and then at about 11 a.m. He went out again to by some groceries.  He was wearing a jacket and trousers.  He never returned.  That was on Saturday, 12 October 1991.  I went to our friends, the Pantelic's to make a phone call.  However, the telephone lines were out of order that day.  On 13 October, I went to the police station in order to report my husbands disappearance.  In November, I was told that 23 people had disappeared and that their whereabouts were still unknown.  On 10 November I left Gospic and went to Zagreb, via Karlobag, Crikvenica and Rijeka.  From Zagreb I went to Belgrade.<P>
My husband was a pensioner and whole Lika knew him.  He was known and respected by everyone...<P>
My husband was a Serb; I am a Croat."<P>

<h1>The statement of Milica Smiljanic, wife of the slain Stanko Smiljanic</h1>

"They came to get my husband at midnight on 16 October.  They barged into the house armed to their teeth; they were wearing camouflage uniforms and green caps with holes for eyes pulled over their faces.  They found us hiding in the cellar and then they started shooting at the ceiling and shouting:'Get up, you bandits!'  I recognized one of them by his voice.  It was Irfan Matajia, a local.  They demanded from us to sign a statement which stated that the Serbs in Croatia were not endangered.  We refused to do so, because it wasn't true.  My husband and brother-in-law were then ordered to get dressed.  They tied them up and shoved them onto a truck.  I was escorted at a gun point to the house of Radovan Barac, where they demanded that I ask him to come out.  Radovan's mother came out instead.  She refused to call her son.  They took them both away.  I was visited on the same night by Luka Sulentic, who was one of the first who had been picked up by the Ustashe; he was released later once it was established that he was a Croat.  Sulentic told me that scores of Serbs had been arrested and taken by trucks to Smiljan.  I spent three months searching for my husband and brother-in-law, Milan.  Several times I addressed in person Zeljko Bolf, the chief of police in Gospic.  I begged him to find out what had happened to Stanko and Milan.  He promised to make inquiries and let me know, which he never did.  I managed to escape from Gospic thanks to a Croatian police officer who helped me get an ausweis (a pass), so that I was able to reach Zagreb, via Karlobag, Senj, Rijeka, Delnice and Karlovac.  From Zagreb, I went to Doboj, and from there to Serbia.<P>

Stanko had no enemies.  He never engaged in politics; he didn't belong to a political party.  He simply wasn't interested in such things. Now I know that his only sin was his Serbian descent.  Perhaps, the fact that my mother in law was the sister of Nada Dimic, a WWII partisan hero who had been killed by the Ustashe, was one of the reasons for killing him..."<P>

<h1>Serbs abandon life of fear in Croatia: Tudjman's generous law on minorities is not halting an exodus of frightened people</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Emma Daly<br>  Independent, 2/13/95, London</i></h2><p>

copyright 1995 Newspaper Publishing PLC

<hr>

Zagreb: ``My family lived in Croatia for 800 years," said Ana. But, she is planning to leave for good this summer, with her husband Ilija and their two sons.<p>

The family will swap the comfortable two-storey house they built in a village outside Zagreb for a Croat-owned house in northern Serbia.  Ana has decided, regretfully, that life as a Serb in Croatia has become too painful, adding:``Probably the situation for the Croats in Serbia is not very rosy either."<p>

Since Croatia's recognition in January 1992, when the Serbs accounted for about 12 per cent of the 4 million-plus population, some 300,000 have left [the Croatian] government-held territory, 85,000 moving to the ``Serbian Republic of Krajina."<p>

Of those who stayed, some have assimilated, changing their names and converting to Catholicism; others stick it out, loath to leave their homes and hoping for better times.<p>

``There is no way to live well in Krajina.  I would have no job there.  Everything we own is here.  Our children were born here.  We don't want to give it up," said Gordana, a Croatian Serb in Zagreb, who lost her job as a cook, she claims, because of discrimination.<p>

She and her husband, Dragan, describe a life circumscribed by intimidation, isolated from their Croatian neighbours, cut off from relatives in Krajina, their children bullied at school and rejected for places at university.<p>


``A Serbian colleague of mine changed his name to Ivan, a Croatian name, but it didn't help him much because everyone knew he was a Serb and in a way they despised him a bit for giving up a part of himself," Dragan said.  ``and he lost his job in the end, anyway."<P>

Ana and Ilija decided to leave because their two sons were bullied at school - the youngest by his teacher - and friendless.  ``I was born here and I'm going to the unknown but I'm happy to do it because of the children," Ana said.<p> 

Such stories are common, according to human rights officials and Croatian Serb politicians.  ``I would call the policy of our government towards Serbs 'soft ethnic cleansing'," said Ivan Cicak, of the Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights.<p>

The atmosphere is better now, three years after the Serb-Croat war.  It is almost certainly safer to be a Serb in Croatia than to be a Croat in Krajina.<p>

Mr Cicak says that the situation is improving as does Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the United Nations human rights rapporteur.<p>

Under Croatian law, Serbs are guaranteed human rights and the advancement of their culture.  Serious crimes, such as kidnapings, murders, the destruction of Serbian houses and illegal eviction s are no longer a problem.  yet, Serbs do not enjoy the rights to which they are entitled by law.<p>

Many face obstacles getting citizenship and keeping their jobs and homes.  they also encounter hostility, much of it fostered by the government.<p>

When asked about illegal evictions last year, President Franjo Tudjman replied that ``evictions have to do with the individuals who are guilty or in connection with those guilty for the fact that in Croatia today we have 250,000 people driven out of their homes ... and also thousands killed." As Mr Cicak said:``The Serbs are accused of collective guilt."<p>

Veselin Pejanovic, an MP of the Serbian National Party, considered a Tudjman puppet group by other Serbian politicians, and Milorad Pupavac, founder of the Independent Serbian Party, say the minorities law does not yet apply in Croatia.<p>

The government says the minorities law will be implemented fully once the Krajina is reintegrated.  But the Krajina Serbs have refused to consider a peace plan for Croatia until Mr Tudjman revokes his decision to expel the UN.  The two enemies have made some progress, agreeing to open a road linking two Serb-held areas.<p>

<h1> Six Women Tremble As They See The 'Door Of Hell' Open</h1><p>

 
<h2><i>Ian Traynor<br>The Guardian , 8/9/95, London, UK</i></h2><p>

<i>Copyright 1995 Guardian Newspapers Limited</i><p>
<hr>

On the top floor of a crumbling Habsburgian tenement in the centre of Zagreb yesterday, six women spent the entire day alternately sobbing quietly, wailing in grief, and hugging the telephone.<p>

They were all Serbs, members of the Croatian capital's much diminished but still large Serb community.  All are cought up in what is already the biggest and quickest single population transfer in four years of balkan war, following the Croat seizure of the rebel Serb enclave of krajina.<p>

"We all have to go now.  There's blood on the streets and no one will help us," said Mira, a retired post office clerk, aged 65.  "Most of us will leave.  We're afraid we'll be liquidated."<p>

Anka Bunarevic, aged 75 said:"For four years we Serbs in Croatia have been living on the doorstep of hell.  The door has just opened."  Mrs Bunarevic looked every inch the stereotype of the Balkan peasant, her crumpled, wrinkled face wrapped in a black shawl.  In fact, she was one of Yugoslavia's most distinguished pathologists, is president of Zagreb's Serb Orthodox Council and has spent more than half a contury not working the fields, but living in this city.<p>

"This is a tragedy for Serbs.  But it is also a tragedy for Croats and for the many mixed families," said Milorad Pupovac, a moderate political leader of the Serb minority.  "It looks like it means the end of 400 years of Serb life in these territories."<P>

Before the war erupted in Croatia in 1991, about 100,000 Serbs lived in the Croatian capital.  The majority of Croatia's Serbs -400,000 of 600,000- were urbanised; many had roots and relatives in rural Krajina.  Mr Pupovac estimates that the ethnic cleansing of the past four years has left some 130,000 Serbs in Croatia's cities, 40,000 in Zagreb.<p>

Serb leaders in Zegreb tried to contact Croatia's prime minister, Nikica Valentic, to get human rights guarantees and assurances of safety for members of their community.  But the Croatian government, in triumphalizt mood, ignored them.<p>

The Serb mothers of Zagreb are enraged by Croatian government calls for Serbs to stay in Croatia.  One 40-year-old pointed to her son, aged six, and said there was no way he would grow up in a climate of harassment and discrimination.<p>

Jovanka, aged 65, was relieved her two daughters had married Croats.  "There is now a lot of assimilation.  Parents are agreeing that their kids at shcool become Catholics, and are changing their names.  Anything for an easy life.<p>

Croatian liberals said they doubted that there was an overt campaign to force Serbs to convert from their Orthodox faith to Croatian Catholicism.  But they agreed there was enormous social pressure in the fiercely nationalist climate for Serb schoolchildren to become Catholics.  Young Serb friends, they added, were changing their names.<p>

Mr Pupovac said there was no violence or large-scale harassment of Serbs in Zagreb, but the entire community was gripped by fear and panic.<p>

"If the Croatian government wants to integrate us socially and culturally, we urban Serbs will remain.  But if the situation stays as it is now, there will be a movement of Serbs from Croatia and it will be the last."<p>

Mladen Klemencic, a Croat political scientist and geographer, agreed that up to 200,000 Serbs could flee Croatia after the latest war games of the nationalist leaders in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia.<p>

"We need to break the cycle of revenge.  We have to find a way to bring some of them back.  As many as half might come back if we offer the right conditions."<P>

But Natasha Radakovic, spokeswoman for Croatia's president Franjo Tudjman, insisted that masses of Serbs leaving Croatia were doing so of their own free will.  "If there was any ethnic cleansing, it was done by the Serbs themselves.  We did not ask anyone to leave.  On the contrary."<P>

Such emarks inspire a frenzy of shrieking and wailing in the siz Serb women.  "There will be a few Serbs left here and they'll be like animals in a zoo, exhibits for Tudjman to show Western visitors who are concerned about human rights," siad Mrs Bunarevic.<P>

the Serb exodus from Zagreb is getting under way.  One man showed up at the Orthodox church looking for his children's baptism certificates, saying he and 11 other families were heading for Serbia.  Another arrived with a list of 400 Serb families preparing to go.<p>

"Maybe we should just let these politicians have their way," said Jovanka, "divide everything up, separate, and get on with our lives."<P>

<h1> Muslim Mother Longs for the Return of Kidnapped Sons</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Vesna Peric Zimonic<br>  Inter Press Service, 10/26/93</i></h2><p>


<hr>

BELGRADE: A year has passed since Safija Catovic's two sons were abducted from a local bus on their way to work.  Nothing has been heard of them since.<p>

"My boys will surely come back one day...they haven't done anything to anyone," she says, as she waits for the return of Ramahudin aged 24 and Sabahudin aged 22.<p>

The brothers are two of 17 Muslims abducted a year ago from a bus taking workers and school children to Priboj, a town in Serbia, some 115 miles southwest from Belgrade.<p>

Priboj lies close to the curvy border between Serbia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, where civil war has raged for 18 months.  The bus route meanders between mountains and the nearby river, and passes through small stretches of Bosnian territory under the control of Bosnian Serbs.<p>

At the end of October in 1992 a group of armed men stopped the bus while it was in Bosnian territory, asked for the passengers identity papers and took away the 17 Muslims, all from the village of Sjeverin<p>

Witnesses said the armed men told the Muslims nothing would happen to them, and they would be exchanged for Bosnian Serbs.  In November there were reports that they had been executed, and others saying they were still alive.  But that was the last that has been heard of them.<p>

The bus abduction is not an isolated incident.  In February this year a train connecting Belgrade and Bar, the Montenegrin port, was stopped as it passed along a half mile stretch of track through Bosnia-Hercegovina..<p>

Some 30 men wearing camouflage and the insignia of the Bosnian Serb army boarded the train and took 23 of the male passengers away at gunpoint.<p>

Even though Dobrica Cosic, Yugoslavia's president at the time, ordered an investigation, nothing has since been heard about the case.<p>

Eight Muslims born in Serbia, five Muslims born and living in Montenegro, one Croat , two foreigners and seven Serbs born in Bosnia are still missing.<p>


The Bosnian Serb army commander Gen. Ratko Mladic denied his regulars had anything to do with the incident but admitted "some paramilitary formations could exist in the area, who respect no-one."<p>

The area where the train abductions took place was not far from where the 17 bus passengers were abducted the previous October.<p>

Better known under its Turkish name "Sandjak," the area has a significant population of Muslims of Slav origin -- 237,000 according to the April 1991 census.  Administratively, it belongs to the republic of Serbia.<p>

As a result of the abductions, Muslims living in Serbia towns and villages near the border with Bosnia-Hercegovina have begun to leave their homes and property, heading for areas where Muslims are more dominant, or for Turkey and Sweden.<p>

The Red Cross in Serbia admits that officially around 1500 Muslims have moved from the border areas or have emigrated, but others argue the total figure is far higher.<p>

Some 50 out of 200 families have left the village of Sjeverin, where the 17 Muslim men were kidnapped.  Their homes were immediately looted or repossessed by Serb "neighbors."<p>

Natasa Kandic, the executive director of the Belgrade-based Human Rights Fund, says that although people have been kidnapped since the beginning of the break up of the former Yugoslavian federation and the ensuing civil wars, but says things have now taken a turn for the worse.<p>

"Most of the early abductees were released when a certain objective has been accomplished," she said, "but the war in Bosnia saw a shift in attitudes.  Some estimates say that about 50,000 people are missing after being taken to the detention camps."<p>

At a recent conference in Belgrade on the disappearances, people told of how friends had disappeared after returning home from holidays in Croatia.  The editor of independent Belgrade-based newspaper <em>Vreme</em> was kidnapped for 38 hours in September, and never learned who his abductors were.<p>

"The era of political terrorism has begun," says journalists and long-time correspondent in Latin America, Dusan Dakovic.  "The war zones are too close, the state of law does not exist in Yugoslavia.  Anybody can do whatever he wants, without fear of being caught of punished," he adds.<p>

All in All, says Kandic, the fate of 200,00 people from all over the former Yugoslavian federation (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia) is unknown.<p>

They are listed as missing and no-one is coming forward to say what has happened to them.  The reason is, she says, the war and everything that war brings along with it.<p>

<h1> Killers Focus on a Photographer</h1><p>

 
<h2><i>Hans Moleman<br>The Guardian , 4/26/93, London, UK</i></h2><p>

<i>Copyright 1993 Guardian Newspapers Limited, de Volkskrant</i><p>
<hr>

Enough was enough.  In February after two months in a Belgrade jail, three attacks on his parents house and countless phone calls threatening that they would slit his throat just like a pig, Bojan Stojanovic fled from the terrors of Serbian nationalism.<p>

He is now living in the Netherlands, like thousands of others who have flown from the violence in former Yugoslavia.  Yet 23-year-old Stojanovic is no ordinary asylum seeker.  The young Belgrade photographer made the front page all over the world last year with pictures of Serbian policeman summarily executing a Muslim in Brcko, a small town in northern Bosnia.  The picture has just been awarded first prize in the spot news category of the World Press Photo awards, to be presented later this week in Amsterdam.<p>

The pictures date from May 1992 when the outside world still knew nothing of concentration camps, murder squads and rapes.  They were among the first to show the horrific daily practices of Serbian ethnic cleansing.  They made a huge impression and contributed to international denunciation of Serbia.  The photographs also turned the unknown, occasional Reuter freelancer into a traitor in the eyes of Serbian nationalists.  A good Serb doesn't take photos of the war crimes of his own compatriots.  He himself thinks that he is just doing his job: showing the realities of war.<P>
 
"On May 5 last year, I was on my way from Belgrade to Sarajevo.  Near Brcko we heard something was up.  When we drove into the village, we glimpsed a couple of bodies on a side street.  I grabbed my cameras and, just a bit later, a policeman and a soldier came past, pushing two handcuffed men in front of them."  When the policeman raised his gun to shoot one man, Stojanovic pointed his Nikon and pressed the shutter release with the motor drive on.  There was no time to focus.<p>

He hid the film in his sock, frightened of having his camera seized.  But the policeman and the soldier completely ignored him.  "I think they were bound up with their murdering."<p>

Stojanovic decided to deliver the pictures to Reuters in Belgrade straight away.  Just outside Brcko they saw something else: a white refrigerated van for meat transport and a military vehicle turning off the main road.  They followed and then watched as the corpses of Brcko's murdered citizens were dragged out of the van and dumped in a mass grave.<p>

"Around than, in Brcko and that area, about 3,000 Muslims were murdered," he said with huge, restless eyes.  "We were there with some soldiers and one of them, who had the nickname Adolf, had killed 600 men single-handedly.  But it is not just the Serbs who are guilty.  Everyone is killing everyone in this war."<p>

When the photos from Brcko got through to the outside world, the terror began.  Although Reuters deliberately changed his name in the photo credits, a few days later, a camera crew from Serbian television suddenly appeared in his doorstep.  His passport photo was shown on television and 10 days after the publication of his pictures, a bomb went off outside his front door.  A week later, a Kalashnikov was emptied in his direction from  a passing car.  "I wasn't there but my mother saw them coming.  She ran inside; nobody was hurt but I later counted 26 bullet holes in the wall."<p>

In September he returned to Belgrade having spent the summer working in places like Split, Dubrovnik and Sarajevo.  The police interrogated Stojanovic because in seemed very suspect that with his typically Serbian surname, he had no problems working freely in Bosnia and Croatia.  He heard a bizarre conspiracy theory.  "I was supposed to be working for the British secret service MI6.  My pictures from Brcko were just western propaganda and I had been given $20,000 to bribe the policeman to kill the prisoner."<p>

When the EC tightened sanctions against Serbia, his picture was shown again on television, juxtaposed with the summary of the EC boycott measures.  He got thousands of phone calls at home.  "We'll slaughter you like a pig, you traitor," he was told.<p>

Then he was arrested on suspicion of attempting to murder a woman he did not even know.  He was stuck in jail for two months.  "They beat me with rubber truncheons, tried to break my spirit with three weeks of solitary confinement.  A few days before I finally got out, another inmate tried to stab me with a screwdriver during the exercise break.  I didn't even know the guy.  But the guards did nothing.  I'm pretty sure they told him to attack me."<p>

When he was released in early January, he discovered that at home all his photo equipment, 4,000 negatives, his passport and other personal effects had all disappeared.  With a friend, he fled across the Bulgarian border to Sofia.<p>

"Because I didn't have a passport, I rode across the border at night on the roof of a train."  On February 16, he heard from a Reuter staffer that his picture had been chosen by the World Press Photo jury.  "I was so proud.  It is the first time a Yugoslav photographer has won the prize."<p>

A few days later, somebody threw a hand grenade at his house in Belgrade.  Bojan Stojanovic decided to ask for asylum when he came to the Netherlands at the end of February in time for the prize giving.<p>

Since de Volkstkrant ran this story, Stojanovic has been placed under Dutch police protection following his abduction by two armed Serbo-Croat speaking assailants.  He escaped by jumping from a moving car into a canal.  The Dutch journalists' union, NVJ, is now giving him financial support.<P>

   BELGRADE:  A Serbian  general  who claims he defied orders to save the lives of soldiers and civilians during the 1991 Serbian-Croatian conflict has found himself condemned for his act by both his own side and the enemy.<P>                       
                                                                                
   By defying orders Serbian army  general  Vlado  Trifunovic  also says he     
spared the Croatian town of Varazdin from devastation by artillery bombardment  
by his troops and opposition forces. Despite this, both sides want him jailed.<P>  
                                                                                
    Trifunovic's  case is seen here in Belgrade as proof of the                 
Serb government's determination to bring to heel the dwindling band             
of professional soldiers who might be tempted to defy the politically motivated 
orders of the embattled regime of Slobodan Milosevic.<P>                           
                                                                                
   "The case of  General Trifunovic  is an example of how to destroy the life of
an important Serbian official in order to hide results of an imperfect policy," 
said Slobodan Vuksanovic from the Serbian opposition Democratic Party.<P>          
                                                                                
   Belgrade's military court decided in June 1992 and again one year later that 
 Trifunovic  was not guilty of defying orders and treason. However, the military
authorities insisted on a third trial. The composition of the military court was
changed for the next trial, and he was finally found guilty and sentenced to    
11 years in prison at the end of December 1994.<P>                                 
                                                                                
   Although  Trifunovic  appealed to the authorities, his sentence was upheld.  
There was an immediate protest from opposition parties, independent media, human
rights groups and legal experts against this sentence.<P>                          
                                                                                
   In 1991 Croatia seceded from the Yugoslav Federation, plunging Croatian      
forces into battle with the Serb controlled Federal Army of Yugoslavia.         
 Trifunovic's  barracks in Varazdin were besieged and attacked by the Croatian                                                                                  National Guard. He had no clear orders and was outnumbered 17 to one.<P>           
                                                                                
   He had plenty of artillery, but he knew an artillery exchange would          
inevitably result in civilian deaths and the possible destruction of the town.  
As a result after seven days of light fighting, he decided to negotiate. Using  
Croatian negotiators as hostages, he safely withdrew his soldiers to the Serbian
border.<P>                                                                         
                                                                                
   The enemy in Croatia condemned  Trifunovic  for taking Croat cease-fire      
negotiators as hostages, which they described as a war crime and a breach of the
Geneva Convention. But on arrival in Belgrade,  Trifunovic  was surprised to    
find himself accused of cowardice and treason by his own side as well.<P>          
                                                                                
   Inquiries were held, in which expert witnesses testified that  Trifunovic    
and his soldiers had little chance of survival had they continued to fight the  
Croats. With civilian deaths inevitable, the  general  argued that a safe       
retreat was the best option.<P>                                                    
                                                                                
   Belgrade independent weekly Vreme has also run several interviews with       
 Trifunovic's  troops and their families, who praised his humanity and care for 
the soldiers under his command.<P>
                                                   
 At the first two trials, the military courts agreed with this analysis. But by the third trial the government had swung public opinion against him and his "failure" to fight to the last man against overwhelming odds. <P>                  
                                                                                
    Trifunovic's  lawyer Branko Stanic said the prosecution used every          
opportunity to make the  general  a scapegoat for what was a Serbian defeat in  
Varazdin and Belgrade's overall failure to keep the old Yugoslavia together     
under its control. Stanic believes that Serbian military courts now simply      
reflect the desires of the president and top army personnel. <P>                   
                                                                                
   He cited the fact that two members of the chamber from the first trial were  
removed from the court before the second trial, and when the second trial failed
to find  Trifunovic  guilty, Djordje Dozet, president of the chamber in the     
second trial, was transferred to a lower civil court. <P>                          
                                                                                
   Meanwhile, in the run-up to the third and decisive  Trifunovic  trial, the   
media and the army's newspapers waged a concerted campaign against the          
 general.  One of the judges in the final trial was quoted in the Politika      
Ekspres as urging  Trifunovic  "to commit suicide in order to save his honor."  
He continued to hear the case despite the objections of the defense. <P>                                                                                                                   
   All the opposition parties described the hearing as a political show trial   
aimed at diverting responsibility from the Belgrade government in failing to    
prevent the break up of the federation.<P>                                         
                                                                                
   "The military found a victim in  General Trifunovic,  who was left without   
help and without clear orders," said Milorad Jovanovic from the Democratic Party
of Serbia (DSS).<P>

<h2>STATEMENT NO. 34</h2>

Violations of human rights on the recently liberated territories
of the Republic of Croatia are still going on. We are especially
concerned about recent murders.<P>
     
The CHC has received the information relating to the murder which
took place in the evening of February 26 in the village of
Jezerce, near the Plitvice lakes where two elderly citizens were
killed - Dane Kalember, born in 1913 and Milka Kalember born in
1915. Their houses, located only 100 meters from the main road
were burnt.<P>
     
According to our information, the investigation was carried out
by the members of the Ministry Interior and the investigating
judge from Zadar. The bodies of the killed people were not
transported to the Zadar or any other hospital as prescribed by
the law, but the autopsy was carried out by the doctor
immediately at the crime scene which has lately become the common
occurrence when the citizens of the Republic of Croatia of
Serbian nationality are concerned.<P>  
     
Regardless of the fact that the members of the families were
present at the scene of the crime, and that the investigating
judge assured them that they would be able to  receive the
victim's mortal remains after the autopsy, the representatives of
the Ministry Interior have buried them themselves without the
prior knowledge and presence of the relatives.<P>
     
The Committee requests that the public be informed about the
course of the entire procedure, and that the exhumation of the
bodies of Dane and Milka Kalember be carried out, and that the
decent funeral be performed with the presence of the members of
their  families and friends. <P>
     
The CHC takes this opportunity to inform the public and all
interested parties, that the member of our Committee, father
Jovan Nikoli}, is ready and willing to help all citizens of the
orthodox faith with the burial procedures in accordance with
their religious tradition and custom.<P>

<h2>STATEMENT NO. 35</h2>
</center>

        Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights is informing the 
        public about the outcome of the investigating procedures relating 
        to the crime which took place in the village of Komi} near Udbine.
        In the village and the hamlet of Poljice lived 198 citizens, 
        according to the census of 1991. At the beginning of August of 1995, 
        a majority of them escaped to Bosnia and Serbia just before the 
        military operations in the region took place.  20 Serb families 
        decided to stay in their village upon hearing a speech of the 
        President of the Republic of Croatia Franjo Tu|man, directed to all 
        Serbs living in the temporary occupied territory of Croatia. 
        The village of Poljice surrended peacefully (meaning that there were 
        not any battles at the time taking place in the village of Poljice 
        during the military operation Storm). The Croatian army entered the 
        village on August 12, with two tanks and three armored vehicles and 
        a few troops of Croatian soldiers. 80% of all premises and objects 
        in the village were destroyed (mined and burnt) and cattle killed 
        between 12 and 14 hours. 7 persons were killed.<P>

        In the village of Komi} the following persons were killed:<P>
<ol>
  <li> Staka <strong>Curcic</strong>, 45 years old (killed with a bullet)
  <li> Mika <strong>Pavlica</strong>, 90 years old (invalid, burnt alive in her house)
  <li> Marija <strong>Brkljac</strong>, 75 years old (invalid, burnt alive in her house)
  <li> Sava <strong>Lavrnic</strong>, 93 years old (?)
  <li> Petar <strong>Lavrnic</strong>, 60 years old (?)
  <li> Rade <strong>Sunajko</strong>, 89 years old, (killed with a bullet)
  <li> Milka <strong>Sunajko</strong>, 86 years old, ( her corpse dissapeared)
</ol><P>
        The corpses of the old lady Save Lavrnic and her son Petar have been 
        laying until now  unburied in the yard, near their burnt house. 
        The monitors of the CHC could not discover the cause of death 
        because the bodies were found in the decomposed state. However, the 
        monitors discovered rope around the old lady's ankles by which the 
        lady's ankles have been tied until now.<P>
        The rest of the citizens of the Republic of Croatia, who were during 
        the military operation "storm" in the village, saved themselves by 
        escaping and hiding in the nearby woods and the UNCRO camp in Titova 
        Korenica. The CHC monitors have managed to collect all relevant 
        documents which would be delivered to the appropriate judicial bodies 
        for further proceedings.<P>
        The mortal remains of Sava and Petar Lavrnic were buried today at the 
        local cemetery in Komic. A member of the CHC for Human Rights, 
        Jovan <strong>Nikolic</strong>, an orthodox priest, carried out the religious and burial ceremony accompanied by his colleagues from the CHC office.<P>

<h2>STATEMENT BY THE CROATIAN HELSINKI COMMITTEE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS</h2>
</center>
                           

     Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights (CHC)
informs the public about the situation on human  rights
in  the recently liberated territories of Croatia.  The
Committee has been monitoring the events in the  region
since the military operation "Storm".<P>
     In the region of Krajina, there have been reported
various  cases  of  continuous  looting  and  abuse  of
remaining   local  residents  of  Serbian  nationality,
systematic  mining of houses and additional structures.
This  is  how,  for  example  the  village  of  Kricka,
situated near Drnis, and some other places in the area,
are  the objects of permanent mining of houses  of  the
citizens   of  the  Republic  of  Croatia  of   Serbian
nationality.  These houses were previously  looted  and
burnt.<P>
     When the Committee's representatives; Drago Pilsel
-  Vice President and Petar Mrkalj - Executive Director
together with their  associates from Split, visited the
village,  they talked to the authorities  on  different
levels  in  the  region. They took the  opportunity  to
demand  that the electricity be connected to the  house
of  Milka and Petar Cakic, in the village of Kricke no.
70, Drnis Municipality, since their house is one of the
very  rare  ones which did not have electricity.  These
citizens  of  the Republic of Croatia stayed  in  their
houses  waiting for the Croatian army to  arrive  while
their  son refused to join the paramilitary Serb forces
despite the continuous pressure and numerous calls, but
remained  to  live with his family in Split,  where  he
still lives.<P>
      After  the intervention of the representative  of
the  CHC  for  Human Rights, the family Cakic  got  the
electricity that same day. However that same night  the
unknown persons mined two stories house, built by their
children  and  situated in the vicinity and  completely
destroyed it.<P>
      It is the Committee's opinion that the mining  of
this  particular house was done in retaliation  and  in
order to prevent normalization of the situation in  the
recently  liberated territories, as a precondition  for
the   return  of  the  Croatian  citizens  of   Serbian
nationality  to  their homes. And not  only  that.  The
Committee  considers  this case to  be  an  example  of
pressure put on the remaining residents of Serbian nationality 
living  in  the  region  to  leave  the  area.  The  Committee  
reported  various incidents  of mining of houses in the entire 
recently  liberated region  of the former sectors North and South, 
assaults  against the  citizens, physical abuses, plundering, 
not only with  tacit approval of the uniformed man but with active 
involvement of the officials of the Ministry Interior in stealing 
of livestock.<P>
      The  Committee  therefore  asks  the  authorities  of  the
Republic   of   Croatia  to  energetically  stop   the   further
destruction  of  property and pressure against citizens  in  the
recently  liberated territories and to persecute and punish  the
perpetrators,  and in such a way demonstrate it  willingness  to
respect the rule of law in the Republic of Croatia.<P>

<h2>STATEMENT NO 38</h2>
</center>

       The   human  rights  situation  for  people  of   foreign
nationality  in  Croatia is unfortunately worsening.   WE  would
like  to  take  this  opportunity to inform the  public  of  the
violations of human rights in Croatia's legislature.<P>
      At the assembly held on March 21, 1996, the government  of
the Republic of Croatia confirmed a decision with respect to the
sale  of  government owned apartments that are  managed  by  the
Ministry  of  Defense(Narodne Novine, Issue No.  24,  March  26,
1996).<P>
     In point II, paragraph 1, the decision claims that:<P>
     Apartments in item 1. of this decision will be sold by the
Ministry  of  Defense  to  those people  who  moved  into  those
apartments during the period from July 24, 1991 until the day on
which  this decision was rendered, on the basis of the  exchange
of  apartments(exchange agreements or true exchanges)  from  the
former Yugoslavia and have lived in those apartments continually
until the day this decision was made, if:<P>
      <ul><li> the person is a part of the Croatian people has Croatian
citizenship;
      <li> the  person  proves that they have  tenants  rights  or
ownership   rights   with   respect  to   the   apartment   they
moved out of;
      <li>  the  person  does  not fall within the  classifications
listed under article 50a, paragraph 3. of the  law about  the sale  of apartments involving  tenant rights</ul><P>

      The  Croatian Helsinki Committee for human rights believes
that this item involves a serious violation of human rights  and
the concrete freedoms of the citizens of the Republic of Croatia
as  guaranteed  by the constitution of the Republic  of  Croatia
because the right to ownership is conditioned on citizenship and
nationality.  That kind of discriminating decision  is  contrary
to not only the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia, as well
as  to  international norms and the agreement which the Republic
of  Croatia  ratified  and  entered into.   It  is  particularly
inconsistent   with   the   Universal   Declaration   of   Human
Rights(1948),  article 17., items (1) and  (2).   The  norms  of
international democratic laws are the achievement  of  a  modern
civilization  and according to article 134. of the  Constitution
of  the Republic of Croatia legally stand above state laws,  and
analogous to that and to sub-legal acts.<P>
      With  this decision the Republic of Croatia has failed  to
respect  the  law  respecting  ownership  as  specified  in  the
European  Convention  for the protection  of  human  rights  and
freedoms(First  Protocol,  article 1.)  placing  limitations  on
citizens who fall within certain categories - those who are  not
of  Croatian nationality ad who do not have Croatian citizenship
-  acquisition  of ownership (purchase of apartments)  under  the
same conditions.<P>
      We  believe  that  it is important to  inform  about  this
flagrant  violation of the European Convention in light  of  the
fact  that the Republic of Croatia recently committed itself  to
respecting  the basic European norms as a precondition  for  its
acceptance  as  a  member of the parliament of  the  Council  of
Europe.<P>
      Therefore,  we think that it is important to remark  about
the inherent danger of this discriminating decision in light  of
the  fact  that  according to the list  of  citizens  from  1991
Croatia's  citizenship was made up of 78% Croats, 12% Serbs  and
10% others.<P>
      The  Committee  is  cautions that this  decision  embodies
nazistic elements, and therefore requires that the part  of  the
decision  which  discriminates on the basis  of  nationality  be
repealed as quickly as possible.  At the same time we demand the
resignation of those who are responsible for the passing of this
kind  of  decision in the Republic of Croatia and that  they  be
held accountable.<P>

<h2>STATEMENT NO. 39</h2>

	The Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights(the  Committee  or 
 CHC ) wishes to inform the public of an unusually scandalous event which took 
place on April 13th in Karlovac.  We think that it is necessary to do so, because in 
our opinion this incident is indicative of the social climate surrounding war crimes.<P>  
	On the occasion of the Karlovac County Day celebrations, for the very first 
time, the assembly of the county council recognized the efforts and public service 
of certain of its citizens.  Mate Granic, the Vice President of the government and 
Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Republic of Croatia was declared an honorary 
citizen of the County of Karlovac.  In addition, six other citizens of the county of 
Karlovac and 23 legal entities received awards of recognition for their 
contributions.<P>
	All of the nominations for the awards were unanimously approved by the 
assembly of Karlovac s council, which happens to be composed of 40 delegates(28 
from the Croatian Democratic Union, 7 from the Croatian Social Liberal Party, 3 
from the Croatian Peasant Party, one delegate from the Croatian People s Party 
and one from the Croatian Party of Rights).<P>
	Also among the citizens who were recognized with this award was Mihajlo 
Miso Hrastov, a member of Croatia s Special Police Force and a commander of the 
Special Police Forces of the Karlovac Police Department.<P>  
	He is the policeman who, on September 21, 1991, acting as  a member of 
Croatia s Special Police Forces received an order to go to the Korana bridge near 
Rakovac in the vicinity of Karlovac in order to take charge of a group of prisoners 
who had surrendered to the Croatian forces.  These prisoners where among those 
individuals who were recruited from nearby villages by the Jugoslav National 
Army(JNA) in order to fight in the war against Croatia.  Despite the fact that these 
prisoners were disarmed and therefore posed no threat Mr. Hrastov nor to any of 
the other policemen in his group, Mr. Hrastov gunned them all down - at first with 
a  Ultimax  machine gun, and then once they had fallen down, he shot them in the 
head and other parts of their bodies from point blank range.  Afterwards, the dead; 
Jovan Sipic, Bozo Kozlina, Nebojsa Popovic, Milic Savic, Milenko Lukac, Nikola 
Babic, Vaso Bizic and Mile Peuraca were stabbed repeatedly with a knife.  Only 
two of the victims survived the massacre that took place on the Korana bridge.<P> 
	The perpetrator of the crime - Mihajlo Hrastov - was not deprived of his 
freedom, but was instead taken to the central police station on Doriceva street 
along with the other policemen and witnesses of the crime.  On the following day, 
September 22, no investigation took place.  Hrastov was reassigned to Bijelovar in 
northern Croatia, where he was a member of the elite anti-terrorist police forces of 
the Bijelovar Police Department until March 5th, 1992.  He was arrested on March 
5th, 1992, after a number of articles describing the incident appeared in various 
newspapers.  He was charged with committing crimes against humanity and 
violating international law.  Following a four day trial in the beginning of 
September 1992, the grand council of the county court of Karlovac acquitted him 
of all charges, which was received with a standing ovation from all those present in 
the courtroom.  <P>
	According to the information available to the Committee, the Supreme 
Court of the Republic of Croatia declared the county court s decision void and 
initiated the procedure for a retrial, however, despite the fact that two years have 
passed since the Supreme Court s decision was rendered, the county court has not, 
as of yet, set a date for the second trail concerning the crime that took place on the 
Korana bridge. <P> 
	Mihajlo Hrastov is currently still a commander of the Special Police 
Forces of the Karlovac Police Department.<P> 
	According to other information available to the Committee, about which 
we have already notified the Ministry of the Interior(MUP) following  Operation 
Storm , Mihajlov Hrastov was the self-proclaimed commander of the Special 
Prison in the old school in Ozalj, where citizens of the Republic of Croatia of 
Serbian nationality who had surrendered to the Croatian authorities following 
 Operation Storm  were savagely tortured. <P> 
	The  Public Recognition Award from the Karlovac County Council  
which Mihajlo Hrastov was among the first receive is not the first recognition or 
award he has received.  He was also recognized by the President of the Republic of 
Croatia, Dr. Franjo Tudman, in 1995 on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of 
Croatia s independence, according to Article 98 of the constitution of the Republic 
of Croatia and Article 2, item 1 of the law on recognitions and awards.  President 
Tudman awarded him with the Order of Nikola Subic Zrinski, for his  heroic 
behavior  during the war.  This Committee is not aware of any particular act of 
heroism, except for the two mentioned in this statement, which would deserve this 
or any other high award or recognition.<P>  
	It is worth mentioning that one of the ex-ministers of the war-time 
government warned the authorities of the Karlovac county about the possible 
repercussions that could result from the recognition of Mihajlo Hrastov.<P>  
	Immediately after having received the information about the distribution of 
awards in Karlovac, the professional staff of the CHC gathered all of the relevant 
data and forwarded it to the Chairman of the Committee who on Sunday April 14, 
1996 talked to Mate Granic, the Minister of Foreign Affairs over the telephone.  
He notified him of the implications involved in his(Granic s) receiving the 
Honorary Citizen's Award along with Mr. Hrastov's public recognition, who 
happens to be a suspected war criminal.  Minister Granic said that he did not know 
who Mihajlo Hrastov is, despite admitting to being in charge of the Karlovac 
region during the war. <P> 
	Since there has been no public reaction until today, April 16, 1996, the 
Committee feels obliged to notify the public of the inappropriateness of the 
Croatian government s behavior with respect to individuals who are suspected war 
criminals.<P>
	We are bringing this case to the public s attention, especially since this 
Committee is aware of the fact that Ivica Rajic, who is being sought by the 
international war crimes tribunal at the Hague, is currently to be found on the 
territory of the Republic of Croatia; in a room owned by the Ministry of Defense 
of the Republic of Croatia at the motel Dujlovo in Split, where he and his family 
are being put up. <P> 
	Similarly, Dario Kordic, who is also being sought by the Hague, is 
currently free and traveling without restrictions across the Republic of Croatia and 
is accompanied by a personal escort.<P>
	The Committee therefore encourages the County of Karlovac to publicly 
revoke its recognition of Mihajlo Hrastov and for the President of the Republic to 
explain exactly which heroic act on the part of Mihajlo Hrastov was worthy of 
recognition.<P>
	Similarly therefore, the Committee invites Minister Granic to share his 
thoughts with the public about this kind of recognition by the County of Karlovac.<P>

<center><h2>STATEMENT NO 40</h2></center>

	Aside from its symbolic promotion of worker s rights, 
international labor day (May 1st), has always been an occasion for the 
examination of social conditions in legitimate states and societies.<P>
	This first of May will in be the first real opportunity to point out 
the disfunctionality of the Croatian welfare state. The state has used 
the fact that it has invested vast resources in the war effort over the 
course of the last few years as an alibi to justify the violation of 
citizens basic social rights, however, as the time following the war 
grows longer the time has come to return the standards of social 
welfare to moderate levels. <P> 
	The entry of Croatia into the Council of Europe obliges the state, 
just as it does all of Croatian society, to, within the context of 
democratic integrational processes, devote all of its attention to 
economic and social rights of the citizens of Croatia, and therefore 
expedite the process of integration into the European and international 
financial leaders.<P>  
	The Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights emphasizes 
the importance of making the equality of all persons a reality in every 
sphere of life, in economical, social as well as political.  This is an 
essential precondition for the recently achieved independence of 
Croatia to constitute itself permanently as a value which guarantees 
political freedom and the social well-being for all its citizens. 
	In order to promote the realization of these principles the 
Croatian Helsinki Committee requests the following:<P>
	<ol>
        <li> The cessation of attacks by the high levels of the state against 
trade unions, associations, individuals and activists because of their 
united activities as well as the cessation of their stigmatization as 
political enemies of the Republic of Croatia.
	<li> The cessation of the abuse of the state controlled media for 
the continued stigmatization of the work force, retired persons and 
other categories of socially imperiled citizens because of their justified 
requests for the reparation of the social status in society and for the 
protection of their rights.
	<li> Change in the overall relations towards requests from unions 
for the change of the irresponsible condition of their members, in the 
sense of their cooperative relationship with the state authorities, just 
as the role of the third party in the dialogue between employers and 
employees, has become at the very least, doubtful.   
	<li> Respect for the right to strike and other methods used by 
unions, societies, activists and individuals that are in accordance with 
civilized standards.
	<li> A radical change of the politics relating to privatization.  In 
particular, this is in reference to the rights that are equally shared by 
all citizens of Croatia until the year of 1990, and the protection of 
those small shareholders who s rights are often taken advantage of by 
the numerous nouveux riche and wartime profiteers who continue  to 
plunder and impoverish the majority of Croatian citizens.
     	<li> A thorough and expert revision - overseen by foreign experts - 
of all conflicted privatization procedures.
	<li> Radical cutting of public expenses squandered by the state, 
spending the money of the most impoverished class of citizens, and 
causing the pauperization of the largest portion of the population.
	<li> Developing a respect in practice all of the conditions which 
were placed on Croatia in the integration process with Europe and the 
rest of the world.  They are: the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights(Article 23); the International Pact on Economic, Social, and 
Cultural Rights(Articles 5 and 6); the 1961 European Social Charter; 
the International Convention about the Abolition of all Forms of 
Discrimination(Article 6); the Declaration about the Abolition of all 
Discrimination against Women(Article 10).
	<li> Developing a respect in the general practice of all the 
international instruments from the International Labor Organization 
(ILO).  They are: The 1958 Convention on Discrimination at Work and 
Choice of Professions (Number 111); the 1981 Convention on the 
Advancement of Negotiations between Union Leaders and Employers 
(Number 154), the 1949 Convention on Freedom of Association and 
the Protection of the Right to Organize and the 1964 Convention on 
the Politics of Employment.</ol><P>
	The building of international standards into the Croatian legal 
system, which like the respecting of the high standards of the western-
European countries will make the following possible:<P>
       <ol>
 <li> The successful protection of individuals who in this war or in 
the previous one bore the brunt of the effort of the political liberation: 
the invalids, exiled, the families of the dead and disappeared and 
others.
	<li> The successful protection of workers who ve lost or are losing 
their jobs, as well as their families.  The majority of those people were 
victims of dishonest and illegal forms of transition in which the rights 
of workers and small stock owners were sacrificed.
	<li> A complete change of the state s politics with respect to retired 
persons, especially were paying out pensions, the various forms of 
manipulation, and in light of the equality of all retired persons with the 
same work record, previous status and other.
	<li> Radical changes in the tax system because the current system 
is preferential to the rich(the few tax brackets and low customs fees for 
luxury items  and the fact that they enjoy the lowest tax rates while 
their employees are taxed at a higher rate)
	<li> Changes in legislation with respect to serious and complete 
protection of children and families, which contrary to what is normally 
said, has not been taken care of yet(for example, the facilitating of 
buying children s  wares, appropriate financial support, adequate baby 
bonuses and paid vacation, help for sick people, invalids and others.)
	<li> Change to the current social security policy based on the 
bureaucratic concept of saving.</ol><P>  
	Because of all of that, the Croatian Helsinki Committee is 
requesting publicly that all departments of the Croatian state, the 
opposition, churches and other social assemblies, commit themselves 
to the furthering of the social standards in the interest of the 
protection of the threatened social and economic rights of the citizens 
of the Republic of Croatia. The Committee believes that this should be 
the main goal of all social groups and not by simply making 
declarations, but to attempt to promote its inclusion in daily and long 
term practice.  In that we see a precondition of the stable, democratic 
and prosperous Croatian state. Only  a true realization of such 
principles would ensure  that these declarations about the social state 
become a part of a truly valid and responsible state and social politics.<P> 
	The Committee takes this opportunity to demand that the 
Government of the Republic of Croatia finally submit detailed 
elaboration of the (short term and long term) program of the economic 
development and social politics based upon it.<P>
        Following closely various cases of human rights violations, the 
Committee came to the conclusion that if  true changes in the area of 
social rights violations do not take place, social issue of the state could 
reduce the state s independence to a mere toy in the hands of domestic 
and foreign financial power-wielders. This would undoubtedly be 
contrary to the original wish of the Croatian population, articulated 
through centuries, without which the Croatian state would not exist at 
all, and at the same time it would open new possibilities to certain 
individuals to claim people s will as their own property and personal 
merit. Besides, such a course of events would surely open new 
possibilities to strengthen and shape all kinds of authority, which lead 
to the even more radical social conflicts and open doors to the different 
kinds of dictatorship, with only one thing in common and that is fight 
against democracy and freedom.<P>

<center><h2>ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE CHC OFFICE</h2></center>


	CHC for Human Rights wishes to inform the public 
about the violence of the military authorities of the Republic 
of Croatia towards a Croatian citizen Niksa Violic from 
Korcula, born on December 16, 1976. Niksa Violic is a 
member of Jehova's Witnesses. He is, according to our 
Affiliate for Human Rights based in Split, currently situated 
in the former military hospital in Split in a very grave health 
condition.<P> 

  	Nikca Violic was summoned to Sinj for a compulsory  
military service. Following his arrival to the military 
barracks he gave his own written statement regarding his 
membership of Jehova's Witnesses, according to which he is 
exempt from compulsory military service, wearing of 
uniform and use of arms. Despite his objection, he was 
given his military uniform which he refused to put on. Niksa 
Violic immediately asked to be released from the detention 
and sent home. He refused to accept food as a sign of 
protest against forcible detention at the military barrack. 
The military officers threatened and verbally insulted him. 
He continued to object against compulsory military service 
for the following two days and finally on May 16, at 14.20 
he was sentenced to 4 days prison term at the Lora military 
prison in Split. In the register,  the one he refused to sign, 
there is a description of his behavior at the military barrack 
stating that he refused to associate with other soldiers, 
sleep in the common dormitory and eat with them. Because 
of his "anti-social and intolerant" behavior he was 
sentenced to prison.<P> 

	On May 16, Niksa Violic was put into solitary 
confinement in the Lora military prison. During following 
night (night between May 17 and 18), he was subjected to 
physical and psychological  harassment, which caused the 
clinical death in duration of 4 hours. He was urgently 
transferred by the ambulance car to the military hospital 
(psychiatric department) where he has been located since 
then.<P>

	On Monday, May 20, 1996, military policemen came to the hospital in 
order to take Niksa Violic to the Military Court. The doctor on duty 
energetically refused to allow it. The military police visited him again on May 
22, 1996, and requested that he sign a statement according to which he would 
certify that he was not subjected to any maltreatment. Nik{a Violi} refused to 
sign the statement. The members of the military police threatened to come 
again on Friday, May 24 and take him to the military court in Split, where the 
dates for the trial had already been set.<P>      

	The military police made serious threats, saying that there would be 
nobody there to save him and that he would be killed in case he continued to 
evade his military service. <P>
	
	We take this opportunity to warn the military and civil authorities that 
such behavior is completely unacceptable, and demand that Niksa Violic, 
because of conscientious objection to compulsory military service, be freed 
from his military service, and that he be enabled to carry on with his life 
normally and be guaranteed freedom of movement and all necessary citizens 
rights prescribed by the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia. We also 
demand that the authorities of the Republic of Croatia stop the persons who 
subjected Niksa Violic to torture and harassment (endangered his life and well-
being) from committing any further inhumane acts, and press charges against 
them. <P>

<center><h2>OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA
DR. FRANJO TUDjMAN</h2></center>

Dear Sir,<P> 

	a wave of forcible evictions of the citizens of Croatia is taking 
place in Croatia. This whole problem has been transformed into a 
different legal and institutional process through which flats 
continue to be appropriated. According to article 102a of the Law 
on Housing Relations, the authorities have the ability to proclaim, 
almost anybody they please, to be a public enemy of the state, 
which of course directly implies the termination of his/her tenancy 
rights. <P>
	The most interesting fact about the above mentioned 
situation is that not even a single case has been brought to trial 
nor has any criminal court procedure been carried out so far). A 
criminal procedure is essential to establish certain facts, necessary 
for the precondition to accuse a party of engaging in activities 
against the integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia. The 
Varazdin County court decision - Gz. 403/95 - 2, signed by the 
President of the Court Dubravka Vincekovic is a clear example of 
why it is deemed not necessary to conduct trial against the 
tenants. Among other things, she states that the mere fact that a 
tenant was a member of the former Yugoslav Army is in itself a 
sufficient reason to proclaim him a public enemy of the Republic of 
Croatia (article 102 a of the Law on Housing Relations). This article 
states that it is irrelevant whether the tenant belonging to the 
Yugoslav army, directly participated in military activities on the 
territory of the Republic of Croatia.   Furthermore the article states 
that "it is not necessary to prove enemy activity against the 
Republic of Croatia by the valid court judgment because it is not 
prescribed by the regulations of the above mentioned law".  The 
court papers for eviction in practice apply to the spouse. This has 
been explained by Dubravka Vincekovic: "In regards to the 
spouse...., for whom there is no evidence of wrongdoing against the 
Republic of Croatia, she gained tenancy rights through the act of 
marriage and henceforth is considered to have equal tenancy 
rights. She shares her husband's fate.  Principle of individual guilt 
has not been mentioned at all.<P> 
	Our Office has registered only 16 of such cases over the past 
few months based on the Law on Housing Relations. This number 
does not represent the total cases present today in the Republic of 
Croatia. It is CHC opinion that the established method is in fact a 
form of "cleansing" of the tenants from the remaining JNA flats.  
Most of these people are elderly citizens who remained in their flats 
during the entire war. The ones that left their flats documented 
their leave of absence by medical certificates or by other papers. 
	This whole procedure created by this Law article 102a of the 
Law on Housing Relations presents unlimited possibilities of 
manipulation and violations of Croatian citizens' rights and their 
fundamental human rights.  These same citizens are not allowed to 
buy the former JNA flats in which they have been living for years 
because they are considered to be enemies of the state but only 
when it concerns this particular issue. In all other segments of life 
they are treated as ordinary citizens and exercise normal citizens' 
rights.  There were cases of attempted forcible evictions. When they 
were not successful, the above mentioned court procedure was 
undertaken.<P> 
	Due to all these circumstances and to indifference of the 
state authorities concerning the aforementioned human rights 
violations, we have decided to bring this issue to the attention of 
the public.<P> 

Respectfully,<P>

<h1>TRIAL ON A KRAJINA KILLING</h1>

<em>Split - March, 1 1996</em><P>

On February 27 and 28, in the Zupanski (County) court of Zadar,
representatives of HHO (Croatian Helsinki Committee) and DOS
(Dalmatian Committee of Solidarity), together with Otvorene Oci monitored
the trial of a man accused of murdering a Serb shortly after Operation
"Storm". Also present were members of ECMM.<P>

Zvonimir Lasan, aged twenty-two, was accused by the Republic of Croatia
of the murder, due to ethnic hatred, of Janka Cakic, aged sixty, in the village
of Zecevo (the Hamlet of Cakici, near Kistanje) on 20 August, 1995.  The
charge is based on Article 34, paragraph 2, point 4 of the Criminal Law of
the Republic of Croatia (Act against life and body -murder). Mr. Lasan was
accused of going to the village of Zecevo with two other soldiers, where  
he killed Mr. Cakic in his house.<P>

Mr. Lasan was represented by attorney Mr. Marko Marinovic. The State
prosecutor was Mr. Mate Dorcic and the Judge was the Honourable Mr.
Dubravko Krpina.<P>

During the trial evidence was heard from only three witnesses, Mr. Nikola
Rasic and Mr. Ivan Jakoljevic (who were with the accused in the village of
Zecevo) and Mrs. Lasan (mother of the accused), all of whom were called
to testify by the defense. The written statements from other witnesses were
read to the court, including that of the person who found the body. The
State prosecutor asked the court to call the absent witnesses, but after a
break on the second day, withdrew his request.<P>

Judge Krpina, conducted the trial in a professional manner, directing the
proceedings in an attempt to ascertain the sequence of events and the
motives present. However, he did not challenge the inconsistencies of the
accused or witnesses, in particular the differences in terms of arrival in the
village, purpose for being there and when they first learned of the murder.
Additionally, he did not see the necessity to call the additional witnesses
originally requested by the State prosecutor.<P>

The attorney for the defense, Mr. Marinovic, worked hard to defend his
client, re-directing the witnesses in favor of the accused and emphasizing the
lack of material evidence of the prosecution. Mr. Marinovic was only
inconsistent in his failure to react immediately to Judge Krpina's statement (at the
beginning of the trial) that at the time of the murder Mr. Lasan was no
longer a serving member of the Croatian army. However, on the second
day, he produced documentation that Mr. Lasan is still an active member of
the Croatian army, with a rank of reserve non-commissioned officer.<P>

Throughout the trial, the State prosecutor asked no questions or
clarifications from the accused or the witnesses, despite the presence of
inconsistencies and differences in their testimony and written statements.
Furthermore, in his closing statement, the State prosecutor urged the court
to take into consideration all the circumstances in favor of the accused and
give him a sentence less than the minimum 10 years, for the crime of
murder.<P>

Mr. Lasan was found guilty of murder, although not due to ethnic hatred
and sent to prison for six years, where he will also undergo medical
treatment for drug addiction. This will be finalised in five days.<P>

Local activists feel that the process of this trial and the participatory manner
of the judge and State prosecutor may set a precedent for the upcoming
trials for the Gospic and Varivode massacres. They are anxious to see
guarantees that the law of the Republic of Croatia and the agreement made
between the UN and Croatia, with regard to those people remaining in
Former sectors North and South, are upheld.<P>

<h1>A FAIR TRIAL?</h1>


<em>Split - April, 27 1996</em><P>


     Together with activists of CHC (Croatian Helsinki
Committee) and DOS (Dalmatian Committee of Solidarity),
Otvorene Oci, monitored the trial of Mr. Mirko Graorac,
accused of war crimes, in the Split County (Zupanijski) Court.
The following report is an observation of the procedures of
that trial.<P>

     The Republic of Croatia brought charges of war crimes
against war prisoners in accordance with  article 122 of the
Croatian Criminal Law and articles 3, 13, 14 and 17 of the
Geneva Convention, from August 12, 1949 against Mr. Graorac.  
Mr. Graorac pleaded not guilty. Specifically, Mr. Graorac was
accused of leaving Croatia, of his own freewill  and going to
Bosnia-Hercegovina to a district where para-military units of
"Republike Srpska Krajina" held the territory. He was also
accused of, while there, being a member of the civilian Serb
police force and acting as a commander of the external guard
of the concentration camp "Manjaca", near Banja Luka. As the
commander of these guards he was accused of physically and
pschologically maltreating and torturing prisoners of war,
both personally and through orders to his troops. This
treatment subsequently led to the death of some of the
prisoners of war. Mid-way through the trial, these charges
were also extended to include the phsyical and pschological
maltreatment and torture of civilians.<P>

     A number of witnesses were called to testify on behalf of
the accused. Of these witnesses, many could not positively
identify Mr. Graorac as carrying out those crimes he was
accused of. Responses to the questions of the Judge, Josip
Cule and Defence Lawyer, Mr. Nenad Boban were never very
specific, ranging from "I think", "Maybe", "Probably" to "I
heard". The majority of the witnesses, were able to say that
they recognised Mr. Graorac, although many did say it was
through televison and newspaper coverage, or photographs shown
by the police before the identity parade. Video tapes of news
broadcasts from British, French and US television were also
presented to the court as evidence. No translation of these
tapes was provided and no mention or identification of Mr.
Graorac was evident.<P>
     No witness was able to testify that Mr. Graorac had
personally beat them, that they had seen him beat other
prisoners or given orders that prisoners be beaten. One of the
main witnesses, Mr. Boris Duvnjak testified that he had  never
seen Mr. Graorac personally beat a prisoner, just that he had
heard he had.<P>
     Concern was also expressed by local activists with regard
to one of the witnesses, Mrs. Edi Parcina, who was allowed to
be present in the court during the hearing, before she
testified. The State Prosecutor Mr. Slavko Mrsic, told her
that she "would come next time as a witness".<P>  
     Defence Lawyer, Mr. Boban challenged the use of video
tapes and other identification procedures as being unfair.
Judge Cule dismissed his objections, as did he with regard to
Mr. Bobans request for inhabitants of the village Bainci,
Bosnia-Hercegovina to come and testify. Judge Cule, said that
it was unnecessary and that as they came from an "enemy
country" of Croatia, he did not feel it was appropriate.
In his closing statement, Mr. Boban also requested that the
case be referred to the International Court for War Crimes at
the Hague.<P>
     Mr. Graorac was found guilty and sentenced to twenty
years imprisonment. The request of the defence lawyer, Mr.
Boban was denied on the grounds that Mr. Graorac was not a
citizen of the Republic of Croatia, but rather a citizen of
Bosnia-Hercegovina. Mr. Boban will appeal this decision.<P>

<h1>THE PROTECTION OF NATIONAL MONUMENTS</h1>


<em>Split, - April 26 1996</em><P>


     Accompanying Split human rights activists, Otvorene Oci
vsited the three Orthodox Monasteries located in Former Sector
South. The following report is the findings of those visits.<P>


     Since the end of Operation "Storm", access to the three
oldest Orthodox monasteries in Croatia (Krupa - 1317, Krka - 
c.1350 and Dragovic - 1395) has been denied to human rights
activists. The official reason for this was that, in
accordance with the Dayton Agreement (Annex 08, the Commission
to preserve national monuments), police guards have been
placed at each monastery in order to protect them.<P>

     Together with a representative from CHC (Croatian
Helsinki Committee), Otvorene Oci obtained permission from the
deputy commander of MUP in Zadar, Mr. Ivan Zrboja, to visit
these monasteries. Mr. Zrboja, assured us that the buildings
were all intact and that no looting had taken place.
     Arrival at the monastery Dragovic, showed no signs of
police presence. The grounds were open and an examination of
the monastery revealed signs of serious looting, damage to the
church, the removal of religious artifacts and grafitti ridden
walls. The building remains intact and there is little
structural damage, the majority of the damage confined to
windows and entrances to buildings and bullet holes on the
interior walls. The library has been completely destroyed,
many of the books torn and scattered across the floor. The
grafitti on the walls is of obscene symbols and pictures and
drawings of two pistols, signed and dated, 15.01.1996, by
members of the Croatian civilian police, based in Makarska.<P>
     Krupa monastery still has a police presence, although on
arrival, they were not there. Loaded weapons and police
radios, however, were present. The police appeared shortly
afterwards with representatives of the Regional Office for the
Protection of Monuments, who were removing several books from
the monastery. The monastery is intact and the church is also
not damaged, with the exception of some pictures, where the
glass has been destroyed. Krupa monastery, however, has been
severely looted, particularily the library. Many of the old
and valuable books have been completely destroyed, as have
many of the rooms.<P> 
     Activists were unable to examine the interior of the
monastery at Krka. Although permission was obtained to visit
the monastery, upon the eventual arrival of the civilian
police, activists were informed that they could not gain
access. Apparently the keys are kept in Knin and an
appointment had to be made there to collect them. What could
be seen, also showed signs of looting and the courtyard was
scattered with furniture and other items thrown from the
windows. The police claim they keep a guard at the monastery
at all times, although much of the day is spent out on patrol.
The police present believe that hiding in the forest are many
Serbs and that they pose a threat to the monastery. When
questioned about the obvious signs of looting, the police
replied that this was a result of searches for people who may
have tried to seek refuge at the monastery, during Operation
"Storm".<P>

     Local activists will continue to monitor the situation in
Former Sector South with regard to the protection of national
monuments. They are concerned that without careful monitoring,
these national monuments will not be preserved.<P>

<h1>THE RETURN OF SERBS TO FORMER SECTOR SOUTH</h1>

<em>Split, - April 26 1996</em><P>


     Split human rights activists have been monitoring the
return of the Serb population to Former Sector South. Together
with Otvorene Oci, one village near Zadar was visited. The
following report is an observation of the conditions for
return.<P>

     The village of Smilcic, before the war in 1991 had a
population of around 3,500 of which Croats made up 8%. Since
Operation "Storm", there are only five remaining Serbs. Croats
have begun to move back to the village, and in a meeting with
local HDZ president, Mr. Zoran Arbanas, Otvorene Oci learned
of the new village policy. Since many Croats have still not
returned, Mr. Arbanas informed us that Bosnian Croats from
Teslic, Bosnia would be "imported" to re-populate the village
and discourage Serbs from returning.<P>
     Mr. Arbanas, claims he speaks for the current inhabitants
of Smilcic, when he says that this war had to happen and that
different ethnic groups could not live together. He was angry
that the remaining Serb population received visits and
humanitarian aid from the ICRC (International Committee of the
Red Cross). His goal, he said, was a Croat village. If Serbs
wanted to return, it would not be prevented, but strongly
discouraged.<P>
     In an attempt to carry out this policy, on arrival in the
village, the Split activist and Otvorene Oci were immediately
offered a house and land, by Mr. Arbanas. Enquiries about the
returning population, revealed that if correct and relevant
documentation could be provided, people would eventually be
allowed to return to their property. If their property was
inhabited by someone else, those inhabitants would be offered
alternative accomodation.<P>
     Mr. Arbanas claims to be acting with official permission.
He stated that documents could be issued almost immediately
for any Croat seeking a house in Smilcic. There are already a
number of Bosnian Croats, from places such as Sarajevo, living
in the village and he told us that there were a number of
"large and beautiful" houses if we wanted to live there. He
did not seem perturbed that we already had accomodation in 
Split, simply stating that if we changed our minds we "were
welcome". Furthermore, he felt that it was not a problem to
"import" a population to prevent the return of the rightful
owners. He said that he used to have Serbs as friends, but
this war had to happen before it was too late and now that it
had, local HDZ policy was to discourage any return.<P>

     Local human rights activists are particularly concerned
about this "new policy" and the "import" of Croats from
Bosnian. These kinds of actions are being viewed as a second
phase of ethnic cleansing and human rights activists feel it
could escalate the fears of those wishing to return.<P>

Citizen <strong>Nada Jovovic</strong>, born on June 7, 1969, father Novica
and mother Dragica, nee Todorivic, agricultural technologist,
single, permanent residence at No. 34 Darovalaca krvi street,
Sarajevo, commune of Novo Sarajevo, C. Reg. No. 0706969177668,
has made the following<P>

<h3>STATEMENT</h3>

On September 30, 1992, around 9 p.m., Hamdo Sasic, MP commander
for the city of Sarajevo accompanied by two members of "Juka's
army" came to the apartment of Sanja Ikic at No. 1, Oteska street, 
block 1.  They asked me and Sanja Ikic what we had done at 
Joze Oroz's place, how had Stjepan Kalem, nicknamed Pepo,
gone and why had he not taken us with him.  They cursed our
Cetnik mothers and verbally abused us.  Hamdo Sasic asked me where 
brother and brother-in-law were.  We did not respond to any of his 
provocations.  At a certain point a third member of so called
"Juka's army" arrived and addrssed Hamdo Sasic with the words:
"This is not how things are done, my brother, but like this."
Having said that, this member of "Juka's army" took Sanja Ikic
by the hand and took her to the adjoining room.  The other two
members of "Juka's army" joined them.  After that I only heard 
screams and sounds of Sanja Ikic struggling to wrest herself free.
I stayed in the room with Hamdo Sasic and, tearful and scared asked him:
"Why are you doing this to us when we are guilty of nothing?"
I begged him to go into the room and to make them let her go. 
He replied: "No, Nada, we must make Moslem children".
At that moment one Juka's soldier entered the room buttoning up 
his black overalls and said to Hamdo Sasic: "Our business is done".
Three Juka's soldiers went towards the front door and I ran to the room 
in which my friend was.  I found Sanja on the floor, naked, her body was
red, especially her neck.  Her face was white as a sheet and she
was frothing at the mouth.  I went to her and took her by the
shoulders, I called her name, but she did not respond.  I could 
not ascertain whether she was dead or alive.  I ran towards the 
front door seeking to escape, but Hamdo Sasic caught up with me,
grabbed my shoulder and turned me to face him.<P>

Through tears I begged him to let me go but he would not let go
off me.  I started screaming and Hamdo hit me with his head 
drawing blood from my nose and mouth.  He lightly pushed me 
towards the floor.  I fell on the floor and Hamdo Sesic said to me:
"Tomorrow night you will be raped by me and you will bear a Moslem".<P>

After that Hamdo took the key and locked the door from the outside,
taking the key with him.  Through the window of the flat, which was
on the first floor above the "Hollywood" pizzeria, I climbed down to
the street across some sand bags, then I ran to the other side of the 
street and went into building L near the railway tracks.  There I spent
the night and, the next morning at 9 A.M. crossed the river Zeljeznica 
and into Vreoce.<P>

<h2>Deposition Made by S.K. From Sarajevo, Belesici on
23 November 1992 at the Gynecology-Obstetrics Clinic in Belgrade</h2>

I was born 7 February 1972 in Sarajevo where I lived until the
outbreak of the war.  When if broke out, I was taken to prison 
last April at the time when the roadblocks began to be set up.<P>

I completed elementary school and the high hairdressers' course.
I worked in a private hairdresser's lounge "Buba-Mara" and was
a part-time student of the Faculty of Physical Education
(I completed two years).<P>

While I was returning home from my job, I was stopped by four
armed members of the green berets who pushed me into a car, 
blind-folded me and drove me to a basement (I do not know where
it was located).  When we arrived there, I was put, together with
a 16-year old girl named Jelena, in a small partitioned corridor 
having no windows or ventilation.<P>

On the first night, twelve men wearing black overalls, which
served as a kind of their uniforms, came.  They first molested
Jelena and then forced themselves upon me.  I did not know any 
of them; I only heard that they called one of them "Alibaba".
He tore all my clothes and, since I was virgo in tacta, he was
very brutal, he slapped me and made me have oral sex with him 
and an intercourse.  Then the other two came who pinned me down
on the floor while Ismet Bajramovic known as Celo (I later found
out what his name was) led the rape.  He was the leader of the group.
He has an organization of his own which still operates in Sarajevo. 
He assaulted me first, then the others took their turn and the 
whole ordeal was repeated throughout the night: I had to have
oral sex and intercourse with them.  I found out his name during
my 25-day detention with Jelena in that corridor.  Jelena stayed
behind when I left.  As I could see later on, it was a small
apartment building which had a basement where the two of us were
detained.  The basement space next to us resounded with cries and 
screams of other women.  During those 25 days I was there, I was
repeatedly abused day in and day out; both of us were forced to oral
sex and intercourse.  All those who did that to us said that Serbs
were doing the same to their Moslem sisters.  This was their pretext, 
a justification for what they did.<P>

On my last, 25th, day there, Ismet Bajramovic-Celo came and told me
he had to let me go because of the strings pulled on my behalf, 
advising me to forget all about what happened to me there for my 
own sake. <P>

The husband of a friend of mine, a Moslem, used his connections
to find out where I was and get me out.  He told me that the 
building I had been in was in Pofalici.  Everything has been
pulverized and there is no Serb house left in that suburb now.<P>

I left in the same manner I was brought in - blind-folded.
They drove me to Kosevsko Brdo, a Moslem controlled sector of
Sarajevo, opened the door and threw me out.  I walked to a friend,
Emir Tufekcic, whose wife Radmila is a Serb.<P>

Since I was mentally disturbed, my friend Emir Tufekcic,
who was not a member of green berets at the time but had to comply 
with a work order, and his wife Radmila helped me to go to the 
psychiatric clinic "Kosevo" in Kosevo, to see a Dr. Haris, whose
surname I do not know.  I found out what his name was while I was
treated at the clinic:  they called him Haris there.  I was 
hospitalized for 28 days.  Having left the clinic, I stayed with
Emir and Radmila Tufekcic who hid me in their home.<P>

After a month I felt sickness, I vomited, which indicated pregnancy.
I went again to "Kosevo" clinic intending to have an abortion.
They said that I could have it only if I said to the journalists that
I was raped by Serbs.  I indignantly refused, since I could not 
besmirch my people, the religion I belong to, and myself.
They have no humanity or compassion; they salute each other with
"Selam alekum and merhaba".  So, I decided: if there was no chance
for me to have an abortion, I would give birth to the child and
strangle it, I hope one can understand such thoughts in such moments.
The child was not a fruit of love; I would feel only hatred and
rage for it and it would always remind me of the awful and horrible
things I went through.<P>

I was still with my friends Emir and Radmila Tufekcic, who fed me
and gave me clothes, since I did not have any clothes of my own.
There was no chance for me to pass to the Serb-controlled territory.
I was with them until 15 November (midnight).  They helped me to be
included in the list of people to be evacuated to Serbia.  The list
began to be compiled in July, but it was not until November that the
convoy of evacuees left for Serbia.  The convoy departed Sarajevo on
15 November and reached Belgrade on 17 November 1992.  I arrived in
Belgrade at midnight, where I slept and a day later was admitted
to the Gynecology-Obstetrics Clinic where I gave birth to a girl.<P>

<h2>Deposition Made by S.K. on 6 November 1992 at the Gynecology-Obstetrics
Clinic in Belgrade, 26 Visegradska Street</h2>

My name is S.K. I was born 11 July 1968, Nisic, municipality of Ilijas.<P>

I was captured on 26 May 1992 in the forest near my house.
I was with two other refugee girls from Visoko - J. and N.R.
We were captured by ten men in camouflage uniforms; they had
"lily" insignia on their caps.  They put us in a truck and took
us in an unknown direction.  They drove us to Breza camp.
We were detained in a basement with small windows; it was a
dirty, damp and cold place.  They raped us immediately on arrival;
groups of them raped and beat us.  I remained there for two days.<P>

I was then moved to another building, another room where there were
five women and girls: two Nadas, Rosa, Mira and Olja.  I was in that
room until our release on 15 August 1992.<P>

We were in that room almost all the time, except when we were taken
out to watch prisoners being beaten up, tortured and executed.
The torture consisted of slaughter, tearing of bodies bit by bit,
drowning in a pool which looked like a swimming pool - what else was
in it besides water, that I do not know.<P>

Prisoners were forced to hard labour and we were taken out from
our room only to watch killings and tortures, or to clean and do
the gardening.  I did not know the prisoners; they were from 
Breza, Visoko and Vares.<P>

We were repeatedly beaten and raped by scores of men;
sometimes as many as 20 of them violated me one after another.
When we fainted, they poured water on us.<P>

We did not have bath.  There was a bathroom but we were not 
allowed to have a bath or take a shower.  There was a washbasin
were we could wash our faces, and if we managed we could wash
ourselves speedily. <P> 

We were tortured simply by taking us to watch other prisoners
being tortured.  Once, they forced a father to rape his daughter 
who was about 17 years old.  They beat them but the father and
daughter refused to do what they were told.  It was only when they
pressed a knife to his throat that his daughter cried and begged
him to do so in order not to be killed.  He eventually did it 
and I do not know whether he was killed later on, but anyone
who leaves that prison is a living death.<P>

We were fed by pieces of mouldy bread or macaroni, probably 
leftovers, and a soup which was in fact slops.<P>

We, the girls and women occupying that room, could not talk to 
each other since we were never alone; there was always
someone of them with us both when we worked and when we were
in the room.<P>

They constantly mentioned the name Kula, probably an alias.
They kept asking themselves whether he would be satisfied 
with the way and how much they beat and raped us.  They
laughed as they did so. <P>

Later on, when I returned home, I heard that Kula was the
warden and that he was from Semizovici.  I never saw him.<P>

When I was freed, the five girls who were with me in the
room were also released.  Two of them committed suicide
immediately after their release and the rest of them 
left the village with their parents.  They set us free
because we were pregnanat and their purpose was to make
us pregnant.<P>

I am now horrified of confined spaces and wish to go back
home as soon as possible.<P>

<TITLE> Vehida Dedic</TITLE>

<Font SIZE="+1">

<H2>Brutally betrayed by trusted protectors</h2>

<em>By Bruno Beloff, The Scotsman, July 13, 1994</em><P>

The brutality of the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina has been measured over the last two bloodstained years by death and rape - rape as a military tactic for terror and control.<P>

Now, in the chaos and lawlessness of the Muslim enclaves in southern Bosnia, allegations of the same crime are emerging.<P>

Only a few survivors have so far been able to testify to such behaviour.<P>

One is Vahida Dedic who says she was raped and beaten by a gang of men led by the Bosnian Muslim commander of Srebrenica, Naser Oric, then rejected in her own town with no-one to turn to.<P>

For her, crossing the lines into the hands of the Serb army which was shelling the people around her, was the only means of escape.<P>

A rotund, gentle, elderly man, a lawyer from Belgrade, sits in the cramped dusty office of a disused factory in the Bosnian Serb town of Bratunac.  Opposite him is a tall, thick-set young Serb soldier, toying with a handgun, slumped in a chair. A diminutive 15-year-old girl enters and the two men stiffen.  They each know why she is here.  The soldier is the girl's temporary warder.  She is after all, an object of some curiosity in Bratunac: an infiltrator from across the nearby frontline.  The lawyer is present to take a statement for Yugoslavia's own war crimes tribunal.<P>

Vahida Dedic, visibly in pain and with one side of her face swollen with toothache, tells her story.<P>

"I was desperate.  I realized that I couldn't live there anymore and was thinking of committing suicide."  As fighting spread across Bosnia-Hercegovina, Vahida and her family had fled from their village of Pobudje to the nearby Muslim enclave of Srebrenica.  Vahida, initially in makeshift refugee accommodation, found space in a house in the centre of Srebrenica.  It was there that she met the town's commander.<P>

"Every second evening or so, Naser Oric used to come, usually with a different woman.  He was always followed into the house by three Muslim soldiers.  On March 27, they came again.  I made coffee, as the housekeeper told me to.  Then the three soldiers ordered me to another room.  I knew their names: Safet, Serd and Ibro, boys of 20 years.  When I entered the room, the soldiers told me to strip off, lie down on the bed and have sex with them.  I started protesting.  I tried to free myself.  At one point, I tried to jump through the window: this was upstairs.<P>

"Safet caught me and started to beat me on the face and body.  Then all three started to to beat me and take off my clothes.  That's how they stripped me naked.  Safet was the first to rape me.  After that, Serd and Ibro raped me as well."<P>

Vahida's quiet measured voice continues, weakened only by her swollen mouth.  She holds beck tears and stares into the lawyer's eyes.  She remains outwardly calm.<P>

"By the end, I was unconscious.  I came round before dawn.  I realized that I was alone and naked, and the door of the room was open.  The rape started around eight in the evening.  I don't know when they left the room.  At first, I couldn't stand up.  Then I dressed, and went to find the housekeeper.  When I found her I told her what had happened, but she just laughed at me.<P>

"In the morning, Commander Oric came back, so I told him what his comrades had done to me.  He hit me and swore at me."<P>

Vahida Dedic's only culpability had been to trust those around her.  Now, she says, no-one was there to support her or assist her.<P>

"I went to the Muslim police, to complain to them.  But when I told them what happened, they shouted 'Get out of here!' and threw me out of the police station.  'You have complained to Naser,' they said. 'If he didn't help you nobody can!'"  Naser Oric, the 24-year-old army commander of Srebrenica, first came to prominence in March 1993.<P>

At that time, the charismatic UNPROFOR General, Philippe Morillon, demanded that, if the town was to become a "safe area", Naser Oric must hand over his weapons.  Oric dismissed the demand and halted the evacuation of the town's women and children.  Faced with angry demonstrations as the townsfolk stampeded on to UN trucks, Oric said he would "screw up" the convoys, preferring a human shield of 9,000 civilians for Srebrenica's 8,000 fighters.<P>

Vahida Dedic's public ignominy meant no future for her in Srebrenica.  Escape seemed the best option.  Vahida persuaded a friend, Serifa, to accompany her on the five-mile walk across the frontline, to Bratunac.  But by this time, under Oric's instructions and with the active compliance of the UN, Srebrenica had effectively become a prison.  The girl's walk was potentially suicidal.<P>

"The only way out was down the main road from Srebrenica to Bratunac.  If we went into the hills, someone could have shot us.  There were Muslim positions there.  So we were down the street.  Myself and Serifa walked out from Srebrenica.  But when we came to the UN guards, they prevented us from going on and told us that they would shoot at us.  They were very short with us.  They ordered us to go back to Srebrenica... but we didn't want to go.<P>

"So, we crossed a stream about five kilometers from the UN post and went on our way to Serbian territory...  At about half past twelve a Serb soldier saw us and beckoned.  Then we saw that we were in the middle of a minefield.  We asked the soldier to come and take us out... so that we didn't step on a mine.  He came and took us to the Serb guns.  The Serb soldiers gave us food.  Then they took us to Bratunac by car.  Serifa was taken to hospital, she was pregnant."<P>

The lawyer completes his notes.  The statement is concluded.<P>

But what will now happen to Vahida?  "In no way would I ever go back to Srebrenica...  I want, if I can, to stay here and live in Bratunac.  But if they won't let me, I'll go on, to Valjevo [in Serbia], to see my grandmother ... she's called Dessa Mehmetovic."<P>

But no-one knew if Dessa Mehmetovic was still alive.<P></FONT>

<h1>  Yugoslavia: Serbs Cry Out As Sanctions Cripple Health Care System</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Suzanne Nelson<br>  Inter Press Service, 5/19/93</i></h2><p>

<i> Copyright 1993 Inter Press Service</i><p>
<hr>

BELGRADE: The Agisevocs counted their blessings when they were told that their six-year-old son Siafet would be admitted to the Mother's and Children's Hospital in Belgrade after he was diagnosed with leukemia, an often fatal childhood disease.<p>

Then came the bad news.  there was no medication available to treat their ailing son although it could be obtained at a price.  But the cost of even the first treatment is more than the combined monthly salaries of the Agisevocs who come from the troubled south-western Serbian region of Sandzak.<p>

" I never expected this.  We have no savings because we started to build a house, and I don't know how we'll pay for the second therapy -- maybe we'll have to sell the furniture," said lawyer Nedzmija Agisevoc.  With tears in her eyes, she continued:"No matter what the reason is for sanctions, they (the U.N.) should never restrict the importation of medicines."<p>

The overall cost of the medication -- the equivalent of eight treatments -- is 10,400 German marks ($6,500), and what's more it has to be bought overseas.  The first treatment cost them approximately 1,200 German marks ($812) -- more than twice their combined monthly incomes of 600 marks ($375).<p>

" I was shocked when I heard the price," said Agisevoc, adding that her husband -- a factory worker -- had borrowed money and traveled abroad to purchase the medicine.<p>

It is the bitter pill that all Serbs are having to swallow for perhaps in no other sector has the effect of the tightened United Nations Security Council trade embargo on Yugoslavia been more painful than in the realm of health care.<p>

The sanctions, which were put in place a year ago, severely restrict the import of medicines and other health supplies, are directed against Serbia and Montenegro for lending military assistance to the Bosnian Serbs in war-torn Bosnia-Hercegovina. <p>

The effect on health care has been widespread.  At hospitals, patients are being given unscreened blood transfusions or improvised, untested drugs.  State-operated pharmacies are empty of all but the most basic supplies.<p>

At dental clinics, an increasing number of people are opting to have teeth pulled instead of fixed, and they are doing so without any anesthesia -- which costs as much as 10 marks ($6) per shot.<p>

The deterioration in health care is also acutely felt by doctors, who used to boast of having some of the best equipment and training in the developing world.  these days, many doctors pedal to and from work on bicycles retrieved from attics, and their salaries are barely enough to buy milk and bread.<p>


In the past, doctors point out, wealthy Arab leaders would reserve entire floors at the massive military hospital in Belgrade, while a number of women would also secretly fly in from the United States for discounts on facelifts.<p>

Official statistics on the number of patients who have died from causes directly related to the sanctions won't be released until next month, but government officials say the number is climbing.<p>

Psychiatric clinics, emergency wards, kidney transplant patients and malignant and cardiovascular patients are expected to show particularly high mortality rates, said Ljiljana Stojanovic, the federal assistant minister for health care.<p>

Diseases such as hepatitis and tuberculosis are also becoming more widespread among Yugoslavia's roughly 10 million residents -- an estimated 15 percent of whom are said to be undernourished.<p>

The trade embargo, which technically allows humanitarian supplies to cross the border, has in practise resulted in massive amounts of red tape, bankrupt hospitals and pirated medical supplies which disappear en route through neighboring countries.<p>

Additionally, more than 90 percent of the country's domestic drug production, which largely depends on the shipment of raw material, has come to a halt during the last three months, officials say.<p>

And officials say that to add insult to injury, international aid organizations such as UNICAF and the World Health Organization (WHO), have done virtually nothing to plead Yugoslavia's case in the world court of opinion.<p>

"I'm usually not too sharp, but I can tell you, we are not Iraq -- we're going to find a way to tell the world some of its decisions were wrong," said Stojanovic at a recent press conference.  "when all this finishes, it will be like World War II and the Jews -- the world will have something to be deeply ashamed of," she added. <p>

But Hannu Vuroi, head of the World Health Organization's office in Belgrade, argued that sanctions are designed to hurt.<p>

"Sanctions are a political matter, and we're not a political organization.  But it's a little funny that one U.N. body should be bringing sanctions, and another should try to correct the effects (of those sanctions)," said Vurio, a Finnish doctor. .<p>

In any event, Vurio said it was not the sanctions that initially triggered the demise of yugoslavia's health care sector, rather it started with the collapse of Belgrade largest trading partner, the Soviet Union.<p>

Besides, Vurio continued, WHO's humanitarian mandate for ex-yugoslavia -- approved in July 1992 -- is to focus on refugees and displaced people.<p>

WHO's first aid office was opened in Croatia -- one reason the Serbs may slight the organization, Vurio admitted.  Another reason is that only a fraction of the needed funds for Yugoslavia have been pledged by WHO's donors.<p>

"Many donors have specified that (their aid) is not for Serbia, saying 'They're the bad guys in the world'," said Vurio, adding that there are only about 10 non-governmental aid agencies active in Yugoslavia, compared to five times as many in the Bosnian city of Tuzla.<p>

But, privately, corruption is also cited as one reason Yugoslavia may not be getting as much humanitarian help as it would otherwise.<p>

An estimated 20 to 30 percent of humanitarian aid supplies -- especially costly drugs -- are 'lost" in the supply routes between warehouses, regional centres and distribution points, say international aid workers.<p>

Vurio said WHO has tried to combat the problem by driving its supplies straight to hospitals, but some drugs, especially insulin and antibiotics, "probably end up missing."<p>

"We have no figures, but some things end up, shall we say, in the wrong hands," said Vurio, whose office -- which is kept locked even during working hours -- was robbed of its telephones over the weekend.<p>

Yugoslav officials dismiss such accusations as irrelevant or smoke screens for larger issues.  "There's corruption on all three sides (in the war)," said Stojanovic, who said the issue at hand is whether refugees and Yugoslav citizens should be made to suffer collective punishment.  "I don't know of a war in history that doesn't have corruption."<p>

The debate over the morality of sanctions, especially when it comes to health issues, is likely to become increasingly heated.  But for now, suffering only appears to be bolstering intense feelings of patriotism.<p>

Miodrag Miladinovic, a middle-aged Montenegrin, said it's been two months since his 13-year-old son, Tivat, was diagnosed with leukemia.  Because he only makes 250 marks ($155) a month as an army officer, Miladinovic borrowed money from his brother-in-law in Germany to pay for leukemia treatments.<p>

But Miladinovic said he wouldn't suggest doing anything different to "appease" the world and lift U.N. sanctions.  "I wouldn't do anything more (than Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has done) ... I would do even less," said Miladinovic.  "Certain things have to be respected.  And one of them is (that) Serbs have never allowed someone else to decide their destiny."<p>

<H1>LEND A HELPING HAND TO A FRIEND IN NEED</h1><p> 




<hr>

For almost two years now Yugoslavia has been living within an iron international blockade.<p>

Over 10 million people of different nationalities are endangered.  Out of that number 4.3 million are children and elderly and 600,000 refugees - accommodeted mainly with host femilies.<p>

Winter is at the door-step.  Due to the embargo on the import of oil, gas and spare parts for electricity generating plants, schools, hospitals, homes for the elderly and apartment buildings .. will have no heating.<P>
 
Mortality due to infectionus diseases in Yugoslavia has recorded a drastic increase (115%).  Polio has reappeared.  Nutrition of the population is 20% below the physiological minimum.  Anemia among children has increased by 50%.  The poor purchasing power, and hyper-inflation make it impossible for the population (with average monthly salaries of $15) to ensure even the minimum of food requirements (bread, milk, basic food products).<p>

There is a shortage of drugs, medical equipment and supplies, vaccines for children, surgery supplies, disinfectants, hygienic supplies, water filtering chemicals.  There is a lack of infant formulas, warm clothing and footwear.<p>

<h1>  Yugoslavia: Suffering Increases in Belgrade Hospitals</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Suzanne Nelson<br>  Inter Press Service, 11/16/93</i></h2><p>

<hr>

BELGRADE: Ranko lay propped in bed in a purple tee shirt, waiting for the nurse to finish unwrapping the bandages that bound the smooth round stump where his leg had been amputated.<p>

Two months ago, Ranko, a 27-year-old diabetic from the Montenegrin town of Pljevlja, couldn't find the $30 he needed for a month's supply of insulin. as a result, he lost his leg.<p>

Within days of his stopping insulin intake, his skin started to look different.  then gangrene set in.<p>

"I knew if I stopped taking insulin that something would happen, but o didn't know exactly what," said dark-haired Ranko, lifting his hands in an expression of despair.<p>

Ranko's story is a familiar one at Belgrade's institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, where cases of gangrene have increased tenfold in the past year.<p>

Insulin has become increasingly difficult to find in Yugoslavia's  state-run pharmacies over the past two years.  Supplies in private pharmacies -- at grossly hiked prices -- are also now difficult to come by.<p>

The collapse of the economy, the strain of war, hyperinflation and United nations sanctions also mean there's little money available to buy essentials like insulin.<p>

According to the institute's director, Predrag Djordjevic, cases like Ranko's are common.  He said that he used to see gangrene only occasionally but now it is no longer rare.<p>

there are some 50,000 insulin-dependent diabetics in the Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro.  Together, they need about $30,000 worth of insulin each day.<p>

"How cheap life has become," said Djordjevic, adding that gangrene is just one of the problems facing Yugoslav doctors.  "Nothing is unbelievable to me now."<p>

The imposition of U.N. sanctions on Yugoslavia and the other former Yugoslav republics 17 months ago because of inter-ethnic warfare has had a dramatic impact on the health-care system hare.  Although medicines are not subject to sanctions, hospitals cannot afford foreign medicine, and the local drug industry is not allowed to import many raw materials.<p>

In additions, many supplies never reach Yugoslavia because of the lengthy, complicated paperwork required by the United Nations for importing medicine of hospital equipment.<p>

In the same hospital, Nevenka, a 56-year-old refugee from Mostar,serves as another example of the lack of money and medication.<p>

Nevenka suffered a stroke 20 days ago and has blood-circulation and diabetic problems.  She has no money for medication, and the hospital does not have supplies to treat her.  Nevenka thinks she will never leave the hospital alive.<p>

"We don't know what to tell patients, so we just try to talk about the future," said Alexandra Jotic, a 27-year-old intern.  "We give them education and prescriptions, but no drugs."<p>

The situations is much the same throughout Yugoslavia.  Lack of drugs, run-down or broken equipment, outdated sterilization techniques and even lack of light bulbs have plunged medical care back 30 years or more.<p>

Even in Belgrade's most modern hospitals, patients subsist on a diet of cabbages, potatoes and soup -- trundled to them by attendants who have to grope along unlit hallways.<p>

Far from turning citizens against the Yugoslav government, the frustration and anger are increasingly directed against the West.<p>

Djordjevic, who claimed to speak for some 17,000 Serbian physicians who belong to the Serbian Medical Society, said that sanctions are turning both intellectuals and ordinary people against Europe and America.<p>

"There's no milk for the babies.  Where's the connection with political problems?" he asks.  He adds that he also sees no connection between Yugoslavia's health-are and military budgets.<p>

"I could accept everything -- no gasoline, no car, no chocolate.  But I must have bread," he said.<p>

At the nearby overcrowded University Children's Hospital, pediatric surgeon Zoran Milosavljevic said that children are facing worsening odds of survival.<p>

"Doctors make experiments on rabbits, and politicians make experiments on people," he said.  "I'm not God to say this boy can live and this one will die.  I've worked in this job for 30 years, and it has never been so bad."<p>

<hr>

For almost two years now Yugoslavia has been living within an iron international blockade.<p>

Over 10 million people of different nationalities are endangered.  Out of that number 4.3 million are children and elderly and 600,000 refugees - accommodeted mainly with host femilies.<p>

Winter is at the door-step.  Due to the embargo on the import of oil, gas and spare parts for electricity generating plants, schools, hospitals, homes for the elderly and apartment buildings .. will have no heating.<P>
 
Mortality due to infectionus diseases in Yugoslavia has recorded a drastic increase (115%).  Polio has reappeared.  Nutrition of the population is 20% below the physiological minimum.  Anemia among children has increased by 50%.  The poor purchasing power, and hyper-inflation make it impossible for the population (with average monthly salaries of $15) to ensure even the minimum of food requirements (bread, milk, basic food products).<p>

There is a shortage of drugs, medical equipment and supplies, vaccines for children, surgery supplies, disinfectants, hygienic supplies, water filtering chemicals.  There is a lack of infant formulas, warm clothing and footwear.<p>

<FONT SIZE=+2>During the escape which the Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, called "voluntary ethnic cleansing" and President Clinton "a new hope for peace" the refugees were shelled both by the Croatian artillery and air force, beaten and stoned by angry Croatian mobs in the presence of UN monitors and Croatian police.  At the end of September 1995, over 170,000 refugees have arrived to Serbia and another 20,000-30,000 remain in the Serb controlled territory in Bosnia. In 1991 Serbs were 15% of population in Croatia.  Today they make up 2.5%.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>Ms. Gordana Todorov was in <A HREF="http://www.ecn.uoknor.edu/~nsfdesmm/vojvodina/novisad/ns.html">Novi Sad</a> in <A HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/users/lpv/YU/HTML/yu.html">Serbia</a> at the time when the refugees from <a HREF="http://sharac.msc.cornell.edu/~marko/KRAJINA/index.html">Krajina</a> were arriving.  She visited the central "collection center" at the SPENS sports center in Novi Sad and numerous other places where the refugees were congregating during several days between 8/7/95 and 8/11/95.  At this time Ms. Todorov taped a number of conversations with the refugees.  The photos shown here were also taken during those visits.<P> 

 The excerpts from the interviews were added to the documents containing larger versions of the photographs.  Unfortunately, because of the initial hostile reactions of the refugees (they accused Ms. Todorov of intending to portray the footage as that of Croatian or Muslim refugees fleeing from the Serbs) Ms. Todorov was unable to record their names or their background stories.  We can only convey as much as the refugees were willing to mention in their taped conversations.  Unless indicated otherwise, the excerpts from conversations are displayed next to the picture of the collocutor.   Additional information  from news articles about the events leading to and during the exodus and the destiny of those Serbs who decided to stay in their homes in Croatia is also included.<P>

 Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ:<P>
 
      It has been three weeks since the Croatian attack on the
 Krajina created the largest single movement of refugees in the war
 that continues to torment the former Yugoslavia.  According to our
 office in Belgrade, more than 170,000 Krajina Serbs have sought
 refuge in Serbia, while many more are moving east across Bosnia.
 Well over 600,000 Serbian refugees have fled conflict in the course
 of this terrible war.  Their plight is worsened by the severe
 limitations on humanitarian assistance that sanctions have created.<P>
 
      We are pleased that IOCC - in the midst of such tragic
 circumstances - is able to continue its Christian mission of mercy,
 helping anyone who is in need and for whom we have sufficient
 supplies.  Within hours of the onset of fighting in the Krajina,
 IOCC had diverted its existing stocks to aid these new refugees -
 more than $900,000 worth of relief supplies in the last two weeks.
 We were very fortunate that at least one major contributor allowed
 us to divert immediately 30,000 hygiene parcels originally intended
 for UN enclaves to meet the needs of Serbs who have fled the
 Krajina.  We have also been able, during this time, to continue our
 numerous programs that assist people served by Serbian hospitals
 and social institutions.<P>
 
      In addition, as the lead implementing agency for the World
 Council of Churches, IOCC has received major contributions from
 European donors to assist people in the UN enclaves that still
 remain.  IOCC has also appealed to the administration in Washington
 to overturn its policy of refusing to provide emergency
 humanitarian assistance through organizations that operate in
 Serbia.<P>
 
      Attached you will find an update on our activities to assist
 Serbian populations affected by the fighting in Western Slavonia
 earlier this summer and, more recently, in the Krajina.<P>
 
      Our appeal for $2.4 million to assist refugees from the
 Krajina still stands, and we, in turn, appeal to you to find every
 possible way of responding as generously as you can.  The needs
 will be great, and the winter will be bitter.  Please share this
 letter and update with as many people as you can.<P>
 
 Yours sincerely,<P>
 
 Alexander Rondos<br>
 Executive Director<P>

           <h2>     Sarajevo Winter Report/Appeal #3</h2>
 
BACKGROUND  Last February  a few netters in the US and Sarajevo
started the "Sarajevo Winter" project, which wired cash to
Sarajevo for distribution amongst the people of a neighborhood to
help them get through the winter months. We set up a bank
account, found a way to wire money to Sarajevo reliably, and
appealed for contributions. Our Sarajevan team member distributed
the money amongst needy people of his acquaintance.<P>
 
Over the winter we collected and sent a total of $1900 to
Sarajevo, which has been shared amongst a total of 30 people.<P>
 
We also carried $900 to individuals at the request of netters who
heard of our project; and we sent a small amount of money to
Bihac.<P>
 
THE QUESTION OF PROFITEERS  We decided that money sent to
Sarajevo would work against the black market if people could lay
in supplies during those times when the city was relatively open
and prices low. We decided that it was more important to help
people with immediate necessities in this way rather than worry
too much about the profits of those who were bringing goods in
during the siege.<P>
 
We would have sent more money to Bihac, but the situation there
was different than in Sarajevo, and our Bihacan team member
advised that such aid at the time was not useful.<P>
 
END OF THE FIRST PHASE, BEGINNING OF THE SECOND  Supplying money
to Sarajevan friends during the winter was a successful project.
However, the task of distributing the money - and  having large
amounts of money in hand - was a burden to our Sarajevan team
member, and we are not currently soliciting contributions for
that particular activity.<P>
 
However, during the first phase we have identified specific 
needs in Sarajevo and also Tuzla, that can be met through
Sarajevo Winter wires, and are now appealing for help in meeting
them. Our current projects are:<P>
 
1. We are helping a Sarajevan soldier who lost his foot after
stepping  on a mine; this soldier needs remedial surgery, and a
decent prosthesis. His wound is not serious enough to require
medical evacuation, and we are attempting to supply the funds he
needs to get proper care in Sarajevo. We have arranged for a US
doctor to consult with the Sarajevan doctor via email, and the
prosthesis will be built either in the US or Sarajevo, depending
upon the siege situation. NEED: $1,000<P>
 
2. We were able to deliver a number of solar-panel battery
chargers and portable stoves to Sarajevo during the winter, and
have been told that these made a big difference to people. We
would like to procure and deliver more. NEED: $500<P>
 
3. We have begun a project "Tuzla Disabled Online" to allow the
mobility-disabled community in Tuzla to communicate with their
peers in other countries via email. We are hoping to supply two
groups, the Union  of War Invalids and the Association of
Dystrophics, with the hardware needed to bring people online and
also provide training in computer skills. Deltacomm ltd, a
telecomm company in Tuzla, will provide the necessary technical
help. NEED: $2,500.<P>

 <h1>Vision of Hell and of Burnt Land</h1>

<strong><em>by Vladimir Jovanovic (a military analyst)</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nasa Borba, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 4/26 1996</h2> 

The latest bloody incidents in Kosovo are a sign that the
long time accumulated political tension, resulting from time
to time with human casualties and violence, could escalate
in severe armed clashes between the Serbs and the Albanians
there. Kosovo has been a potential war territory for a
decade and a half already, and the 'status quo' situation
has been kept due to the fear from repression, to the
international diplomatic pressure, and to the exhausting
mutual policy of 'waiting'.<P>
A military uprising of the Kosovo Albanians was announced as
'a very possible' several times during the dissolution of
former Yugoslavia. The disbanding of the territorial defense
units of Kosovo in 1989, however, made it obvious that the
eventual uprising could be limited only to a guerrilla war.
And it could hardly bring to  some significant effects, due
to the characteristic flat configuration of the ground. The
Yugoslav National Army (YNA), that was performing military
actions in Kosovo beginning from 1981, had a very detailed
operating plan, which included: action for quick isolation
of rebellion places, bases and areas; interruption of the
eventual supplying lines from Albania; severe vengeance
measures; punishing the Albanian rebellion movement, etc.
The actions of the YNA, that were to take place eventually,
would have followed the 'burnt land' model, and there is not
a single thing to show that it had changed in the meantime.
Currently, strong forces of the Yugoslav Army (YA) are
covering Kosovo. The Third Nish Army units are the land
forces of an operational-strategic level, and the
operational forces are grouped in the Pristine Corps.
These Corps are one of the YA most powerful ones, and are
made of highly mobile brigades. Their imperative is to break
and disorganize the Albanian uprising at the very first
interval of the eventual armed conflict with strong initial
actions, lots of fire and movement, as well as to give the
YA headquarters enough time to evaluate the character, the
dimensions and the intentions of the rebellion. Accordingly,
the following steps anticipated are the strengthening of the
already present forces with units from the inland of Serbia
and Montenegro, which would be preceded by a mobilization
and a concentration of the forces at those regions.<P>
The Pristine Corps consist of the following basic units: an
armored brigade, two motorized brigades, an artillery-
missile regiment, and an antitank artillery-missile brigade.
The back up troops would arrive from three directions. The
Nish units and Leskovac Corps would strengthen the units in
Gjakovica, Prizren, Uroshevac and Gnjilane; the Kraguevac
Corps would act alongside the Ibar Ravine, from Kosovo
Mitrovica through Vuchitrn towards Pristine and due south;
the Podgorica and Uzice Corps (as a part of the second Army)
would be grouped at the Pestar Plateau to cut the road
communication from western Kosovo to Novi Pazar, and to
further act towards Pec and Kosovo Mitrovica in the Metohija
Plain.<P>
The operations of the land Serbian-Montenegrin forces would
be joined by a demonstration of force, and then by military
actions of the air forces. The air military base of Pristine
bases its forces on a regiment of fighter planes 'Mig-21',
that would perform their assault actions as a support to the
land forces. The other air forces which would also be
included would be: the Nish military air forces (the
transport brigade of the 63rd parachute brigade and the
'Gamma' helicopters squadron), the Kralevo air forces
('Eagle' squadron, 'Gamma' squadron and 'G-4' assault
squadron), and, eventually, airplanes from the Podgorica
airport, which would act from the reserve runway near
Berane, located at the north-eastern part of Montenegro.
In case the Albanian rebellion is of a smaller intensity and
at isolated regions, the engaging of the Serbian Internal
Affairs Ministry special forces would be of a priority. The
other forces included would also be: the local police ones
(that have antiaircraft guns 'Beffers' and 'Prague' at their
disposal, as well as machine guns, mortars and armored
vehicles); the YA Special Corps (consisting of the Topchider
guard motorized brigade, the 63rd parachute brigade and the
Panchevo 72nd sabotage brigade); the military police units;
and the protection regiment of the Pristine Corps.
According to the Defense Law, the operational commander of
these forces would be General Dushan Samardzic, the
commander of the south-eastern battlefield of the YA, and
the operations would be strategically led by the Supreme
Military Council, from the military bunker near Belgrade.
There are no proofs that the Albanians in Kosovo have many
weapons, except for the light arms they have obtained
illegally (either from foreign countries or from the police-
army forces, the latter of which provoked great affairs in
public), and probably light antiaircraft and antitank
weapons.<P>
An intensive resistance of Kosovo Albanians near the border
with the Republic of Albania is expected. They would be
probably supported by Albania, but this country's armed
forces would not be able to help, unless an international
military intervention against Serbia and Montenegro takes
place.<P>
Taking into account the numerous population of Kosovo and
the great hatred between the ethnic groups there, it is
certain that any kind of armed clashes in this province
would bring to great civil sufferings and to a great number
of desperate refugees. The reservists and volunteers from
Serbia and Montenegro, as it happened in 1991-1992, would be
hard to be controlled and they would hardly respect the laws
of the war.<P>
On the other hand, a war in Kosovo would make a foreign
intervention very possible, and could provoke an all-
against-all war in the Balkans.<P>

<TITLE>City Electoral Commission Warns Nasa Borba to Keep Quiet</TITLE>

<h1>Propaganda Must Cease</h1>
                
<strong><em>by editor-in-chief and the editorial board</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nasa Borba, Beograd, FR Yugoslavia, 11/27 1996</h2>

<strong>Belgrade</strong> - "Article 34 of the law on the territorial organization
of the Republic of Serbia and the local self-government, prescribes that pre-election
propaganda in the public media and election gatherings must cease at least 48
hours before the election," says the letter which has been faxed from the City
Electoral Commission to our offices.<P>

"Since the repeated elections for the deputies in the Belgrade city hall in the
precincts where the previous round of elections had been cancelled are supposed
to take place on November 27, 1996, starting at 7 o'clock a.m., election propaganda
in the media should have stopped on Sunday, November 24, 1996 at midnight."<P>

The letter continues: "As your newspaper has continued with election propaganda
after the deadline prescribed by the law, the City electoral Commission WARNS
you that you are breaking electoral rules and making the legality of the repeated
elections for the Belgrade city hall questionable."<P>


<h2><em>Nasa Borba's</em> response</h2>

<h3>How long should we remain silent?</h3>

We are heartened in the knowledge that the City Electoral Commission has
again started to communicate with our newspaper, since its president Radomir 
Lazarevic had until now several times refused to respond to our questions
about important aspects of the commission's activities.  For example,
about the regularity of all that this commission has done since the November
17 elections.<P>

We would like to inform Mr. Lazarevic about several facts:<P>

<ol>
<li> On the day when he sent us the warning, state-controlled newspapers 
published articles with the following titles: "Left wins more mandates",
"Triumph for Socialists", (<em>Vecernje Novosti</em>), "Even more convincing
Socialist victory", "Socialists in the lead" (<em>Politika Ekspres</em>).
<li>We do not engage in election propaganda, as the CEC warning states, but we
report about the demonstrations of the citizens in Belgrade, Nis, Kragujevac,
Uzice...  And about unprecedented vote rigging and lawlessness in which CEC
is also taking part, as was asserted by <a HREF="/info/students/marko/nasaborba/nasaborba2.html">a judge in the Serbian Constitutional
Court</a>.
</ol><P>

Maybe CEC thinks that the demonstrations should be covered with a shroud of
silence but in that case they are barking up a wrong tree.  The commission
should first silence hundreds of thousands of protesters in the streets.<P>

Finally, we would like to remind that <em>Nasa Borba</em> dutifully observed
pre-electoral silence before the elections of November 3 and 17.  Now the 
situation is much more confusing: voting took place on Sunday in Vojvodina, on
Monday in Serbia and today in Belgrade.  In the pre-electoral silence still on?<P>

How long should we stay quiet?<P>

<h1>Serbia Doesn't Need Protection From Us</h1>
                
<strong><em>Z. Radovanovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nasa Borba, Beograd, FR Yugoslavia, 12/5 1996</h2>

<strong>Kragujevac</strong> - "These demonstrators have only one goal: that those
who enact laws also respect those laws.  Their theft is unprecedented.
Therefore, until they return our mandates in the Belgrade city hall, we will
continue with protests; until that happens Belgrade will feel that Kragujevac is
a moral capital of Serbia".  With these words Milan Komnenic, from Serbian Renewal
Movement, addressed yesterday's rally in the center of Kragujevac. "Through the
official channels, we want
to win the necessary political, economic, and 
cultural changes in Serbia.  Because of that we expect that common sense will
prevail in the end and that these 100,000 policemen will return to their homes.
There's no need to protect Serbia from us, we are its future," said Komnenic and 
added that "the lesson in democracy" will continue until Christmas, if necessary.<P>

Finally he told to the Kragujevcani: "Let us struggle to become free men, to respect
law and that Kragujevac, together with Belgrade, Novi Sad and Nis be in the
quartet of cities which will be the cornerstone of new Serbia".<P>

   <center><h3>Student Protests</h3></center> 

<strong><FONT SIZE="+1">Student protest continued yesterday at the mechanical engineering faculty 
in Kragujevac.  Student protesters were addressed in the central lecture
hall by professors, Dr. Milos Kojic, Dr Milan Micunovic, Dr. Miroslav Demic,
Dr. Ruzica Nikolic, as well as several teaching assistants.  It was agreed
at this meeting that Kragujevac students will gather daily at 1 p.m. at the
mechanical engineering faculty and that the protest will continue until 
their demands, the most important of which is the respect of the popular 
will as expressed in the local elections, are fulfilled.<P>

After the rally at the mechanical engineering faculty, Kragujevac students 
walked through the city and arrived to the main rally at the central city
square "kod Krsta".</FONT></strong></TD></TR></TABLE></center><P>

Newly elected "Zajedno" representative, Dr. Vladan Vucicevic emphasized
that people will gather every day at the main city square, "kod Krsta"
until both Belgrade and Nis are liberated.<P>

"We will prove to everyone in Serbia that 'Zajedno' is a political organization
which has the strength of Karadorde and wisdom of Milos [Karadorde and Milos 
Obrenovic liberated Serbia from Turks].  If necessary, we will go to Belgrade
to help," asserted Vucicevic.<P>

"Now all of us know what Milosevic's regime is prepared to do.  They won't 
flinch from open theft of opposition mandates.  Something like that is unprecedented
in the history of democracy.  Slobodan Milosevic and his henchmen staged the heist
of the century.  It seems they don't know what they are doing, they've lost their
heads," said the secretary of the Democratic party City Council for Kragujevac,
Dragutin Radosavljevic.<P>

He added that on November 17, all illusions about the independent judiciary
in Serbia disappeared.  "There is no independent judiciary in Serbia.  The courts
are just another institution in service of Slobodan Milosevic and his regime,"
said Radosavljevic.<P>

"We will demonstrate in city squares until the media in Serbia are free.
We can see that Milosevic's regime is relentlessly trying to destroy the free media.  
We must persevere and hold on to the end.  We won here in Kragujevac, but we must
help Belgrade, Nis and other cities and show to the Socialists that the Serbian
people doesn't want their rule," concluded his speech Dragutin Radosavljevic.<P>

Yesterday's protest concluded when more than 10,000 Kragujevac citizens
passed through the city streets shouting "Red bandits".  New demonstrations
were scheduled for today at 3 p.m.<P>

<h1>No Compromise on Our Election Victory</h1>
                
<strong><em>by Z. Miladinovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nasa Borba, Beograd, FR Yugoslavia, 12/8 1996, Special issue</h2>

<strong>Nis</strong> - "I plead, beg and demand of Slobodan Milosevic and the Supreme Court of Serbia not to force the city of Nis to once again become a war-time capital of Serbia [as during W.W.I]."<P>

"I guarantee that there will be no trade with the Socialists and that we won't trade recognition of the opposition victory in Belgrade for our victory in Nis.  That sort of deal won't pass by Vesna (Pesic), nor Zoran (Dindic), nor Vuk (Draskovic), nor the local "Zajedno" leaders," said the vice-president of the Democratic party, Zoran Zivkovic, at the 20th day of protests in Nis; yesterday's rally took place in the central city square.<P>

Member of the Democratic party city council, Milan Paroski, and writers from Belgrade, Dusan Kovacevic, Ivan Ivanovic, and Milan Mladenovic, spoke in front of approximately 20,000 citizens.<P>

When Paroski mentioned the president of Serbia, Milosevic, the protesters started whistling and didn't stop for 45 minutes.  After that, Paroski continued: "We broke another record," and "The lecture is over, they are finished!"<P>

<center><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=500 CELLPADDING=20><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#E7E7E7">
   <center><h3>Fabricated Shots</h3></center>
<strong><FONT SIZE="+1">"We want to deny the information carried by the Nis city television that shots
were fired by the protesters at the Television building.<P>

This lie was denied by the Nis city police as well.  The police officially
announced that the protesters hurled crackers at the building and that one window pane was broken.  Throwing of crackers is hardly an incident, and as far as the broken window is concerned, I told the police: arrest the perpetrator," said the Democratic party vice-president, Zoran Zivkovic.</FONT></strong></TD></TR></TABLE></center><P>

The remaining speakers were greeted with shouts: "We won't give Nis", "We won't surrender victory", "Thieves, thieves",  and whistling.<P>

Even the announcement that the Serbian renewal Movement leader, Vuk Draskovic
will speak at the today's rally, which was scheduled to start at the same place at noon today, was greeted with calling of the absent leader's name.  Several tens of taxi drivers attended the rally with "Zajedno" and Vuk Draskovic posters on their cars.  We also saw students from the Nis university in the crowd.<P>

"Last time in Nis, I said that this was a Czech protest, but this is Polish 'Solidarity'.  This is a real social protest which political parties cannot organize.  This can only be done by the people, long live people," was all that Paroski managed to say before his voice was drowned by the noise from the crowd.<P>

Writer Dusan Kovacevic said that 20,000 protesters in Nis is the same as if half of Belgrade was in the streets.  "After 50 years of occupation and living under communism, we expect a different story in Serbia.  This is the beginning of a new, better, and more beautiful life.  Changes have begun, we must persevere.<P>

Make sure you don't make any mistakes.  The authorities are waiting for an excuse to use force," warned Kovacevic.  He also said that he "was excited to be speaking at this rally," which was greeted by shouting of his name:" Dule, Dule!"<P>


<center><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=500 CELLPADDING=20><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#E7E7E7">
   <center><h3>Socialists to form a new City Hall in Nis</h3></center>

<strong><FONT SIZE="+1">Yesterday a rumor circulated around Nis.  Apparently, high officials of SPS [the Socialists] and JUL [United Yugoslav Left] were visiting the local SPS.<P>

Allegedly, they came to Nis to decide how to constitute a new city hall in which the Socialists have 46 deputies [after vote rigging].

This rumor agrees with the reliable information that Nikola Sainovic has recently left the session of the SPS city council with the promise that he
"will return tomorrow or day after tomorrow to decide how to establish the new city hall."

It also dovetails with the expectations that the Socialists may recognize the results of the second  round of local elections in Belgrade but that they won't
"give in" in Nis.</FONT></strong></TD></TR></TABLE></center><P>

Moderator of the afternoon gathering and the opposition candidate Risto Bukvic informed the crowd that the Nis City Television had publicized misinformation, that someone from the crowd of protesters had shot at the television building.<P>

"Obviously, they are looking for ways to bring the occupying forces to Nis and establish a dictatorship here.  We will send an open letter to the Nis City TV in which we will demand that they stop fabrication of lies or totally stop their broadcasts," said Bukvic.<P>

President of the Serb Patriotic Alliance "Nine Jugovic's", Milivoje Ristovic responded to the government claims that "only hooligans attend rallies in Nis" by saying that he had indeed brought a deadly weapon: a whistle.  "With that whistle I say to the authorities that they are going on a blind track."<P>

Sociology professor, Slobodan Stojanovic added that the citizens have nothing to lose, since they've already lost all of their possessions, apart from their dignity and honor.<P>

"We won't allow that someone turn our victory into a defeat.  We won't give up because we played according to their rules and we won't allow them to turn us into slaves," he said.<P>

"We appeal and demand from the centers of power in Serbia  to immediately start resolving our petitions for the recognition of the original election results in the second round since every delay leads to additional radicalization of protests and makes it increasingly difficult to control popular anger," said the Democratic party vice-president Zivkovic at a press conference held before the rally.<P>

He said that the City Electoral Commission hasn't responded to "Zajedno" appeals, although the legal deadline had already expired.<P>

"The City Electoral Commission in Nis continues with the behavior which is bringing the situation in the city to the boiling point.  The citizens won't tolerate that any more and the members of the City Electoral Commission should be aware of their responsibility for the radicalization of the protests," said Zivkovic.<P>

He added that the protests had spread to another 16 cities and towns all over Serbia.  According to him, the largest concentration of police was in the cities of Belgrade and Kragujevac; the goal of protests all over Serbia was the recognition of the original election results and the return of policemen to their home towns.<P>

"Coalition 'Zajedno' cares about all the citizens, even those in police.  It is better that policemen stay in their home towns with their families than to waste time in other towns," said Zivkovic.<P>

Today's protest rally in Nis concluded with the customary walk through the city.  Dissatisfied citizens were led by taxi drivers, and some of tired protesters were "saved" by friendly drivers.<P>

Protesters were asked to bring today flowers and carnival gear since the "holiday season has started in Nis".<P>

<h1>Socialists To Repeat Elections Until They Win</h1>
                
<strong><em>R. Lalic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nasa Borba, Beograd, FR Yugoslavia, 12/8 1996</h2>

<strong>Vrsac</strong> - After the second round, the local elections in Vrsac
took the same course as in other towns in Serbia.  The District Court in Vrsac 
annulled the election victory of the "Zajedno" coalition (the coalition took
23 out of 45 mandates), and the District Electoral Commission, instead of 
confirming the 24th "Zajedno"  victory in the village of Vlajkovac, decided to 
annul regular elections.<P>

Legal procedure in the District Court was very interesting; after the intervention
of a high Socialist official, Ljubomir Ilkic (deputy to Gorica Gajevic), judge
Petar Magda fell ill and had to be urgently taken to a hospital for a dialysis.
That apparently helped and the elections in those places where Socialist
candidates (Ljubomir Ilkic, Brana Djurdjev and others) had lost were annulled.
"Zajedno" coalition legal team led by prof. Dragor Hiber, lodged appeals on
those decisions, since they do not comply with current laws.  The court still
hasn't replied to those appeals; it is probably waiting for the outcome of
the demonstrations in the rest of Serbia.<P>

Immediately before the third round of elections, the political climate in 
Vrsac suddenly became harsher.  "Sudden" arrival of two buses with government 
tax inspectors resulted in the "entertainment" for opposition members and
candidates.  It is interesting that even some Socialists, who do not agree
with Ilkic's struggle for personal survival at any cost, were also targets 
of the "tax sweep".<P>

Fliers introducing Socialist candidates were distributed all over the town.
The fliers warned the citizens not to vote for "scoundrels and terrorists who
call for violence".  On one of the fliers, SPS candidate claimed that "Hemofarm"
[local company] supports his wife, that is Socialist/United Yugoslav Left (SPS/JUL) campaign.
Having in mind apolitical orientation of "Hemofarm's" director, Babic, it is
hard to explain this abuse of renowned company in support of an outrageous
electoral procedure whose only purpose is to save Ilkic's political life.<P>

In the third round Ilkic again lost, so the elections will be repeated for
a fourth time.  Electricity was switched off at one voting station, and in order
to avoid any potential surprise in Vlajkovac, the district electoral commission
added the necessary number of Socialist votes!?  However, unsurpassed in its
baseness was the attempt to recruit <strong>inmates of a psychiatric institution</strong>
(the whole conversation was recorded on a cassette player) to vote for their
physician, Dr. Bane Djurdjev, SPS/JUL candidate and the chief of the local JUL.
Because of all these incidents, "Zajedno" has again lodged numerous criminal
complaints.<P>

Peaceful protests of citizens in Vrsac continue.  Elected "Zajedno"
representatives haven't given up and are demanding that the original election
results from November 17 be reinstated.  If that doesn't happen, they will 
return all of their mandates in the new town hall.<P>

<h1>"We Know What we are Doing and are not Trying to Woo Anyone"</h1>
                
<strong><em>Dragan Banjac</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nasa Borba, Beograd, FR Yugoslavia, 12/9 1996</h2>

<strong>Belgrade</strong> - Lately, this newspaper has pointed out that the
only way to obtain information in this country, because of the government
controlled media, is to turn to foreign radio stations and satellite Television
channels.  Understanding that, students protesters, several days into protests,
decided to communicate with other students in the country via the Internet and to
use the Internet try to inform the world about everything.<P>

Starting with last Tuesday, a group of students from the Faculty of Political
Science has tried to spread the news about current events via the powerful Internet.
<strong>Why the Internet and why so much fuss about that?</strong>, we asked Dusan 
Vasiljevic, third year student at the Faculty of Political Science and the 
spokesperson for the Student Protest 1996/97.</FONT><P>

<center><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=500 CELLPADDING=20><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#E7E7E7">
<center><h3>Slogans</h3></center>

<strong><FONT SIZE="+1">There are a lot of slogans on the walls of the crowded and small room.  
Maybe the most conspicuous one is "This room is bugged," and then "Mr.
Milosevic, you didn't pass the exam.  See you in JULy [abbreviation for United 
Yugoslav Left]. Professor Dr. Mira Markovic [Milosevic's wife and one of
the founders of JUL]", "Problem in political mechanics: calculate the vector
which will get rid of the rector [pro-government head of Belgrade University]",
and finally in English "I am an underaged, crazy, misguided profascist", an 
allusion to the description of the student protests by one of local
political sycophants.</FONT></strong></TD></TR></TABLE></center><P>

<h2>"Internet Revolution"</h2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">"Several days into the protest we realized," said Vasiljevic, "that it is
much easier to communicate with Novi Sad and other cities in Serbia via 
the Internet than using inadequate telephone links and faxes.  We achieved
two things: established communications with our colleagues within Serbia and,
what seems to be very, very important, informed the whole world about
what we are doing and what our demands are.  I have to admit that until 
recently I hadn't realized the potential of electronic mail.  I am almost
certain that this was more important than any local radio station, it was
kind of like the Voice of America.  Besides, we are in contact with students
all over the planet and from their reactions we can tell that our voice is
heard and that they are interested in the situation in Serbia."<P>

<strong>Who have you managed to contact so far?</strong><P>

"Mostly non-governmental organizations which work on human right protection
and problems in the sphere of democracy in general."<P>

<strong>Who was your first contact from abroad?</strong><P>

"I think Zeljko from Orlando.  After him, it was a guy from New Zealand.
Via the Internet we received messages of support from NBA basketball
player Vlade Divac, lord Owen...  From Zadar we received a message of support
from the head of Croatian Internet.  On Saturday we received a message from
Bulgarian students.  We've heard that signatures for a petition in our support
are being collected in the USA and Canada and that demonstrations in front of
the UN building in New York were scheduled for this Sunday.  We've also heard 
from the Slovenian students of political science who had started a petition
in support of our movement a few days ago."<P>

<strong>You've reached every corner of our planet?</strong><P>

"Yes, but we didn't expect this sort of reaction, we just wanted to inform
them, but we've received a lot of offers of assistance.  By the way, I'm
convinced that this is neither a velvet nor yellow [protesters throw eggs at
government buildings] revolution, but an Internet revolution."<P>

<strong>Will it last?</strong><P>

"Until our demands are met (reinstatement of the original election results,
resignations by Belgrade University rector Dragutin Velickovic and student
prorector Vojin Djurdjevic), and then we'll have a party."<P>

<strong>Where?</strong><P>

"At a place which will be able to receive all those who support us.  Maybe
somewhere in the city, maybe even in the Usce park [site of large demonstrations
in support of Slobodan Milosevic in 1991], although my preferred
location is next to the Terazije fountain, a haunted place since the 1992 student
protests.  Whenever I pass that fountain I get the creeps."<P>

<strong>Why?</strong><P>

"We've been silenced for four years.  As if we had lived a good life; and all
kinds of things happened, a war, huge exodus of young people from the country,
sanctions (UPUDAG, UnProvoked, UnDeserved And Genocidal [formula used in
the government controlled media for the sanctions imposed on Serbia for
its role in the Bosnian conflict], interjects someone) a few elections, 
clashes with the rest of the world..."<P>

<h2>"We Demand At Least Some Democracy"</h2>

Student Nedeljko Lazic, like all the other students, insists that their 
protest should not be linked with "Zajedno" coalition.<P>

"I am not here because of any opposition political party, nor do I 
support them.  The reason for my being here is our first demand; I see
that the energy is still there and hasn't been spent in Slobodan Milosevic's
and Draskovic's rallies; this is an eruption of anger which has been 
accumulating since the fall of Krajina and blockade on the Drina river[against
Bosnian Serbs]."<P>

"This is a pay off for everything," said Lazic.  "For the catastrophe to which
our political leadership has taken this people.  A few days ago, American flag
was burned in front of the American embassy and that was enough to make the 
impression in the uninformed West that we, Belgrade students are mistaken and
convinced that the West supports Milosevic.  We are not mistaken and are not
trying to woo anyone."<P>

<strong>Is this an allusion to the events from the near past?</strong><P>

"I was in high school during the last student rebellion.  But I was passed
next to the Faculty of Philosophy and saw what was going on.  Real carnival
atmosphere, and those days monastery Zitomislic [Serb Orthodox monastery
near Stolac] was burned in Hercegovina.  This time we are aware that only we, 
ourselves, can win our
 freedom and that renewed western pressure on Milosevic is because of their,
not our, interests.  We are not trying to bring down Milosevic; we are aware 
that we are not powerful enough for that; we are against such behavior of the
authorities.  Look at the JUL leadership, there are more millionaires today than 
before W.W.II.  During the 1968 demonstrations the main slogan was 'Down With
Red Bourgeoisie'.  The situation hasn't changed until today; it's time to
get rid of fear and to stop plunder in this country."<P>

"We demand minimal democracy.  Because, if something happens, they may forbid 
us to breathe", added Helena Kolesar from Sid.  "Let them fulfil our demands
and then we will see."<P>

Helena said that she wasn't thinking any more about emigrating; she admitted
that she had considered that option earlier this year.  "I don't know if abroad I
could find a guy who could put up with me; this country is too beautiful to
leave.  The easiest thing is to leave."<P>

Her colleague, Nenad Djordjevic, assessed the earlier student protests as 
lacking seriousness.  "That was nothing but a party and, besides winning Draskovic's
release from jail, broadcasts of parliament sessions and resignation from the state
controlled TV director, they didn't change anything.  This time it's 
different," said Djordjevic.<P>

"If my Leskovcani [town in southern Serbia], who to the last one support the
Socialists, were informed about the real situation (they only watch, and trust,
state-controlled TV program)... I can only imagine how such an indoctrinated
person would behave if he had access to foreign TV stations and the Internet,"
mused Goran Nikolic, third year student of political sciences.<P>

Lazic added that this time, regardless of the opposition protests which are
supported by a large number of citizens, only with the start of student 
protests the demonstrations in Serbia and especially Belgrade became "a
popular movement for democracy".</FONT><P>

<center><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=500 CELLPADDING=20><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#E7E7E7"><center><h3>"Birth of Democracy"</h3></center>

<strong><FONT SIZE="+1"><em>On Saturday, student protesters planted "Serbian plum tree" in New Belgrade?</em><P>

"There are different interpretations of that act.  Some say that the tree is
a spruce which will bear plum fruit once democracy takes hold in Serbia.
In my opinion that is a spruce tree which will grow together with democracy,
whose birth was marked with the planting of that tree," said Dusan Vasiljevic,
spokesperson of the Student Protest 96/97.</FONT></strong></TD></TR></TABLE></center><P>

<h2>"This Generation Is Ready"</h2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">President of the student organization at the Faculty of political science,
Daliborka Uljarevic, one of the most important persons in the presentation
of the student protests on the Internet, was especially surprised that the
number of messages in which assistance (even financial assistance) is 
offered was growing daily.<P>

"So far we cannot receive financial aid from abroad, since we still haven't
officially registered ourselves..."<P>

<strong>You do intend to correct that in the near future?</strong><P>

"See that message on the wall - <strong>Student Protest 1996/97</strong>.
It would make us very happy if tomorrow we went back to our studies, but 
that is very unlikely to happen.  Actually, we are not thinking too much
about how long this will last.  Still, I'm hoping that we won't have to 
register our organization.  The citizens were very generous in their
assistance, although we never have enough.  Young people can spend a lot."<P>

<strong>We've already raised this topic, but let me ask again: is there a link
between Student protest and "Zajedno" coalition and its numerous supporters who
also support the students?</strong><P>

"Students are rebellious enough without the opposition.  Most of us are
not members of political parties, but we are not apolitical.  Nor are we
a mob, as those whose names I don't want to mention insist.  After all,
we are supposed to be some sort of intellectuals and to connect Student 
protests with "Zajedno" coalition is to destroy it.  Besides we are helping
them enough and they know that.  I'd like to emphasize that we organized
ourselves and that we know what we are doing, and how to do it.  If our
right were denied, how can we expect that all other human rights won't
be denied in the future; that is where we differ from the opposition, although
some of our demands are the same."</FONT><P>

<center><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=500 CELLPADDING=20><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#E7E7E7"><center><h3>Support from Toronto</h3></center>

<strong><FONT SIZE="+1">While the last news item is entered into a computer late at night and some
students are stuffing themselves into sleeping bags, another message of support
arrives from afar.  The message is from Toronto, from Dusan Petricic, well 
known cartoonist and former student and professor at the Faculty of applied 
art, who left Yugoslavia three years ago.<P>

"There's nothing more natural and healthier than your need for a future.  
We support wholeheartedly that demand.  The only one you must stick to.<P>

We are proud that we were a part of Belgrade University," the message ends
above the signatures of Petricic and his wife Dragana Varagic, former student
at the Theatre Academy.  There is an attachment, a cartoon which was published
in the newspaper, "Toronto Star", a few days ago.<P>

Loud cheers spread through the small room.</FONT></strong></TD></TR></TABLE></center><P>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><strong>Everything is unusual.  Foreign journalists are surprised by peaceful
protests, and your movement is from time to time accused of immaturity?</strong><P>

"This generation is mature; they shouldn't fool themselves.  We've been in the
streets for 17 days and everyone has been impressed by our dignity. Powerful
CNN has sent war reporting crews, and a Swedish radio journalists asked me a few days 
ago why we are waving our "red books" [student report cards, also used as
a student identification].  She thought that the report cards were our 
Socialist party membership certificates which we want to return to Milosevic".<P>

<strong>"Still, the presence of foreign journalists is very useful for your 
protests?</strong><P>
 
"We know that. The police will think twice before charging a Sky news TV crew
[European satellite channel, similar to CNN] and we are grateful for their
presence.  Still the situation in the West isn't as rosy as most people
here believe.  I heard when you asked my colleagues whether they were thinking
about leaving the country."<P>

<strong>What do you think?</strong><P>

"I want to have a normal life here.  I don't want to go abroad; after all,
it's not all milk and honey out there.  And the West doesn't particularly
want us.  On Saturday, a journalist from San Francisco told me that they
were here to assist us in defense of the free media, but he admitted that
even in the USA there isn't such a thing as free media.  Therefore, we have to
sort out the situation here and our protest is a first step in that direction.<P>

This generation has the power and capability to do that.  We must no allow
that the world around us be created by the same people as 40 years ago,
people who have brought disaster upon this country.  When this is finished,
we can discuss free media, autonomy for the University and many other issues.
But [the reinstatement of original election results] is the basic demand and
we won't give up."<P>

<h1>Self-destruction of Great Leader</h1>
                
<strong><em>by Jovan Radovanovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nasa Borba, Beograd, FR Yugoslavia, 12/9 1996</h2>

The most important characteristic of Milosevic's downfall during recent events 
is the self-destruction of his authority.  Although this statement
may sound paradoxical, over the last 4 years Milosevic has done more to
undermine his authority than all the opposition leaders taken together.<P>

Not only has he destroyed huge efforts of important western
powers to transform his old image of a "Balkans butcher" into "a key
factor of peace and stability in the region", but he has also destroyed 
the image of an irreplaceable leader among his followers with his autistic 
silence and refusal to communicate with the dissatisfied citizens of Serbia
in any other way but through his henchmen, such as "Yugopetrol" Tomic [important officials of the Socialist party run state-owned companies, such as state oil company, "Yugopetrol"] and commentators employed by the state-controlled media.<P>

Ruthless media blockade of the opposition campaign during the federal election, imposition of discriminatory conditions, and finally the open
theft of opposition votes and criminal rigging of the local election results testify that Milosevic has comfortably settled in the role of "a key factor",
who is given a lot of discretion in his internal policies.<P>

<h2>Stupid Admirer</h2>

The best evidence for the claims above is that infamous Mile Ilic from Nis (by now a "political dead weight")
has stated that America and Europe had indicated that they would ignore Milosevic's pre and post-election machinations in 
return for his continued support of the peace process in Bosnia.<P>

Thus, a proven admirer of our Leader, obedient boss Mile, as it later turned
out, got, not only himself and those like him, but also the Great Boss himself into
a lot of trouble.  Even children know that such "dirty games" are kept far from the ears and eyes of the public.  Because of Mile's big mouth, some pretty significant embassies in Belgrade had to
issue a lot of denials; still, Mile demonstrated what kind of stupid
"cadres" the Boss has to rely on.<P>

Unfortunately, natural arrogance of our Leader, which forced him to approach
the situation after the November 17 elections in the style "state, that's me",
clearly revealed his character: not only was he unmasked as a ruthless
bully who doesn't give a damn for the popular will expressed in the elections,
but also as a totally irrational politician who cannot bear even the smallest
political defeat and is disoriented in a new situation.  It was another
Milosevic's attack on his reputation of a statesman who is supposed
to be "a key factor for peace and stability in the region".<P>

Therefore, no matter what the outcome of this political crisis caused by the
surplus of Milosevic's arrogance and his attempt to ignore the will of the 
people, his silence in the face of these massive protests (either because Milosevic underestimates the protesters or because he fears "the forces of chaos and madness" who attacked the strongholds
of his regime with eggs, whistles, horns, bells and paper planes) can have
only one result: in the eyes of a significant part of Serbian citizenry
Milosevic's authority has been definitively destroyed.<P>

<h2>Fatal Influence of Collaborators</h2>

Milosevic has done the biggest part of the damage.  If, in the future, someone
tries to measure the contribution of other participants in this (mis)deed,
he will find that the effectiveness of opposition politicians was
way below that of the people from the Leader's inner circle.  As every
authoritarian personality, Milosevic cannot stand those who can, at least from
time to time, use their own mind; he has removed from his inner
circle all those who could command at least some respect.
He surrounded himself with obedient, but less capable, people who are already
looking for a good opportunity to leave a sinking ship.<P>

Then, there is his closest collaborator, his wife, who has probably contributed
in the destruction of the Leader's authority, not understanding that the
forbearance of the wider public has its limits and that it won't stand
incessant bombardment with obsolete ideas and cheap literature from the pages
of her diary.<P>

With founding of her party (JUL [United Yugoslav left]) and imposition of
that party as an omniscient judge and vanguard on the Serbia's road to 
the future (which many have already seen in the past), she succeeded in
significantly reducing his prestige among the members of his own party.
Even within SPS [Socialist Party of Serbia], which cannot boast with
moral purity and lack of inclination to use every chance for theft,
there were expressions of intolerance with respect to the "sister party"
and its leading cadres who, in spite of a lot of pre-election talk
about the protection of social, that is popular, property, had stolen
a huge chunk of that property.<P>

<h2>Dissolution of a Myth</h2>

Lately, in the streets of large cities in Serbia, Leader's name is greeted by
long-lasting whistles from the crowd of protesters; masses who only a 
few years ago shouted "Slobo - slobodo!" [Slobo -freedom], today shout
"Slobo get lost!"; the Leader has to thank only himself for this huge
turnaround.<P>

Public abuse to which Milosevic is exposed in the streets and squares all over
Serbia, couldn't have ever been organized by the opposition without assistance
from Milosevic.  Because this time, much clearer than ever before, he 
demonstrated how much he despises and underestimates his own people.  There
is no politician in the world who could ignore demonstrations of dissatisfied
citizens for days, no matter how unpleasant their demands might be.  A smart
politician would have probably tried to reduce tension in a public appearance,
reduce the damage to his image and at least try to turn the events to his own
advantage.<P>

<h2>Expectations and Possible Outcomes</h2>

Because of all that, today, the basic question isn't whether Milosevic will
have to step down.  He demonstrated himself during the recent events that
he doesn't measure up to the political situation in which Serbia is today.
He has demonstrated better than ever before that Serbian people needs a 
different statesman at the beginning of the new century, no matter what
his strictly controlled party propaganda tries to convince us.  The recent
events have destroyed the myth that he is irreplaceable.  Now, the question
is not whether the regime which he epitomizes will fall, but when and how
that will happen.<P>

A bloody resolution, with which Milosevic's henchmen have lately tried to 
scare the populace, is the worst possible resolution of the several year
long crisis in Serbia.  One should hope that this will be avoided, although
one shouldn't underestimate forces which prefer such an outcome and probably
will try to provoke it.  This is the cause of visible efforts of international 
factors who are trying to prevent such a resolution of the crisis.<P>

Current indications are that numerous emissaries, who are these days visiting
Milosevic, will try to force him and the opposition to some sort of compromise in which both sides will have to make concessions.  If that happens,
that will mark only a beginning of the process whose duration cannot be 
predicted, but which will result in a greater degree of democracy in the
Serbian society.  To a large extent the outcome of this process will depend
on the power and skill of the opposition parties and their capability to
break the political monopoly of SPS and JUL, by using the newly released
positive energy of the people who in the protests expressed its demands for
fundamental social transformation.<P>

<h2>Newly Awaken Citizens and Young Generations</h2>

Nevertheless, even if that process doesn't go smoothly, which is a likely
outcome having in mind numerous weaknesses and shortcomings in the opposition
ranks, it seems that Milosevic's authority has decisively been damaged
among the citizenry and that it will never regain its former power and 
undisputed force.(...)<P>

It is becoming obvious, from numerous messages carried in the columns of
student protesters, that a new generation is growing up and that this 
generation, in spite of repression, and suffocating propaganda which was
supposed to push them into political apathy, knows how to use with their 
own minds, and understands real values, no matter how much all ethical,
human and political values had been systematically destroyed over the years.
This generation can bear the heavy burden of moral, cultural, economic and 
political renewal of this destroyed country.<P>

Since it is possible to in advance predict that there will be a lot of 
obstacles in this direction, the awakened citizenry will have to provide 
wide ranging support to the new generation, because it has demonstrated that
it can respond in a highly civilized and constructive manner to all provocations
of the current regime and that it will probably be able to effectively respond
to the future attempts of a leader or a party to curb basic human rights:
to choose and replace the authoritt which can not fulfil the demands
of its voters.<P>

<h2>Nasa Borba, Beograd, FR Yugoslavia, 12/13 1996</h2>

<strong>Vranje</strong> - Yesterday, "Zajedno" coalition supporters continued
their walks through the streets of Vranje [industrial town in southern Serbia].  
These demonstrations have been
registered with the local police until January 14.  During the coming days,
the demonstrators expect to hear "Zajedno" representatives from Belgrade;
participants in the Student protest in Belgrade will also be asked to come
to Vranje.  The organizers plan to start with public broadcasts of "Voice of
America" and "Radio Free Europe" news via loudspeakers in the streets of the
town.<P>

Starting today, citizens from the south of Serbia will be able to hear news
programs prepared by "Zajedno" coalition, which cover all important developments
within the country and abroad; these programs will also include information
about the current events in Pcinja district [in the south of Serbia] which
are ignored by the state-controlled media.  The news programs will be available
24 hours a day and can be heard by calling phone number 017/22-408.<P>

<strong>Bor</strong> - In spite of a ban by authorities, about 3,000 citizens
gathered yesterday in front of the House of Culture in Bor [Bor is a mining 
center in eastern Serbia].  After the latest news by
"Deutsche Welle" [German "Voice of America"]  were read, the gathered citizens 
were addressed by the Serbian Renewal Movement deputies Milic Mutavdzic and
Dragoljub Janes, and Bor city hall deputy and a candidate for mayor,
Dragomir Dragic.<P>

After that, the citizens went for a walk along the main street in Bor.
Bor students were unable to join the demonstrations because of the explicit
ban by the head
of Bor university and a loosing Socialist candidate for the Bor city
hall, Nedeljko Magdalinovic.  He threatened to expel those students 
who join the protests from the University and to make sure that they
would find it impossible to find employment in Bor.  Some students
have stated that they would ignore Mr. Magdalinovic's threats and would
join the protests today.<P>

<h1>Civic, not a Nationalist Protest</h1>
                
<strong><em>BETA news agency</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nasa Borba, Beograd, FR Yugoslavia, 12/13 1996</h2>

Chair of the Main Council of the "Student Protest 96", Aleksandar
Djukic, stated that students from all departments of Belgrade
University are staging a civic and not a nationalist protest, as
alleged by the American daily <em>New York Times</em>.  "That is
simply untrue.  All of us have national feelings which are our private
concern.  The current demonstrations in Belgrade are a typical
civic protest because of the annulment of the local elections by
some smaller and greater Serbs, whatever they wish to call themselves.
These is no connection whatsoever with nationalism," Djukic, a third year student at the department of political sciences, said two days ago.<P>

According to Djukic, the protest cannot be branded as nationalist because
some members of the Main Council are not Serbs.  He said that one
of the people who suggested that students visit Saint Sava cathedral
is Bunjevac [Croat from northern Serbia], therefore a Catholic [Serbs are
Eastern Orthodox, while Croats are Catholic Christians]. "He proposed
that idea as a way to spread our protests.  We don't care whether
someone is a Serb or a Croat, we don't care about anybody's nationality
or religion; all we want is that laws and the Constitution are respected
in this country, that we have a democratic system; if we can live together,
and we can, then nothing else matters," concluded Djukic.<P>

He also pointed out that student protesters carry flags of various
[western] countries and of the European Union because they want to
show that they belong to a nation which is just like any other
nation.  "By that, we show that we want to be a part of the world
and that we can be a part of the world, because we have enough intelligence,
knowledge and know how to show that," added Djukic.<P>

To the question whether it was true, as <em>New York Times</em> wrote,
that the students are protesting because Milosevic failed to establish
"greater Serbia", Djukic responded that sometimes even a victory in a war
can actually be a defeat.  "In a country in which a large proportion
of population lives in poverty, the president of the country can never
be a winner," said Djukic.  " We don't think that we gained anything with the establishment of a Serb state in Bosnia.  We have lost our
dignity, we have to listen to the people in power, who steal, who have stolen
everything, starting with "old" foreign currency deposits in Serbian Banks
and our parent's salaries, and ending with our future," emphasized Djukic.<P>

<center><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=500 CELLPADDING=20><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#E7E7E7">
<center><h3>"We were heartened by support from Slovenia"</h3></center>

<strong>"We are very aware of speculations about the nationalist nature of 
our protest.  Because of that, we were recently very heartened by the
support from Slovenian political science students.  I was very happy
to hear that young people from Slovenia support us.  I think that all
of us have to face a common prejudice that we are Balkan savages and
have to work very hard together and show that this part of the world
is no worse than others and that it is possible to live a normal life
in the Balkans," said Djukic.</strong></TD></TR></TABLE></center><P>

Djukic also said that the leadership of the Student protest is aware
that the democratic changes will bring up some very difficult questions: 
why was there a war, who was responsible for the war, and what was the role
of Milosevic and Belgrade in all that.  "Of course that we are aware of 
that.  We are facing the same problem that Germans faced at the end of
W.W.II : they had to prove that not all of them thought like Hitler.
That is a huge problem.  We must demonstrate that we also have positive,
freedom loving traditions, that we have things we can be proud of," emphasized
Djukic.  He expressed hope that "younger generations will find courage
to think about all that, especially since they didn't take part and are
not responsible for all that, and that they will try to make amends for
the deeds of others."<P>

"Why should people leave if they can prove here that they are intelligent
and capable.  That's what we want.  We want to work, to live.  That's all.
That's behind our slogan 'Belgrade is the World'. This city is the world.
We have a lot of that world here, a lot of good people and very different 
people. And we want it to stay like that," said the Chair of the Student
protest, Aleksandar Djukic.<P>

"It is high time that the power in Serbia was passed peacefully, based
on election results.  We hope that, finally, the rule of law and democracy
will be established.  That's our goal," said Djukic.  He added that "Student
protest '96", was "a typical civic protest" because of the annulment of the 
election results; students don't want to be forced to leave the country
because of the people in power, no matter who they are.  "Foreign journalists
often ask 'how many of you will leave the country' and I respond that, God
willing, none of us will.  If we are defeated, the majority of us will leave,"
said Djukic.  He emphasized that students have different life styles and
political affiliations, that some members of the Main Council of the Protest
are also members of some political parties, but that a majority of students
does not belong to any political party.  "We want to give power to someone
who can improve our living conditions, return our human dignity, and to ensure that
we have a right to vote as we desire; a lot of student votes were stolen
in the recent local election," said Djukic.<P>

<center><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=500 CELLPADDING=20><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#E7E7E7">
<center><h3>Students are Independent</h3></center>

<strong>To our question regarding the similar demands of students and "Zajedno" 
coalition, Djukic responded that their demands are the same, because
the students want to have right to democratically choose their 
representatives. "In that, our demands are the same as the demands of
'Zajedno' coalition.  We are seeking a system in which the party which
looses an election will peacefully give up power.  It is a mere coincidence
that 'Zajedno' coalition is also protesting at this time.  We will again
protest if in the future 'Zajedno' annuls elections in order to stay in 
power."</strong></TD></TR></TABLE></center><P>


To the question whether the students will in the future insist on separate
demonstrations from those of "Zajedno" coalition, and whether they insist
on separate protests because of fear or something else, Djukic responded that
the reason for separate protests is not fear but "a kind of wisdom".<P>

"We don't want to make it possible for the authorities to say that we are
led by Zoran Djindjic, Vesna Pesic or Vuk Draskovic ["Zajedno" leaders].
We want to avoid such accusations, because they may lead to a break with
some of our parents, some of whom voted for "Zajedno" while others voted for
the Socialists; we are sure that all of them will vote for us.  They will
trust us more [than the authorities] because they know that we are young,
educated and that we really care and want to start living a normal life
in this country instead of worrying daily whether there will be enough money
for food.  Our parents know that we want to live like all normal people,
who respect certain rules, because they live in legal states.<P>

"These students are patriots; why should they emigrate if they can live 
here."  Djukic asserted that president Milosevic is under increasing pressure
and that "whether he wants it or not, he will have to give in to the demands
of foreign politicians, governments and media and also to the demands of 
more than 100,000 protesters who had been demonstrating daily in the streets.
Who knows how long the protesters will remain peaceful," said Djukic and
added that "there are some changes" and that "the situations is not the
same as before".  "The time of lies is over.  They are trying to hide 
the truth, but with 150,000 people daily in the streets..."  Djukic claimed
that the students were not tired and that "they will not get tired because
each one of them knows that this is about his or hers own future; and one
doesn't play with the future."<P>

<h1>Best Solution: Reinstate Election Results</h1>
                
<strong><em>BETA news agency</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nasa Borba, Beograd, FR Yugoslavia, 12/17 1996</h2>

<strong>Podgorica</strong>, Beta - Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Dukanovic
stated that the best solution for the current crisis in Serbia is to reinstate
the results from the second round of recent local elections.  In 
an interview for the daily <em>Vesti</em>, which is published in Serbian in
Frankfurt, Germany, Dukanovic said that even to him, let alone to foreign
governments and public opinion, "the explanation that the opposition has
rigged the elections which were, as everywhere else, organized by the 
authorities, sounds very unconvincing".  According the Podgorica daily 
<em>Pobjeda</em>, he emphasized that the reinstatement of the
election results would be "the best solution" for the current crisis in 
Serbia.<P>

Dukanovic emphasized that "the authorities in Serbia shouldn't be afraid to
do that; it is not a tragedy to loose power in several cities, even the
largest ones, if one has firm control of the republic and Federation".<P>

Montenegrin Prime Minister said that if it has become impossible to reinstate
the results because of the legal procedure, president Milosevic should 
"annul these and declare new local elections as soon as possible; this way
we are simply wasting time".<P>

According to Dukanovic, the solution for the crisis in Serbia is a condition
for improved relations with the international community: "everyone must
realize that huge internal, economic and social problems cannot be solved
without improved relations with the international community".  Dukanovic
concluded the interview by saying that the annulment of the second round
of local elections in Serbia has resulted in "irreparable damage both on
the internal and external plane".<P>

<h1>Hunger, Money and Cans</h1>

<strong><em>by Vehid Jahic <a HREF="/info/students/marko/
bumerang1.html">(AIM)</a></em></strong><P>

<h2>Vreme, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 2/10/96</h2>

The latest demonstrations of the exiled Srebrenica inhabitants in Tuzla-Podrinje
canton culminated after several days in  violence and a "clash" between the 
protesters and the policemen
who were protecting the canton government building.  Women refugees tried 
unsuccessfully, after several hours of protests, to break through the police 
cordon made up of about one hundred policemen in order to enter the building;
that was the beginning of a commotion and scuffling with the police.  After that,
the refugee women stoned the canton government building, broke seven windows   
on the building, all the time demanding to talk to someone from the cantonal 
authorities.  However, besides foreign TV-teams and local journalists, no one
came out to talk to them.<P>

Their protests had begun several months before in the village of Vozuca,
near the town of Zavidovici [in north-central Bosnia].  For days the refugees demanded better conditions for themselves and their children, more food,
clothing, shoes, appropriate accommodations and health care.  There are 
approximately 1800 refugees from Srebrenica in Vozuca.  The buildings in the
village are destroyed since the village had until recently been a 
frontline [between Bosnian government and Bosnian Serb forces]; consequently
the refugees lived without electricity, schools, a clinic...  Dissatisfied
 and feeling deserted by the authorities, Srebrenica refugees blocked with 
 their bodies the road Tuzla-Zavidovici-Zenica, demanding that the Bosnian
 officials resolve their status.<P>

<strong>SACKING OF A RED CROSS BUILDING</strong>: The authorities started some
activities in order to improve the situation of the refugees living in Vozuca,
but everything ended with feeble attempts.  At the end of the last and beginning 
of this  month, thousands of refugees from Srebrenica, living in the counties
around Tuzla, organized demonstrations in front of the International Red Cross building
in Tuzla.  The protesters demanded from ICRC the truth about the missing men
from Srebrenica; after hearing the reply that the employees of ICRC "are working
on that", the protesters broke into the offices of this institution and 
demolished the first floor of the building.  ICRC employees locked themselves up
on the higher floors of the building;  all roads leading to Tuzla were blocked 
for hours; some ten cars, one truck and one bus, whose drivers tried to push
through the crowd have lost all semblance to motor vehicles.<P>

After giving vent to their dissatisfaction with international organizations
because of the missing men from Srebrenica, the refugees "remembered" those 
responsible for their difficult situation.<P>

"We understand everything!  They did not let us leave in order to use our
suffering to collect humanitarian aid and money.  The received donations 
were not used to provide accommodation and food for us, but were kept by the
authorities.  The authorities are using humanitarian aid as a vehicle for
some sort of their capitalism, all at our expense.  You know, we will
demonstrate until the authorities tell us how much humanitarian aid and
donations were received from abroad and what they were spent on.  That
money wasn't spent on us!  We are hungry, thirsty, sleep in tents in the
middle of a winter; we lack clothing, shoes, food...," tells us Zejneba
Mesic from Srebrenica, now living in the school building in Zivinice 
[near Tuzla].<P>

Among the protesters, there were several men in uniform, obviously soldiers
who survived Srebrenica calvary.  They also accused SDA [ruling party in Bosnia
and the largest party representing Bosnian Muslims] and the government for
stealing and embezzlement; their political message was that they  would not
vote for SDA in the future but for Haris Silajdzic and the opposition.<P>

This sharp criticism of the authorities and social and political demands
of the refugees from Srebrenica were, naturally, ignored by the pro-government
media.  All the information about the demonstrations which appeared on the 
government controlled RTV Bosnia-Hercegovina and in the pro-SDA papers were
presented as the anger of the refugees at the international community because
of the missing.  For days, the demonstrators were ignored by the authorities;
nevertheless, in the last spate of demonstrations one could discern the 
involvement of a hidden director.  The demand for clarification of the way
in which the humanitarian assistance was spent was slowly drowned by the 
the demands regarding the missing Srebrenica men, and the anger at the authorities
was more and more replaced by the anger at the international institutions.<P>

Nevertheless, persistent demands in connection with the social and political
problems resulted in a pre-approved visit of a refugee delegation to Sarajevo,
more precisely, to the president of SDA and Bosnia-Hercegovina, Alija Izetbegovic.<P>

<strong>GOVERNMENT STONED</strong>:  However, instead of promised seven buses,
cantonal authorities provided only one bus, which set out, with carefully chosen
travelers, towards Sarajevo.  This additionally angered the refugees from Srebrenica
so that they demanded from the cantonal authorities, made up of SDA leaders, 
to provide another seven buses for the trip to Sarajevo.  After the cantonal 
authorities ignored their demand, the refugees renewed their demonstrations in front 
of the canton government building; however, this time the strongest demands
were in connection with the social and political situation.  While they were
stoning the building, the demonstrators swore at virtually all members of the
current Bosnian leadership shouting: "We will vote for the opposition, Siladzic
even Kljuic [a Bosnian Croat politician] if we have to!"<P>

The accusations regarding the sellout of Srebrenica and embezzlement
of the foreign financial aid were heard again.  Fifty years old Habiba 
Dzananovic from Srebrenica, at the moment living in Lukavac, claimed that
seven trucks full of aid for the refugees had recently arrived to Lukavac,
but that none of the aid was given to the refugees.  Rejha Mehmedovic 
claimed that Bosnian leaders were all thieves, that they sold the 
humanitarian aid for foreign currency while the refugees got two small
fish cans, two pounds of peas, several ounces of oil and a little 
washing powder for a whole month, or only 100 grams of bread per day!
Uniformed men were shouting "SDA-thieves", or "Alija, God willing 
you will perish like Srebrenica"; consequently, the ruling circles accused
the opposition of organizing the demonstrations since the demonstrators
were shouting political slogans!?<P>

After the meeting of the chosen Srebrenica inhabitants with Alija Izetbegovic, 
domestic media tersely reported that the authorities "support justified  
demands regarding the fate of missing men; the social situation of the
refugees was also discussed."<P>

It is a somewhat strange that the government of the Tuzla-Podrinje canton
knows to the last penny how much money non-governmental humanitarian 
organizations, which finance their project independently (instead of
through the government), spend (organizations like Norwegian peoples 
aid and Norwegian churches assistance) while at the same time they do 
not know what happens with their own money. For example, what happened
with $5 million donated by the Dutch government to the refugees from
Srebrenica; the authorities are keeping quiet; they still haven't
revealed the amount collected through the funds earmarked for the
aid to Srebrenica, for example the SDA party account.  Canton president,
Izet Hadzic, one of the SDA leaders, claims that half of the money
donated by the Dutch government was spent on the renovation of the
buildings in Brcko and Srebrenik for the accommodation of the refugees.
He is keeping quiet about the other half, $2.5 million.  Still, it 
is known that the SDA president, Alija Izetbegovic gave a personal 
donation of DM 2 million (!) for the refugees in Vozuca, but those
funds had been frozen for months because no one wanted (or knew how) 
to spend them.<P>

Finally, it seems that the Bosnian authorities have underestimated
the problems facing refugees, since the return of refugees, despite
the [Dayton] Agreement, in practice still hasn't started.  In Tuzla, people
from Srebrenica showed that they had "had enough".  It is reasonable
to expect that the volcano of dissatisfaction will erupt in other towns
in Bosnia-Hercegovina.<P>

<h1> Buried Truth: Abduction in Strpci Two Years Later</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Filip Svarm, Velizar Brajic and archive center <em>Vreme</em><br>  Vreme, 3/6/95, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia</i></h2><p>


<hr>

Two years have passed since the abduction of a group of Muslims and a Croat, citizens of the FR Yugoslavia (FRY), which occurred on 3/27/93 on train number 671 in Strpci.  Relatives of the kidnapped passengers, Montenegrin Helsinki Committee for Human Rights and citizen resistance movement "Public Against Fascism" marked this date by organizing a press conference open to the public in Podgorica.  Several tens of citizens, journalists and representatives of the Foundation for Humanitarian Law and "Helsinki Watch" were present.  Although individually invited, the people from the Montenegrin and Federal leadership were absent.  At the same time, the citizens chamber [lower house] of the federal Yugoslav Parliament rejected a resolution sponsored by a representative from the Montenegrin Social Democratic Party, Ranko Krivokapic, which demanded that the chamber issue a proclamation regarding the kidnapping in Strpci since "after two years nothing is known about the destiny of the abducted persons."  Federal vice president, Nikola Sainovic, replied that the investigation is still open and that, therefore, there is no basis for a debate in the Parliament.<p>

How far the investigation has moved and what has been discovered so far, i.e. who were the kidnapers, who is behind the abduction, where the kidnapped persons are and whether they are alive, is still not known.  Dr Dragisa Burzan, president of the Montenegrin Parliament's Committee for the investigation of the abduction in Strpci, said at a press conference in Podgorica that the Committee's hands had been tied, simply because the relevant authorities had refused to cooperate.  "We needed six months," said Burzan, "to get a permission to inspect the documentation of the authorities in Uzice, who were in charge of the investigation.  We have obtained the permission, but we still do not know when we shall be invited and allowed to inspect the documentation."<p>

Relatives of the abducted passengers in the meantime tirelessly knocked on the doors of republic and federal offices and engaged in hunger strikes in order to find the truth.  When they were received by the president of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, in Belgrade on 5/25/93, he promised "to turn heaven and earth" and to reveal the truth about the destiny of their dearest.  Serbian Minister for Internal Affairs, Zoran Sokolovic, asked even earlier (March 1993) in Prijepolje  those same families "what kind of Ministers we would be if we couldn't find them?"  Yugoslav Federation president, Zoran Lilic, expressed in Novi Pazar on 9/23/94 readiness to "gladly talk" about the case provided that the Montenegrin parliament's Committee sends him an official invitation.<p>

What has prevented Milosevic from fulfilling  his promise for two years?  Indeed, what kind of Minister is Sokolovic?  What does it mean when Lilic, as a federal president, does not feel obliged to respond to a Montenegrin Parliament's written request?<p>

The tragedy in Strpci, as nothing else, has brought in question the very foundations of the local legal system and shown that in this state there are two kinds of citizens.  The first kind are the citizens of Serbian and Montenegrin nationality and the second class citizens are everyone else.  Since, it seems,  the name of a "second class" nationality in the identity papers is enough to disappear without a trace.  Jasmina Husovic, wife of abducted Rifat, said in the magazine "Liberal": "I have been given about DM20 by the state ... That is the price of a return ticket to Belgrade...  Shame on the state and its president."<p>

Although it is not known how far the authorities have got in their investigation of the abduction in Strpci, the families of the abducted and non-governmental organizations have been trying to shed some light on what happened in Strpci on 3/27/93.  The Foundation for Humanitarian Law in Belgrade maintains, based on its investigation, that a group of armed men in uniforms with chetnik insignia had been in the train number 671 since Belgrade.  Witnesses further claim that the conductor, escorted by two policemen, checked personal identification papers and wrote names on the tickets, which was justified by measures against smugglers.  Engine driver, Zeljko Radojcic stopped the train in Strpci and the signal to stop was given by the Strpci station master, Slobodan Icagic.  Apparently, no-one has questioned them so far.  However, it has been said that Icagic claimed that a group of armed soldiers forced him to stop the train.<p>

Podgorica weekly <em>Monitor</em> (8/26/94) stated that Ivica Martinovic from Vinkovci, at that time serving a year of mandatory military service at the barracks of the Yugoslav Army, "Stari aerodrom" [Old Airport], in Podgorica had also been abducted in Strpci.<p>

Allegedly, he was abducted due to an "error", since he had a "checkerboard" [Croatian coat of arms] on his documents.  He was released after less than 24 hours when it was found out that his father had died fighting against the Croatian army in Slavonia and Ivica Martinovic was returned to the barracks.  In the same issue of <em>Monitor</em> we further found out that certain Milovan Tripkovic, who had taken a part in the abduction, had been, two months after the abduction, receiving medical treatment in Zemun hospital, so called komora.  He claimed, according to <em>Monitor</em>, that an order for the "action" in Strpci had been faxed from Belgrade.  <em>Monitor</em> then asked how come it had been impossible to obtain adequate statements from Martinovic, Tripkovic, Radojcic, Icagic, the train conductor and the policemen providing escort who had inspected passenger's papers and, according to the passenger's statements, had directly taken part in the abduction, and to get the investigation going.<P>

Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs revealed, not long after the kidnapping that the link with the relevant authorities in the Republic Srpska (RS) had been established.  A member of Slobodan Milosevic's staff, told one of the desperate mothers that Dr. Radovan Karadzic had promised that he would personally see that the whole case was resolved soon.  Indeed, on 7/6/93 a statement by the RS government was received in Belgrade.  The statement said that the RS Army smashed a paramilitary unit responsible for the abduction and that the forementioned unit had been manipulated and incited by foreign counterintelligence services.  That was all.  No names of culprits, no trial, and what is most important, no indication of what happened with the abducted passengers.  Their relatives continued to visit, without results, different officials, and in the December of 1993 Montenegrin parliament formed the already mentioned bipartisan Committee.  The above mentioned Dr. Burzan's statements say enough about the results of the Committee's work.<p>

<h2>Zoran...Zoran!</h2>

<em>"Silence fell on the room as president Milosevic entered.  He stopped in front of a table.  He carefully looked at the people in the room.  I had an impression that he stopped at every person trying to remember his or hers face.  Zoran Sokolovic sat down next to him.  Minister Sokolovic looked up from the table at most twice during the two-hour-long conversation.  He did not move even when president Milosevic asked him a question.  `Zoran, did you know about the facts these people are talking about? Zoran, have you taken statements from the witnesses? Zoran, when are you going to come out with the facts? Zoran, we have the culprit' ...  Police Minister Zoran Sokolovic was mostly nodding and about that man (Lukic) he said:' President, to tell the truth, we kidnapped him.'  I am not sure but it seemed to me that president Milosevic looked at him angrily and curtly said:` Do whatever you want, but do not let him go.'<P>

What can I say, the president looked worried and convincing and the audience left feeling hopeful.  He left the impression that he personally will search heaven and earth.  He left a deep impression on me.  He did not say a single wrong word .  He carefully listened to each one of the family members of the abducted, asked questions regarding the stories and facts put forward by the relatives, expressed anger after stupid replies from the police minister..."<P>

 (Natasa Kandic about the meeting with Slobodan Milosevic)</em>

<hr>

It seemed that the abduction in Strpci had been covered up, similar to the abduction in Sjeverin, which had occurred four months earlier and when 17 Yugoslav citizens of muslim nationality had been abducted.  Then, none other but Zoran Lilic, brought it back into the public focus.  In an interview given to <em>Politika</em>, published on 8/20/94, he  stated that "certain Lukic" had been in charge of the abduction.  He was "arrested by our police in a risky operation."  Yugoslavia handed him over to the RS because it had been promised that he'd stand a trial there.  However, immediately after the extradition, the leadership of the RS "released and even rewarded him. This action clearly showed who might had been behind the abduction and that Lukic was a mere operative.  The basic idea was to provoke bloody clashes in the area around Prijepolje and Priboj, a territory with mixed population of Serb and Muslim nationality, in order to shift the war to the Serbian territory and pull Serbia and Montenegro into the war."<p>

Bozidar Vucurovic, a poet and a mayor of Trebinje reacted to this Lilic's statement. "Remembering the Strpci case," he said, "Lilic reduced himself to a level of a police station chief and that is why many in the RS cursed him."  Dr Konstantin Obradovic, an expert in international law, however thinks (<em>Vreme</em> 8/29/94) that according to the law, "certain Lukic" should have stood trial in the FRY.  Namely, according to the Yugoslav Criminal Law, Yugoslav citizens cannot be extradited.  Another question is to whom was "a certain Lukic"  extradited.  The RS has not been recognized even by the FRY and the only basis for extradition was their claim that "their judiciary will conclude the case." <p>

It seems that the Federal president used the abduction in Strpci for his own political gain.  A rift between Belgrade and Pale was growing in size at that time and the case was used as a way to spite Karadzic and his lot.  This is confirmed by the fact that the abduction has not been mentioned later and that Lilic forgot to "gladly testify" before the Montenegrin parliament's Commission and convey his insights.  Also, it became obvious that the Serb state east from the Drina river could not brush away the suspicion of being involved in the whole case.<p>

Besides, the role of "a certain Lukic" in the abduction in Strpci is rather mysterious.  His name is Milan.  According to the Foundation for Humanitarian Law, ha has been arrested several times.  His first arrest happened on 10/20/92 when he and a certain Dragicevic were caught armed in Sjeverin, immediately after the kidnapping which had occured there.  However, they were soon released.  Ministry of Internal Affairs stated that there were no grounds to keep the duo in jail and that they were found armed on the territory of the FRY "because they were in charge of arming of the army of the RS."  The following arrest occured in Serbia in march of 1993.  Lukic was accused of an attempted theft, forgery and illegal arm possession in front of the First and Third District Court in Belgrade.  He got a conditional sentence.  The third arrest happened on 4/16/93.  This time because of a suspicion that he had, in June of 1992, killed Stanko Pecikoza in Visegrad and again because of an illegal possession of arms.  The First District Court in Belgrade sentenced him on one year and three months, but the sentence was later reduced to eight months.  All in all, he spent nine months in the Pozarevac jail.  At the same time, the information that Serbia has caught the man responsible for the abduction in Strpci has surfaced.  His name was not mentioned.  Lukic's sentence expired on 4/6/94.  He was released and immediately arrested and transferred to the Solitary confinement in the Central jail in Belgrade.  This time due to a firm suspicion that he had been involved in an abduction. He was in jail until the end of April when he was released and again arrested.  The basis for this arrest was an extradition request from Pale, sent by judge Blitvic. Finally on 5/27/94, Milan Lukic was extradited to the authorities of the RS where he was released.  Judge Dobrivoje Gerasimovic signed the extradition warrant.  Federal justice minister at the time, Zoran Stojanovic, stated in the TV program "Krovovi" [roofs] on the TV station Politika that he had not known "who extradited Milan Lukic to the RS."<P>

What can be said in conclusion. Representative from the Democratic party in the Federal parliament, Miodrag Perisic, said regarding the second anniversary of the abduction in Strpci that "it is shocking" that there was a tacit agreement to keep the truth about the case away from the public.  The leader of the Serbian Radical Party, Dr. Vojislav Seselj, in his style, accuses the League of Communists - Movement for Yugoslavia of organizing the abduction in cooperation with the Counterintelligence Service.  Leading officials from the Socialist Party of Serbia, Borislav Jovic, Ivica Dacic and Goran Percevic refused to comment the case to the Belgrade news agency "Beta".<P>  

Mujo Bacic, whose son was among the kidnapped, said at the press conference in Podgorica:" It is hard for me that nothing is known about my (son's) destiny, whether he is alive or dead.  I think now and then how I would be happy if instead of these anniversaries I could celebrate my grandchild's birthday.  Many are together with us in our pain and sorrow, but the authorities do not understand.  They say that Strpci is in another state although it is known that at the time Yugoslav Army controlled the territory of Bosnia-Hercegovina as far as 30 km from the border.  This is undeniable truth which no-one is willing to admit."<p>

<hr>
<h2>Rifat Rastoder, Representative of the Families of the abducted: Authorities are Hiding a Crime</h2>

<em><strong>VREME: What have the authorities done in order to clarify the circumstances surrounding the abduction in Strpci?</strong><P>

RASTODER: Apart from the expressions of sympathy and numerous promises in the beginning, the Serbian and Montenegrin authorities, in spite of a multitude of reliable leads, until today have not done anything concrete to solve the case and hopefully save the lives of the abducted passengers.  On the contrary, they have done everything in their power to hide and cover up the crime.  This can be proven by numerous documents obtained by the relatives and several humanitarian organizations.  Is it necessary to remind of the first information issued by the news agency "Tanjug", originating from unidentified sources in the RS army, according to which nine Serbs, two Croats and two foreigners were abducted in Strpci together with the muslims?  It is obvious that from the start the goal was to "prove" that the abduction was not a genocidal crime but a plain terrorist attack.  State authorities and even the Federal government have quoted this information.  State controlled media later concocted monstrous stories about the abducted passengers, like the one published in "Pobjeda" on 3/5/93, according to which the abducted passengers were "close collaborators of the muslim forces in Bosnia."<P>

<strong>VREME: Can you tell us more about the abducted passengers?</strong><P>

RASTODER: For the benefit of the public and the integrity of the abducted and their relatives I shall repeat these facts again.  Abducted Ismet Bacic was on that fateful day on a way back from a business meeting, should I say, with Serbs, on the Zlatibor mountain, which had been arranged by his Kum [Best man, good friend] Boskovic, from Podgorica.  Esad Kapetanovic was traveling from Belgrade, where he had worked, to Bijelo Polje in order to respond to a draft notice received by his parents.  Ilijaz Licina, employed in Belgrade, intended to spend a weekend with his family in Lozna near Bijelo Polje.  According to witnesses, he had a sack of flour and food with him.  Similarly, Fehim Bekija, also employed in Belgrade, had decided to spend that weekend with his family as had Seco Softic and Jusuf Rastoder.  Rifat Husovic was on the fateful day on his way back from a visit to Belgrade.  Esad Djecevic, a minor was with him by chance.  Halil Zupcevic, a refugee from Trebinje, was returning from Belgrade, where he had been trying to obtain an emigration visa, to Rozaje.  He never made it back.  Zvjezdan Zulicic, another refugee from Bosnia, with refugee status in Serbia where he played soccer for the team in Petrovac on the Mlava river [eastern Serbia] was on the way to visit his mother's relatives in Niksic. etc. etc.  These are the so called "suspicious elements", actually innocent helpless men who were grabbed by somebody's dirty criminal hands.  Naturally, according to somebody's orders.<P>

<strong>VREME: The authorities claim that they are helpless because the abduction took place on the territory of another state?</strong><P>

RASTODER: Yes, and some international factors are beginning to accept this explanation.  Putting aside the testimonies which point out that the abduction was prepared in the train, on the way from Belgrade to Strpci, where the "chosen" passengers were only taken off the train, the important and undeniable fact is that the train station in Strpci including everything around it, tracks, buildings and employees, was and remains the property of the ZTP-Belgrade [Rail Transport Company from Belgrade], i.e. the Republic of Serbia.  This can easily be checked in the appropriate documents and is obvious from the fact that the station security was provided by the Yugoslav Army.<P>

It is enough to mention that the investigation was interrupted and a certain Lukic extradited to Bosnian Serbs.  This man was among the main suspects in the case.  How can we interpret the fact that thousands of pages of the report by the Federal Commission for crimes committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia do not mention even once the crime in Strpci?<P>

<strong>VREME:  How are the authorities treating the families of the abducted?  Have the authorities helped them financially?</strong><P>

RASTODER:  In stead of help to the families of the abducted workers and compatriots by the companies, mostly based in Belgrade, in which the majority of the abducted had worked, the termination of employment notices were sent to the families, ironically quoting failure to appear at work as a reason for firing!!!  Consequently these families lost all means of social and financial security; also, legally, the rights of the abducted employees cannot be resolved until their destiny is known.<P>

The help from the Montenegrin authorities amounted to a single payment of DM20 to each family.  No-one has been responding to appeals and demands of the families of the abducted to be told about the destiny of their loved ones.  On the other hand, specialists in the well known technique of "brain washing" have been bombarding the families with numerous confusing informations and provocations.  Everything points that another crime is being committed, this time against the families of the abducted. <P></em>

<h1>Celebic Camp</h1>

<strong><em>by Filip Svarm</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vreme, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 3/30/96</h2>

On March 20, the Hague Tribunal issued indictments for the crimes committed against
Bosnian Serbs in Celebic Camp, near Konjic.  The indictments list camp 
commander Zdravko Mucic "Pavo" (51), coordinator of the Muslim and Croat troops
in the region, Zejnil Delalic (48), deputy camp commander, Hazim Delic (31) and guard
Esad Landzo "Zenga"(23).<P>

According to the indictment, Mucic, Delalic and Delic were in charge of the
camp, all guards and other persons who had visited the camp and tortured
the prisoners between May and September 1992.  All three because of their positions
are responsible for the crimes of their subordinates - at least 14 murders, at
least seven incidents of torture, at least 5 cases in which great suffering and 
grievous harm was inflicted on the prisoners, at least three cases of inhuman
behavior (including forced felatio by prisoners) and finally, unlawful imprisonment
and imprisonment in inhuman conditions.  In addition, Mucic is charged with 
robbing the prisoners, Delalic is charged with four murders, five torture
cases and two rapes, and Landzo with five murders, four torture cases etc...<P>

On March 18, accused Mucic and Delalic were arrested in Vienna and Munich respectively.  
It seems that Delic and Landzo are still at large somewhere in the Konjic
region.  The Bosnian presidency has said that "all criminals should face
charges," and that "that is the attitude of the legal Bosnian authorities."  Bosnian
authorities also assured the Tribunal that the Delic and Landzo would also
be arrested.<P>

"This is the first, but not the last indictment for crimes committed against
Bosnian Serbs," confirmed the spokesperson of the Hague Tribunal, Christian 
Chartier.  "The indictment couldn't have been issued earlier because the
Pale and Belgrade authorities refused to cooperate with the Tribunal and 
the witnesses had to be questioned outside the former Yugoslavia."<P>

The Fund for Humanitarian Law from Belgrade gave its data and the testimonies
about the crimes in Celebic to the Hague Tribunal.  These files were used as 
a relevant information which facilitated the investigation.  From the 
Fund's documentation, <em>Vreme</em> publishes two testimonies: from the "tunnel"  
and "hangar".  The names of witnesses have been altered.<P>


<h2>Tunnel</h2>

When the war broke out in Sarajevo, I went together with my wife and children
to live with my father-in-law in the village of Brdani, near Konjic.  At that
time that area was peaceful.<P>

Around 10 o'clock on June 24, nine men dressed in camouflage uniforms broke into  
my father-in-law's house.  On their heads they wore green berets and 
introduced themselves as Policemen from the Bosnian Territorial Defense.
They took off my wedding ring and wrist watch, handcuffed and blindfolded me and 
took me to a van in which they had driven to the house.  Soon we were in the center of 
the village.  There, two more members of the "green berets" entered; those
two beat me up with a metal bar used to clean a mortar...<P>

We made frequent stops to pick up other "green berets".  All of them them 
beat me and M.S. who had been arrested together with me.  They knocked out a few
of my teeth.  They were hitting my arms and legs and using all kinds of things;
I was covered with blood.<P>

At about 2:30 p.m. we arrived to Celebic camp, a former Yugoslav Peoples
Army base.  The two of us were forced to stand against the headquarters 
building wall. There, we were taken over by the deputy commander, Hazim 
Delic.  He wanted to hear our names.  He kicked us both in the ribs
several times.  Guards took off our blindfolds and pushed us down a 
manhole.  They covered the manhole; they urinated and threw stones on us...
We spent 24 hours in that manhole.<P>

The following day, we were taken to an underground corridor in a nuclear
shelter.  There, we found another 39 prisoners, civilians from the village
of Bradina which had been burned to the ground, as I later found out from them,
between May 27 and 31, 1992.  The prisoners were exhausted and had a lot of 
injuries.  Four men from that village, whom I had known from earlier, almost
couldn't recognize me.  I was totally disfigured because of the beatings.
I was all covered with blood; my underpants were so bloody that I had to take 
them off and throw them away.  All together, there were 41 men in the tunnel.
The tunnel was 1.4 meters [5ft] wide and 24 [70ft] meters long.  It was made 
from concrete and had a slight slant.  The tunnel ended with a short flat stretch,
about 1.5 meters long.  There was one plastic bucket which was used for
urination and defecation and the flat portion of the tunnel was totally covered
with urine and full of worms.  Upon entering that corridor one
had a feeling of being in a septic tank.  When I arrived, I set down with M.S.
next to the bucket, on a bare floor.  We were very cold; they hadn't given 
us anything to cover ourselves or to sit on.  The only light came from a peep
hole on the door.<P>

They beat every evening.  Guards would bring people from a bar,
picked those prisoners they had known from earlier, and took them outside because
there was not enough space in the tunnel.  All the walls were bloody.
They would grab a prisoner by hair and hit his head against the wall.
We were afraid to look at the wall.  They forced us to drink urine and told
us that was juice.  They would divide 700 grams [1.5lb] of bread among
15 people.  They didn't let us to wash ourselves, sometimes they would not even
give us drinking water.  After me, they brought in Professor Slavko Susic.  His house
was only 100 meters from the camp.  They beat him non-stop: they took him in
front of the door, burned his tongue, beat him; they heated nails in a gas flame 
and hammered in under his nails...  We heard all of that.
They brought him in on June 27; he died on July 4 from the torture and beating 
with a baseball bat.  The guards left his corpse in a tunnel for a day.<P>

They would make us raise our arms and face the wall and than, they would beat us
with a baseball bat.  Sometimes in the tunnel, sometimes in front of the door.
Sometimes we were beaten by the guards, sometimes by the Territorial Defense
soldiers coming back from the front.  Anyone who wanted was allowed to beat us.
Not a single minute passed without a beating.<P>

Zeljko Milosevic (born in 1961) was murdered on July 19.  They found some 
documents from which they could tell that Zeljko had been trained as a sharp
shooter during his military service.  That's why they killed him.  They beat 
him, pulled out his tongue, pushed hot nails under his nails, hammered an SDS
badge into his forehead.  Once they killed him with blows and torture, they
left his body in front of the tunnel for 23 days.  They took us all out
several times to see the body and told us that we would all end up like that.<P>

I had dreamt of bread only for three days.  They did not give us food; we were
like skin and bones.  Exhausted, we would faint several times a day from
hunger and beatings.  Sometimes they would take us outside to urinate, four
of us together.  But they wouldn't let us finish: half way through it they
woudl start hitting us with a baseball bat on the kidneys...  We were beaten 
by everyone in the camp.  Deputy commander, Hazim Delic and Esad Landzo, a.k.a.
Zenga were the worst.  They called commander Mucic Pavo.<P>

I was in the tunnel in Celebici since June 24 to August 21 1992.  After that 
I was transfered to the Konjic Sport center; there were about 160 prisoners 
there.  We were maltreated, but not a lot...<P>

<h2>Hangar</h2>

In April 1992, Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) armed about 400 Serbs in the region
around Konjic.  We were told to hold the barricades near the village of Bradina
until the Army comes to our help.  However, on May 5, the army evacuated in 
helicopters from Konjic.  We were left alone.<P>

On May 25, Muslims and Croats attacked the Serb village of Bradina and surrounded 
us from all sides.  The fighters surrendered a day later because their families 
were in the village.  The attackers killed fifteen of them on the spot.
They set houses and stable on fires.<P>

They detained women and children at the school building and released them a 
day later.  Novica Kuljanin and myself managed to hide under a concrete slab.
We remained hiding for three days and then set out towards the village of Brdani.
We arrived to the village two days later and reported to the Muslim authorities.
We were in the village until June 15.  On that day, Nedzad Spego delivered
a summons to report to the Police station.  When I showed up, there were already
about 40 men, Serbs, in front of the building.  They put us in a truck and 
drove to the camp in Celebic.<P>

As we were jumping out of the truck, soldiers started swearing and
hitting us.  They took away our money and documents saying that we would
not need them in the future.  Then, they pushed about 20 of us down a 
manhole; the hole was about 5 meters deep.  After two hours we ran out 
of air. Mirko and Danilo Zivak fainted.  After out pleading, the guard
opened the manhole cover.  We had spent about five hours there; afterwards 
they took us to a hangar which had earlier been used for fuel storage.
There were already 200 people in the hangar, most of them from Bradina. 
They looked like ghosts.  Most of them had bold patches on their scalps.
All of them were covered with bruises.  They told us that 20 people had
been killed before we arrived.  The following people were killed during
the first seven days of my imprisonment: Simo Jovanovic, Scepan Gotovac,
Nedo Milosevic, Bosko Samoukic and Zeljko Klimenta a.k.a. Keljo.  They beat
them in front of the hangar.  I watched through the crack of the door; they
were hitting them with baseball bats, pieces of wood, pipes, rifle butts
and boots.  After they fainted, guard Zijo Landzo finished them off by 
hitting their heart with a hard rubber ball.<P>

We had to carry the dead into the hangar.  The guards would pin SDS badges
to their foreheads.  They would leave the corpses with us during the night.
The following morning, we would load the corpses on a truck.  They were
telling us that they were driving the corpses to the health center in order
to determine the cause of death.  Every night they were taking out about
ten people.  They beat them until they fainted.  Landzo was the worst.
One evening, he hit Jovo Draganic 250 times on his back and legs 
with a baseball bat. Jovo couldn't get up for ten days after that.<P>

Landzo would enter the hangar and force the prisoners to do ten push-ups.
Because the people were too exhausted they couldn't do it.  Then, Landzo
would kick them in the belly until they fainted.<P>

Landzo wrapped a cable around Rista Vukalo's body and set it on fire.
Risto suffered serious burns.  Landzo pushed a hot needle through
Mirko Dokic's tongue.  He hit Bosko Samoukovic with a rifle butt
in the ribs and killed him.  He especially liked lighting gunpowder
on prisoner's bodies.  He put a hot knife into Momo Kuljanin's hand.
Momo had a huge blister over the whole palm and fingers for two weeks
after that.<P>

One night, Hazim Delic, the deputy commander took five of us outside
and lined us against the wall, to be shot.  He turned on car headlights
and spoke with someone in the dark for a long time.  He asked for our 
last wish and then called the guards.  He ordered them to aim and shoot.  
They shot above our heads. Nedeljko Grigorevic fainted.  Then Delic 
ordered us to stand there for two hours.  In the meantime they shot
several times above our heads.<P>

Pavo Mucic, the camp commander, entered the hangar one day and ordered
a handful of prisoners to turn toward the wall and raise their arms.
Then he kicked their lower back, around kidneys.  Most guards were lower class
young guys from Konjic.  I remember some of them: Kemo Mrndzic, Salko,
Kravar, Edo, Nermin Zilic...<P>

For a month and a half we were getting a peace of bread, three times a
day.  At times we would go without food for 55 hours.  From exhaustion, 
people were unable to turn over, let alone stand up.  We were given water
when they considered that we were thirsty.  Ten prisoners had to share
a 1.5 liter water bottle.  In the hangar, there was a canal full of garbage,
from which rats were coming out all the time.  For several days, we had slept on 
bare concrete; later we were given old uniforms to sleep on.  We were not allowed
to bathe.  I had to scrape dirt off myself.<P>

Twice, they brought Verica and Mira, two retarded girls from Konjic.
They stripped and trashed them in front of the prisoners.<P>

Zejnil Delalic (who had donated a lot of money for the Muslim army) and 
Hazim Delic brought Arab journalists to the camp.  A journalist from
 Sarajevo TV joined the group.  They filmed as the guards were beating
us.  In front of the cameras, we had to testify that we had raped, 
slaughtered and killed.  Zoran Mrkajic didn't say everything they had
told him and was beaten for three days after that.<P>

During August we were visited thrice by an International Red Cross team.
After their first visit, about ten guards led by Hazim Delic burst into
the hangar.  They kicked every prisoner in the kidneys.  After that
we refused to cooperate with the Red Cross.  I think they understood
what was going on.  They visited again 20 days later.  After their second
visit, the beatings subsided.<P>

<h1>Strategy of Flirt</h1>

<strong><em>by Ljiljana Smajlovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vreme, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 4/6/96</h2>

<em>"I have been living for 37 years in the Christian environment in atheistic
Europe, living among a handful of scared Muslims, in the atmosphere of lies 
and hypocrisy.  My permanent and open Islamic orientation, in the midsts of 
a communist country, the lack of basic conditions for living and daily humiliation
are the reasons for my decision to leave my home and homeland and emigrate to
Iran."<P>
Meliha Salihbegovic<br>
in her letter to Imam Hommeini, July '82</em><P>

In the pre-war multicultural and multiconfessional Bosnia-Hercegovina, Sarajevo
writer Meliha Salihbegovic was sent in 1983 because of these words straight to 
jail.  The quote is taken from her private letter to Imam Hommeini from 1982,
which in the hands of then Bosnian judicial organs turned into one of the 
crucial pieces of evidence in "the process to Muslim fundamentalists" in Sarajevo
in 1983.  In the warrant for the start of investigation against Meliha Salihbegovic
, issued on March 29, 1983, and signed by investigative judge Abdulah Hadzikaric, 
Ms. Salihbegovic was accused that, between January '80 and March '83, "through
numerous contacts with Alija Izetbegovic, with whom she had lived for a time
in a sharia [Islamic] marriage," she expressed her nationalistic and panislamist
beliefs, glorified the Islamic revolution in Iran and Imam Hommeini.<P>

Those were the dark ages in Bosnia, when Alija Izetbegovic, Omer Behmen, 
Hasan Cengic, Edhem Bicakcic, Husein Zivalj and Ismet Kasumagic (let us only 
mention those accused from the process in 1983 who in the spring of 1990
founded the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] and who have until today remained on
important positions in this political party and Bosnian state) were accused of 
conspiring with the enemy because they had planned to travel to Iran (the
indictment states that "they tried to establish contacts with the institutions
from foreign countries in order to obtain assistance") and because all of them,
except for Alija Izetbegovic, had secretly traveled to Iran in order to take part
in the celebration of the anniversary of the Islamic revolution and the congress
of unification of Sunnis and Shias in Iran, between January 2 and 14, 1983;
their passports were not stamped in hope that in that way they would avoid "complications
in a socialist environment."<P>

Today, it is hard to say with any confidence how much publicity the process
to "the Muslim fundamentalists" or "Young Muslims" received in the Bosnian 
public at the time.  The public knew at the time, although one wasn't allowed
to say that in public, that in Bosnia [the authorities] had been always working
on a so called political balance between the three nations and nationalisms and
 that all three had to be accounted for at all times, both on official positions
 and in prisons.  The public at that time, of course, wasn't able to judge the
 secret Islamic Declaration written by Alija Izetgbegovic, but the accusation
 of betrayal of their own country to Hommeini made quite a splash, moreover
 because the accused didn't deny that they had traveled to Iran although
they denied counter-revolutionary actions.<P>

The Sarajevo process from 1983 has in the meantime been unmasked as a show trial
to the people whose fundamental "sin" was that they didn't believe and think in 
the way that the authorities demanded from them.  Nevertheless, the "Iranian 
connection" still haunts the Iranian travelers from 1983.  The Teheran guests, together with their supporter
who stayed in Sarajevo, Alija Izetbegovic, are today again on the bench for 
the accused, although the circumstances are somewhat different this time.  All of them
are on important positions in the party and state (Omer Behmen, vicepresident 
of the SDA at the time when the party was founded, is today the ambassador
in Teheran) and constitute the so called hawkish wing of the SDA.  All of them 
influence the decisions important for the fate of the country; at this time 
it seems that the most difficult decision facing the Bosnian Muslim authorities
is the decision about the fate of several dozens of  Iranian fighters, widely
known as "Mojahedeen" who had fought in Bosnia on the side of the Bosnian Army.
The Dayton agreement stipulated that all foreign fighters were supposed to leave
Bosnia by the end of January this year.  Bosnian government has claimed several 
times so far that it had fulfilled this requirement from Dayton, but the NATO
calmly responded every time that that wasn't true; one one occasion NATO obtained
material evidence for its claims by arresting three Iranian citizens after the
capture of a terrorist camp near Fojnica.<P>

Bosnian stake in this game of nerves is enormous, but all trump cards are in the 
hands of NATO alliance and Washington.  Sarajevo had waged a difficult battle
throughout the war in order to lift the arms embargo and gain rights to the American
assistance in arming and training of the Bosnian army.  Furthermore, the Bosnian 
delegation swallowed quite a few bitter pills in Dayton only with the help of
water sweetened by promises that the U.S.A. would train and equip its army.<P>

In this moment, Bosnia is separated from that important and significant goal
by fifty or sixty Iranian fighters in its territory.  At least Alija Izetbegovic
acknowledges that many in his latest statement on this topic given to Bosnian
weekly <em>Ljiljan</em>.<P>

It seems that the Americans have made to Izetbegovic an offer he cannot refuse,
but he is still hesitating.  Washington has firmly decided and publicly stated
that the arming and training of the Bosnian Army will only start after all 
Iranians have left, and they are still there.  Probably not for long, since
Izetbegovic has opened a door to compromise by admitting that Iran, which 
indeed proved to be the real friend of Bosnia, "is far away, while our enemy 
is very near."<P> 

Therefore, Sarajevo is hesitating to give in to American conditions, but it 
would be wrong to interpret that hesitation with the immaturity of the
Bosnian regime, its ideological dependence on Teheran, blind loyalty to
the participants of the Islamic revolution or some kind of religious fanaticism.
The sources of that hesitation are complex and related to the role that Bosnia
has (or intends to attain) in the world Islamic community.<P>

Since his first steps on the international scene, Alija Izetbegovic has patiently
built a specific position for Bosnia-Hercegovina among the Islamic countries.  As 
early as July 1991, when Yugoslavia was still "alive" and nine months before
Bosnian independence, Izetbegovic requested that Bosnia-Hercegovina attend the next
conference of the Ministers of foreign relations from Islamic countries, which
would take place in Turkey.  That action caused some commotion in the three-party 
coalition which at the time ruled Bosnia [SDA, HDZ and SDS].  On July 19, 1991, <em>Oslobodenje</em>
asked Izetbegovic whether he had requested the member status for Bosnia, to what
he responded:" In a certain sense that is true, but we all know that, according
to the Statute, Bosnia-Hercegovina cannot be a member of this organization.  Only
internationally recognized Muslim countries can be the members of that organization.
However, some organizations, groups and parties can also be members of that
organization."  It is a well known fact that in the Islamic world three countries
with three different models of state organization and role of religion in the society
are fighting for the supremacy among the Muslims. Those countries are Iran,
Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  Alija Izetbegovic managed to achieve that each one
of these three countries tries to gain his favor and the favor of his Bosniaks.
He has flirted with each one of them, while he managed not to cast his lot
with any one of them. He has received direly necessary aid from all three of them,
always keeping open the possibility that he would in the end ally with only 
one of them.<P> 

Extremely important part of that strategy was the continuous insistence of Sarajevo
that everything happening to the Muslims in Bosnia was exclusively the result of 
their religion, that the world wouldn't tolerate a genocide against the members
of any one of Christian sects, that the Muslims in Bosnia were suffering because 
of Islam and therefore, for Islam.  Magazine <em>Ljiljan</em>, whose editor-in-chief
is Dzemaludin Latic, former professor at the Sarajevo Islamic college (another
one of the SDA founders and accused in the 1983 process), provides 
plentiful evidence about the pretensions of the Izetbegovic's Bosnia to play a
messianic role as the unifier of the Islamic world.  For example, in March 1995,
Resid Hafizovic wrote that "Bosnia and the Bosniaks have unified the whole of 
the Muslim world...  Because of that we hope that Bosnia and the Bosniaks will
in the future transform the collective consciousness of the Muslim world and 
fundamentally transform the relations between the Muslim East and European west.
[The Muslim world] has been yearning  to cast away its spiritual,
economic and military-political subordination imposed by the Christian 
neocolonialist Europe which is today directed by the blood-thirsty governments in
Paris, London and Moscow."  In the latest issue of <em>Ljiljan</em> the president
of Bosnia has the following to say on that topic:" When we talk about allies,
my answer is that both the U.S.A. and the Islamic peoples should be on our side,
and if possible the whole world."  As a sign of recognition, among other to his 
statesmanship, it should be said that Bosnia is very close to that goal.  
Bosnian president has done everything possible to gain the support of the whole
world, not only Islamic countries.  Finally, after all, he will do as he must, 
in order to avoid loosing the support of the U.S.A.<P>

At the time Serb grenades provided a miracle which homogenized the Muslim 
population in Bosnia.  That is the origin of that famous American statement
about the secular Bosnian population who was "pushed into Islam by grenades."  
American blackmail is now on the way to complete that process and unite all 
Bosniaks, even those  who don't have a particularly good reason to be happy 
about the presence of "Mojahedeen" in Bosnia.<P>

<h1>Disappointed People</h1>
                
<strong><em>by Perica Vucinic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vreme, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 5/11/96</h2>

The Republic of Kosovo exists only in the heads, hearts, desires and souls 
of Albanians.  In reality, the Republic of Kosovo doesn't exist.  In order to 
become a real state, Kosovo must have authorities which control its 
territory, issue passports, personal documents, the authorities which have
their borders, customs, army, police, judicial system...  to have everything that
makes a state;  Albanians don't have that.  Albanians have built a so called 
parallel system in education, culture and sport; this system ensures that
a part of our children don't waste time hanging out at street corners but that
they try to acquire some knowledge.  That parallel system is only a shadow
of our aspirations.  The same is true for our republic.<P> 

<strong>What would you do if you were the leader of the Albanian national 
movement?</strong><P>

I would transform the whole political process.  I would put tactics before
strategy.  I wouldn't insist on us having a republic, but would try to implement
in practice that which our people voted for in the 1991 referendum: that Kosovo
should be an independent, sovereign republic.<P>

<strong>How would you do that?</strong><P>

In the same manner in which that is usually done in the world: by exploiting
all methods at disposal of a civilized people, by mobilizing the whole nation,
by liberating and recovering those things which were taken away from us in 1989.
That would require sacrifices, but those sacrifices would be much smaller than 
those we have already suffered until now; I think that the Albanians have, since
1990, lost a lot.  Almost 500,000 people have left Kosovo because of terror and
our education, culture, economic and financial institutions have been stifled.
We are a people which lives at the edge of survival.<P>

<strong>Your answer shows that you support a more extreme approach.  You've been
accused of being the inspiration behind more radical currents within the 
Albanian block...</strong><P>

There are two limits I don't want to cross: neither a bloody conflict, a war, 
nor a capitulation.  That means that everything between these two extreme options
is a part of the political scene to which I belong.   My "extremism" is only
extreme for those who are not willing to risk anything but are simply waiting
for events to resolve by themselves.<P>

The fact that some accuse me of extremism, as in a part of the Belgrade press
these days, is another proof that here anyone can shoot you like in a jungle.
Here, Albanians are unprotected, like animals in a jungle; therefore,
you can be assassinated through the papers, there's no one to object to.
If there were the rule of law in this state no one would dare claim that Demaqi
was an agent in Sigurimi [secret police in Stalinist Albania].<P>

I don't have enough information to be able to speculate who is responsible
for the events from the last ten days of April [terrorist attacks on Serbian
policemen and civilians].  I cannot agree with the theory that these attacks
were staged by Serbs: Albanians have much more motivation to stage these attacks
because they are angry and desperate;  since they are unable to express this
anger through institutional channels some Albanians are prepared to do anything
at all in order to change something.<P>

<strong>Do you think that these groups have support from abroad?</strong><P>

These groups are groups of disappointed men and women.  It is hard to guess
from which circles these people come from, since the apathy has spread through
all levels of the society.  There are a lot of people who had illusions that
the world, USA or Europe, would fix everything for us in a month or two.<P>

These gullible people are likely to go from one extreme to another.  I've
always known that no one would serve us anything on a plate.  Having in mind
the rights of Serbs, I believe that we should try to negotiate with them first
and try to point out to them that they can only protect their interests if they
take into account our interests.<P>

<strong>In your opinion, what should Albanians do at this moment?</strong><P>

At this moment, Albanians should abandon multiparty politics, since political
parties only fragment people.  They are wasting a lot of energy at internal
struggle.  It turned out that the Albanians are the wisest people in the world,
wiser that English, wiser than the French;  when these two peoples were in great
danger they united all of their forces until they won a victory.  Albanians must 
not  be wiser than the others.  Multiparty system hasn't produced tangible results
so far.  We should abandon it and unite all our resources.  That way, we 
would form a force which would convince the Serbian regime that we are not joking.<P>

<strong>But then, you wouldn't have democracy...</strong><P>

This is a fake democracy;  we can say whatever we like, but we have reached the point
at which Albanians have no school, no culture, no economy, nothing to eat.
This kind of democracy is ridiculous, a caricature.  Our situation today is worse than
Tito's dictatorship and his totalitarian regime.<P> 

<strong>What in your opinion should Serbia do?</strong><P>

Serbia should wake up and draw conclusions from what happened with Bosnia-Hercegovina;
she should realize what has changed in the world's attitude towards it and not 
allow for that to happen again;  if Albanians are brought to the situation that they
have to defend their essence they will act the way Bosnians did;  they tried
to avoid the war, but were pushed into it.  Therefore, Serbia, as the stronger
side, as the side responsible for all those massacres and this tragedy, whose
regime destroyed former Yugoslavia, Serbia must stop, think and talk to Albanians
openly, so that we can see what we can do together.<P>

<strong>Why don't Albanians take part in Serbian elections?</strong><P>

If the Albanians took part in elections they would accept their slavery.
They would win at most 30 places in a 250 member parliament, they would be
outvoted and couldn't do anything in order to protect their essence.  
As it turned out in Macedonia and the communes within Serbia, 
it is always possible to find ways to enact laws against Albanian interests.
We know that Albanians, if they entered the Parliament could, together with
the opposition, bring down the Milosevic regime.  But the irony is that
those weak parties are making offers which are worse than Milosevic's
promises.  In fact, Milosevic does what the opposition thinks.  He is a lesser
evil compared with what the opposition intends to do.  Let me not mention
Seselj.  All of them agree that Albanians should be given some sort of minority 
rights and that's it.  Our political platform is to seek equal status with Serbs.

<h1>Hayfever</h1>
                
<strong><em>by Jovan Dulovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vreme, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, July 6, 1996</h2>

The trial against Dr. Zoran Dindic, the president of the Democratic Party, and Dragoljub
BIjelic, editor-in-chief of the Belgrade daily <em>Telegraf</em>, started last
Tuesday in the Belgrade District Court.  Both of them stand accused of defaming
the Republic of Serbia, which in practice means that they have publicly mocked
Serbian Prime Minister, Mirko Marjanovic.  According to the indictment, Dr.
Dindic in January 1996 published a paid advertisement in <em>Telegraf</em> in 
which he claimed that Mr. Marijanovic had used his position to promote his
commercial interests.  "As the president of the Democratic Party, Dr. Dindic
had ordered the composition of the advertisement which he consequently approved 
and under the title 'Mr. Marijanovic, do not steal our people's bread!' had published
 in <em>Telegraf</em> on January 24," states the indictment.  Public 
Prosecutor claims that editor-in-chief composed the title for the front page
which read: "Through barter of Serbian wheat for Russian gas, Marijanovic
earned DM 200 million and left Serbia without bread".<P>

Mr. Marijanovic was not present at the trial, since he hadn't been summoned
by the court, but his spirit was nevertheless present in the courtroom.(...)<P>

At the start of the trial the Judge reminded Dr Zoran Dindic that he had said during
the investigation that he had been sentenced only once (in a political trial)
while the records showed that he had been actually sentenced twice.  "That is 
true.  In 1974, I took Aristotle's book Metaphysics from a bookstore without
paying for it.  You know, some prefer books, others wheat," responded Dindic
making an allusion to Mr. Marjanovic's wheat exports.<P>

<strong>Controversial Report</strong>: After that, the Judge informed the accused
and their lawyers that a day before the beginning of the trial District Public
Prosecutor had supplied the Court with reports (some of them from the Serbian 
Directorate for Strategic Reserves), which probably refute the claims published
in <em>Telegraf</em>.  This caused a reaction by the accused and their six lawyers.
"We haven't had a chance to examine these reports which had been provided outside
the public hearing," said lawyer Strahinja Kastratovic and continued: "It is an
unprecedented and shameful that a Public Prosecutor would secretly and outside
public hearing seek out and procure evidence whose authenticity we find doubtful.
Does the Prosecutor think that we are so naive that we will believe that those
reports hadn't been fabricated?  These documents have been planted by the Prosecutor
and we consider that those documents do not exist and should be returned
to the Prosecutor as his personal documents; we believe that the documents
have been provided in order to expedite the trial and pass a sentence today
or tomorrow or at the latest two weeks from today."<P>

After a short discussion, the Court decided not to exclude the reports from
the trial documentation.  "Whether the reports will be used as evidence will
be determined later," said the Judge.<P>

<strong>Symbol</strong>:  After that, Dr. Dindic spent a long time, almost 
four hours, speaking about what motivated him to publish the advertisement
in <em>Telegraf</em>, supplying the documentation consisting of news reports,
and statements by Mr. Marjanovic and other Ministers, as well as various 
officials and traders, to illustrate the confusion and chaos which followed
the export of wheat.  The indictment specifies that in the advertisement
"it was said that the Prime Minister had bought 1 million tons of wheat for
export at the price for $160 per ton, while the price in Romanian port 
Constanta was $200 per ton, that the Prime Minister had forced the Reserves
Directorate to accept Russian gas as a payment for the wheat (Mr. Marjanovic
has exclusive rights for the import of gas) at the price which is 50 percent
higher than the world market price; hence, without effort, risk or invested
capital, only thanks to his position and his political bosses, Mirko Marjanovic
earned in one operation $130 million."<P>

Dr. Dindic explained that in the advertisement Mr. Marjanovic was a symbol for the
links between Serbian government, companies "Progres" and "Progresgas trejding"
and the Republican Directorate for Strategic Reserves.  "In the advertisement
Mr. Marijanovic was not mentioned as the Prime Minister, but as a symbol of
the universal monopoly," said Dr. Dindic and added that "instead of starting
an investigation in order to find out what happened with the wheat, the 
Prosecutor defends the chief monopoly holder, Mr. Marjanovic."  All in all,
according to Dr. Dindic, various documents and facts clearly point out that
Serbian wheat is the subject of speculations, that the data are not correct,
that the shortage of flower in Serbia is imminent, that Serbian government
Ministers make decisions about the fate of wheat while at the same time they
are the directors of largest companies and the have the monopoly because they
issue the permits for export and import.<P>

Hence, at the time when the advertisement was published, the shortage of flour
was looming over Serbia.  Fortunately, "Progres" did not export all 1 million 
tons of wheat, partly because of the Democratic party advertisement which 
provoked a heated reaction by the public and panic among the exporters.<P>

It is significant, said Dr. Dindic that some individuals who publicly spoke 
about the wheat have been dismissed; for example Minister of Agriculture
Ivko Donovic, Director of the Republican Directorate for Strategic Reserves
Matic and the Governor of the Bank of Yugoslavia, Dragoslav Avramovic...<P>

<strong>Anchored Ship</strong>:  The campaign in government controlled media
was especially interesting: Serbian television (RTS), "Politika", "Vecernje
Novosti" published identical anonymous articles, obviously by the same author
and with the obvious intention to hide and distort the facts, emphasized Dr.
Dindic.  The advertisement in <em>Telegraf</em> was published to inform the public
about the catastrophic situation in Serbia.  Every reader of the advertisement
must have understood good intentions behind the advertisement, whose purpose
was definitively not to slander nor defame Mr. Marjanovic, also said Dr. Dindic
at the trial.  As a curiosity, Dr. Dindic showed the Court the news item published
in papers on January 22, 1996, which stated that the Federal Commerce Inspectors
had stopped on the Danube barges with wheat belonging to "Progres" because
the exporters, "Progres" (director Mr. Marjanovic), "C Market" and "Investkorp"
hadn't paid for the wheat to the Republican Directorate for Strategic Reserves,
as had been stipulated in the export contract. Former Governor of the 
Yugoslav National Bank (NBJ), Dragoslav Avramovic, never received an answer to his
many times repeated question: what happened with 1 million tons of wheat, i.e.
DM 200 million; NBJ never registered foreign currency inflow resulting form 
wheat exports.<P>

Dr. Dindic and his lawyers undoubtedly have a difficult task since they have to
prove that the statements published in the Democratic Party advertisement are
true.  However, it is obvious that the Court has received an order "from above"
to speed up the trial, as was the case with trial against NIN journalist
Vesna Kostic.  She was sued by the Prime Minister because she had
written that business people estimated that the Prime Minister had at least
DM 40 million.  Without an indictment or summons to appear at the Court,
Ms. Kesic was arrested early in the morning and immediately delivered to
the Court, to be given a conditional sentence.<P>

It is also interesting that the District Public Prosecutor yesterday spent 
a lot of time on the phone.  Justice Minister, Republican Public Prosecutor and 
numerous other officials showed intense interest in the trial developments.
It seems that many are afraid that Prime Minister's expectations will not
be met which could cause an early dismissal.<P>

The courtroom was full.  In the audience we noticed Vesna Pesic [President of
Serbian Civic Council, an opposition party], Nikola Milosevic, Parliament
deputies from opposition parties and several foreign observers.  It is
interesting that the Public Prosecutor had no questions.  As if the sentence
has already been passed.  The trial continues [in early September, 
Dr. Dindic was found guilty and given a suspended two months jail sentence].

"I received an anonymous threat that, unless I released Miljkovic from jail before midnight that day, my house and my family would be blown up," Radojko Martinovic, president of the District Court in Kragujevac, said in his statement for Telegraf.  He added: "threats don't scare me; I've been in this profession for 30 years."  The threat, of course, couldn't have originated from Miljkovic, since he was in jail, but the court president leaves open a possibility that the threat might have come from "one of his people."<P>

Judge's house, fortunately, hasn't been blown up, but the arrest of Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as "Miljko" or "Lugar", the first individual indicted for war crimes by the Hague Tribunal for War Crimes in the former Yugoslavia, produced as much excitement in Kragujevac as an explosion.  If you recall, according to the Hague Tribunal indictment, Miljkovic is accused of "ordering execution of 16 prisoners, Muslims and Croats, in Bosanski Samac, and of personally murdering three persons and beating up seven prisoners"(The accused Miljkovic, in an interview published in our paper a few weeks ago, denied all claims from the indictment).<P>

<hr>

<h2>Jail Interview: Slobodan Miljkovic</h2>

<strong>Mr. Miljkovic, were you involved in racketeering?</strong><P>

What racketeering, it has nothing to do with racketeering.  They needed an excuse to put me behind the bars and facilitate my extradition to the Hague.  The circumstances were such that they managed to find a person who owed me some money and set up an alleged racket.  If I were really involved in that, I wouldn't have had a legal contract and would have tried to avoid witnesses.  I've heard that that poor guy Mladenovic owes more money than he weighs, so he thought that he could write off the money he owes me in by putting me in jail.  Regardless of the verdict, he owes me that money and will have to pay it back.<P>

<strong>Did the bomb threat to the Court president come from you?</strong><P>

Please!  I am in jail and according to the prison rules, I cannot get in touch with my children, wife and parents, let alone send threats to someone.  Especially over the phone.<P>

<strong>One of your men might have done it?</strong><P>

I have a lot of friends in different professions, all over the country.  Before the war I had a road transport company and traveled all over the country; during the war I have fought with people from all over the country.  Nevertheless, knowing all those people, I am certain that none of them would have made that kind of a threat, simply because they know that by doing that, they would be making my position more difficult.<P>

<strong>Are there some indication that you will be extradited to the Hague?</strong><P>

Absolutely.  I will be extradited in the same way I ended up on the Richard Goldstone's list of shame.  Unfortunately, that shameful list was written in Belgrade.  I don't feel sorry for myself but I feel sorry that, because of the cowardly attitude of my country and its leaders, my innocent children will have to be branded with my alleged crimes.<P>

<strong>There are rumors that you know a lot.  Will you talk if extradited?</strong><P>

It is true that I know a lot; they tried to silence me twice already, with bullets.  I survived two assassination attempts.  In any case, if they send me alive to the Hague and if I have to set the accounts straight, I will talk.  That will be very unpleasant for some people, but I have saved the evidence...  I haven't betrayed my country, it has betrayed me.<P>

<hr><P>

However, Slobodan Miljkovic, hasn't been arrested as a war criminal but because of alleged racketeering.  According to the indictment, Miljkovic, together with Ljubisa Jovanovic, a restaurateur from Kragujevac, was detained because, at the beginning of October, the two of them "with use of force and threats, forced Nebojsa Mladenovic, owner of a private business from Kragujevac, to make a contract with the accused Miljkovic for a loan of 30,000 dinars, in order to obtain the ownership rights for the property valued at 21,140 dinars."  According to the indictment, Slobodan Miljkovic and Ljubisa Jovanovic committed the crime of "attempted extortion" following the orders of Miomir Arsic, the owner of a private company, accused for "the incitement for extortion..."<P>

The events which led to the indictment started at the pub "Kod Sinise" in the Kragujevac township of Erdoglija, where, according to the indictment, all three accused and the plaintiff Mladenovic had a meeting.  Mladenovic was ordered to pay 5,000 dinars by the end of that week, and to pay the rest a few days after that.  On October 13, on the invitation of the accused, Mladenovic came to the offices of "MOO Tursa" and met Miljkovic, Jovanovic and Arsic.  After several (bomb) threats and a short beating, Mladenovic phoned his lawyer Ratko Jovanovic; the contract was signed in the presence of the lawyer.<P>

Slobodan Miljkovic's defense, lawyers Tatomir Lekovic, Radmilo Pantovic and Zvonko Markovic, believe that there are a lot of inconsistencies in this case and that the indictment will not stand in the court; lawyer Tatomir Lekovic sees a different motive behind the whole case: "This is actually a preparation and an introduction to Miljkovic's extradition to the Hague."  One should view the threats directed at the court president in light of these facts: "obviously, the goal of threats was to make the position of the accused more difficult."<P>

According to the press, Miljkovic is the fourth on the Richard Goldstone's list, immediately behind Karadzic, Mladic and Martic.  Lekovic claims that it is not a coincidence that the first person indicted by the Hague Tribunal comes from Kragujevac, the town in which Germans carried out an infamous and barbarian massacre of civilians [in World War II]...  It is not a coincidence that Slobodan Miljkovic, several times wounded war veteran who has been assassinated twice since he returned from the [Bosnian] Posavina front, has been chosen for a scapegoat.  It is not a coincidence that he was arrested at the time when, in the USA, the negotiations are being carried out behind the closed doors.  There are no coincidences.<P>

<hr><P>

Momir Arsic stated the following for <em>Telegraf</em>:  "This is a farce.  I didn't 'hire' Miljkovic, and there was no beating; if Mladenovic had been beaten he wouldn't have reported the incident.  Mladenovic owes money both to me and to Miljkovic and he used the situation in order to write off his debts.  He chose Miljko because of the Hague."<P>

<h1>Radovan Karadzic's State of Republic Address</h1>


<h2>Telegraf, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 4/16/96</h2>


It is my duty to give you an assessment of the current situation and
the strategic goals of our Republic and the short, middle and long term
strategies for achieving these goals.<P>

Five years have passed since the first multi party elections in the former 
Bosnia-Hercegovina, four years and three months since the founding of
the Republic and four years since the beginning of the war.<P>

There are few nations in the world who were exposed to such trials and 
suffering in such a short period as our people has been.  Centuries and
decades which our enemies had spent working on the de-nationalization
of the Serbs west from the Drina and on their separation from the mother 
Serbia and Montenegro reached their culmination in the destruction of 
Yugoslavia and the formation of new nations which hadn't existed before.  
New world order used the rich anti Serb heritage of the Catholic, Islamic
and Communist international, strongly trying to submerge the Serb people west
from the Drina into new nations and turn it into an ethnic minority, in Croatia,
or a part of a new Bosniak nation, of the Kallay type, in Bosnia.<P>

In one moment, at the end of 1991 and the beginning of 1992, it seemed that the
international community understood the situation caused by the 
destruction of Yugoslavia, and realized that the Serbs in the then Bosnia,
since they had been pulled out of Yugoslavia against their will, had a
right to their own state, at least within the framework of some confederal
Bosnia.<P>

The result of that was the Lisbon Conference, which was mediated by the
representatives of the European Community, today European Union, Lord
Carrington and ambassador Jose Cutilhero.  On March 18 1992, at the time
when the regular and irregular Croatian forces were taking new Serb lives,
the Lisbon agreement was reached by the three constitutive communities in
Bosnia and the international community, i.e. European Union.  That agreement
recognized our right to a separate state, based on an ethnic principle, with
recognition of other, above all geographic, and economic principles.<P>

The significance of the Lisbon Agreement was much larger than it sometimes
seems.  Before the recognition of independent Bosnia-Hercegovina, 
the Republic of Srpska was recognized as a condition for that recognition.
This Parliament had established Srpska two months before the Lisbon Agreement,
under the name of Srpska [Serb] Republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  That 
recognition  within the scope of the Lisbon Agreement was the recognition of
our centuries old historic national rights, and came as a result of the 
legal political struggle of the Serb deputies in the Bosnian Parliament and the
support of all patriotic forces in the former Bosnia and our motherland 
and Serb Krajina.  That was a legitimate political struggle in front of the
eyes of our whole people, based on its support and its prodding.  That was the most
painful compromise and concession that one nation can make, which we did not
accept but were forced to accept: the fact that that confederal Bosnia would
not be a part of Yugoslavia.  Whenever the Serb historic territories were not
in the same state with Serbia, Serbs were the victims of a genocide, which
was also confirmed in this war.<P>

Everyone knows who broke already achieved Agreement and under whose influence
[Alija Izetbegovic broke the Agreement after being promised USA support
by the then American ambassador in Belgrade, Zimmerman].  The result was a 
war, which could have easily been avoided.  There are a lot of similarities 
between the Dayton and Lisbon agreements.  Why had we been fighting for four
years?  Will those responsible for the failure of the Lisbon agreement which
caused the war be condemned by the Court of justice and history?  Will they
break another agreement and again cause a war?  Can we trust them?  Our 
people must not rely on international justice and the judgment of history,
since history is full of tragic examples of destruction of whole nations.
In order to survive, nations must fight at the cost of great losses.<P>

Regardless of whether those guilty for this war will be tried, we shall always
hold them responsible and will never forget what they did to us.<P>

However, we shall never allow that the Lisbon Agreement and the responsibility
of the international factors for its failure be forgotten.  Because of that
we reject all accusations that we were the aggressor and that we won this
state in armed struggle.  We won our state through legitimate political means,
the international community offered a solution which recognized our state
without armed struggle and that cannot be neglected, neither from a historical
nor legal point of view.  We must never let the international factors off the hook
and allow them to forget that which they recognized and offered before
the war and without struggle, push that into oblivion and avoid the 
responsibility for the war.<P>

Three weeks after the recognition of our state, we were forced to defend it
with arms.  Our armed struggle and the defense of the state and the people
are among the brightest examples of knightly self-sacrifice.  During the 
struggle, other related and friendly peoples confirmed that we were a unique
example of the defense of freedom and dignity to other small and endangered
nations.  But only our people knows the price for this honor.  Thousands of 
the most handsome and most promising Serb men died in this fight for survival.<P>

We fought against huge powers.  Against a more numerous and better equipped enemy.
Against the immeasurable industry of lies.  Against the interests of the most
powerful world powers.  We also fought against our weaknesses, and regional
and ideological divisions.  We fought with support from the whole Serbdom, and
often with painful attacks and lack of understanding from the most unexpected
sides.  The people was on our side, and the God was on our side.<P>

The results of our struggle were historic, and would be for any other nation.
The highest goal of any nation is a sovereign state.  Even in this moment,
many peoples in Africa and Asia are dying for that dream, the dream which we 
fulfilled relatively quickly; because of that, some peoples mention our name
with respect.<P>

Our goal was, and remains, the united state of all Serbs; still, even the Republic 
of Srpska, since it was established in the struggle against huge odds, is
a significant achievement on that road and will always be mentioned in the
history of the Serb nation.  We saved our people from a genocide and secured
a significant portion of its historic territories.  Some precious territories
we didn't include in our state, and we will never accept that that loss is
definitive, but we will not continue armed struggle for their return to our
sovereignty.  The exodus of the people from those territories was not 
caused by the Srpska authorities, but by the clear historic experience and
memory of our people which confirms that we cannot survive under the enemy
regimes in Zagreb and Sarajevo.  We have no right to demand from our people to
stay on those territories which were left outside Srpska and which for now
remain under foreign rule.  We are convinced that our people is more precious than
our territories.  We can only guarantee the freedom and democracy to our people in
our state.  I repeat, when we were living under foreign rule we were exterminated.
It is understandable that the Church and the nation grieve the loss of centuries
old territories and eparchies, bit we should remembers ravines to which we 
had been thrown every time when those territories were not under our rule.<P>

What is our duty in the future?  Which historic tasks are in front of us in 
the near and far future?  Often, we hear complaints that Serb national program
doesn't exist.  I believe that every Serb child knows what are the natural
Serb goals, but the Serb national program is still something more than a list
of Serb natural yearnings.  It must contain the goals and point out
the means and forces which can be used in order to achieve those goals.<P>

However, the Serb people in Srpska can not write that program without the
rest of the Serb nation.  That is the historic obligation of the whole
Serbdom, above all in the mother republics of Serbia, Montenegro and the 
Republic of Srpska, but also that part of Serbdom which is scattered all over
the world in emigration, that part of Serbdom which we have until recently 
irresponsibly rejected.<P>

<h2>Immediate Surroundings and the International Position of RS</h2>

The international community started the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina in order 
to annul the results  of the Lisbon Agreement, in order to force the Serbs 
living west from the Drina to accept a new nation and to have another war 
which would allow it to gain a foothold for NATO in the Balkans.<P>

That very same international community created and imposed the Dayton 
Agreement in order to stop that war, and used different means in order 
to impose the solution which it wanted to achieve through the war:
the formation of a new state, a nation, Bosnia-Hercegovina.  No matter,
how much the Dayton Agreement was imposed and no matter how unjust it 
might be, we refuse to wage war and want to implement that Agreement.
Unfortunately, international factors are making new efforts to change
the Dayton Agreement during implementation and through new interpretations
at the Serb expense; for example, during only one night, in Washington,
while transposing the borders from one to another, more detailed, map,
those factors took away half percent of the Bosnian territory from Srpska
and put all the important points on the other side.  It is obvious that
the strategy of the new world order may be different, but the goals are the
same.  The goal is to take away from Serbs that which had been given
to them in the Dayton Agreement.<P>

The interests of the important powers meet over Srpska.  Islam is trying to 
secure its bridgehead in Europe.  European powers are trying to prevent that
by supporting the Federation of Bosnia-Hercegovina, that is the muslim-Croat
Federation, through which they aim to prevent the formation of a fundamentalist 
Muslim state in Europe and at the same time unite Serb enemies and under the 
guise of balance of power actually destroy the Republic of Srpska and integrate it
into Bosnia-Hercegovina.  At the same time those forces whose aim is the
intermittent destabilisation of this region are trying to maintain an unstable
solution and arm the muslims, in order to leave the possibility of renewed
fighting open.<P>

Our interests are totally different.  The destruction of the muslim-Croat
Federation doesn't interest us, since that would cause renewed fighting among 
them, in which we do not want to participate.  Therefore, we expect from those
who have established the Federation to do everything possible to stabilize it,
or provide for peaceful separation.<P>

It is in our interest to strengthen the peace and consolidate that which has
been given to us.  We can not allow that the Dayton Agreement, which is already
in many aspects unfavorable to Serbs, be further altered at our expense.  All our
political and state structures have a duty in their work on the implementation
of the Agreement to preserve that degree of our sovereignty.  Our legitimate
right is to use all permissible, therefore political, means to raise our
sovereignty to the highest degree possible in these circumstances.<P>

Although our relations with Serbia and Montenegro shouldn't be in the category
of international affairs, I have to emphasize that our strategic interest is to 
achieve the closest possible economic, cultural, political and state links 
with our motherland.  It is obvious that the unity of the Serb people remains
one of our goals.<P>

We will have to put a lot of effort in establishing links with the Serbia in
emigration, with a large number of exceptional Serbs  abroad who have
supported us from the beginning of our struggle, and who support our goals
regarding the political structure of our state.  Our goal is that the Republic
of Srpska become the state of all Serbs; consequently I propose that this 
Parliament pass a resolution stating that all Serbs can obtain the citizenship
of Srpska if they wish.<P>

It is very important that we improve our relations with all friendly states,
Slavic, Orthodox and all others who are not our enemies.  Nevertheless we
have to improve disturbed relations with all countries who are willing to 
do so, with the understandable condition that they recognize the Republic
of Srpska, Serb people and its basic interests.  It must be our goal to pull
out of the company of those countries who stand in the way of great world 
powers and their strategies, and to avoid at any cost to become a tool in
their clashes.<P>

Improvement of our political relations with other countries should be 
followed by the improved economic relations.  We must be aware of our
economic capabilities and remove from our laws and behavior everything which
might contribute to continuation of our economic isolation.<P>

<h2>Most Urgent National Business</h2>

In the internal affairs, the conditions in the Republic of Srpska have slowly
been improving.  The wave of pre-Dayton and post-Dayton refugees was a great 
suffering for our people and a great trial for the Republic of Srpska.  
Nevertheless, the political situation remained stable, and has been continuously
improving.  The attitude of the people, who have suffered a lot, but have won a 
state through that suffering, which gives a historic justification to that
suffering, has been getting better as well.  Therefore, the most important 
task facing our state is to take care of the refugees, provide for their
economic recovery and total integration in the surroundings in which
they had decided to live.  The state must develop a deliberate demographic and
population policy.<P>

In parallel with the integration of refugees, the state must urgently establish
a social program for a large part of our population, above all, the families of
slain soldiers, war invalids, retirees and demobilized soldiers.  An urgent
social program, which would rely on the  correct utilization of national resources,
must provide support to the most endangered categories of our population until
our economy recovers.  Recovery of our economy, based on the free market 
principles, will actually become a lasting social program and the best protection
for the population.  The social program must envisage the provision of sufficient
amounts of fuel for sowing at acceptable prices, so that the demobilized soldiers
and the population as a whole will be able to produce food.<P>

All this must be done in parallel with the consolidation of the government, and
establishment of modern and efficient state authorities which will secure
the implementation of the state policy and the rule of law.  Crime must be 
prosecuted and reduced as much as possible.<P>

We are facing the accelerated completion of modern laws, which will
secure political and economic freedoms and integration with the international
economic developments for our people.  Rich resources and a healthy economy,
together with the natural industriousness and independence of our people,
will not produce results unless we can distance ourselves from the previous
socialist system through enactment of new laws.<P>

Therefore, our economic policy is based on an economic recovery of every our
family and its escape from poverty.  That implies the privatization of our
state property based on the model which will make sure that the property
will belong to those who produced and defended it.  Preparation and enactment
of a privatization law and other laws which will regulate the operation of
the new economic system are the most urgent task, because economic recovery
cannot be based on the previous [socialist] economic and political system.<P>

Honorable parliament,<p>

Our people's expectations are great and justifiably  so.  Our people did everything
 it could.  It accepted and followed our policy of protection of our interests,
our policy of preservation of Yugoslavia, our policy of the establishment of our state and its 
armed defense.  Our people gave its most handsome, best and most promising part,
its youth, for the defense of the state.  Our people fought with small 
salaries or without any salaries, they worked in factories, schools, hospitals
without salaries, invalids tried to make ends meet with small stipends of without 
any assistance, retirees tried to survive without pensions.  The people did all
that without grumbling, with one goal in mind: to build a state and not fail
in that goal.  Now the people expects that in the implementation of international
agreements we do not loose that state and to develop that state as a modern state 
of free and wealthy people.<P>

We are fortunate that our people entrusted us with such great historic tasks,
the task of formation of a Serb state and further tasks of its consolidation 
and development.  None of us can complain that history gave him a small and
significant role.  Fate was very generous towards our generation, because it 
allowed us to live and die for our nation and that our efforts are rewarded
by the definitive redirection of the continuous deterioration of the Serb 
people which might have led to our complete destruction in all our states.<P>

If we complete our historic task, consolidate and strengthen our state, establish strong
links with Serbia and Montenegro, and provide for the free development
of the Serb people, then all our sacrifices and efforts will be blessed.<P>

If we do what we have to do, and what our people expects from us than we can
say that we were born with a reason.<P>

 <h1>Incidents: If Sloba Were Here</h1>

<strong><em>by Batic Bacevic</em></strong><P>

<h2>NIN, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, 8/18 1995</h2>

"Problematic" behavior of a certain number of refugees who had been expelling Croats from some towns in Vojvodina [northern Serbia] has pushed the endless story about the exodus of Krajina Serbs to new proportions.  Independent media, numerous domestic and foreign humanitarian organizations have been drawing attention to that development.  The largest number of cases was recorded in Novi Banovci.  The information that on August 12 this town was visited by 12 teams of foreign journalists (there are no precise data about the number of visitors from various humanitarian organizations) indicates that this trend has reached dramatic proportions.  Local Serbs remark that such a number of foreign reporters hasn't visited more than 200,000 Serb refugees since the beginning of their journey to Serbia.<P>

There are 160 Croat families in this wealthy Vojvodina town.  After the fall of Krajina, regardless of their will, they entered a new cycle of violence which is almost unavoidable.  According to the local inhabitants, refugees were at first offering "friendly exchange of houses" to the Croats and then began with threats and assaults.<P>

Two days after the arrival of first "brave Krajina Serbs" to Serbia all Croat owned houses have been marked with "occupied" and the name of the family which had "occupied" the new property.  The Croats avoid conversation, and if they do consent to talk to the journalists, they demand to stay anonymous.  The majority of them emphasize that they have lived in this territory for centuries and that they do not wish to leave this area.<P>

<h2>Radicals?</h2>

Forty-five-year old Croat woman says that the attitude of her Serb neighbors is the greatest disappointment. "We've lived in harmony, I've had better relations with my Serb neighbors than with my own Croats.  We've helped each other and visited each other for national and religious holidays.  Four years ago, during the worst fighting [in Croatia], our relations remained the same.  Now, all that is gone.  Next door neighbors do not exchange greetings anymore; I've heard that they also think that it is better for us to leave the town.  I've taken in refugees, no one had forced me to do that.  But even that didn't help.  They've  threatened to blow my house up if I don't leave.  I don't know what to do."<P>

Croats from Novi Banovci emphasize that the refugees were given precise lists by "an organization from Belgrade".  Unofficially, that organization is the Serb Radical Party, but none of our collocutors was willing to confirm that.<P>

Since the arrival of the first refugees to Novi Banovci only a few Croat families have decided to emigrate to Croatia.  "Those people have close relatives or children in Croatia.  They had been planning to move to Croatia for a while.  I don't have anyone there; I've never been in Croatia.  My ancestors arrived here 300 years ago; I'm not going anywhere.  I understand that these people have lost their homes, I understand their suffering and really want to help them.  But that doesn't mean that what happened to them is my fault," says seventy-years-old Croat woman.<P>

Ten soldiers from Glina [a town in Krajina] have moved in to the house of a local Catholic priest.  They had arrived before the majority of their compatriots made it to Yugoslavia.  They brought with them a truck and a fuel truck full of oil.  They angrily refuse to talk to the <em>NIN</em> journalist.  "Has Milosevic sent you to question us, huh?  It wasn't enough that you betrayed us - now you want to pester us too," says one of the young men.  After a short discussion he demands that we immediately leave the street, because he is not a refugee.<P>

<h2>Firemen</h2>

About hundred yards further down the same street, a whole fire brigade has moved into a Croat house.  They arrived to Novi Banovci in their fire-truck.  There are more examples which don't have much to do with logic.  For example, Milovan Gulanovic, who works abroad, took unpaid leave and came back to Yugoslavia since he won't let "anyone destroy the result of 30 years of my labor.  That really doesn't make sense.  I am a Serb, my wife is a Serb.  Now, someone has heard that my brother-in-law is a Muslim and perhaps thinks that this is a reason to move in to my house without my permission."<P>

Local Serbs object that their Croat neighbors "celebrated on August 5 the victory of their army." "Not all of them did it, and it is true that it was an old religious holiday which they celebrate every year.  But this year they made a bigger celebration than ever before.  Besides that, the refugees at first politely asked the Croats to let them moved in until they find other accommodation, but they refused.  They are not as innocent as they pretend to be," says a thirty-years-old entrepreneur.  The village is hopelessly divided, neighbors are not greeting each other any more, and all of them have an explanation for the exodus of the local Croats.  Only the Krajina refugees are keeping quiet.<P>

The Novi Banovci case was marked with the quick reaction of the police which, according to the local Croats, "functioned without a problem."  They add that this means that this state has finally decided to protect all of its citizens; one Croat even suggests that "the Krajina refugees wanted to use Slobodan Milosevic's absence from the country (he was in Russia).  As soon as he returned the assaults stopped," he added.<P>

<h1>Prime Minister in Wheat</h1>

<strong><em>by Zoran Miljatovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>NIN, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 3/29/96</h2>

Statement that the local authorities can not see further than the tip
of their nose may be correct but it does not indicate that the field of vision has been reduced.  Simply the nose is getting longer.  As Pinochio's.  All sorts 
of state officials and those who would like to be in their place have been 
desperately trying to prove that there is nothing illegal with the export of 
wheat, and definitely nothing illegal about the involvement of their boss,  
Mirko Marjanovic; unfortunately, <em>Nasa Borba</em> has published an article
which used facts to show that in the midst of all discussions about "the spring
sowing of historical importance" which would, if unsuccessful, destroy Yugoslav
food production, the company of our prime minister had been, day and night,
loading wheat on barges and sending them down the Danube in order to feed the
population of friendly Eastern countries.  These are not humanitarian deliveries. 
The wheat is almost as expensive as gold, according to its price in the world 
market, regardless of the fact that the domestic price had been that of aluminum.
Besides, the officials explain, everything was legal and absolutely makes sense: 
the wheat is the property of the Serbian directorate for strategic reserves and
is actually exported by the directorate, while 'Progresgas", the company owned
by the Serbian prime minister is simply a middle man dealing with the logistics of
the export for a small commission.  No one is trying to deny this
logic.  First, the head of the directorate explained that in this region there
is nothing cleaner than the export of wheat;  the following day, the
Serbian government gave an excellent review of the directorate's performance, 
 and finally, a day later, the company owned by the Prime minister won a 
 lucrative contract from that very same state agency.  There is nothing
 more logical than state officials working to enrich their superiors, is there?
Could there be anything more logical than that?<P>

Apparently, "Progres" won the contract "in a competition".  Another company
, "Investcomp", also won a contract at the same competition (export of 100,000 
tons), but its director explained in a letter sent to <em>NIN</em> that his company
had to pass this opportunity (obviously against its will and interest) because
they had been "ordered to do so".  Obviously afraid, the director failed to 
mention who had issued the order, but one can assume that it was issued by 
a state agency or a ministry.  "Progres" hasn't received an order of that kind.
What could be more logical?<P>

A new call for tenders, issued on Monday by the Serbian directorate for strategic reserves shows
that the sale of wheat is lucrative and that there is a shortage of wheat in Serbia: 
the Directorate will buy all wheat on offer for 55 paras [0.55 dinars, 1 dinar=3 DM] per kilogram.  Abroad,
the same wheat fetches about 100 paras per kilogram.  Obviously, the state and
state-owned companies of the head of the state must somehow make money as well.
"Progres's" luxurious office building on Knez Mihajlova Street [one of most prestigious
addresses in Belgrade] is almost finished,
and the company needs money for a luxurious interior.<P>

Everything, therefore makes sense, but one cannot figure out whether it is
also legal.  The ruling party is preventing establishment of a parliament committee
which would carry out an investigation.  Secretary general of the Socialist
Party of Serbia rejected the idea with indignation.  Still, indignation is not 
a proof of innocence; only of bad temper, maybe even fear of 
the possible revelations by the future multi-party committee.<P>

Sooner or later, the truth will surface; nevertheless, it is already evident
that this period of the Socialist rule will be remembered and go down in history
as a time of scandals (oil, gas, wheat...), unbelievable misuse of power and a
moral breakdown which has no parallel in recent history of the Western world.
Once this regime is gone (it only seems firmly entrenched; much stronger 
regimes have disappeared overnight), only one question will remain; the question
asked by governor Avramovic: where is the money?<P>

The desire to delay the answer to that question is evident in the repressive
mechanism which has been set to work in order to hush down rumors about
the scandals.  Serbian prime minister communicates with the public only through
Courts which serve as his spokespersons...  However, it seems he is unhappy
because of the leniency of our laws and is frantically searching for a way
to find more severe punishment for "curious" journalists.  Once the journalists
stop being critical of the government, the only ones left will be the state
officials who will eulogize their boss in the papers (failing any better reason,
they will praise him because there is still enough air to breathe); for their 
service they will receive what belongs to them: crumbs.<P>

This almost monstrous triple symbiosis (high party officials, high state officials,
directors of the largest companies), terrifying and astounding collusion of 
economic and political power which, like a leach, is sucking Serbia's blood will 
prevent Serbia's return to the international scene at any cost.  The most recent
arguments of Governor Avramovic with the state agencies in connection with the 
negotiations with the World bank and the International Monetary Fund demonstrate
the desire in the party-state leadership to avoid the return to international
financial institutions.  We will not receive credits, but we also won't have 
to accept strict conditions of the IMF which include totally open market economy 
and privatization; that is the end of their monopolies and even their rule.<P>

After a loudly announced entry into the 21st century, we can now discern
what it will really mean to us.  Three different studies, published 
independently of each other (one published by the Serbian institute 
for development) agree: in extremely favorable conditions, including
the inflow of foreign capital, in year 2000 we would reach only 80% 
of the 1989 GDP.  In the best possible situation we would reach the
1989 GDP in year 2005.  In the best possible situation; and the reality will
be different.<P>

While we work on getting back to the state we had before 
the Socialist rule, the world won't wait for us.  While we waste 21st 
century trying to reach our standard from 1989, what will happen to
those countries who were only a few years ago far behind us in economic
development?  Our prime minister (busy with wheat and trials) and his 
superiors do not, do not want to or do not need to realize that.  
Are they hoping that all of us are blind as well?<P>

<TITLE>Decline of Nationalist Press in Serbia</TITLE>

<h1>Spent Nationalism</h1>
                
<strong><em>by Teofil Pancic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nezavisna Svetlost, Kragujevac, FR Yugoslavia, August 5-11 1996</h2>

Viewers of state-controlled TV stations in Serbia, Montenegro and various
"Serb lands" which were attached to the (mis)information machinery of RTV
Serbia still remember the appearance and voice of Ratko Dmitrovic, one
of the most exposed journalist storm troopers from the time of the psychological-
propaganda preparation of the Serbs for the "defensive war" and the time when
that war, prepared by experts, was in full swing.  Together with Krsto Bijelic,
Stefan Grubac, Milijana Baletic, Mila Stula and few more media personalities
of this sort, Dmitrovic became a symbol of the merciless media campaign against
all those who did not fit the idealized image of a warrior Serb.  When
the support for the war declined (according to the directive from above) in 
the Serbian state-controlled media, since peace suddenly became the only 
viable option, Dmitrovic found himself among those who could not, or did not want
to adjust to the new trend.  He left RTS and, with a group of collaborators,
founded bi-weekly "Argument", a low circulation publication directed at that
part of readership which was disappointed with the gradual decrease of the 
nationalistic fury in the state-controlled media.<P>

At first, the regime did not obstruct its former exponent but, as the differences
were increasing, and the Serb policy went from one defeat to another, unpleasant
witnesses who knew the propaganda machine from inside and couldn't be discredited
as "traitors and foreign merceneries" became more and more undesirable.  Gradually,
larger state-controlled distribution companies started to block the distribution
and withold payments for the sold copies of "Argument"; finally, the editorial board was 
forced to cease publishing.  Their press release states, among other, that
"lately, the pressure on 'Argument' has tremendously increased;  
this pressure is evident in the obstruction of the distribution of the magazine
and in the inability to collect the debts for the larger part of the sold 
circulation".<P>

<h2>"Pravda" and "Pogledi"</h2>

Problems facing the "Argument" editorial board are only the tip of an iceberg
in the complicated relations between the regime and its former allies from
the circles of journalistic "patriots".  Explicit nationalist attitude and
rhetoric, which were widespread at the beginning of the nineties, have fallen
out of favor since they prod the consciousness of the regime which had
created them (or at least established the conditions for their strong promotion).
Before "Argument", two other Serbian publications of the pronounced nationalist 
orientation ceased publication.  Weekly "Pravda" [justice] was launched at the 
beginning of 1994 by the "Borba" journalists  who were
disattisfied with the civic-liberal orientation of that independent daily.
The team led by Blaza Sarovic (one of the media troopers from the infamous
"Eight Session", described in Bogdan Bogdanovic's book, "Mrtvouzice"),
had a special treatment and immediately received office space in the
"Borba's" building at 7 Nikola Pasic square, most of which had been the state 
proprety even before the state contested the legality of "Borba's" transformation
into joint stock company.<P>

Soon afterwards, the official Serbian policy was forced to change its
course and the magazine which at first tried to support every "patriotic"
option, regardelss whether it was coming from the regime or opposition
circles, found itself on the exposed ground: it became a dead weight to 
the regime, the opposition had no confidence in the journalists whom
had previously excelled in the total support of the regime, and the market
showed no interest for the articles by Dragos Kalajic, Milic od Macve
and other "intellectuals" who wrote for this paper.  Hence, "Pravda"
ceased publication after about twenty issues, since it couldn't prove 
itself at the market nor earn confidence of any sort of political
sponsors.<P>

Kragujevac magazine "Pogledi" [views] had a completely different history:
it started as a socialist-realistic magazine of the Kragujevac University
students; at the end of the eighties, it was in hands of the editorial
board led by Miroslav Samardzic who turned it into a tool for the 
rehabilitation of the Ravna Gora movement and the Serbian Chetniks as a second
Serbian anti-fascist army.  Front pages with the pictures of Draza Mihajlovic, 
"Serbian Uncle", and the reaffirmation of the ideology and iconography which
had been a compete taboo for fifty years [since the end of WWII], contributed
to an unbelievable market success of formerly anonymous student magazine from
Kragujevac.  Circulation grew precipitously until it reached almost 200,000
sold copies (at least according to the editorial board).  In Serbia, in the throws
of "national awakening" and newly composed anti-communist orientation it was
considered "in" to read "Pogledi", and the collaboration with the paper became
the matter of prestige for the "hard-line" rightist intellectuals.<P>

<h2>To Hide a Great Defeat</h2>

When the war started, "Pogledi" sided with the most extreme nationalist 
movements from both sides of the Drina [in Serbia and Bosnia-Hercegovina],
and consistently suported the concept of "Greater Serbia"; the editorial
board believed that a large number of Serbs, let alone others, should be 
sacrificed for this goal.  The paper consistently criticized all "unpatriotic" 
intellectuals and journalists who dared to objectively inform about the
dishonorable role of Serb units in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina.<P>

When the war morale and the nationalist zeal of the manipulated masses
began to wane, the circulation of "Pogledi" fell significantly; the paper
faced the fact that their goods were becoming uncompetitive at the local
ideas market.  Neither the regime (which, because of ideological reasons didn't
like the glorification of the Chetnik movement), nor the democratic opposition,
nor the world public did anything to save the paper which was the symbol
of the darkest ideology in the history of the Serb nation.<P>

"Pogledi" quietly ceased publication a few months ago.  It is obvious that the 
time of the press with the strong nationalist orientation has passed, and that
the authorities are doing all they can in order to "assist" its demise.  Only
the most gullible individuals believe that the regime has realized that the
support for nationalism was a mistake.  The regime is simply trying to remove the 
evidence that there was ever a war and "state-sponsored" nationalism in this 
country.<P>

<h1>With Political Rallies Against Television</h1>
                
<strong><em>by Darko Sukovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nezavisna Svetlost, Kragujevac, FR Yugoslavia, 9/29-10/5 1996</h2>

Although it's been almost two months since the founding of the opposition 
coalition People's Accord [Narodna Sloga], the public is still confused
about the joint election platform of the Popular party [Narodna stranka]
and the Liberal alliance [Liberalni savez].  These two parties
have opposite views of the Montenegrin independence, national and
religious status of Montenegrins and some other issues.  Explaining that
the coalition of the popular party and the Liberal alliance was
forced by the changes of the election law, which through division of the
republic into 14 electoral districts established <em>de facto</em> first
past the post system, Popular party president, Dr. Novak Kilibarda explains
the program of this ad hoc political alliance:<P>

There are lot of differences between us and the Liberals, but we agree that
Montenegro sorely needs democracy, respect for human rights, durable social
policy, free media...  It is equally important to convince the democratic 
world that all these things can be achieved here.  During three and a half 
years in the Montenegrin Parliament we realized that the DPS [Democratic Party of 
 Socialists, former communists and the ruling party in Montenegro]
oligarchy is unable to solve difficult problems nor is prepared to engage
in democratic development of our society.  Above all, the ruling party is 
unable to resolve the relations between Serbia and Montenegro [in the
Yugoslav Federation].  Someone may wonder whether our two parties will be better
prepared to resolve that problem, having in mind our opposing views on
this issue [Popular party supports Yugoslav federation while the Liberal 
alliance seeks independence for Montenegro]?  We will do it by providing
the conditions for the free expression of the popular will.  As long as the
will of its citizens doesn't resolve the status of Montenegro, the situation in
the federation will be irregular to a certain extent.  It will depend on
the ruling regime and not on the will of the people.<P>

Because of that we decided to offer a democratic block to the citizens.  
We invited all parties with democratic perspective to join us.  Above all,
we had in mind the Social Democratic Party of Montenegro and also the two
influential parties without representation in the parliament: SDA and the
Democratic Alliance of Albanians.  We decided to reject only nationalist-
chauvinist parties.  Such coalition will form, I hope, a government which will
be welcomed in all democratic states and banks.  Because, it will be the 
government of experts, the government which will apply democratic principles
unlike the present government which treats these principles as dead letter
of the law.  Our government will have a difficult task.  The citizens will
carefully monitor our work and decide whether we are pure demagogues or
those who "do as they say".  We must resolve crucial problems, we must show 
to the world that multinational and multiconfessional democracy is 
possible in Montenegro.<P>

<strong>You've mentioned SDP of Montenegro as one of the first candidates
for the opposition coalition.  Why have the Social Democrats decided to 
stay out of People's Accord?</strong><P>

Because of their excessive demands.  When Slavko Perovic and I signed the
 Agreement to from a coalition, we decided to ignore some issues.  For example, the Popular
Party didn't demand to be assigned the votes of the Democratic Party [from the
previous election] because the Democratic party had merged with us.  The Liberals
also avoided controversy.  Simply, we gave priority to important issues and 
took the election results from 1992 as the only criterion for the division of
the seats after this election.  SDP demanded that some other criteria be included,
and we couldn't accept that.  We regret that they decided not to join the coalition,
since we respect some of their politicians.  However, I think that SDP will loose
much more then the coalition because of this decision [in the elections SDP failed to win representation
in the Montenegrin Parliament].<P>

<strong>Has SDP made a final decision about joining the coalition?</strong><P>
 
That is correct.  Still, that doesn't mean that we won't co-operate in the 
elections for the local government.<P>

<strong>People's Accord leaders visited northern Montenegro during the last week.
What kind of reception did you get there?</strong><P>

Terrific.  It seems that things are going well for us.  We offered something new
to Montenegro, and to the whole country [Yugoslavia].  Our citizens are tired of
this sort of politics.  On one side we have the ruling party which has the trust
of a very small circle of personally invested people.  On the other side are 
parties which have exhausted their nationalistic propaganda.  For a first time
after 1918, the Liberal alliance and the Popular party have offered reconciliation
to Montenegro [in 1918 Montenegrin parliament voted on whether to merge with
Serbia; PP is the political heir of those representatives who voted for the union
(with white ballots and are therefore called bjelasi or whites); LA is the latest
reincarnation of those voted for the independence (with green ballots and are called
zelenasi, or the greens)].  Every honest person is happy because of that.  If
president Bulatovic had any political sense he would have congratulated us as well.<P>

My impression from the field is that the people have relaxed.  A lady from Cetinje
told me that she wanted to thank Slavko Perovic and myself for healing her family.
Out of her two sons, one was "bijeli" [white] and the other one "zeleni" [green].
therefore, we offer to Montenegro something that no one has offered until now:
peace.  The condition for peace is a democratic referendum about
independence.  If in the referendum the citizens choose independence for Montenegro,
I will be the first one to congratulate Mr. Perovic.  I believe that he will
do the same if the citizens choose the federation with Serbia.<P>

<strong>Will that be the final result?</strong><P>

Certainly.  Considering the current situation, I believe that Slavko Perovic and
myself have already done a lot.  This idea cannot fail.  The world will accept
us only if we follow the track laid down by the two of us.  Enough of nationalist
primitivism!  Besides, the more culture there is, the less nationalist anger.
Every person belongs to a nation, but people express that differently.  We
want to express out national origin both as a moral and aesthetic choice.  Impressions
from the north of Montenegro indicate that the citizens understand our message.
We visited three municipalities with predominantly Muslim population: Plav, Rozaje and
Gusinje.  The reception exceeded all my expectations.  Meeting halls were too small
to accommodate all those who wanted to hear us.  Mr. Slavko Perovic enjoys a lot
of respect there.  But it was unusual that a lot of applauses were directed at me,
although they were not as loud as those for Mr. Perovic.  I didn't go there to
win votes for the Popular party, but to see whether the Liberal alliance will
retain the trust of its voters after forming a coalition with us.  My impression
was that those people trust the Popular party and Novak Kilibarda.<P>

<strong>Do you anticipate similar reception on "your" territory?</strong><P>

There are some encouraging details.  At a Popular party rally in Masline (town near
Podgorica, auth. rem.) everything went fine.  It ended with a pleasant party where
one could here both Popular party and Liberal Alliance songs.  A common rally
in Zeta also went in perfect order.  People greeted the guests with loud applauses
and greeted them with two (liberal sign) and three (popular party sign) finger
salute.  If DPS could have anticipated that their changes of the election
law would unite the Popular party and the Liberals they would have left the law
alone.  But the politics demands intelligence and anticipation, and they have neither.
They couldn't recognize that a serious policy was developing in the two largest
opposition parties.  Our coalition is the only blow that DPS has received during
its rule and I think that they will never recover from it.<P>

<strong>Is there any truth in the stories that Popular party members are leaving
the party in the north of Montenegro and joining the Radicals and the Serbian
Unity party?</strong><P>

There are all kinds of stories during an election campaign.  Those rumors are
spread by parties whose rallies are attended by less than ten persons.  It's
all rather amusing.  They'll see how they'll fare in the election.<P>

<strong>How do you see performance of the state-controlled media in this
campaign?</strong><P>

The [election] campaign is in the full swing.  The election programming on the TV
is simply tiresome, so that even the useful information is often ignored by the viewers.
That is simply a cabaret run by DPS.  We don't pay a lot of attention to that part of
the election campaign.  We are relying on debates and election rallies in
main city squares to get our message across.  We'll start in Niksic next Monday.
I hope we will be able to fill the Freedom Square in Niksic;  then we will continue in
other cities, all the way to the final rally in Podgorica.  We challenge DPS to do
the same.  We are not afraid to answer questions.  They are!

<strong>Finally, give us your prediction of the election results.</strong><P>

We expect to win as many mandates as necessary.  We have realistic chances
of winning the absolute majority.  If SDA and DS win a few mandates, as they will
DPS will not be able to count on their votes.  We, who will accomplish a landslide victory
and those other parties, who will win based on the mood of their voters, will be able
to together bring down DPS.<P>

<h1>Socialists Snatch Victory from the Opposition: Theft of the Century</h1>
                

<h2>Nezavisna Svetlost (Internet edition), Kragujevac, FR Yugoslavia, November 19 1996</h2>

Although "with bound hands and feet", as opposition leader Vuk Draskovic said about 
the conditions in which the opposition ran in these elections, the opposition has won
in the biggest cities in Serbia: Belgrade [capital], Kragujevac, Nis, Novi Sad,
Cacak, Kraljevo, Uzice, Pancevo, Zrenjanin as well as in many smaller towns, even in
those in which the Socialists until recently had total control.<P>

The fact that the Socialists remain in power in more than two thirds of municipalities
 in Serbia, that they won in 15 towns previously run by the opposition, that
 in some of them they won all the mandates, as was incessantly repeated
 by the Socialists' spokesperson Ivica Dacic, was not enough to offset the heavy
 and, it seems, unexpected defeat in Belgrade, Vojvodina and central Serbia; 
therefore, the Socialists' spokesperson was unable to confirm "glorious news about the
victory of the leftist coalition" in this region [as after the federal elections
two weeks ago].<P>

Being unable to summon enough strength to honestly accept the electoral defeat
in 45 municipalities, the leaders of the Socialist Party of Serbia decided to,
at any cost, turn their fiasco into a victory through lies and manipulation.
Simply said - they decided to engage in massive fraud and vote rigging!!!<P>

<h2>Large Scale Annulment of Elections</h2>

In the late afternoon hours on Monday, November 18,  electoral commissions
in all towns and cities in which the opposition has won were suddenly 
overwhelmed by the flood of complaints from the Socialists, many of which
were so ridiculous that they were sad.  Starting with 5-6 complaints early in the morning,
by 8 p.m. in some localities there were as many as ubelievable 50 complaints!  Only
a day before, as was faithfully recorded by TV crews from [the state controlled]
Serbia Television,
the Socialists kept repeating that the elections were progressing in the best
possible manner, honestly and according to the rules.  Only the opposition
complained.<P>

Only when they realized that the situation was not developing according to 
their plans, the Socialists forgot about their old election time motto
about "bad losers" and reached for the only remaining means to avoid the 
defeat: large scale annulment of the elections.<P>

While their election headquarters mass produced complaints, and the opposition
celebrated victory at the main square, the police increased its readiness and
cut off the local government buildings to prevent immediate take over
by the opposition.  Fortunately, there were no incidents, but not because
of the Socialists: it seemed that they were only waiting for an incident, for
a spark which would have proved that the opposition is run by "the forces
of chaos and madness".<P>

At that moment everyone, even the most naive citizens, realized that democracy
is just a nice word used in the speeches of Socialist officials and that
power is the only thing they care about and that they will stoop to anything
to prevent the opposition from claiming its electoral victory.<P>

What did the [Socialist controlled] electoral commissions do?<P>

Most of them obeyed their masters and on Tuesday, late in the afternoon and 
early in the evening, they accepted most of the Socialists' complaints, snatching
clear victories from the opposition in many towns, especially in those where
the opposition coalition "Zajedno" [together] had a small lead over the Socialists.
Thus they pulled from the dead many a Socialist official, heads of districts
and municipal SPS committees, heads of municipalities who were beaten in the
first round of elections by more than 300-400 votes out of 1,000 votes cast.<P>

<h2>Protest Rallies All Over Serbia</h2>

Several hours long sessions of electoral commissions resulted in the annulment
of opposition victories in Nis, Kraljevo, Uzice, Pirot, Smederevska Palanka, 
Pancevo...; reduction of the number of elected opposition candidates in the City 
parliament and the municipalities in Belgrade (most blatantly in the municipality
of Palilula where, out of 30, the commission confirmed the election of only 8 opposition 
representatives), in Kragujevac and some smaller towns.  At 10 p.m., on Tuesday
September 18, when this article was written, the Television reported that in all towns
across Serbia, where the opposition had had lead a few hours before, the Socialists
were leading by one to two representatives, while the results from up to ten 
electoral units were annulled.  Although 8 p.m. was the final deadline for the
publication of the official results, electoral commissions in many towns were 
still working at that time.  Dissatisfied citizens began to gather in front of the 
buildings in which electoral commissions were working during that afternoon.<P>

The situation was most dramatic in Nis, where the opposition was most blatantly
robbed through forgery and "putting of finishing touches" on the electoral
records which were sent from 18 precincts straight to the SPS headquarters, instead
of to the electoral commission.  Some forgery attempts were so amateurish that
anyone could have noticed corrections and additions of 200-300 Socialist votes.
After finding out that, out of 41 opposition mandates, the commission had ratified
only 26, Nislije [inhabitants of Nis] marched en masse to the main city square.
The rally, at which the main opposition leaders, Vuk Draskovic, Zoran Dindic and
Vesna Pesic spoke, was attended by more than 30,000 people.  Chief of the USA
mission in Belgrade [unofficial USA embassy], Richard Miles, urgently left 
for Nis this morning (We found out from reliable sources that strong Police reinforcements are sent from
other towns in Serbia to Nis).<P>

In Kraljevo, the electoral commission was in session the whole day on Tuesday;
according to the latest information, from 9 p.m., it has ratified only a half
of mandates and left the rest for Wednesday?!  At the same time, in the 
local government building in Kraljevo several opposition representatives
in the Serbian and Federal parliament have started a hunger strike.<P>

The Socialists virtually brought Serbia to its feet on Tuesday night and,
what an irony, brought the citizens to the streets [during the election
campaign the Socialist claimed that the opposition is trying to win power
through street riots instead of the ballot box]!  Besides Nis, they woke
up Kraljevo, Jagodina, Pirot, Smederevska Palanka, Pancevo, Belgrade, Uzice...
The night before citizens in 45 opposition municipalities celebrated and
on Tuesday loudly protested, threatening to behave like the authorities and
to retake by force that which they had legally won in the elections.<P>

Such messages to Slobodan Milosevic from the protest rallies in Nis, Belgrade 
and Jagodina were sent by the opposition leaders, warning him about the 
possible consequences of the popular dissatisfaction and informing him
that they would not give up even a smallest "bit" of their victory, which
they were prepared to defend with all available means.<P>

The capital of Serbia [Belgrade] and towns in which the citizens have gathered 
are full of policemen.  It is believed that the authorities are waiting
for an excuse to completely annul the local elections in those localities.<P>

<h1>Tell Me How To Get To Cacak...</h1>
                
<strong><em>by Margita Cvetkovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nezavisna Svetlost, Kragujevac, FR Yugoslavia, 12/15-12/21 1996</h2>

Newly elected city hall deputies have already taken over the Cacak city hall
(on Tuesday, December 10), according to the protocol which was in place since
1860 all the way to 1939.  The new local authorities, led by Mr. Velimir Ilic, 
wanted to underline continuity of democratic tradition in this city; new
deputies first went to the church, then returned with the priests to the city
hall, which was blessed.  All respected and senior citizens who wanted
to witness "the rebirth of democracy" in Cacak were invited attend the 
ceremony.  After that, the newly elected deputies and guests went to the main city square, where
the church choir sang the anthem "God of justice", and newly elected mayor
addressed the gathered citizens.<P>

"We decided to adopt another feature of the pre-war organization of the local
authority in Cacak and establish a City Advisory Board; experienced public
workers and experts, who have retired, will sit on that board.  As its name
indicates, the Board will have an advisory character and will serve as a
sort of a "control" and "filter" for the local government and city hall;
the Advisory Board will give opinion on all proposals to the local authorities,"
said Velimir Ilic, newly elected mayor of Cacak.<P>

Ilic also explained that he would propose at the first session of the Alliance
of Free Cities (which will include 30 municipalities and will be chaired 
by Ilic), that the Alliance establish a similar advisory body,
comprised from the most respected people from all parties, but excluding
all party leaders.<P>

In the recent local elections, the Socialists suffered probably the 
worst defeat in Cacak ("Zajedno" coalition won 57 mandates, independent
candidates 5 and the Socialists eight).  In the first round "Zajedno" won 26
mandates, while in the second round the score was 29:0 for the opposition.<P>

<h2>Cacak Recipe</h2>

According to our collocutors, the changes in the city on the Zapadna 
Morava river are the result of several years of hard work.<P>

"This is not a coincidence.  All opposition parties, under leadership of
the district organization of the Serbian Renewal Movement, worked very
diligently.  Every detail was planned and all of us worked as one.  
Togetherness was the recipe for Cacak and it should be nurtured and
developed as a method which produces results," said Branko Popovic, a member
of "Zajedno" coalition.<P>

"Our election campaign lasted four years.  We co-operated with all opposition
parties and even celebrated new years with the local Radicals.  First we
established several strong private companies and then, economically 
united, linked together and helped each other.  Not only in Cacak but also 
with the companies in Uzice and Kragujevac.<P>

"We gathered the best experts in various fields; we even have several bankers.
We've had more than one hundred visits by the financial police [Serbian IRS],
and they never found anything illegal.  After that, during the campaign we
visited every house, every village, bought loudspeakers for public events, 
established a radio station, "OZON Radio", and even managed, for a lot of money,
to present our candidates on one of the two local Television stations; the 
station, "TV Galaksija" was banned soon after that.<P>

"After we managed to break through the media blockade, the whole city was with
us and we knew that we were going to win," said Velimir Ilic, newly elected 
mayor and a high ranking official in the local Serbian Renewal Movement; by 
profession he is a civil engineer and for more than 16 years he has run a 
contracting company.<P>

That hard work resulted in a victory in the local elections.  The Socialists
helped by compromising their party so much that people simply had enough of
them.<P>

Newly elected mayor of Cacak emphasized: "there have been enough empty words,
promises and various illegal acts by the Socialists.  We can wait no more!
Uzice, Kragujevac and Cacak must fight together for new people and a new
way in politics.<P>

<hr>

<h2>Radio "Miracle" in Cacak</h2>

It'd be hard to find a smaller radio station and a greater miracle.  That's
the shortest description of radio "OZON" which has after only three months of
broadcasting become the most popular radio station in Cacak.  The radio 
station was established at the end of September by Stojan Markovic 
(a film director); he is the editor-in-chief of this station, which is based 
in a trailer; the station mostly broadcasts news.<P>

Radio "Ozon" has a work force of five people and broadcasts on 91.2 MHz. 
It has reached notoriety as soon as it started to report on the election
campaign and election results in Cacak and Moravicki district, as well as
the events all over Serbia, with direct broadcasts from Nis, Uzice, Pirot,
Kraljevo and Belgrade.  This radio station has made a contract with Radio
Free Europe which allows it to broadcast RFE news programs, as well as with
the Belgrade radio station <a HREF="http://www.siicom.com/odrazb/">B92</a>, whose two news programs, "Nocnik" and news at
5 p.m. are also broadcasted.  At the moment they are working on a similar
contract with the BBC program in south Slavic languages.<P>

"Ozon" became even more famous when, on November 29, the station was visited
by a federal inspector and two policemen. He delivered an order to cease
broadcasts.  "He told us that, despite court registration, we must submit
a technical project for the radio station and seek a permit from the ministry of
information and [state-controlled] Radio Television Serbia.  They also told 
us that if any one of the two permits is denied, we would not be allowed to
resume broadcasting," explained Markovic.<P>

Interruption of the station's program has caused strong reactions among
the citizens of Cacak and the following day (and following five days) they
"gave a permit" to "Ozon" to resume broadcasting.  They said: "It's easier
to breathe with 'Ozon'".<P>

Editor-in-chief, Stojan Markovic said that he didn't know what would 
happen next.  He was told that he would be sued and the station definitely
banned.  "I sincerely hope that that will not happen as it would only
provoke another angry reaction from our listeners," added Markovic.<P>

"The founding of 'Ozon' in our city was a very important event in the history
of journalism, especially since almost all electronic media [in Serbia] are
controlled by the ruling party.  We are not like the other stations, we 
have a lot of contact programs, and try to provide correct information 
and news.  We directly reported from the demonstrations in Cacak and Belgrade,
and our listeners can talk 'live' in our program.  They phone, ask questions,
express their opinions.  We do not try to interpret events but simply try to report news and leave it to our listeners to interpret the news and reach
their own conclusions," said Vesna Bjelic, a Radio "Ozon" journalist.<P>

<h1>New Serbian Axis: Uzice, Cacak, Kragujevac</h1>
                
<strong><em>by Slobodan Cuparic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nezavisna Svetlost, Kragujevac, FR Yugoslavia, 12/15-12/21 1996</h2>

From the Drina river to Sumadija, from Bajina Basta, over Uzice and Cacak, all
the way to Kragujevac, lies the other, free Serbia. "Zajedno" 
coalition victory in these towns was convincing.  Hardship forced the citizens of 
these towns to raise their voice, to cast away fear in front of a ballot box
and disregard threats by the ruling Socialists.  The Socialists threatened
to cut funding for those municipalities in which they loose.<P>

Large towns under opposition control have already formed a common front which
will resist central authorities if they attempt to interfere in local policy.
Opposition members in Uzice, Cacak and Kragujevac say that they will behave
correctly with respect to the Republican authorities as long as higher
authorities fulfil their obligations towards them.  Otherwise, they will
try other methods.  These towns are strong centers and will not allow to
be manipulated by the central authorities controlled by the Socialists.
Our collocutors, mayors of these towns, believe in other Serbia and their
ability to confront central authorities if they try to subvert the local
governments.<P>

<h2>New Axis</h2>

How will Cacak, Uzice and Kragujevac co-operate in the future?<P>

"We have already established strong links," said Velimir Ilic, new mayor
of Cacak.  "We have especially worked on economic links.  That co-operation
will be even stronger, now that we are in power in all three municipalities.
True, Kragujevac will be in a somewhat more difficult situation because
of 'Zastava' [car and armaments] factory, but I expect that they will be
able to resolve their problems.  Naturally, they will have our support and 
assistance in that."<P>

Milan Nikitovic, new mayor of Uzice, reminded that the Association of Free
Towns will be established soon; the goal of that organization will be to 
improve the co-operation among them.  This will be that more important since the Socialists will try to cut off the municipalities controlled
by the opposition from central sources of funding.  For opposition controlled
municipalities to succeed, they will have to work together and co-ordinate 
their policies.  "Cacak, Uzice and Kragujevac must work together," said
Veroljub Stevanovic, future mayor of Kragujevac.  "We expect to have problems
in the relations with the central authorities.  These towns must co-operate
on all levels, but especially work on economic co-operation."<P>

Borivoje Radic, president of the regional Democratic Party council for this
part of Serbia, claimed that "the fact that we won in the recent local
elections will be extremely beneficial for this part of Serbia.  We will
be able to put in practice our old proposals and work on regionalisation
of Serbia and devolution of central power to local authorities.  That will
not be easy, since the Socialists control republican and federal governments,
but the fact that this axis has been established and that it connects three
large towns, shows that we will have a strong basis to work for a development
of a different political concept."<P>

<h2>Study of Obligations</h2>

What will be the approach of the new local authorities towards 
the central authority?<P>

"We will try to defend ourselves," insists Velimir Ilic, " with our economy, organization and privatization, on which we will insist.  Central authorities will try to use any illegal action to introduce emergency measures.  Therefore,
we have to respect their laws.  I've talked with representatives from the 
Belgrade municipality Vracar, which managed to survive during the last four
years, and they said that they strictly followed the law during their mandate.
We will try to get from the central authorities what we are due, and will
try to reason with the Socialists and point out that in a multiparty democracy
one may loose a local election, but that life in those municipalities must
go on.  There can be no mistakes.  We don't have time for experiments.  
Everything we do must work from the start".<P>

Milovan Martic, president of the Democratic Party district council for Uzice
said that "if Uzice is not satisfied with the funds allocated by the central
authorities, we will simply withhold taxes we are supposed to pay to the 
central authorities.  Another possibility is to invite citizens to engage in
civic disobedience.  If, for example, price for electricity is too high, citizens will not pay their electricity bills until central authorities
adjust the price to the current living standards".<P>

"State television tax is another story," added Martic.  "It was introduced illegally
and should be boycotted because of state-control over the national television
and interference with the programming".  "Right now," said Veroljub Stevanovic,
"we expect to co-operate with the central authorities.  We will treat them the
same way they treat us.  I think that our obligations towards the republican
budget are too high.  Therefore, we want to re-examine that problem.  If we
cannot agree, we will use civic disobedience.  That's the most important 
issue.  Secondly, we were legally elected by the citizens and will demand 
increased jurisdiction even in those areas which were traditionally under total
control of the central authorities.  By this I mean health, education...  If
we are local authorities and were elected by those employed in education,
then we have to also defend their interests and demand increased jurisdiction."<P>

<h2>Serbia is Surrounded</h2>

(...)Are western and central Serbia a cornerstone of some new Serbia?<P>

"Absolutely!  We are that new Serbia, " said Velimir Ilic.  "Kragujevac is
a new capital of Serbia.  It had to be like this.  'Zajedno' coalition had
its first election rally in Kragujevac.  This is the cornerstone of a new Serbia."<P>

According to Milan Nikitovic, "central and western Serbia managed to liberate
themselves.  Unfortunately, there is more to be done in Belgrade.  If the
capital manages to win back what was stolen from it, then the most significant
part of Serbia will be controlled by the opposition.  That is a good basis for
Serbian-wide elections which will be held before December 28, 1997."<P>

"I think that this is the beginning of a new, democratic, Serbia, in which,"
said Miroslav Martic, "the authorities can be replaced peacefully in an 
election.  It is common sense that those who fail on their job should leave.
The same applies to us.  Therefore, in these towns we had a peaceful transfer
of power, a very important democratic tradition which heralds the start
of a new Serbia, similar to other democratic European countries."(...)<P>

<h1>Bones in a Mixer</h1>

<strong><em>by Marinko Culic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, April 4 1996</h2>

No one knows why <strong>Franjo Tudman</strong> took two long hours 
from <strong>Hloverka's</strong> precious schedule.  Neither the Television
nor the four papers whose journalists jointly "interviewed" the president told anything about that to their audience, nor were they expected to
since in this situation they don't have a greater role than decorative  
plants in the president's room with a fireplace.<P>

It is obvious that Tudman made the decision on when, where and about 
what he would be interviewed, although journalists of the Novak-Srzic or
<strong>Ivankovic</strong> type are urgently being prepared in the 
state-controlled media; these journalists are surprisingly similar
to little heads of state, but only in the sense that they demonstrate
the same arrogance with respect to the public and coworkers as that 
demonstrated by Tudman with respect to the opposition and its supporters
(one detects here the well known syndrome of a "cyclist" who firmly 
steps on those below him while bending in front of those above him).  In that case, why 
did Tudman decide to address the Croats at this moment?  And to address
them with an interview not exactly full of current political material,
except for the new-old analysis of the Zagreb crisis, but instead "firmly
dug in in the past", as stated by <strong>Drazen Budisa</strong>?  In a short
conversation with <em>Feral's</em> journalists Budisa blamed HDZ inner
party politics.<P>

<h2>Pro-Ustashe Stamp</h2>

In HDZ, despite some corrections (repeated elections in Zagreb) radical
right has gained so much power that it endangers the policy of "reconciliation"
even in the party-movement which was the first one to announce that the embrace
between Ustashe [Croatian World War II fascists] and Partisan [communist multinational army which fought the Germans and their collaborators in WWII] Croatia was possible.  Budisa's theory is supported
by the fact that all HDZ initiatives with antifascist atmosphere or its
contemporary reflection (legal status of June 22, cooperation with the Hague Tribunal...)  
have to be directly initiated and supported by Tudman in order to succeed.  On the
other hand, the official commemoration of Bleiburg [site of the massacre of several tens of thousands of Croatian, Serbian and Slovenian Nazi collaborators and their families by the Partisans at the end of WWII], for example does not require
Tudman's support since it has a widespread support in the party.  That gives
HDZ a pro-Ustashe character more than the head of state, who after all needs
"the reconciliation of the dead" in order to rule over the living, would like,
and maybe can even tolerate (therefore honorable mention of the Croatian partisans
for their patriotism and that, almost stunning, eulogy to <strong>Tito</strong>
which, taking into account its motives, appears empty and fake).<P>

Even this intra-party aspect still, it seems, cannot fully account for the
timing of the Tudman's new reconciliation offensive and announced repatriation
of Tito's, <strong>Pavelic's, Macek's and Busic's</strong> bones and the conversion
of Jasenovac into "a place for all war victims" (in spite of serious warnings
from Jewish and even official American circles to Tudman to leave Jasenovac [Ustashe run concentration camp for Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and antifascist Croats] alone and 
stop his attempts to rewrite the history with a "shovel", and even in spite
of calls on Croats to stop their president before it is "too late").
In order to detect other, equally important aspects of that offensive, one 
has to remember that Tudman in his analysis of the Zagreb crisis said that
it was necessary to stop the activities of the "seven-head coalition", whose aim
is to "overthrow the only democratically elected authority in Croatia," and
all that in order to avoid the repetition of "Wiener Neue Stadts, and Bleiburgs and
Jasenovacs."  It is obvious that the Croatian leader intends to introduce
"reconciliation" in the current political and party life, since it is silly
to talk about the reconciliation of the dead while the living are divided
into two camps, the one in power and the other one in opposition, between
which there is almost no communication.<P>

<h2>Undesirable Partner</h2>

Still, Tudman is incapable of understanding the roots of this situation and 
to find the way out of it.  Because of that he is repeatedly surprised that 
none of the opposition parties wants to form a coalition with HDZ, while everywhere
in the world parties with 36.5 percent of votes easily find coalition partners.
His statement is partially correct, but everywhere in the world a ruling party
would, above all, wonder why others don't want to form a coalition with it
before it starts accusing other parties because of that.  Tudman is unable to 
do that because of his political and personal character, but instead keeps
insisting on the imposed "reconciliation" of <strong>Franco's</strong> type as
opposed to the consensual reconciliation of <strong>Adenauer's</strong> type.
In that, his referring to Franco not only confirms his political blindness (if Spaniards don't need that fascist dictator any more, why do Croats do?), 
but also proves his historical blindness, i.e. his ignorance of basic historical
facts.  Franco's cross of reconciliation, with "They are present" written on it
(very similar to Ustashe "they are with us"), did not unite the republican and 
fascist supporters in Spain, as Tudman claims; reconciliation is the consequence
of the democratic transformation of Spain, which was only possible after 
Franco's death.<P>

Therefore, if one wants to borrow something from Spain, that can only be 
defrancization of the country and not the establishment of the fascist-
communist country led by two-part Tudman, one part Tito and one part Pavelic 
(the ratio depends on political circumstances of the moment).  However, it
is obvious that this is exactly what the Croatian leader wants and the reason 
for his continuous attacks on the opposition, among other because in it
he sees the competition in "reconciliation" and accuses it for gathering
everyone "from communists to fascists."<P>

Therefore, it is unclear why Tudman is allowed to reconcile dead fathers,
 while the opposition is not allowed to do the same with their sons.  But 
 the whole accusation is deliberately constructed, because even the Croatian
 president understands that in the opposition there are neither greater Communists
 nor greater fascists than himself.  He is afraid of those opposition leaders
 like <strong>Tomac</strong> who have truly accepted the idea of "reconciliation"; it seems that in parallel with HDZ another political "association"
 is growing, but under different leadership.<P>

 <h2>Subjects in a Nightmare</h2>

 Because of that, Tudman has attempted to strengthen the original wing of
 "reconciliation"; it seems that this is exactly the motive behind the idea
 to bring Tito's and Pavelic's remains to Croatia and line up their two
 armies together with their followers in Jasenovac.  Even if the only matter in
 the transformation of Jasenovac was that the bones of the victims would 
 mix with those of their executioners, that would be morbid and crazy.  
 But the situation is even worse.  Tudman envisages "new" Jasenovac as
 "a reminder to the Croatian people that it was divided in the past and
 pushed into a fratricidal war."<P>

 Non-Croat victims do not deserve a mention, which means that the aim is to
 turn a multinational execution ground into the instrument of intranational  
 reconciliation, while Tudman obviously does not
 accept nor recognize (therefore, the stupidities like the changing of 
 the name of Vrginmost and other places can become a usual and ordinary
 occurrence, as previously happened in <strong>Karadzic-Mladic's</strong>
 "Republika Srpska") transnational reconciliation, symbolized by
 <strong>Brandt</strong> kneeling in penance.<P>

 Finally, this reconciliatory nightmare, into which Tudman is pushing his 
 subjects, has a very concrete and unquestionable result: the more talk
 about the reconciliation there is the less peace there is among the
 theoretical objects of the reconciliation.  If in the case of Croat-Serb
 disputes Tudman shares some blame with others, he receives all the blame
 for Croat-Croat clashes.<P>

 <h2>Tudman Waved Feral in Front of Me</h2>

<strong><em>by Drazena Peranic</em></strong><P>

 <strong>Kati Marton</strong>, the president of the prestigious American
 Committee to Protect Journalists  (also the wife of, in this region
 very well known, <strong>Richard Holbrooke</strong>, who was the "driver" of
 local politicians in the signing of the Dayton agreement and the end of 
 war in the Balkans in general), is at the moment of a study trip through
 three former Yugoslav republics, Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Serbia; her
 aim is to get a better feel for the "main object" of her interest: media
 freedom.<P>

 Committee to Protect Journalists is a non-governmental organization which was
 founded in 1991 by American journalists, actually foreign correspondents
 who experienced until then unexpected difficulties in their reporting
 from abroad;  the motto of the organization is "journalism is a dangerous
 profession"!  Without getting into her ability to personally judge the accuracy of
 that motto after several days spent in Croatia (which doesn't exactly have 
 a reputation of a media paradise), we asked her to comment the fact that
 the Croatian leader, <strong>Franjo Tudman</strong>, confided into her that 
 he was the one who needed protection, not the media.<P>

 I've spent two days in Zagreb and during that time I had a very interesting
 conversation with the Croatian president.  To tell the truth, I found it 
 interesting, although I cannot vouch that Mr. Tudman also felt that way.<P>

 <strong>Why do you think that he might have not liked that conversation?</strong><P>

 You see, I openly and emphatically pointed out the necessity that the press
 in Croatia enjoys full freedom of expression, to which he responded by pulling
 out of a file a copy of <em>Feral Tribune</em> with a satirical photomontage
 of himself on the front page and told me that nowhere else in the world
 that would have been allowed.<P>

 <strong>I assume that expected that you would agree with him?</strong><P>

 I don't know, but I told him that my president Clinton also receives "bad
 press" at home, but that that is an acceptable and ordinary thing in the USA.
 Since if my president doesn't like what he sees about himself in the papers
 or in a TV program he can simply turn the TV off or stop reading that paper.<P>

 <strong>How did Tudman react to that?</strong><P>

 I don't think that I managed to convince him that that was O.K.<P>

 <strong>While we are talking about the American press, could you tell 
 us if there are any noticeable changes in the writing about our local
 situation with respect to the last year when the war escalated?</strong><P>

 The only significant difference is in connection with Croatian president 
 Tudman.  He has become a well known figure in America, object of newspaper
 articles and editorial peaces; he has recently appeared on the front page of
 a high circulation magazine.  He has actually become the face of Croatia in 
 the USA, since other personalities practically do not exist for the American
 media.  A lot has been written about Tudman's constructive role in Dayton,
 but also about some other events.  I told him, during our conversation in Zagreb,
  that his approach to the democratization of Croatia was, politely said,
  imperfect.  Besides, the Croatian president, in my opinion, exactly when
  the media freedom is concerned, has not fulfilled his obligations from Dayton.
 The freedom of media is not only a decoration but an important characteristic
 of democracy; nobody has a right to call himself a democrat if he contributes
 to reduction of media freedom.<P>

 <h2>An Amateur from Croliput</h2>

 <strong><em>by Stjepo Martinovic, secretary general of the 
 Croatian Peoples Party</em></strong><P>

 Dogma about the supra-ideological "Croatian historic reconciliation", as
 the cornerstone of the establishment and maintenance of the stable nation
 and independent state, in principle shouldn't be different from the well
 known concepts about the national reconciliation whose goal is the 
 homogenization of the national political corpus, which has been used
 in history by many European nations.<P>

 However, in <strong>Tudman's</strong> interpretation that reconciliation
 cannot survive as a concept because it is based on the reconciliation
 of two equally totalitarian Croatian experiences, Communist and Ustashe 
 ones, while it is unacceptable in the contemporary European situation
 because of that goal.  Actually, its author doesn't base his ideas on   
 the reconciliation of red and black totalitarianism in their common defeat,
 in their bowing to the victorious civic democracy, but is trying to rehabilitate
 both systems through the reconciliation in order to build on the ruins of 
 those two systems a third, supposedly nonideological copy of totalitarianism:
 reductionist nationalism.<P>

 In other words, Franjo Tudman came up with an amateur formula about national
 reconciliation on the basis of his own doubts, pressed by the necessity to
 reconcile his actual communist biography and his <em>wishful thinking</em>
 Ustashe past (which he didn't dare live through, despite his early disappointment
 in the Partisans, expressed through his histrionic suicide attempt in 1942!).
 It is natural that the obscure idea about Jasenovac, as the "collection center" 
 for the bones of all Croatian victims, is added to that formula and that the
 authencity of two tragic Croatian experiences is denied by disguising them into
 something else, of the nationalist-totalitarian kind.  But we must not be 
 lulled by the bizarre character of that idea because the aim of the amnesty of
 the two totalitarian regimes is to save from catharsis the hostages of those 
 historical illusions with which there is no healthy civic nation, united in 
 the goals of open society.<P>

 All in all, this is a historic ruse whose goal is to attract the attention 
 of the public at the time when for the stability of the Croatian nation and
 strengthening of the sovereignty of the Croatian republic it would be much 
 more productive to prevent the split to the minority of them, profiteers
 of the economic-political transition <em>a la wild</em>, and the majority
 of us, robbed and humiliated citizens of <em>Croliput</em>.<P>

 <hr>

 <h2>Tired of Reconciliation</h2>

 <strong><em>Interview with Drazen Budisa, the president of the chief council 
 of the Croatian Social Liberal Party [HSLS]</em></strong><P>

 <strong>You, personally and HSLS reacted sharply to the repeated Tudman's
 idea about the reconciliation of the dead and the transformation of Jasenovac
 into a common memorial to the war victims.  Why?</strong><P>

 Because those ideas are absurd and cannot be implemented; if the idea about
 the transformation of Jasenovac is implemented somehow, it would result in grave 
 political consequences and a lot of tension.  Already there are sharp reactions
 from abroad; the dissatisfaction will grow at home, on both sides of the political
 spectrum.  The idea is even more unacceptable because president Tudman bases it
 on the example of Franco, which is disturbing and unacceptable and also unnecessary.
 There is no need for a reconciliation if a state is a civic and democratic state.  
 In those conditions its constitution provides equal democratic rights to all
 its citizens and becomes the only necessary and basic act of the reconciliation.<P>

Along the same lines, it is equally unnecessary and harmful to talk that the present
authorities have made peace between "Croatia and the Croatian emigrants."  Since when
has Croatia had a disagreement with its emigrants so that the two need to 
be reconciled?!  The previous regime had problems with the emigrants, and when it 
departed the political scene the reason for a reconciliation disappeared.<P>

<strong>Why were these ideas initiated right now; are there some less obvious 
motives for that?</strong><P>

I think so.  Tudman solves a problem in his party, which appears because 
contrary to all expectations that the historical topics will become the exclusive domain of historians, they are still very present on the political scene.   You witnessed the recent 
discussion in the Parliament about public holidays; certain HDZ
representatives had totally different opinions, so much that it was
hard to believe that <strong>Duro Perica</strong>, and <strong>Janko 
Bobetko</strong> were the members of the same party.  If that's the case,
I am afraid that we will never move beyond that topic.  It is easy to
realize how harmful and fruitless all that is if one compares the situation
in Croatia with that in other countries.  Please, who today talks about
the reconciliation in Germany, France, Hungary, Slovakia?  All those 
countries have past experiences which are comparable to ours, if not worse.<P>

<strong>Is it possible that HDZ is afraid of competition regarding the 
reconciliation which is coming from the opposition, which is because of
that accused that it has gathered everyone, "from communists to fascists"
against the ruling party?</strong><P>

Probably.  It is well known that HDZ presents itself as a party which 
represents the interests of all layers and all political orientations
in the society; it can not bear that someone else has a grass roots support 
in the society.  I have a personal experience regarding that.  I was the 
first representative of a political party to visit Bleiburg, immediately
after the first post-communist elections;  Franjo Tudman criticized me because
of that at the meeting of the leaders of all political parties with the 
former Croatian leadership.  He claimed that that was a politically harmful
move.  I replied that I was really there, but that I left half way through
the commemoration unhappy with the behavior of some HDZ members, one of whom,
Father Duka was in charge of the commemoration.  When Tudman heard that, he
shut up.<P>

I have to say that I really didn't feel good at that Bleiburg commemoration 
because I noticed too much politicization of that gathering and too little
respect for the victims.  Still, I must say that I had the same feeling when
I was invited to the protest rally at the square of the Croatian Greats,
the former Victims of Fascism square.  I went with the best intentions and  
feelings, but when I heard some of the speakers I realized that I didn't belong
there and again left half way through the rally.  Fortunately, the third 
commemoration that I have visited in recent years did not finish like the two 
before it.  After the visit to Bleiburg I gave my word that I would visit Jasenovac
as well.  I managed to do that after the liberation of Jasenovac when, together
with the HSLS delegation, I went to bow to the Jasenovac victims.<P>

<strong>Until now, the idea of reconciliation hasn't reconciled
anyone, but only made things worse.  Do you see its end in the near future, or 
do you think that the idea will be promoted at all costs?</strong><P>

It is true that there is so much talk about the reconciliation and we are still
to feel any results.  That is not surprising since we are talking about 
a classic example of an illusion, and  the more one insists on illusions the more they resist.  I have a personal experience about that as well.
When I was sentenced to a jail sentence and went to the prison in Stara Gradiska
I met there a group of Ustashe prisoners; together with us arrived a group 
of several partisans jailed, like us, because of Croatian nationalism.  Well,
you see, those two groups always kept away from each other, they never walked together
and only had contact in larger groups together with us, younger prisoners.  The 
relations between them were correct, there were no conflicts, but the only 
communication went through us, the young ones.  If that was the case with the 
living, what can one say about the dead.  No one ever managed to make peace between 
them; Franjo Tudman will fail as well.<P>

<strong>Population Census: the Inventory of an Exodus</strong><P>
 <h1>The Great Mover</h1>

<strong><em>by Boris Dezulovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, 9/11 1995</h2> 

Everything was finished in less than a month.<P>

Operation "Storm" began on August 4, early in the morning.  Ahead of the army Croatian radio broadcasted every fifteen minutes president <strong>Tudman's</strong> message to the Croatian Serbs in which he urged the Serbs to stay in their homes and accept Croatian sovereignty and his guarantees for all human, minority and other rights.<P>

After a little more than 24 hours, Croatian army entered Knin and miles long columns of tens of thousands of soldiers, elderly, women and children set out on their way, leaving <strong>Martic's</strong> collapsed parastate through two deliberately unblocked corridors.  Run over by the tanks of their own army, bombarded from Croatian and Bosniak guns and seen off by stones, curses and excrement of angry Sisak inhabitants, headless refugee column with more than 100,000 people scattered along the road to the Serbian border via Banja Luka.  "<em>As if they have never lived here</em>," as the same man, who with so much persistence had asked them to remain in their homeland, vividly said several days later at the stop of the "freedom train" Zagreb-Split in Karlovac.<P>

The "Storm" was followed with what is here usually referred here as "<em>maybe unjustified, but certainly understandable anger</em>."  Reserve army units, following in the "tracks of the Seventh, Fourth" and many other brigades, burned and looted everything that survived the "Storm".  This encouraged looting expeditions of ordinary citizens which started only a few days later; they stuffed trunks of their cars with everything they could lay their hands on: <strong>Ceca Velickovic's</strong>[Serbian folk singer, wife of alleged war criminal Arkan] cassette tapes, "Red Star" flags [Serbian soccer team], plaques from the buildings of various "county governments", roof tiles, video recorders and tractor trailers.  Those who were more resourceful brought along only new locks and paint, locked up empty apartments and wrote on the walls clearly visible passwords: "Taken. A Croat!".<P>

Chaos in which the whole villages (Kistanje) and towns (Gornji Lapac) were destroyed reached such proportions that finally even the commander of Knin, general <strong>Ivan Cermak</strong>, had to publicly admit that it was outrageous that "the looting and burning of Serb houses still go on, almost a month after the liberation," and that that had to be stopped.<P>

In order to avoid confusion in connection with this systematic madness, it was very picturesquely justified by some high officials in the Croatian government.  The one on the top, to whom the Constitution euphemistically refers as the Maximus [Vrhovnik], explained first in one of his speeches on the Freedom train tour that "<em>those from abroad who object because of several cases of arson and looting in Croatia should recall the ancient Old Testament saying: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.</em>" Then, in an interview to <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em>, he expressed regret that the Serb exodus occured in this manner, recalling his negotiations with <strong>Cosic</strong> and <strong>Milosevic</strong> in 1992 in Geneva, where they had nicely agreed to organize "<em>voluntary exchange of population</em>."  Nevertheless, explained <em>the Great Mover</em>, "<em> regardless of the personal tragedy of these people, the results will be positive because the Serbs will cease to have the role which they have had in Croatia since the Ottoman times [16th century] until today</em>."  Finally, in an interview for the high circulation German weekly <em>Fokus</em>, he concluded that "<em>the return of Serbs is almost unimaginable</em>," among other because "<em>that would hamper the normalization of the Croat-Serb relations</em>". (!)<P>

Vicepresident of the Croatian government <strong>Bosiljko Misetic</strong> publicly summarized at a press conference the thoughts behind the statements of the Great Transporter: "<em>Croatia doesn't want people of non-Croatian ethnicity living in her.</em>"<P>

On September 4, exactly a month after the "Storm" and a reasonable Tudman's message to the Croatian Serbs, that same Bosiljko Misetic proclaimed in a solemn voice the decision of the Croatian government to conduct, from April 1 to April 15, 1996 "<em> the first census of the Croatian population after the international recognition and independence.</em>"  While explaining this decision Misetic stated that "<em>after military-police action Storm, a number of citizens left the territories in which they had lived before the liberation</em>," and that the census was necessary in order to obtain "<em>more accurate picture of the demographic structure of the population</em>."<P>

The census will, besides its store-room-inventory nature, have a very practical significance: changes of certain constitutional laws, such as the one about ethnic and national minorities, will depend on the purity of "the demographic picture" obtained in the census.  We believe that it is only a matter of a busy government schedule and that very soon Bosiljko or some other misetic will announce the changes in the citizenship law according to which all persons, besides pure-blooded Croats, living in Croatia at the time of the 1996 census will have a right to become Croatian citizens.<P>

Population census was envisaged as a monthly inventory of the glorious August of our history and a declaration about the ethnic purity of Croatia. "<em>As if the Serbs have never lived here</em>," as Dr. Franjo Tudman already announced <strong>positive results</strong> of the census, his face distorted in convulsions caused by uncontrollable happiness.<P>

In accordance with the government law, the population census will be conducted by midnight, March 31.  Then, the Croatian darkness will be officially documented.<P>

<TITLE>Yugoslav War Criminal Demands to be Extradited to the Hague Tribunal</TITLE>

<h1>I Only Recognize the Authority of the Hague Tribunal!</h1>

<strong><em>by Vjeran Grkovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, January 29 1996</h2>

<em>You be the judge, I fully trust your conscience</em>: these words were
taken from a thick and heavy letter which has recently been sent from Croatia
to the Hague Tribunal for War Crimes in the former Yugoslavia.  The letter
was sent from the prison in Lepoglava, which immediately indicates that the
"owner" of the letter, who offered to show up in front of the court
which had never indicted him, is not at the moment the owner of his freedom; 
As a matter of fact, his freedom is in the hands of Lepoglava prison guards.
The prisoner (who is self-extraditing himself to the Hague tribunal although
this institution does not demand that from him, unlike several local state
and para-state regimes which are going to extreme lengths in order to avoid 
to send to the Hague even those who had been indicted) ended his 
proposal for an "international judicial arbitration"  with a simple signature:
respectfully, <strong>Nikola Mladenic</strong>.<P>

Who is Nikola Mladenic and why does he want to go to the Hague?</p>

This is how he introduced himself:<P>

"I was born on December 6, 1934 in Kukuljanovo-Rijeka, Croatia.  I am a former
member of the Yugoslav Peoples Army; I retired in 1992 with the rank of general
-major.  I am an engineer and during my service with the YPA I've spent 25
years building the infrastructure of Dalmatia, airport Dubrovnik, many roads,
bridges, water-works and other objects needed by the population of the coastal
Dalmatia and the islands.<P>

In 1991, between May 30 and the end of December, I was the deputy commander
of the Military District Split, in charge of civilian duties: technical control, 
planning, finances, accounting etc.  On the basis of these duties I was appointed
as the YPA negotiator in the negotiations with the civilian authorities in Split
and the surrounding area (Crisis Headquarters Split); the negotiations dealt
with the the establishment and oversight of a ceasefire and the peaceful departure
of the YPA.  I left Split on April 1 1992 and went to Montenegro to regulate
the formalities in connection with my discharge from the YPA and retirement.
I retired in 1992, immediately after my arrival to Montenegro.<P>

After the passage of a pardon [which applied to the former YPA members] in Croatia, I returned 
to Croatia on October 24 1992 and was immediately arrested and then sentenced to
12 years in jail; the sentence was later reduced to 10 years.  Since
than I've been in jail.  At the moment I'm serving my sentence in Lepoglava
prison."<P>

<h2>Self-extradition Request</h2>

The reply to the second question, why Mladenic wants to be tried in the Hague, 
is rather more complicated, since in itself it also contains the story of his
trial.  Briefly, Nikola Mladenic, was accused of war crimes (with numerous
individual crimes, among which is the suffering of Croatian soldiers whose
boat hit a mine in front of the Naval war harbor Lora in Split) and sentenced
by the County Court in Split on 12 years in prison; later that sentence was
commuted to ten years in prison by the Supreme Court of Croatia.  He has been
serving his sentence in Lepoglava prison; he has used all legal resources at his
disposal and now demands to be tried in the Hague.  His, in any case interesting 
"self-extradition letter" is the main part of this article in which <em>Feral</em>
does not want to judge the truthfulness of General Mladenic's statements
(since the talk about oneself is never fully objective) but simply wants to
make them known to the public.<P>

Calling on human rights, Geneva convention about the protection of civilians
during a war and international law articles which treat war time events,
and because of the violation of the Croatian constitution and the trial law,
Mladenic proposes an arbitration by the Hague tribunal; he states that the
sentence does not correspond to its justification, that the justification
of the sentence was contradictory, confused, and deficient since it
incorrectly reproduced the statements given by the witnesses and facts 
established during the investigation;  in addition to that, he states that
the testimonies of eye-witnesses called by the prosecution were unconvincing
and contradicting each other and that the main prosecution witness (Croatian
Navy Admiral <strong>Sveto Letica</strong>) in his statement tried to blame
Mladenic and avoid responsibility for his own mistakes.  Further, Mladenic 
states that he was blamed for the Yugoslav airforce bombardment of
Split, which according to Mladenovic is a brazen lie: "I responsibly claim
that during the was Yugoslav airforce never bombarded Split.  Further,
Yugoslav NAVY ships limited their actions to attacks on the positions
of the Croatian military forces and in response to the attacks of the 
Croatian coastal artillery...  I was at the time the president of the commission
for the oversight of the ceasefire; the sentence on the other hand claims 
that, being on this position, I had the authority to make decisions about
combat actions."<P>

<h2>Pile of Unproven Accusations</h2>

"Further, statements and testimony by admiral Letica, both during the 
investigation and in the main hearing are totally contradictory and 
to a large extent false; in situations where some part of his statement
was showing me in good light, that part would be rejected and not entered in the
trial records. 
I reacted to these violations during the trial, but my objections were
rejected.<P>

Since my defense attorneys were under constant pressure, this show trial 
resulted in an unjust and wrong sentence.  I propose that the honorable  
institution contact competent courts in Croatia and request access to
the records from the investigation and the trial in order to verify
the assertions made in this letter;  I can honorably state that the 
verdict was passed only on the basis of the purged testimony by Admiral
Letica."<P>

Lepoglava prisoner Mladenic suggests that this time the court take into
account testimonies of a number of persons (most of whom were YPA officers
at the time) who can be reached through the Personnel Department of
the Yugoslav Army, located in Belgrade;  Mladenic is convinced that these
testimonies could overturn the verdict which was reached with use of "assumptions,
insinuations and imaginary witnesses".  He further claims that the verdict
was based on the "collective trial of 33 accused, of which only 2 were in custody
during the trial"; therefore, because of the inability of proper defense, 
"the amount of accusations gives an unrealistic impression of guilt which can
result in unobjective, biased view of the actual events."  Mladenic illustrates
his view of the trial with this characteristic example:<P>

"In order to avoid disturbing the previously determined schedule of the trial,
the Court refused to summon two members of the Croatian Army who had been wounded
by mines inside the military complex Lora; these soldiers would have told
the truth about the circumstances in which they had been wounded and the fact 
that at the time they were in military uniforms, on a combat mission and within
a military object; therefore, at the time they were soldiers on a combat 
mission and not civilians; this would have made it impossible to portray the
military complex Lora as a civilian object and those individuals as civilians,
and consequently pass a preconceived verdict for war crimes because of the
suffering of civilians..."<P>

<h2>General Refuses to be Exchanged</h2>

"The Court is of the opinion that it is irrelevant that the soldiers were wounded
by Croatian mines, because those mines were allegedly moved by the YPA soldiers
without the knowledge of the Croatian Army.  This detail is used in order to
justify the verdict, regardless of the fact that this detail hasn't been proved
nor had the prosecution made an attempt to prove it.  The Court further states:
it is irrelevant that the wounded were Croatian soldiers and not civilians since
they were not wounded during the regular war-time activities, and should be considered
to be civilians."<P>

Therefore, writes Mladenic, we can conclude: a) that the wounded are sometimes
civilians and at other times soldiers, depending on the whim of the Court 
b) the statement "they were not wounded during regular war-time activities"
is unclear.  What does constitute regular and what irregular activities during
a war?  Behind all this, according to Mladenic, is the intention to take the
blame for the suffering of these soldiers off the real culprits, since if
the soldiers had engaged in "irregular activities" it is obvious that they
did so because the command of the Croatian Navy ordered them to engage in those
"irregular activities".<P>

In his letter to the Hague Tribunal, Mladenovic also lists other violations of the
the law in the trial against him.  He says that the actual statements of the
witnesses from the main hearing were not entered into the record of the trial;
instead it was simply entered that "the witness repeated the testimony given
during the investigation"; furthermore, the verdict claims that the testimonies
of all 38 witnesses were read during the main hearing, which is a lie, since
only three testimonies, given during the investigation, were read and none of
those witnesses had been summoned to appear at the hearing.  Mladenic emphasizes
that witness Sveto Letica was not questioned about the crucial details during
the main hearing although the verdict wrongly claims that  this was the case 
(instead Mr. Letica's statement given during the investigation was included
in the verdict).  During confrontation, writes Mladenic, witness Letica
was very unconvincing and "in order to avoid answering my questions, he left
the hearing on his own accord and prevented me, with the assistance of the Court 
which failed to stop him, from asking important questions.  At the same time I 
was not given a permission to point out the inconsistencies in the statements
given by witnesses Letica and <strong>Puljic</strong> (Croatian negotiator);
therefore the right to defend myself was denied, both to myself and my attorney, 
in the crucial moments of the trial."<P>

Mladenic proceeds to inform the Hague Tribunal that on January 1994 he was released 
from the detention and then, without a new arrest warrant, taken to the prison
in Lepoglava and two days later taken to be exchanged for captured Croatian 
soldiers; he refused to be exchanged.  Then he draws the attention of the Court to
a very telling detail (according to him).  Namely, during  the visit of the
Hague prosecutor <strong>Richard Goldstone</strong> to Croatia, then president
of the Croatian Supreme Court stated that "Croatia [was] leading a defensive
war and that her defenders [could not have committed] war crimes."  Mladenic wonders whether
this was a certain "permit" to commit war crimes for the privileged individuals.<P>

<h2>Volunteer Hostage</h2>

These "excerpts" from the letter in which Nikola Mladenic demands to be tried in
the Hague can be concluded with a note in which he tries to demonstrate to the
international jurists how and in what circumstances he had served in the YPA:
" In order to prevent further clashes I volunteered myself and another 20 
officers as hostages during negotiations with the Split Crisis Headquarters
in Hotel Marijan, in the presence of Mr. Puljic, Admiral Letica and the
European Union representative;  in return I asked that all YPA officers and 
soldiers be allowed to leave Split undisturbed;  in addition I offered to
collect and return the arms belonging to the Territorial Defense Split.
When Mr. Puljic and Letica rejected this proposal, the EU representative, 
<strong>Bundoli</strong> told them: 'Gentlemen, when an enemy wants to leave
one should build him golden bridges!'  Had this proposal been accepted
this would have been the end of everything."<P>

Former general of the former YPA, Nikola Mladenic, now a prisoner in the 
prison in Lepoglava, has used all the possibilities to appeal his verdict.
On June 13, 1995, he went to the Constitutional Court of Croatia but until
today he hasn't received a reply although all "legal and reasonable deadlines
have passed."  All the pardons and the clemency law managed to miss him.
Still he is obviously convinced that he is right and does not ask for clemency
, but for justice, demonstrating with this self-extradition to the Hague that, 
after all, he expects to find more justice in the International Tribunal for
war crimes than in the County Court in Split or in the Supreme Court of Croatia
in Zagreb.<P>

<hr><P>

<h2>Cannon Fodder</h2>

<strong>During combat, Croatian side often threatened to use
the families of YPA officers and soldiers as human shields.  These threats
were taken very seriously, especially when they were made by Admiral Letica;
Consequently I organized the evacuation of the families of active and retired
YPA members from Split.  I managed to evacuate 742 families, of all nationalities,
without making any distinctions.  All families were evacuated to secure territories
according to the possibilities and their wishes.  These families were constantly
under attack: physical maltreatment, evictions from their apartments, robberies;
Admiral Letica's threat was the last straw.<P>

European Union Mission has data about these pressures and maltreatment;
The mission twice received the delegations of the women from those families.
The Court implies that I could have prevented some events, but fails to mention
that others, from the other side were in the position to prevent, or at least
alleviate such events.  Do war crimes have a bright and a dark side?  Are the 
actions of some individuals excusable while those of others aren't?</strong><P>

<hr><P>

<h2>Political Intrigue</h2>

<strong>Since at the time I was the official YPA negotiator for the Split
region, based on my position of the deputy commander of the Split military
region in charge of civilian affairs, and on the agreement with the
European Union whose representatives were present during all negotiations
in the whole Croatia, the verdict blames me for not defecting to the Croatian
side as a negotiator.  I believe that that cannot be taken as an incriminating
circumstance, since I believed that the position of a negotiator would allow
me to achieve the reduction in tension, enmity, destruction, killing and other
misfortune, which I succeeded in doing.<P>

If the Court wanted to objectively accept the testimonies and my return to Croatia
it wouldn't have made such a verdict.  The fact that I returned to Croatia
demonstrates that I did not feel guilty, let alone thought of myself as a criminal.
The implication that I consciously contributed to the idea of Greater Serbia is a political
imputation which pushes this trial at the edge of being a political witch-hunt
(in some ways it already is a political trial).  I  believe that the above stated facts
are sufficient to point out the injustice inflicted on me and others and to
demonstrate the dependence and biased nature of the Courts.</strong><P>

<TITLE>Nazi Geopolitics as a New Serb Science</TITLE>

<h1>War Science</h1>

<strong><em>by Filip David</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, February 26 1996</h2>

In February, the second edition of a monograph about geopolitics under the title "The Secret of the Balkans" appeared in the bookstores.  The first edition was published a year ago and did not provoke much reaction from the sleepy intellectual public.  We are witnessing the repetition of the last year's reaction: apart from an article by Ivan Colovic - silence.  We believe that anywhere else in the world, the publication of a similar collection of articles which seeks acceptance as a textbook and a scientific tract, would elicit strong reactions for several reasons.<P>

One of the founders and main proponents of geopolitics was German general Haushofer, professor of geography at the Munich University during the Nazi rule.  Geopolitics is based on the theory that the state is a living organism and as such it is continuously fighting for survival.  Conquest of new living space is a basis for the continuous clashes between states.  This is a justification for expansionist and nationalist goals of the states with nationalist programs and for the aggressive nationalism and territorial expansion through war.<P>

Geopolitics, the official doctrine of Hitler's Nazi regime, made into law the theory of blood and soil (Blut und Boden) and the supposed German right to expansion in search of new living space (Lebensraum), which is allegedly augmented by the genetic superiority of the germanic race.  These theories produced the greatest crimes, not only during WWII, but in the whole modern history of the humanity.  Haushofer published his main work on geopolitics in 1943; after the war he was tried in Nurnberg and sentenced for war crimes.  He committed suicide.<P>

The intention of the editor of the compilation "The Secret of the Balkans" is, as the introduction states, to "teach the coming generation about the living space of our nation and the real significance of that space in global terms"; guru of "young Serb intellectuals", as the book introduces extreme rightist Dragos Kalajic, adds that these messages are addressed "to the builders of the new Serb state which is being formed through struggle," because, "the presented geopolitical characteristics of the Serb fatherland demand continuous fighting readiness of the Serb nation and the corresponding all encompassing educational and value system."  It is not hard to guess what kind of system Kalajic has in mind.  On the pages of "the Secret of the Balkans" we can find the works by the foreign founders of geopolitics besides the articles by the researchers and professors from the Belgrade University, as well as an article by a recently retired general from the Yugoslav Army.<P>

Seed couldn't have fallen in the more fertile soil.  Everything that was the ideology of the official and unofficial policy, everything passed by the state propaganda as the goals of the program and goals of national policy, the contents of numerous quasi-scientific discussions resulted in the rehabilitation of geopolitics as a science; something obviously missing in the Serb science.  This promotion and purported rediscovery of this supposedly all encompassing scientific discipline contains many of the stereotypes, illusions, prejudices and manipulations which had sidetracked the Serb nation and are the essence of the unnecessary and ignominious war.  The tales of the peoples of "the land and the sea", about the proud warriors from the mountains and "raja [servile] mentality" of those who live in the flatlands and should be exterminated, about the barbarians who inject fresh blood into civilizations, about the better and worse nations, about the states with rights to  territorial expansion at any cost, essentially boil down to racial theories and dangerous ideas about lower and higher races; the unavoidable consequence are the wars in which, in the name of science, nation and mystical revelations, horrendous crimes are committed, ethnic cleansing is justified and "final solution", i.e. the destruction of certain nations, is implemented.  The final goal is the formation of the pure Nazi and racist state.<P>

In Hitler's Germany, geopolitics swallowed all other scientific disciplines and assumed the position of the generalized pseudo-science as the fullest available expression of the Nazi ideology.  What is truly outrageous is that the publisher of the book is Student Cultural Center, and the book was financed by the Serbian Ministry for Education.  The idea of this publishing project with the state support is that the book will become a required text for a number of subjects at the Belgrade University which is confirmed by a reproduction of the official decree with a signature of the head of the faculty for Political science.<P>

All this demonstrates the extent to which the position of the extreme pro-nazi right has been strengthened under the wing of war nationalism.  This Nazism has been promoted by certain intellectual circles of the Serb right, with open assistance from the ruling establishment.  In a conversation with Russian rightist Alexander Dugin, Dragos Kalajic concludes:"... we, the people from the right, should today stop our attacks on communism, taking into account that those forces have undergone a profound transformation, in a positive sense, which means that today the communists are our potential or actual allies."  Dugin responds that he completely agrees with that statement.  He says: "Present national-communists are a recent and new political reality...  By nature they are more similar to the conservative revolutionaries from 'the German movement' then to the bolsheviks."  Both Kalajic and Dugin see their greatest opponents in the New World Order, cosmopolitan, liberal civilizations, United States, the West and something they call "mondialist forces."  Serbian struggle, according to them, is the start of the great uprising against these forces of evil, the defense of Europe from the aggression of the New World Order and the infiltration of Islam.<P>


Here is the final product of the populist movement which began in 1990.  Unification of red and black, a symbol of blood and a symbol of death.  Prodded and supported by the intellectual circles in important cultural and scientific institutions and associations and the hidden centers of power, this monster, defeated, but not completely, drunk from an orgy of violence, is coming under the wing of the system in order to somehow survive and gather new strength.<P>

Therefore, the entrance of Nazi geopolitics as a new Serb science to the Belgrade University, with blessing from the Serbian Ministry for Education, is maybe not that surprising.  New Serb Right isn't anymore a marginalized force.  It has penetrated many vital spheres of the society, political, military but also the cultural, scientific and spiritual life.  These sick and dangerous ideas mirror the shapes of the turbulent future, full of many difficult trials.<P>

<h1>Suicide with "a short burst of fire from an automatic gun"</h1>

<strong><em>by Petar Doric</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, February 26 1996</h2>


Although it seems unlikely, a curious criminal trial has found  a place between two titles: "Woman suddenly reached under her apron..."(Slobodna Dalmacija, 2/9/96) and "Sunjerga acquitted"(Slobodna Dalmacija, 2/15/96); one could say that this trial was extremely important for our state.  First Croatian soldier charged with the murder of a Serb civilian faced the jury of a Croatian court; the murder took place in the deserted Krajina, after the operation "Storm"; the trial has been described (several times so far) by the highest levels of Croatian government as a national moral catharsis, and also (in a more pragmatic way) as a trump card used to prove that the Croatian government does not <em>legally</em> distinguish between Croats and Serbs and prosecutes criminals regardless of their nationality.  (The announcement of the trial should have shut the mouth of the international community which had been scandalized by the looting, violence and murders in the liberated Krajina territory and outraged by the reluctance of Croatian authorities to prevent those crimes.)<P>

<h2>Handcuffed Witness</h2>

If because of everything mentioned above the trial (of <strong>Zeljko Sunjerga</strong>(28) a.k.a. <strong>Zekac</strong> from Velika Cistka, a soldier of the Croatian Army charged with the murder of elderly Serb woman 
<strong>Manda Tisma</strong> from the village of Rudelo) was awaited as an "indicator", it can only be expected that its result will be taken as an "indicator".  And the result is that Sunjerga was acquitted!  And released from detention!  Briefly, the court decided that Sunjerga was <em>not guilty</em>, although it was not contested that Manda Tisma was <em>not alive</em> as a consequence of a "short burst of fire" fired from Sunjerga's Kalashnikov "at a dangerous terrain where all of us usually had a bullet ready and approached every person carefully".<P>

"In August 1995 in the village of Rudela, hamlet of Tisma after a short conversation with elderly woman Manda Tisma, Zeljko Sunjerga, from a close range and with intention to kill the victim, cocked his rifle, MB-70 AB, and fired several bullets into the victim."  Therefore, <em>the indictment states</em> that "the only motive for the murder (as quoted by Slobodna Dalmacija in its report from the trial) was national hatred, since the accused was aware that the woman was of Serb nationality."<P>

"It has been established that the victim did reach with her hand (during the 'short conversation' with the accused) under the apron, which made Sunjerga warn his comrades with a cry and than, sensing danger, fire.  Neither the premeditation nor the national hatred had been proven by the prosecution.   Whether Sunjerga acted properly or made a mistake and was guilty of manslaughter cannot be decided by this court since that would be going beyond the indictment."  This paragraph is taken from the <em>statement of the judge</em> <strong>Milivoj Lasan</strong>, which justifies the not guilty verdict and the decision to immediately release Zeljko Sunjerga from the detention!

Between the indictment and the verdict, a trial took place.  However, it seems that the only thing about the trial that is worth mentioning is that the witnesses (among them was a comrade of the accused who had been brought to the court room directly from jail since he is a suspect in another crime) managed to prove that old woman Manda Tisma actually, during a "short conversation" with Sunjerga, committed suicide in a manner until now not recorded in judicial documents: she unexpectedly reached under her apron!  The only connection between Sunjerga and her personal and absolutely private tragedy was that he fired "a short burst of fire" at her.  Then, "he went back to the vehicle and [the soldiers] left the village."<P>

<h2>Clear as a Bullet</h2>

"It is clear that that was a case of supposed necessary defense, which is when a person kills because he made a wrong conclusion that he was in danger," president of the Zadar county court, Milivoj Lasan, explained to our journalist, obviously trying to be picturesque in his description of an incident about which he (among others) passed a verdict.  Certainly, "supposed necessary defense," clear as a bullet.<P>

"As a professional, I do not want to accept that that man, Zeljko Sunjerga, was acquitted," said on the other hand, president of the County prosecutor's office,
in Zadar, <strong>Ivan Galovic</strong>, "since one must have in mind that this is only a first instance verdict, not a final one.  I don't have that verdict, I haven't seen it because it hasn't yet been written;  because of that, my office hasn't yet appealed the verdict.  But, do not be mistaken, we will definitely appeal that verdict.  We are convinced that the decision of the Court was wrong and that the Supreme Court will overturn the verdict.  Still, I do not want to comment questionable details of the trial, since the period between the first verdict and the appeal to the Supreme Court is very sensitive, especially since the verdict hasn't yet been written."

Whether it will be written in Sunjerga's acquittal that it was a case of supposed necessary defense or something else, will definitively be of no concern to murdered Manda Tisma, and probably Sunjerga himself.  As far as he is concerned, the important thing is that he was released and that can move on, either "supposedly" or in any other way.<P>

"While we are awaiting the 'official' verdict and  the 'response' of the Supreme Court to the appeal from my office I can only hope that Sunjerga will remain on the Croatian territory and be accessible to the police," added Ivan Galovic.  "As you are aware, he is now free and my office has no information regarding his address.  It is not necessary to emphasize the possible influence this case could have on all similar cases, judicial procedure and prevention of similar crimes.  I will tell you that it is extremely difficult to find witnesses in this type of cases.  Even Croats are reluctant to testify about the crimes committed by Serbs; you can imagine how difficult it is to find Serbs who will testify about crimes committed by Croats."<P>

<h2>Ask the President!</h2>

"I don't think that we will modify our Croatian laws because some trials have been followed from abroad," adamantly stated judge Lasan, president of the Council which rejected the indictment against Sunjerga. As far as he is concerned, "we cannot talk about a hate crime, and if the County prosecutor's office believes that it is right, let it appeal the verdict and we will see who is right."  By the way, he will publish the verdict in the period prescribed by law, Sunjerga's release is "absolutely in accordance with law" and he "has rightfully been free from the moment when the Court rejected the indictment."  Besides, "who are you to ask me all these questions."<P>

Therefore, Lasan is not prepared to  "give court documents" to journalists (at this stage of the case nothing, apart from the consideration towards the public, obliges him to do that), neither is he prepared to answer any questions that he hasn't already answered; for example he refused to reveal names of other members of the court council, or the number of witnesses who testified.  In accordance with that, he advised us to approach the president of the County court in Zadar, <strong>Benko Velcic</strong>: "Go ask him, it's not only my verdict!"<P>

We decided to follow Lasan's advice.  Unfortunately, president Velcic immediately stated that apart from the five member court council no one knows about the detail of the trial and that any "questions about the possible pressure exerted on the judges would be very inappropriate," and as far as he is concerned, "I don't know anything about that case and you should wait for the verdict and the possible appeal by the County prosecutor's office.  Besides, the trial was public and it is not necessary to make such a fuss nor is it necessary to comment the decision."<P>

<h2>Polished Conscience</h2>

The president doesn't want to make fuss.  "He can do as he likes," as the proverb says, "since there's nothing better than one's own will."  Still, it would be much more useful for the public if he could comment at least some details of the trial: why was it impossible to find out the age of the victim; why was it impossible to obtain any data about her relatives and family; did the prosecution have any witnesses (especially since an important defense witness was brought to the trial from a prison cell and gave a testimony which differed from the one he gave during the investigation)...?  Also, maybe, Velicic, as a lawyer, could tell us something about the acquittal in which the court did not care whether Sunjerga had "any other motives" for killing Manda Tisma but found it sufficient for the acquittal and release that "the national hatred" was not the motive for the murder, as was claimed in the indictment.<P>

Maybe all these details of the gloomy story about the murder of a civilian after a battle are "not important" when compared with the sudden breakout of the affirmation of the rule of law in our state, so that from "the patriotic point of view", one cannot waste time on those "trivial" details when we should be unmasking bigger criminals who are working against our state.  Maybe, there is, after all, a premeditated model for the forthcoming trials which will be used to polish state's conscience in connection with the prosecution of our own criminals; some of them might have already been decorated; the trials for brutal murders of Serb civilians in Varivode and Gasici, which have been demanded by the international community should follow in the near future.<P>

And the model could be described as follows: Europe sated, rule of law totally full and all the criminals still free.<P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, April 8, 1996</h2>

The [Croatian] media, despite severe controls (or perhaps indeed because of
them), is not immune to terrible gaffes.  We can accept with a certain dose
of understanding and collegial sympathy the gaffe of the Croatian Radio
reporter who concluded his report on the recent visit of President Tudman
to Benkovac with the words: "You have been listening to a speech of
President Tito."  But it is difficult to accept with similar emotions last
week's abandonment of all professionalism, an abandonment which simply
swarmed from the radiowaves and newspaper stands.<P>

        Though the occassion is tragic - involving the airplane accident
near Dubrovnik and the death of 35 people, including American Secretary of
Commerce Ronald Brown - the low level of professionalism with which certain
local media treated the visit of the American delegation to BiH and Croatia
imposes upon us the following question: who are these people that have
found their way into the Croatian media, especially the state-controlled
media?<P>

        Croatian Radio, with an unbearable ease of routine, broadcast in
its 3:00 PM Wednesday program a report of its Dubrovnik correspondent which
anounced not simply that Prime Minister Matesa awaited Secretary Brown in
the Dubrovnik airport, but, indeed, that a meeting of the two delegations
had already begun.  This was anounced some time after 3:00 PM, at a time
that is, when the plane had already crashed near Velje Dole (the crash
occured at 2:40 PM), and at a time when the travelers, including Secretary
Brown, were unfortunately already dead.<P>

        If we were in some how able (at least partially) to forgive the
newspapers, whose production technology simply forces certain
pre-judgements, concerning even that which is news, we cannot similarly
forgive the radio, which has the technological fortune to present events to
listeners in so-called "real time."<P>

        But that which we cannot forgive even newspapers, in this specific
situation Vecerni List, is flat-out falsification.<P>

        Always the fastest, most precise, most competent, as it itself
likes to babble, Vecerni List did not satisfy itself simply with the
information that the Americans had reached Dubrovnik (although they
didn't), where Matesa received them (he awaited them but did not receive
them).  In its first edition on Thursday, it even published an anouncement
which Secretary Brown supposedly gave upon his arrival in Dubrovnik....<P>

<strong>Official U.S. Delegation led by Secretary Brown, in Dubrovnik</strong><p>

<h1>A SIGNAL FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</h1>

Dubrovnik: A group of 15 American businessmen in the fields of
infrastructure, energy, and finance, led by American Commerce Secretary
Ronald Brown and other employees of the Department of Commerce, were
received yesterday at the Dubrovnik airport by Croatian Prime-Minister
Zlatko Matesa, Vice-Presidents of the Government Borislav Skegro and Dure
Radic, Ministers Davor Stern and Niko Bulic, President of HKG Nadan
Vidosevic, US Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith, Croatian Ambassdor to
the US Miomir Zuzul, Governor of the Dubrovnik-Neretva county Jure Buric,
and Dubrovnik mayor Nikola Obulje.<P>

        The American delegation arrived hoping that during its stay in
Croatia and BiH it could assess the possibilities of investing from 5.1
billion dollars into the region as part of a reconstruction program
initiated by the US, EU, and various other international financial
institutions.  The program forsees a reconstruction of the energy system,
transportation, residential homes, and health care.<P>

        "The fundamental purpose of my stay here is the fact that the keys
to keeping the peace are long-lasting economic growth and the establishment
of new employment opportunities," anounced R. Brown, who also said that
from this visit he expects results similar to those achieved by America 50
years ago with its economic assitance to West European countries.<P>

        "This mission signals the next phase of American relations with
Bosnia and Croatia," said Brown.<P>

<h1>Occupation in 26 Credits</h1>

<strong><em>by Domagoj Horvat</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, April 8 1996</h2>

Business empire of <strong>  Miroslav Kutle</strong>, well known business
wizard from SIroki Brijeg [a town in Hercegovina] whose main comparative 
advantages are his origin and political orientation, has grown so much
in only a few days that even uninformed Split inhabitants shouldn't
be surprised if affable Miro soon throws in the question: "How much for
the whole city of Split?"  For those who haven't kept up with the news,
we will list the properties of the omnipotent Kutle located in Split
and its immediate environs.<P>

<h2>Mafiocracy at Work</h2>

Miroslav Kutle arrived to central Dalmatia in 1993 with the spectacular
take-over of the publishing house <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em>; with it he
became the owner of a newspaper and commercial printing-works, a daily newspaper,
and a well developed (especially in Dalmatia) <em>Slobodna's</em> distribution
network.  His next move was in the tourist sphere: the company <em>Kastelanska
Rivijera</em> with the at the time prestigious hotel <em>Palace</em> was added
to Kutla's empire.  After a short excursion into tourism, master Kutle went back 
to his original interest: the media;  immediately after the founding of the
radio station <em>Radio Dalmacija</em>, he took over <em>TV Marjan</em>, the 
oldest privately owned TV station in Split.  As the diversification of business
is in the core of Kutle's business strategy, the next logical move was made in
the commercial sphere:  Kutle enriched his Split empire with the company <em>Jadran
tekstil</em>, including four department stores and a large number of shops and
valuable commercial space.<P>

All those who might have thought that Kutle has rounded up his business empire
with these acquisitions and satisfied his business ambitions were totally 
wrong.  Although Kutle has until recently claimed that the time for new acquisitions
was over and that he was about to start with the consolidation of the acquired
companies, in the last ten days Miroslav Kutle has gone on another shopping 
spree which can be only described with the <em>Globus</em> neologism "Turbo-
sensational".<P>

So there it is:  Miroslav Kutle has just put his characteristic signature on 
the acquisition of <em>Dalma Maloprodaja</em> and take-over of companies
<em>Prerada</em> and <em>Drvodeljac</em>; these days, he has also begun 
a campaign to buy the <em>Jadransko osiguranje</em> (former "Dunav") shares,
from small shareholders.  In parallel, the development of a very 
complicated project whose goal is the privatisation of <em>Splitska Banka</em>,
which would naturally, according to the project, become partly or wholly
controlled by Miroslav Kutle, is reaching its completion.<P>

Operation <em>Dalma</em> is a classic example of mafiocratic management of
the Croatian economy, all with the goal of strictly controlled privatization.
Formerly very prestigious <em>Dalma</em>, powerful and rich commercial company
which has covered a large part of Dalmatia, has been systematically undermined
and commercially exhausted over the last few years.  During the last year, 
<em>Dalma</em> has reached the bottom, hit by the social disturbances, 
strikes and protests of the workers who were formally employed by the company
but hadn't been paid for months.  In addition, the company stopped payments
to the pension fund and health insurance for its employees. Destroyed company
and exhausted employees were brought to a state in which they unanimously 
sought a saviour, someone who will buy the company at any cost.  So that at
least the present state of neither life nor death ends.<P>

<h2>Prince Charming</h2>

Enter the saviour, prince on a white horse who will take the bride to his
glorious castle.  Although seemingly shabby, <em>Dalmacija Maloprodaja</em>
is still a pretty attractive bride.  In addition to 6 large supply centers and supermarkets,
she owns as many as 70 stores with different sorts of goods all over Dalmatia.
  <em>Maloprodaja</em> was at a time
estimated at unbelievably low DM 9 million; however, that price was too high
for Kutle, so that the company had to be offered for DM 7 million.  Finally,
crafty Miroslav managed to obtain such favorable conditions for the transaction
that even an average Split inhabitant might ask himself or herself: how come
I didn't do it?<P>

Simply said, Kutle agreed to pay DM 1,8 million for 70 <em>Dalma's</em> stores
and supply centers, while he will repay the remaining 5.8 million over the next 
5 years.  By the way, the whole transaction is very interesting.  The interest
of the public will be tickled by the fact that the official buyer of <em>Dalma</em> 
is not Kutle's "mother company" <em>Globus Holdin</em>, but its subsidiary
<em>Jadrantekstil</em> which is wholly controlled by Kutle although he does not
control the majority of its shares.  For that Kutle can be grateful for the 
favorable attitude of the <em>Splitska Banka</em>.<P>

Kutle gained access to <em>Jadrantekstil</em> buying shares from small shareholders.
 For this he used the credit which he obtained from HPT [Croatian state owned
 telecommunications monopoly].  With these shares and the control of the 
 <em>Splitska banka</em> stake in <em>Jadrantekstil</em>, Kutle achieved
 full control of this Split commercial company.<P>

Problems started when HPT realised that they will have a hard time getting their
money back from Kutle; therefore, they agreed to  a barter: for the borrowed
money, Kutle ceded to HPT <em>Jadrantekstil's</em> headquarters building
in Kopilica, allegedly worth DM 15 million.  Hence, the "postmen" for their money
obtained a large building, which they can hopefully sell in the near future, while
Kutle, also thanks to <em>Splitska banka</em> took control of <em>Jedrantekstil</em>
without investing a cent of his own money.<P>

Not only that: with <em>Jadrantekstil</em> Kutle buys <em>Maloprodaja</em> of
another commercial company - <em>Dalma</em>.  How?  Already mentioned DM 1.8 
million, he will cover with a credit from another favorably inclined company:  
<em>Dubrovacka Banka</em>.  The same one which the Financial police accused
of loaning money provided by the Croatian government for the reconstruction of
Dubrovnik hotels to its "business associates".  Therefore, Kutle is supposed to pay
the first instalment for <em>Dalma maloprodaja</em> with this credit.<P>

<h2>Who Will Get <em>Dalma's</em> Money?</h2>

The public will also be interested to find out who will receive those DM 1.8 million.
<em>Dalma</em> employees, 580 of them, were hoping, since they had been promised so,
that this money would be spent for their wage arrears and for payments to their
pension and health insurance funds.  Well, promises are one thing and the reality
is something else.  Well informed sources claim that those 1.8 million will
very soon appear on the Split city administration accounts, since <em>Dalma</em>
owes to the city administration for some 30 offices which it had used and which
are the property of the city.  Disappointed employees claim that somebody's
dirty hands are involved in this transaction.<P>

The aforementioned offices were formally used by <em>Dalma</em>, but the
company has lately subleased most of them to various private entrepreneurs.
Based on that logic, the city administration is owed money by those
entrepreneurs and not <em>Dalma</em>.  However, the logic of employees
is one thing and the logic of capital and primary accumulation of the capital
is something else.  According to the latter logic, the employees will be
short-changed and the money will go to the city administration accounts;
in its turn, the city administration will use those fund to finish the
sewage treatment plant in the harbor.  Therefore, Kutla obtains <em>Dalma</em>
while Grabic and the guys from HDZ get political points which will surface
in the clean harbor.  And the employees?  They can only hope not to be laid off
as technological surplus.<P>

Kutle isn't the inventor of the system for indirect take-over of companies,
but he uses it a lot.  He also used that system in the operation <em>Prerada</em>.
Shares of that successful Split company were bought for Kutle by a businessman
from Austria; the employees (management as well?) were surprised to find out
that they were a part of Kutle's empire.  With that acquisition, the brightest
star in the constellation of newly formed Croatian capitalists obtained a nice
dowry: a working brewery, whose value has suddenly jumped after concluded
contract for production of German bear "Kaltenberg", successful bakery which
supplies most of central Dalmatia with bread, storage silo in North harbor,
tens of shops in Split and neighborhood...<P>

<h2>Gold Fish</h2>

In order to complete and insure all these acquisitions, business wizard from
Siroki Brijeg initiated the take-over of the insurance company <em>Jadransko
osiguranje</em>, again by buying shares from small shareholders.  This undertaking,
as many others is financed by <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em>.<P>

These days one can hear the following story around Split: Kutle caught a gold
fish and said to her: "Gold fish, tell me your three wishes and I will fulfil
all of them."  Those who laugh at this story forget that Kutle has already caught
two gold fishes.  The first one fulfilled all of his wishes several years ago.<P>

<h1>Crime as a Part of the National Program: Mercenaries</h1>

<strong><em>by Viktor Ivancic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, April 22 1996</h2>

Three years ago, twenty-years-old Dean Milic, a member of the First Guard
Battalion (elite unit of the Croatian Army which provides security for
president Tudman and is under direct command of Defense Minister
Gojko Susak) in [the town of] Novska brutally murdered Stjepan Grgic, lieutenant in the
Croatian Army, his wife Tomislava, son Ivan (13), and daughter Annamaria(4).
Dean Milic was tried by a Military court in Zagreb and given the harshest
possible sentence: twenty years in prison.  However, he was released together with his accomplices
immediately after the end of the trial.  Judge Zeljko 
Horvatovic stated that the murderers were released because of the amnesty law. 
The public found out about this trial and the scandalous release only after
Milic recently committed another murder (he shot to death 22-years-old
Tomislav Ilic in night club "Podmornica" in Zapresic [near Zagreb]).<P>

Four and a half years ago, Mihajlo Hrastov, member of a Croatian special
forces unit, murdered 13 imprisoned reserve members of the Yugoslav Peoples
Army on a bridge over the Korana river, near Karlovac; first he shot at the
unarmed prisoners from a machine gun and then finished them off, execution 
style, with an additional shot to a head.  Hrastov was acquitted by the District
Court in Karlovac.  In January 1994, Croatian Supreme Court annulled that 
verdict and ordered a new trial which hasn't
taken place until today, two years later.  In the meantime, president Tudman decorated Mihajlo Hrastov
for a "heroic deed in the war".  Ten days ago, after the ceremonial induction
of Foreign Minister Mate Granic for a honorary citizen of Karlovac, Hrastov
was given a special prize of the Karlovac county as one of the first six
local citizens to be honored in that way.<P>

Last year, Sinisa Dvorski, a character from the Kostajnica front with cult 
like following (one of the first "Croatian national heroes" who is now in jail
after admitting the murder of Anton Marcelo Popovic from Vrsar) was
tried by a Military court in Karlovac for the attempted murder of five people
by a grenade in the Pula restaurant "Admiral".  Dvorski was acquitted because of 
an alibi provided by Sime Marinic, head of local HDZ [Croatian ruling party] in Vrsar, who later paid
Dvorski to kill Popovic: Marinic testified that Dvorski had been in his night club  
when the attack had taken place.  Kostajnica Rambo had recently been released from
the Croatian Army and the initiative of the Defense Minister Gojko Susak
to put him in charge of training of Special Forces units in Zagreb was shelved
because of pragmatic reasons.<P>

A year ago, Sinisa Rimac, a member of the First Guard Battalion was decorated
by president Tudman for "a heroic deed in the war".  A short time before that,
at the trial for the bestial murder of the Zec family, Rimac defended himself
by silence.  He was acquitted because of the lack of evidence.  Investigation
documents in which Rimac and his accomplices confessed the murder of the Zec
family and numerous other crimes against civilians which they had committed
as the members of the unit under the command of Tomislav Mercep [member of 
Croatian parliament], stationed
in Pakracka Poljana, were declared legally void.  Today Sinisa Rimac attends
higher military schools with the state scholarship in order to prepare himself
for a future command post [in the Croatian Army].<P> 

A year ago, Ivica Besic and Mato Krizanac (also members of the First Guard
Battalion which takes care of president Tudman's security) together with another
four soldiers broke into Marija Zuzija's apartment in Zagreb in order to
evict her family from the apartment.  Epilogue: a raped Ukrainian girl;
two of her friends beaten up and robbed; the Zuzija family out in the street.
Unfortunate Ukrainian girls were taken to a prison that night and later
"disappeared".  Despite witnesses, the state prosecutor still hasn't indicted
the accused for rape, robbery and assault.  Instead, Ivica Besic and 
Mato Krizanac, elite Croatian soldiers, sued <em>Feral Tribune</em> which
had written about this case, because of "violation of privacy, honor and
dignity".<P>

These are only some of examples which demonstrate to which extent the myth
about Indomitable Croatian Knight can be a bloody illusion.  If we didn't
have well intentions we would compare it with the recent painful debate in the 
Parliament about "the Hague law".  Even the opposition leaders, pleading for the adoption of the
law on "practical grounds", denied "the unbiased character of the Tribunal
in the Hague" (Racan [leader of the Social democrats, former Communists])
, claimed that "the international community uses the Tribunal to
establish the artificial balance of guilt for the war in the former Yugoslavia,"
and added that they would "vote for the law" but "with big qualms" (Tomac).<P>

The hypocritical Croatian parliament has never questioned work of Croatian
courts nor has anyone expressed "qualms" because of mass acquittals of knights-
criminals.  Even during the recent debate, no one expressed "moral dilemma"
because Dario Kordic, indicted for war crimes by the Tribunal, spends a lot
of time in Zagreb and frequents party and state functions; or because Ivica
Rajic, under protection of the Ministry of defense, lives in the Ministry owned
apartment in Split and gives heart rending interviews to obscure newspapers.<P>

The protective mechanism which has, almost without exception,  turned the 
perpetrators of cruel crimes into "heroes of the Patriotic war" is not of
spiritual nature.  Croatian "legal state" did this through its concrete
decisions behind which remains a paper trail.  The authorities showered
decorations and rewards on these criminals to elevate a formal release from
guilt to a moral victory.  However, spiritual climate in which a crime is treated  
as a shameful detail or "necessary evil", and becomes a part of the
Greater National Interest, was not engendered only by the ruling party but by the
whole Croatian political elite.<P>

In the end a steep price has to paid for that.  While <em>anonymous corpses</em> 
are falling left and right and disappear in the darkness of police files,
it is sufficient that Dvorski, or someone else, murders a <em>too well known</em>
individual to disturb the idyllic picture.  The price for that false
idyll is the price for the lack of freedom: Croatian political elite, that numerous
hypocritical club, has long time ago willingly become a prisoner of
the Greater National Interest, which is, by definition, <em>common</em> and
<em>romantic</em> and must remain unblemished at any cost.  Evan at the price
of blindness.  Having in mind that "popular representatives" also have to consider
a possible loss of office, in extreme situations they have two possibilities: 
to become murderers or sycophants, and always mercenaries.<P>

<h1>Herceg Camp</h1>

<strong><em>by Gordan Malic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, April 29 1996</h2>

University Professor <strong>Fahrudin Rizvanbegovic</strong> was arrested as a civilian
in his birthplace Stolac, on July 1993, and then transferred to the HVO 
"collection center" in Dretelj.  All together, he had spent six months in
Hercegovina camps (Dretelj and Ljubuski) and during that time he had witnessed
cruel interrogations, torture, hunger and murders.<P>

There were thirteen year old boys and men over the age of
seventy among the camp inmates.  In front of the other inmates, the children slowly changed and 
started looking like "classic" camp inmates, like the ones we remember from
the documents about Dachau, Kolima or Omarska.  After his release, Prof. 
Rizvanbegovic spent some time in Zagreb, and today he lives in Sarajevo
where he is the Minister for Education in the government of the Bosnian 
Federation.<P>  

According to his estimate, during the summer months of 1993 there were 
about 20,000 Bosniaks in the "collection centers" all over Croatian Community
of Herceg Bosna: in Gabela, Dretelj, Ljubusko, at Helidrom near Mostar,
in Otoka near Vitina, Kocerin, Posusje, Duvno, Sujica, Bijelo Polje and
Siroki Brijeg.  In some of the camps prisoners were brutally tortured and
murdered.  It is known that tens of Bosniaks died from the consequences
of torture.  Until today, none of the criminals has been tried; the commanders
of the camps were promoted to new duties, while the "collection centers" were
disbanded and emptied or are still used for the same purpose.<P>

It is necessary to remind that the infamous camps in Dretelj and Gabela are
only half an hour drive from the Croatian border, right next to the
highway, and that for months they hadn't been visited by a single Croatian
official, nor a Croatian journalist, Catholic priest, Red Cross member....
In August 1993, Helsinki Watch members were denied access to the camp and then,
as usually happens in such circumstances, the whole case reached foreign
press.  Then, the season of unpleasant questions for the Croatian public
began, and the story started from its tail.<P>

<h2>Praljak's Lebensraum</h2>

<strong>Roy Gutman</strong>, Pulitzer prize winning journalist who has witnessed
these crimes himself, writes about those times:<P>

"Only a year ago, Croats and Muslims fought against the Yugoslav Army which had
been controlled by Serbs.  Today, they are stuck in the agony of a total civil
war.  Mostar is the main prize.  Old city is the site of aimless destruction,
which reminds one of Vukovar...   Even Sarajevo appears untouched
in comparison with eastern Mostar.  Every day, at least two to three people die from hunger or 
sickness.  Hundreds of artillery grenades, fired from the western side of the Neretva
river, slam day and night into the mostly Muslim old city, killing every day
8 people and wounding another 30."<P>

Gutman characterizes Croat-Muslim conflict as "a war within a war"; he finds
the explanation for this conflict in the reasons given by the commander of
the HVO units, general <strong>Slobodan Praljak</strong>, in his interview with
Gutman.  General Praljak openly defined the war with the German term <em>Lebensraum</em>
(living space) which once upon a time had been used as the justification for the Nazi
aggression against the European east.<P>

"Croatian command (signed by the then Defense Minister, <strong>Bozo Rajic</strong>)
on April 15 demanded to be given military control over three 'Croat' provinces
from the <strong>Vance-Owen</strong> plan, including Mostar.  Seeking
an ethnically cleansed state under the name of Herceg Bosna, Croats started
stopping convoys; the siege of Mostar begun on May 9," writes Gutman.<P>

One of the responsible protagonists of Hercegovina struggle for <em>Lebensraum</em>,
General Praljak, is probably the greatest rhetorician and adventurist of the
failed war adventure with Muslims;  in the same situation, as he repeats today,
he would "repeat this war hundred times over," as if it were an unsuccessfully
executed movie scene.  From the point of view of what we usually call Christian
morality, the totally warped criteria of this tireless veteran reminded the author
of this article of the meeting with the then commander of Mostar HVO, <strong>
Jadranko Topic</strong>.<P>

The war in Mostar was still going on, which could have been concluded at
the western entrance to the city: next to a steep trail one could see the 
barrels of large sniper rifles <em>Beretta 12.5</em> poking from a freshly
dug out trench; their owners, Irish professionals, were aiming at the distance
with their fingers firmly pressed against the trigger; every morning they moved 
to another deadly location.  In the city, detonations could have been head
at the time when the former wing attacker from the soccer team "Velez" received
us in his office at the "Velez" stadium.  Office walls were decorated with
Croatian symbols and the sign of the Croatian Soccer Club "Zrinski".  After
offering us coffee and cigarettes, Topic gave us his view of the whole problem:<P>

<h2>Topic With A Megaphone</h2>

"I don't claim that Muslims don't have a rightful claim to Mostar;  their claim
is as good as ours or Serbs' claim," he admitted.  "The only question is who
is strong enough to realize that claim."<P>

Behind this "innocent" interpretation one could see a sarcastic stare of a peaceful
and not terribly worried man.  Several months earlier (at the beginning of
May 1993) he had been walking around the Old city with a megaphone and calling 
on Bosniaks to surrender and hang white sheets on their houses.  
 One of the bloodiest micro-wars in the Bosnian war started those days, 
 with a cannonade of the HVO artillery; this war was probably the strongest argument for the thesis about
a civil war in Bosnia.<P>

Somewhat earlier, sudden raids and arrests of Muslims, HVO members, had begun
in Stolac county.  Commander of a HVO Bosniak unit "Bregava" was arrested and
taken to the barracks near Capljina.  Soon the members of the main SDA council
for Stolac, humanitarian organization "Merhamet" and the most respected leaders
of the Islamic community in Stolac were detained.<P>

Thus begun the ethnic cleansing of Stolac which was completed during the first
five days of August.  Out of more than 8,000 Stolac Bosniaks (more than 80 percent
of the town population), only a few families remained in the town, mostly thanks
to mixed marriages, commercial contacts or the debts of other nature - for example
the one that was repaid to a Muslim family by the Mostar bishop <strong>Peric
</strong>.  The old Bosniak family had done the same thing for Peric fifty years 
ago when they saved him from the persecution of Partisans.<P>

In a pretty detailed and ambitious booklet, "Crimes in the Stolac county, 1992-
1994," which has recently been published by the eastern Mostar authorities (and
was characterized by the western Mostar authorities as a "flagrant violation
of the Dayton agreement"), one can find a detailed chronology of this local conflict.<P>

The booklet mentions the names of the individuals responsible for the events
in Stolac and gives a longish list of local politicians, starting with <strong>
Mate Boban, Pero Markovic, Ivan Bender, Jadranko Prlic</strong>;  it continues
with the HVO officers, above all the HVO Chief of Staff, Slobodan Praljak, and then
also the local leaders: Police commanders in Stolac <strong>Valentin Coric</strong>
and <strong>Pero Raguz</strong>, president of the local HDZ, <strong>Andelko 
Markovic</strong> and the command of the town HVO led by <strong>Bozo Pavlovic</strong> 
and <strong>Veselko Raguz</strong>.<P>

<h2>Cleansing of Stolac</h2>

The accusations didn't spare military units such as the HVO brigade "Prince
Domagoj," HVO members from west Hercegovina, Neum and Capljina and numerous
smaller units such as the group "Bozanovi" "responsible for the murder of 
civilians".  Although the comments from the Croatian side avoided to mention the evidence
presented in this book (based on numerous testimonies) the comments did not fail to
put a lot of emphasis on pretentious indictments of the highest officials from
the Republic of Croatia: president <strong>Tudman</strong>, ministers
<strong>Susak</strong> and <strong>Jarnjak</strong>, General <strong>Bobetko</strong>
and former Prime Minister <strong>Nikica Valentic</strong>.<P>

It seems that the Bosniak authors were not absolutely objective in their assessment
of the general situation in Stolac (for example, it doesn't make sense to accuse
Croatian Army units of "the occupation of the town" when the town had been under the Serb
control immediately before that action).  But that sort of exaggeration cannot
discredit other facts stated in the book, let alone be used for constructions
about Muslim "Serbofilia", greeting of the YPA tanks with flowers etc.<P>

A while ago, when I asked the local Croats whether Muslims had greeted the YPA
tanks with flowers they replied that the Serb tanks had been greeted with flowers
by only one person.  By a mentally unstable Bosniak woman whose husband had died
as an officer of the Yugoslav Army in Croatia.<P>

It is clear why the commentators from Herceg Bosna skirted around the interesting
evidence presented in the aforementioned booklet.  Most of the evidence deals 
with the experiences of the Bosniak camp inmates.  Namely, a good number of
arrested Bosniak inhabitants of Stolac was taken on July 13 1993 to the HVO camps
in Dretelj and Gabela; at the same time, their property was systematically
looted and set on fire.<P>

All the recognizably Islamic buildings in Stolac (which make up a large proportion
of the town) had been burned and then razed to the ground.  First under attack
were four Stolac mosques, the oldest one of which, Careva Mosque, was built in 1519.
The old Stolac square, Tepa, was burned and razed to the ground; today is has
been cleared of ruins and is ready for the building of the Square of Ante Starcevic
[19 century Croatian politician, "father of the nation"]; Stolac authorities
have even prepared plans for the square within a new development plan for the town
and are seeking projects for the future square.  Muslim cemetery, located behind
Tepa, was the only object to survive untouched during the first days of the HVO rule;
however, after the Dayton Agreement, it has been demolished, together with a score 
of remaining Bosniak objects, and prepared for the Croatian re-design.<P>

<h2>Hangars in Dretelj</h2>

Even today, HVO rejects accusations for an organized urbicide [murder of a city],
saying that the destruction was the result of combat.  These claims are easily 
discredited by a sad inventory of the Bosniak objects upstream from the Neretva's 
source, all the way to Jablanica.  <em>Feral</em> has obtained documents which 
demonstrate that the destruction of mosques (in Jabalanica county) and the
looting of Muslim houses was done systematically, according to the orders from the
HVO command.  One of the commanders, who had signed the document as <strong>Marko
Rozic</strong>, commander of the defense office in the Jablanica county, had carried out
the order of his superiors to destroy two mosques in Jablanica and loot and burn
Bosniak property, and was seeking further instructions.  Marko Rozic is today
an important official for humanitarian matters in the government of Herceg Bosna.<P>

We find the similar situation with those who were responsible for the "collection
centers" (as the camps were euphemistically called by <strong>Nedeljko Mihanovic</strong>),
although, in this case, it is harder to document the involvement of the higher
officials, since they tried not to leave written documentation.  According to
the book "Crimes in Stolac County,"  1559 Bosniak men and 49 women and elderly from
Stolac were detained in the HVO camps.  19 of them died in the camps.<P>

They stayed in the camps between April 1993 and April 1994 when the last group of
inmates was released.  However, after the release, the former inmates, mostly
from the counties of Mostar, Jablanica and Stolac, were not allowed to return to 
their homes.  Some of them were sent to Croatia, to a collective center on
the island of Korcula; from there, they were later sent abroad.  1916 inhabitants
of Stolac county had been expelled from Bosnia-Hercegovina.<P>

Camp Dretelj consisted from 6-7 hangars, 2 concrete tunnels and two cells for
solitary confinement which had been used for punishment.  450-700 people were 
squeezed on 200 square meters of one hangar.  During the summer months, the 
temperature in hangars would reach 50 C.  The situation in the tunnels 
, whose entrances were blocked by metal doors which had always been kept shut,
was the same.<P>

Camp in Gabela used the buildings of an old YPA ammunition depot.  It consisted of
4 hangars and 3 cells for solitary confinement.  Camp commander, <strong>Boko
Presic</strong> had been famous as a madman, and later (after the end of his "tenure") 
was allegedly confirmed to be clinically insane.  At the beginning of October 1993, 
Previsic murdered <strong>Mustafa Obradovic</strong> in front of a large number
of witnesses, because the victim had tried to smuggle food leftovers into 
one of the hangars.<P>

This journalists has obtained a confession of one of the guards from the Gabela
camp; this man was a local from the neighboring village, was educated and had
been forcibly mobilized into HVO; he requested to stay anonymous.  His statement
confirms numerous cases of torture and executions of the prisoners by the HVO
members.<P>

"During the night we were often visited by the soldiers from the elite HVO units
from western Hercegovina; those units were reportedly under direct control of
Mate Boban or <strong>Tuta Naletic</strong>," claimed this witness.<P>

"They would make me open the hangar door and then they would pour water on
the prisoners inside from a fire hose.  Then they would take some of the prisoners
outside and beat them.  Sometimes they would shoot at them, without aiming,
which would result in deaths," he admitted.  "Every day, we forced Muslims to
sing Croatian patriotic songs, Ustashe songs, or lecture them about the dangers
of 'Alija's fundamentalism'".<P>

Prisoners had to urinate and defecate inside hangars and 
a lot of them ended up drinking their own urine because of terrible thirst.  It seems almost
unbelievable that for the existence of such torture camps the majority of
Croatian politicians found out from the foreign press.<P>

<h2>Tudman's Camps</h2>

In a conversation with <strong>Stjepan Mesic</strong> we find out that president
Tudman had his own opinion about the "character" of these institutions: "Others
have camps too."  Tudman later repeated this claim several times, although unfortunate
Nedeljko Mihanovic had constantly been trying to put a different spin on the
truth about "collection centers".  According to Mihanovic, these "institutions" 
could not have been concentration camps since the number of violent deaths in them was
small; actually the deaths were accidental, unlike in the formal perfection
of millions of victims and chemical technology (one wonders why he used Nazi
camps for comparison when we have examples from our own past).<P>

Even if president Tudman made a slip of tongue, he didn't lie, that's for sure.
According to usual humanistic standards, and the Geneva convention, Hercegovina
camps were definitively concentration camp; until today
no one has been indicted for the crimes committed in these camps 
(not even by the Hague tribunal which seems strange).<P>

A small, and for Croatian politicians irritating, booklet about the crimes in
Stolac is an ambitious step in that direction.  It does not spare any one of
the Croatian leaders.  To what degree that step is based in the political reality,
and to what degree it was based on the impulses of humiliated Bosniaks, is a question
to which the only answer can be given by philosophers like Slobodan Praljak.<P>

Lecturing the world powers about the war morality (Dresden, Hiroshima, Vietnam)
as if someone had given him a mandate to repeat catastrophic historical examples,
this supporter of the theory of Hercegovina <em>Lebensraum</em> would probably
gladly push the pendulum of responsibility towards the international community 
which hadn't done its job.  Why would he be guilty, when he was only doing his 
job, using all the opportunities that the job offered?<P>

<h1>Race and Power</h1>

<strong><em>by Viktor Ivancic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, June 3 1996</h2>

"They are the ideologues of the Yugoslav communist regime, children
of  Yugoslav army officers and the offspring from the mixed marriages
of Croats and Serbs!"<P>

This intellectual masterpiece hasn't been spitted out by one of the drunk
Schwartz's [leader of Croatian neo-Nazi's] fascists but by the president
of the Croatian republic, Dr. Franjo Tudman.  This statement wasn't made
in a pub at the Zagreb train station, but was published on the pages of 
the London <em>Financial Times</em>, last Thursday, May 30, exactly on
the Croatian statehood day, and recorded by well known journalist
Laura Silber, also known as the author of the book about the BBC documentary
"Death of Yugoslavia".<P>

After all, the objects of Tudman's morally justified racist rage, "the ideologues
of Yugoslav communist regime, children of Yugoslav army officers and the offspring
from mixed marriages of Serbs and Croats", are the journalists from <em>Feral
Tribune</em> whose trial for the slander of the Croatian president will start 
in a few weeks in Zagreb.<P>

An interesting character, that Croatian president.  The majority of Croats did not 
need to read his statement to the <em>Financial Times</em> in order to understand
that, for a first time since Ante Pavelic [Croatian fascist leader during W.W.II],
they are being led to a brighter future by a <strong>declared racist</strong>;
still this statement will be useful for a better understanding of the strategy 
for national development which is served [to the public] under the title "race and power".
Namely, the implementation of the great national task is neither easy nor 
a theoretical undertaking; the chief executive will have to rewrite more-or-less
everything: recent and ancient history, internal and external political reality,
and finally the origin and composition of the blood cells of <em>mandatory enemies</em>.<P>

As a descendant of a traditionally civilian family in whose veins flows pure
Croatian blood (which fills him with happiness, haemoglobin and shame) the author
of this article wonders what really bothers the Croatian leader?  What is his problem?
They say that Hitler's aunt was a Jew (we won't mention here Pavelic's wife)
and that a private hatred and frustration, since it couldn't have been acted
out on a psychiatric couch or through sport, was partly built in a global
ethnic mission and a grandiose National Program.  What are the links between
General Tudman, the Yugoslav Peoples Army and mixed marriages?<P>

As far as <em>Feral</em> is concerned, the president has gone back on some of
his previous accusations.  A few months ago at the session of his party's Central
Committee, he said that the journalists and collaborators of this paper were
the followers of "Chetnik platoons" [Serb royalist army during W.W.II, committed
crimes against Croatian and Muslim civilians] and "Orjunas units" who used to "beat up 
Croatian people".  These Croatian people, who are safe and sound today, demand
protection from him and ask in their letters for his help:<P>

"I receive letters, from ordinary citizens and university professors.  They
ask me: 'Mister President, why does the state allow such lunacy and humiliation
of Croatia?'" says Dr. Franjo Tudman in <em>Financial Times</em>.  European
concern because of the attacks on freedom of press in Croatia he deems "absolutely
without basis and totally unacceptable," since "That is not freedom of press.  That 
is not democracy, that is anarchy!"  Yes, that is a wolf! That is madness!
That is a president!<P>

(In brackets, as appropriate, let us mention that Europe, after all, is something
else.  On the same page of  the <em>Financial Times</em> where the "dossier Croatia"
was given a detailed treatment we can also see a paid advertisement of "Kapitol 
Bank" - "Croatia's first company for managing investment funds".  The owner of
that company is a young businessman Dejan Kosutic; he founded the bank with 
 the capital provided by his mother Nevenka Tudman [President Tudman's daughter]
, private entrepreneur and the owner of a store in Zagreb.  
The "Kapitol Bank" advertisement in the <em>Financial
Times</em> was adorned by the <em>motto</em>: "When investing in the country
of the future, seek out those who produce opportunities!"<P>

That is Europe.  Free market of people, capital and ideas.  Europe doesn't
care that Nevenka is a child of a former Yugoslav Peoples Army general [president
Franjo Tudman], and Dejan a child from a mixed marriage [Dejan's father, 
Nevenka's former husband is a Serb].<P>

As far as the domestic affairs are concerned, once everything is put together,
<em>Feral's</em> journalists had a pretty lenient treatment:  the man who falsely 
introduced them as "the ideologues of the Yugoslav communist regime", "children
of the Yugoslav army officers", and "the offspring from the mixed Croat and 
Serb marriages", with the obvious implications that these things are horrible
in itself, has certain problems with his own pure-Croatian pedigree: he is the
former Yugoslav peoples Army officer, father of an officer's child, grandfather
of a child from a mixed Croat-Serb marriage and his only bright spot is that his
wife is neither Serb nor Jewish [during the 1991 election campaign Dr. Franjo
Tudman stated that he was grateful that his wife was neither a Serb nor a Jew].  
Although she was a Yugoslav Army officer.
Ciao.)<P>

<h1>From Lies to Lynch: Witch from Kolorina</h1>

<strong><em>by Boris Dezulovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, September 16 1996</h2>

</FONT><FONT SIZE="+3">Y</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1"><em>ou came back, huh?  
Remember that this is the last time.  You'll have nowhere to come to because
we will blow up your house!  Go, bre, back to your shity Yugoslavia
and swim in the Morava river!  You'd be better off leaving as soon as 
possible because you may end up with a broken back when you least suspect
it!"</em><P>

This charming anonymous letter greeted world famous tapestry artist 
<strong>Jagoda Buic-Wuttke</strong> at the beginning of August 1996
at her house in Dubrovnik, on the picturesque stones of Kolorina.
The letter was followed by new threats, verbal attacks and provocations;
the artist finally approached the authorities and they provided police
protection.  Despite police protection, anonymous "welcome committee"
decided that Ms Buic had had enough verbal threats.  On Sunday, September 1,
early in the evening, a group of young man surrounded Ms Buic's house
and tried to brake in through the front door.  Squeezed between two doors,
Ms Buic managed to get hold of a telephone and, after two unsuccessful
attempts to call the police, she managed to reach her friend, an officer
in the Croatian Army; he arrived to the house soon after that and managed
to pull her out of there.  Since then, Jagoda Buic hasn't been back to 
Kolorina: at the moment she lives "in exile" at Dubrovnik hotel "Excelsior".

<h2>"Open City"</h2>

Jagoda Buic's "case" has again filled the pages of newpapers.  
Besides passionate newshounds hardly anyone remembers how all of this
started.  In any case, today Jagoda Buic-Wuttke, a renowned artist whose
works are displayed in leading galleries all over the world, from New
York and Washington, to Paris and Amsterdam, isn't anymore one of the 
first names of Croatian art scene.  She is today a traitor who in the midst
of the aggression on her Dubrovnik demanded from the World powers to
hand the city over to the Serbs.<P>

It has never been conclusively determined who deserves credit for discovery
of these perfidious activities of "the witch from Kolorina".  The story
began in the Fall of 1991: at the start of September, when the first bombs
fell on Dubrovnik, at the time when Gruz [Dubrovnik harbor], Belvedere
and Imperial [hotels], and boats in the old harbor were burning, the 
rumors started that Jagoda Buic-Wuttke demanded at the yearly session of
UNESCO that Dubrovnik be demilitarized and declared an "open city"!  Allegedly
the news was released from the Ministry for Culture:  high official from 
the Ministry claimed that the report from the session in Paris, which deals
with Jagoda Buic's "appearance", mysteriously disappeared from his desk.<P>

<h2>Ball With Generals</h2>

Yellowed newspaper archives record that art historian from Zagreb, 
<strong>Radovan Ivancevic</strong>, was the first one to inform the public
about the shameful statement of the well respected artist;  at the end
of November he said to a <em>Danas</em> journalist that "<em>Jagoda Buic
spoke unannounced at the UNESCO session in Paris; she excitedly suggested
that Dubrovnik should be declared an open city under protection of UNESCO</em>."<P>

A few days later, on Sunday, December 1, 1991, an editor of Croatian Radio,
<strong>Mani Gotovac</strong>, produced the first reliable and all 
encompassing information about the "case Buic" in her weekly show "I need
an answer".  After comparing the idea of Dubrovnik as an "open city" with the
status of Hong Kong as an "open city" under the British protectorate, she
 concluded that Jagoda Buic had demanded that Dubrovnik become a protectorate
of Greater Serbia.<P>

"<em>If it weren't for the Croatian Radio show, 'I need an answer' the public
probably wouldn't have found out about the wartime activities of well 
respected artist Jagoda Buic,</em>"  <strong>Jagoda Martincevic</strong> wrote
two days later in <em>Vjesnik</em> outraged with the news.  After informing
the readers about the fact that "<em>pro-Yugoslav attitude of Jagoda Buic is well
known from earlier times</em>," Jagoda Martincevic added that the highly respected 
artist "<em>has never protested against the mindless destruction</em>," but 
has instead "<em>already started political games to ensure her future return 
to an 'open' Serb city.</em>"<P>

A day later, prodded, probably, by the "wishes of her listeners" who missed her first 
show about "case Buic", Mani Gotovac sent to <em>Vjesnik</em>  
her open letter to Jagoda Buic.  "<em>How should I address you? As a Lady 
who used to weave her tapestries in glory?  Or as a Lady from the high 
society?</em>" Mani Gotovac began her inspired letter from which the 
readers could find out that during the days "<em>when Dubrovnik entered
its first circle of hell,</em>" Mani Gotovac personally phoned Jagoda Buic
in France and pleaded:"<em>Jagoda, for God's sake, do something! Madam,</em>"
continued Mani, "<em>you told me then that you would do something! I trusted 
you.</em>"<P>

<h2>Serb Agent</h2>

Instead, according to the Croatian Radio editor, the artist demanded the status of
an open city for Dubrovnik at the UNESCO session in Paris.  "<em>Did you 
know that, at the same time the same demands were made by [Serb] General 
Raseta and [Serb politician] Vojislav Seselj?  You used their words -
 'open city'!  Madam, you were a ballet dancer at the same ball as
 Generals!</em>" concluded Mani Gotovac, adding "<em>But you shouldn't
worry about that.  Do not lower your eyes when you pass those who have lost
children, families, a house.  Preserve your charm.  Dubrovcani are gentlemen.
They will calmly say: Let her go!</em>"<P>

Only a few days latter, then powerful <strong>Bozic's</strong> <em>ST</em>
[tabloid newspaper] joined the "witch hunt".  "<em>The news had an impact of a bombshell,</em>" wrote
Tomislav Wruss.  "<em>Jagoda Buic, renowned Croatian and world artist, 
married to a famous banker Dr. Hans Wuttke, calls from Paris for the surrender
of Dubrovnik!</em>"  Wruss uncovered a detail which both Mani Gotovac and
Jagoda Martincevic had missed:  Jagoda Buic is a Serbian agent!  <em>ST</em>
journalist claimed that Serb agents had forced the famous artist to 
collaborate with the French branch of the Movement for Yugoslavia, APDDY, 
which wasn't hard since "<em>her husband advises Chinese government on 
economic matters, so it isn't difficult to guess, having in mind the recent
Chinese-Serb relations, what kind of instructions he could have received from
his employer.</em>"  Wruss backed up his claims by names and "well informed
sources" and concluded that "<em>Jagoda Buic has joined the gallery of women
who spread Milosevic's ideas around the world.</em>"  Finally he sent a 
message to Jagoda Buic and Dubrovcani: "<em>If Ms. Buic ever comes back to
 Dubrovnik, her house will again become what it used to be in the past: 
a quarantine.  Refuge for those who are rejected by their compatriots.</em>"<P>

Indeed, <strong>Salih Zvizdic</strong> soon wondered at the pages of <em>Slobodna
Dalmacija</em>: "<em>Will Jagoda Buic dare to look in the eyes of the gentlemen 
from the ancient city?</em>" Naturally, he doubted that the inhabitants of
Dubrovnik would "<em> if she ever dared come back to Dubrovnik, calmly and
like gentlemen say: let her go.</em>"  Because, "<em>instead of helping 
her brothers to save the City from the barbarians she in the company of Greater
Serbian propagandists pays visits to the French officials demanding that
Dubrovnik be declared an 'open city',</em>" that is "<em> exactly the same demand
as that of the Chetnik semi-intellectual and ideologist of slaughter, Vojislav
Seselj, and the mob of colonels on the Srd mount, who are getting drunk on
cheap brandy talking about what
they will take back to their homes in Sumadija and Niksic when they 'tomorrow'
capture Dubrovnik.</em>"  Because, after all, the "open city" means the same
 thing to Jagoda Buic and the colonels: "<em>To enter a city without fighting,
to arrest and murder its defenders, decimate the population, settle their own
people and change the blood of the city.</em>"<P>

<h2>Truthful Lies</h2>

To top everything, on the New Year eve Jagoda Buic joined the worst and
most despised traitors of Dubrovnik and Croatia in a special show on the
<em>Croatian Television</em>, "Quislings", in which words of the occupiers of
Cavtat [town near Dubrovnik] were superimposed on Ms. Buic's portrait!
By then everything that was to be known about the "artist" was out in the
 open.  The only remaining question was whether she will dare to return to 
the city which "<em>she wanted to surrender to Chetniks</em>"?  Only a few
 dissenting voices, like a letter of a group of Dubrovcani to <em>Slobodna
Dalmacija</em> which stated that "<em>Ms. Buic worked for the physical survival
of Dubrovnik and its inhabitants</em>", tried to break through the flood
 of criticizm.<P>

Throughout all of this no one tried to find out (the whole affair was undeniable!)
what had Jagoda Buic actually said at the UNESCO session in Paris.  The truth
wouldn't have fitted in the carefully assembled portrait of "the witch from
Kolorina":  Jagoda Buic did not demand at the session that Dubrovnik be 
declared an "open city".  Actually, she has never been to any gathering organized
by UNESCO!<P>

After finding out about the unprecedented campaign against her in the Croatian
media, Jagoda Buic sent a denial from Paris, together with the confirmation
from UNESCO that she has never spoken at a meeting organized by that organization.
Soon after that, professor Radovan Ivancevic, who had started the whole 
campaign, retracted his words.  Finally, even the Croatian television 
apologized to Jagoda Buic with a few shy words broadcasted late at night.<P>

What now?<P>

<h2>"Go to Serbia!"</h2>

Of course, Mani Gotovac was the first one with a come back.  In her reply 
to Jagoda Buic she with perfect easiness ignored her earlier monstrous lies
and added another accusation: on November 13, Jagoda Buic co-signed an open 
letter to George Bush which, true, doesn't mention an "open" but "<em>protected
city</em>"; however, it also mentions - "<em>civil war</em>"!  Mani Gotovac 
won a place in the world encyclopaedia of dishonor by her conclusion: 
"<em>True, she didn't speak at a UNESCO session.  But then, the force of logic
takes us to another conclusion: in the most difficult days for Dubrovnik and
Vukovar, Ms. Jagoda Buic was silent.</em>" (!!!)<P>

Ms. Jagoda Martincevic also raised her voice and jumped in as a crown witness
for the prosecution: in the aforementioned letter to George Bush, Jagoda Buic
"<em> found it impossible to put the adjective CROATIAN next to Dubrovnik
and Vukovar</em>"!<P>

The witch hunt ended.  But only after "the witch" has been forced out in the 
open and left to the hunters.  The question of guilt or innocence is never
of any importance in a "witch hunt".<P>

Denials and cynical "apologies" didn't change anything.  On the contrary -
exactly during this period Jagoda Buic was finally branded as a proven 
traitor of Dubrovnik and Croatia.  It just remained to be seen whether she
would dare come back to Dubrovnik and walk straight into a carefully set up 
trap.<P>

When, during the summer of 1993, Jagoda Buic finally "dared" and for a first 
time since the beginning of the war returned to Kolorina, she found that her
house had been broken into, demolished, looted and defiled by graffiti: 
"<em>Go to Serbia!</em>".  Jagoda Buic received the same kind of messages 
during the following summers and again this August.  "The last warning".
And then the hunters came out of bushes: well known "irresponsible individuals",
on which the initiators of "witch hunts" count in their defamation campaigns.
"Individuals" who fired shots from real guns at the house.<P>

This whole story wouldn't be so absurd and grotesque if any of the accusations
were even remotely true.  What did Ms. Buic actually do during those days when
Dubrovnik was going "through the first circle of hell"?<P>

On the morning of October 23 1991, she faxed an appeal for help to the 
city written by  <strong>Zeljko Sikic</strong>, mayor of Dubrovnik, to the dignitaries 
all over the world.  The 
message from her old friend and officer in the Croatian Army, <strong>Misa 
Mihocevic</strong> was: the appeal must reach French president 
<strong>Francois Mitterand</strong> before the ultimatum of Yugoslav
generals, after which they were supposed to start bombarding the city,
expired!  It was almost impossible to reach Mitterand at the time.  Jagoda
Buic hurried to <em>Palais Chaillot</em> to catch Mitterand's close adviser
<strong>Laurence Sudet</strong> during a play intermission;
Ms. Sudet promised (and fulfilled her promise) that the appeal would be
at the president's desk by the following morning.  Jagoda Buic hurried
back to her Paris apartment to a birthday party thrown for her husband
to which the president of the international organization for oil,
<strong>Helga Steg</strong> had been invited: two days before, Dr. <strong>
Hrvoje Kacic</strong> had asked Jagoda Buic to try to obtain an embargo
for oil deliveries to the Yugoslav Peoples Army from Ms. Steg.<P>

Difficult diplomatic birthday party was interrupted at about 11 p.m. by Mani 
Gotovac. She was asking for an interview for the Croatian radio on the
topic: what are you doing these days for Croatia and Dubrovnik?  Jagoda
Buic politely replied that she considered such an interview to be inappropriate
at the time, that she would rather not speak publicly about her activities.<P>

Mani Gotovac didn't get her interview; instead, a month later, she read
on the radio her "open letter to Jagoda Buic".  The flood gates were opened
and the lies burst out.<P>

<h2>Hunting Society</h2>

During all that time, "Lady from the high society at the ball with
[Serb] generals" kept sending, together with her husband, donations
for Dubrovnik: for a new roof on the Mala Braca monastery, for hospitals
in Split and Mostar, for the theater in Dubrovnik, for Matica hrvatska
[Croatian culture and arts organization], for refugee children and
kindergarten "Orsula"...  Because of her perseverance <em>International
Herald Tribune</em> published the news about the bombardment of Dubrovnik.
She has organized numerous exhibitions dedicated to Dubrovnik, and at
the request of Dubrovcani wrote many letters to politicians and officials 
all over the world: to the secretary general of UNESCO Federico Mayor, 
Bernard Kouchner, Hans D. Genscher...  Thanks to her messages, Lord Carrington
travelled to Zagreb before continuing to Belgrade.  The evidence for all 
this are numerous copies of faxes, correspondence with Hrvoje Kacic and
Miso Mihovcic and letters of gratitude from the Dubrovnik mayor.  There 
is also that infamous letter to George Bush, written by hand and entitled
"<em>Stop the destruction of Dubrovnik!</em>", in which Jagoda Buic directly
accuses Serb leaders and Yugoslav Peoples Army generals for the bombardment 
of Dubrovnik.<P>

Still, the strength and force of words, of lies, is miraculous and terrifying.
After all that, Jagoda Buic-Wuttke is still a traitor.  While I'm writing
this article, she is still "in exile" in Dubrovnik hotel "Excelsior".<P>

It is worth reminding ourselves - all this happened because of one publicly
said lie.  Because of an "open city" (a lie) and the "civil war" (which, according
to the international law, the war in Croatia was at the time).  Presidents 
Tudman and Milosevic confirmed that much with their
signatures on the agreement about the normalization of relations [between
Croatia and Serbia]; they agreed that there was never an aggression on Croatia
and Dubrovnik.<P>

Unfortunately, words are stronger than deeds.  "Witch hunters", however, sleep
peacefully today on already wilted remains of their war glory earned with
liquidation of quislings and traitors.  With astonishing ease, the same ease with
which she started the pyre five years ago, Mani Gotovac has recently stated
that she had nothing to do with Jagoda Buic's "case".  True, cheap plaster of
pathetic "patriotism" with which she and other "hunters" adorned the wall in front
of the execution squad has cracked and fallen off a long time ago, but the
 leaden, heavy, poisonous, and mendacious word has remained behind.<P>

They say that hundred times repeated lie becomes a truth.  
<strong>Goebbels</strong> knew about that; Croatian society of witch hunters
knows that as well.  And that kind of "truth" doesn't hurt.
It kills.<P>

<h1>Respect Our Primitivism</h1>

<strong><em>by Davor Glavas</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, September 23 1996</h2>

</FONT><FONT SIZE="+3">T</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1">ens of millions of Dollars in direct
economic aid were approved for the use of Federal partners in Bosnia based on
a simple post-Dayton equation which says that the number of rebuilt houses
is equal to the number of repatriated refugees; however, these funds have
disappeared without a trace, in the books of the local Croat and Muslim
authorities.  Even worse: the money which was earmarked for "the renewal of
ethnic tolerance and coexistence" and all other prescribed words with <em>multi</em>
prefixes, was used as efficient means for the completion of ethnic homogenisation.
Because of that, this case is far more than a simple financial scandal.<P>

<h2>Shocked  Americans</h2>

This financial project started at the end of January, 1996, when a group of the World
Bank experts concluded that it was "necessary to invest approximately 2.5 thousands
of millions of Dollars to rebuild damaged and destroyed houses, bring back
displaced persons and refugees and <em>reestablish ethnic coexistence in Bosnia</em>
Based on these decisions and the necessity to strengthen the Federation,
Croat and Bosniak partners were given initial funds necessary to build the first
2,500 destroyed houses in central Bosnia.  The only condition was that the houses 
should be rebuilt for previously identified families in the town where the family
lived prior to the war.  In their naivet and the illusory belief in the possibility
of a Bosnian <em>melting pot</em>, the World Bank experts demanded that priority be given to
the houses of Muslim expelled from regions with pre-war Croat majority and of Croats
expelled from regions with pre-war Muslim majority.  The sum of the initial investment
hasn't been revealed, but even rough calculations indicate that it ranges
in the tens of millions of Dollars.<P>

"After that," reveals for <em>Feral Tribune</em> one of the American experts 
who recently returned from a <em>fact finding</em> mission in Bosnia, "we
transferred initial sums to the accounts of the local authorities of several
municipalities in central Bosnia and waited for the beginning of reconstruction.
Several months later, we sent our people to check why the reconstruction hadn't 
started yet.  They were only able to establish that the funds had disappeared,
that none of the houses in predetermined locations had been repaired nor
rebuilt, but that the equipment and armament of the local police forces had
significantly improved.  We are convinced that this was the result of embezzlement,
typical of situations where local party and military bosses enjoy absolute
power.  We decided to write off those funds and to avoid future abuse by
directly allocating funds for reconstruction."  Still viewing the project
from the point of view of bad or good <em>management</em> foreign investors
chose reliable local contractors (as their contribution to development of
the local economy, another one of classic Bildtean myths), chose to pay in
instalments (after each completed phase of reconstruction) and located
the pilot program in Gornji Vakuf.<P>

<h2>Efficient Dynamite</h2>

A town with hardly 10,000 inhabitants, with two names (Uskoplje [new name used by
Croats]), two mayors, two police stations, and a street which divides the two 
communities: cafs on one side play nostalgic Sarajevo <em>rock</em> from the
early eighties, while those on the other play loud contemporary Croatian 
<em>dance</em> music.  Of course, the town is full of ruins whose facades have been mindlessly
polished with bullets from infantry weapons.  The result of the new strategy
in the reconstruction of houses for displaced persons (pay for specific work
only at the end of each phase of reconstruction) is almost ironic.  The houses
have been rebuilt and repaired all the way to the roof and the local contractors
paid for the completed work.  Then, there was a spate of night time explosions 
which at first damaged the rebuilt houses and then completely destroyed
them.  On both sides of the street.<P>

"After a while we realised what was going on," continues <em>Feral's</em> source.
"Local authorities on both sides simply do not want to go back to the pre-war
population mix; obviously they had instructions from above and chose to let
us know about that.  It is another problem that we took to long to realize that.
Finally, we were left with the choice of waiting that all the houses be again
demolished to the ground or to accept the proposals from the local authorities
and allow them to put <em>their</em> refugees in already finished houses. 
The houses are now guarded by both police forces, to make sure that someone doesn't
by mistake destroy <em>our</em> house."<P>

<h2>Hard Realism</h2>

The result of this noble project whose goal was <em>reconstruction of
multi-ethnicity</em> is the following: first half of the money was
used to re-equip police forces in neighboring ethnically cleansed 
municipalities; one can realistically expect that the new equipment will be
used to achieve even higher degree of national homogeneity; the other half 
was used to rebuild houses which were either razed to the ground or will be
used by refugees who in their misery are used to cement the war gains and
losses.<P>

The whole case illustrates the current clash of good intentions and hard 
realism.  The Dayton Agreement will continue to be officially treated as
holly gospel, while in the field it has long time ago dissolved into a
string of half measures, as was confirmed by the latest modification of
the implicit decision from Dayton about the rotation of the members of
the Bosnian presidency into an arbitrary decision about the extension of
Izetbegovic's mandate, made after the elections.  The American government will
support, until the last day of the [American] election campaign, the idea
of integral Bosnia, while American secret services in their latest
report do not leave room for doubt when stating that Bosnia is on a way to 
dissolution into three entities with "porous" international borders.<P>

<strong>Franjo Tudman</strong>, after a fifteen minute long meeting
in the White House dedicated to the abolishment of "Herceg-Bosna", openly
said to the journalists that he "[had] no messages for the Croats in Hercegovina,"
despite Dayton and Clinton (and not only because of his disappointment because
of <strong>Clinton's</strong> refusal to sell US fighter aircraft F-16 to
Croatia as "the key ally in the region").  In spite of officially proclaimed
policy of military support for the establishment of the joint [Croat-Muslim]
Federal forces, only a small amount of obsolete armaments from American
stockpiles has arrived so far to Bosnia, and there are rumors about the imminent 
withdrawal of American military advisers.  Even <strong>Richard Holbrooke</strong>
in spite of invested (although somewhat spent) energy and force, in his latest Balkan
adventure carries more resemblance to the builders of Vakuf/Uskoplje houses
than to the demon from Dayton.  (...)<P>

<h1>Kad Moze Fuhrer, Mogu i Ja!</h1>

<h2>Feral Tribune, 10. travnja 1995</h2>


<strong><em>Razgovor vodio Predrag Lucic</em></strong><P>

<strong>Danas kad diljem domovine obiljezavamo 10 travnja, bilo bi lijepo
da nasim citateljima objasnite zbog cega se taj dan dogodio bas nama?</strong><P>

Duznost nam je, ugodna i vesela, da se ovoga dana nasega slavlja,
naseg narodnog velikog slavlja, sjtimo onih kojima dugujemo veliku
i duboku zahvalnost za sve ono sto smo postigli i sto imamo, da
izrecemo zahvalnost nasim saveznicima i prijateljima, dvama velikim
narodima, narodu njemackom i narodu talijanskom, da izrecemo hvalu
napose njihovim velikim vodjama Duceu i Fuhreru, da izrecemo hvala
njihovim slavnim i nepobjedivim vojskama, koje su sa svojom krvlju 
i zrtvama toliko dopriniele da je hrvatska zemlja postala slobodna,
da je u njoj hrvatski narod svoj na svome.<P>

<strong>Nije li nezvisnost ostvarena zahvaljujuci stranim vojskama
kontradiktorna sama po sebi?</strong><P>

Doslo je vrieme kad mi hrvatski nacionalisti moramo govoriti otvoreno.
Predugo su mnogi od nas izuscivali otrcane liberalno-demokratske
krilatice - "oslobodenje", "nezavisnost" i "mir".  Ne treba nam vise 
tih bezsmislica.<P>

<strong>Nego kojih?</strong><P>

U novom redu, sto ga navjescuju veliki diktatori, ne moze biti
drugog oslobodenja, osim oslobodenja od otrcanih tradicija Matije Gupca
Stjepana Radica i od ideologije laznog seljackog pokreta.  Nema
nezavisnosti dok se dobrovoljno ne prilagodimo fasistickoj nauci i 
njenim vodama; nema mira dok su nasa braca Talijani zauzeti tako
ocajnom borbom.<P>

<strong>Sto Hrvatska ima s talijanskom borbom?</strong><P>

Imam svecano obecanje od samog Ducea da Hrvatska nece ostati nenagradena.
Bit ce joj dodieljena odlicna uloga u Novom redu, da bude spona
medu fasistickom Italijom i nacistickom Nemackom, jer ce buducnost
Dalmacije i veceg diela Hrvatske biti vezana s Italijom, dok ce
neki krajevi, kao Hrvatsko zagorje i jedan dio Slavonije
potpasti pod Nemacku.  No nemojmo se zbog toga uznemiravati.<P>

<strong>Oprostite, ali ne vjerujem da ce iole povrsniji citatelj
shvatiti od cega se sastoji ta nagrada, pa vas molim da to
malo plasticnije docarate.</strong><P>

Premda odieljeni granicama, bit cemo ujedinjeni u junackom duhu
odanosti uzvisenom totalitarnom idealu.  Nova Hrvatska ce doduse,
biti manja obsegom i siromasnija obiljem, jer cemo iz nje izagnati
sve protagoniste stranog kapitala, ali ce zato biti veca slavom i
bogatija duhom.<P>

<strong>Kako doseci taj ideal?</strong><P>

Novi red trazi da imate neograniceno povjerenje u mene, vaseg
Poglavnika, i u genij vasih fasistickih protektora.  Jednom zauviek
 moraju zamuknuti glasovi kritiziranja u vasim redovima.  Cuju se gnjevni
 glasovi koji vicu da kod vas nastaje glad i skupoca uslied toga sto se
zivezne namirnice i sirovine salju nasim osovinskim prijateljima.
Hrvati to more biti!  To je ono najmanje cim mozemo pomagati svojim
velikim susjedima.<P>

<strong>Cesto se ponavlja kako Hrvatska u pocetku borbe za svoju drzavnost
nije imala prijatelja u svijetu.  Kako ste probili taj led medunarodne
- blago kazano - nezainteresiranosti za uspostavu hrvatske drzave?</strong><P>

Prvi korak koji je trebalo uciniti jest obaviestiti talijanski nerod i 
njegova velikog vodu i drzavnika o pravom stajalistu Hrvata i cilju 
kojem teze, svracajuci im paznju na to da bi pomoc Italije borbi Hrvata imala 
ne samo veliko znacenje za europsku kulturu nego bi takoder bila i prvenstveno
vazna za razvitak Italije kao velesile.<P>

<h2>Jadranska orientacija</h2>

<strong>Kako bi to Hrvati pomogli Italiji da se razvije u velesilu?</strong><P>

Hrvati bez ikakve rezerve priznaju Italiji pravo na prevlast na Jadranu i 
osuduju svako nastojanje koje bi islo za tim da oslabi to jneno pravo
ili da ga se dovede u sumnju.  Hrvatska je odlucila odreci se drzanja ratne
mornarice na Jadranu, ako Italija zeli preuzeti zastitu hrvatske obale;
odstupiti Italiji u tu svrhu Boku Kotorsku s onim visovima koji su strateski
vazni za teritorij Dalmacije i Hercegovine; osim toga priznati Italiji pravo da na
otocima ili kopnu upotrebljava naprave potrebne za njenu djelotvornu zastitu
 i vojnu kontrolu.<P>

<strong>Ne bojite li se da bi teritorijalni i akvatorijalni ustupci Italiji mogli naici na stanovito neodobravanje pucanstva u juznim hrvatskim krajevima?</strong><P>

I ja volim jadransko obalno podrucje i suosecam s tamosnjim stanovnistvom, jer sam i sam, ako i moja obitelj, iz tih krajeva.  medutim, ja snosim odgovornost za drzavu i cieli narod i ne smiem to zrtvovati za volju jednog grada ili pokrajine.  U politickom radu more vladati razum a ne osjecaji.<P>

<strong>Predpostaviti je stoga da ste iznasli razumno rjesenje uvijek aktuelnog pitanja istocnih hrvatskih granica u cijoj zastiti ne mozete racunati na talijansku pomoc kao sto vam je to poslo za rukom ne jugu Hrvatske?</strong><P>

Sto se tice Baranje, Backe i jugoslavenskog Banata, Hrvatska smatra da je u njenom interesu da se ta podrucja vrate u zajednicu sa maticom zemljom; ona ce stoga uciniti sve sto moze da se te pokrajine doista i ukljuce u Kraljevinu Madarsku.<P>

<strong>iako ste upravo vi nazivali Hrvatsku bedemom odbrane zapadnih civilizacijskih stecevina, na Zapadu je vas politicki angazman priman s mnogo manje simpatija negoli npr. onaj dr. maceka.  Zasto je tome tako i kakvo je vase misljenje o hrvatskim politicaima koje ste pretekli u borbi za vlast?</strong><P>

Da, slavna Europa, slavna zapadna i kriscanska kultura i civilizacija nasla se je uviek slozna kada je trebalo poniziti hrvatski narod i prigusiti njegovu slobodu.  Slobodno zidarstvo nije napadalo one hrvatske stranacke politicare koji su zastupali zahtjev za autonomijom Hrvatske u granicama Jugoslavije na temeljima demokracije, jer su oni i sami djelomicno bili saveznici Zidova i slobodnog zidarstva.  Njihova djelatnost bila je uperena vecinom i izkljucivo protiv pokreta za potpunom nezavisnoscu koji nije ni slobodnozidarski ni demokratski, nego se bori za oslobodenje Hrvatske i za izgradnju unutrasnjeg reda i poretka na zdravim nacionalistickim nacelima, s pomocu kojih bi zauviek bio odstranjen utjecaj zidovsko-slobodnozidarske demokracije.<P>
 

<strong>Zasto mislite da su Zidovi a priori protiv hrvatske drzavne nezavisnosti?</strong><P>

Zidovstvo je s velikim veseljem pozdravilo osnivanje tzv. jugoslavenske
drzave, jer im hrvatska narodna drzava ne bi nikad tako odgovarala kao
Jugoslavija - drzava raznih naroda.  U narodnosnom metezu lezi Judino
carstvo; tu se moze zidovstvo kao novcano jak i prividno odan elemenat
drzavnoj vlasti dodvoriti i zadobiti naklonost vlastodrzaca.<P>

<strong>Pa nije valjda sve u novcu?</strong><P>

Hrvatska narodna drzava nije se svidala zidovstvu i iz razloga jer je 
osnivac modernog hrvatskog nacionalizma, dr. Ante Starcevic, bio
otvoreni protivnik zidovstva, antisemit.<P>

<h2>Novinstvo Zute Zviezde</h2>

<strong>Oprostite, u kojim novinama ste to procitali?</strong><P>

Cjelokupno novinstvo u Hrvatskoj, gospodine, nalazi se u zidovskim rukama.
To zidovsko-slobodnozidarsko novinarstvo neprekidno napada Njemacku,
njemacki narod i nacionalsocijalizam, a nakon toga pojavljuju se predstavnici
Beograda i prikazuju kao da se radi o novinstvu iz Hrvatske, te iz toga 
izvoda kao da su Hrvati neprijateljski raspolozeni prema Niemcima.<P>

<strong>Hocete reci da u Hrvatskoj zapravo nema medijskih sloboda?</strong><P>

Znate, ima ljudi koji uviek moraju biti u necijoj sluzbi, bilo kao
politicari, bilo kao novinari ili izdavaci kojega lista, pa
prosudujuci po sebi ne mogu si ni zamisliti da netko bude
slobodan i nezavistan u svojoj novinarskoj djelatnosti.<P>

<strong>Problem medijskih sloboda vezujete uz zidovsko pitanje.
Kako to mislite rijesiti?</strong><P>

Sto se tice Zidova, mogu vam izjaviti da ce oni u najkracem roku
biti konacno likvidirani.  U samom Zagrebu bilo ih je 18 tisuca, od 
kojih je ostalo jedva 4 tisuce, a i ovi ce biti poslani na prisilni
rad ili u koncentracijski logor.<P>

<strong>Zidovski ste problem jednom prigodom nazvali najhitnijim.
Sto je s manje hitnima i kada cete se koncentrirati na njihovo
rjesavanje?</strong><P>

Sto se tice Srba, tu je nastalo miesanje pojmova.  Oni su Hrvati
srbsko-pravoslavne vjere.  Ovo ce pitanje biti rieseno na najbolji
najzgodniji nacin.  Sporazumno sa njemackim vlastima poslat ce se
250 tisuca Srba u Srbiju, dok ce drugi ostati ovdje.  Kod njih
primjecujem jak pokret da se vrate u hrvatstvo i priedu na
katolicku vjeru.<P>


<strong>Kad smo vec kod toga, sto je s gospodinom Kosuticem?</strong><P>

Kosutic, to je najveci suft! Taj suft spada u zatvor!<P>

<strong>Nije tajna da ste pregovarali s jednim srpskim politickim liderom, ali nisu poznate pojedinosti tih pregovora.  Biste li nam mogli reci nesto o tome?</strong><P>

Mogu vam reci da smo dr. Stojadinovic i ja izmenili medusobno mosli o potrebi i vriednosti pomirenja obaju naroda.  Dr. Stojadinovic kao vrstan i izkustan politicar dobro je ocienio pravo stanje stvari kada se je otvoreno izjasnio za uspostavu drzave Srbije i drzave Hrvatske, znajuci da se samo tako mogu spasiti i ocuvati interesi i njegova naroda.<P>

<strong>Cuju se prigovori da vas nitko nije ovlastio za vodenje tih pregovora.</strong><P>

Ja nosim odgovornost sam za sve.  Preuzimam svu odgovornost i za vojsku, preuzimam odgovornost i za prehranu i za politiku i za zivote.<P>

<strong>Neki analiticari tvrde da je upravo taj visak vase odgovornosti uzrokom cestih rekonstrukcija vlade.</strong><P>

Ja ne trazim odgovornost ministara pred narodom.  Ministar je tu dok sluzi svrsi i nitko ga poslie ne pita za odgovornost.<P>

<strong>Zbog cega ste onda uopce sazivali sabor koji moze predstavljati samo smetnju vasoj odgovornosti?</strong><P>

Kad Fuhrer saziva parlament, mogu i ja Sabor.<P>

<h2>Obcenitost Zajednice</h2>

<strong>Nije li paradoksalno da vi, s jedne strane, na sebe primate svu odgovornost dok vas, s druge strane, neki intelektualci kritiziraju zbog apsolutistickih tendencija?</strong><P>

Mnogi hrvatski intelektualci stekli su iz razdoblja opozicijske borbe navike i shvacanja koji nisu pogodni za upravljanje drzavom.  Danas, kad smo odbacili ideje individualisticke i demokratske, citav narod postaje jedna obitelj, ono sto nieamci kazu Volksmeinschaft.  Pojedinci, pojedine osobe prestaju vriediti, osim kao dio Zajednice.  Ne moze Drzava sluziti dobru i probitcima pojedinaca, nego sve mora sluziti obcenitosti Zajednice.<P>

<strong>Kamo dalje, gospodine Pavelicu? Kamo ide ova Zajednica?  Jesu li u pravu defetisti koji tvrde da je hrvatska pred kriznim putom?</strong><P>

Ne cemo skrenuti s puta kojim smo posli, a to je put najvisih probitaka hrvatskog naroda i hrvatske drzave.  Za te probitke spremni smo pridonieti svaku zrtvu.  Ni jedna zrtva, bilo zivota, bilo krvi ili osobe, nije zrtva nego duznost, kada su u pitanju probitci naroda i drzave.<P>

<strong>Sto odgovoriti smutljivcima koji u ovim teskim trenucima dodatno zbunjuju hrvatski narod podmetanjima kako cete vi osobno skrenuti s puta na koji ste ga poveli?</strong><P>

Kad se dogodi da narod bude ostavljen od svog vode, kad se voda u kojeg je narod polagao, makar i svu svoju nadu, iznevjeri nije time odsjecena i glava narodu, nije time izcupano i korienje velikog narodnog stabla, jer pojedinci ljudi zivu i umiru, bitisu i nestaju, a narod ne zivi viekom jednog covjeka nego mnogim stoljecima, ne izunire po nevjeri jednog covjeka i nekolicine ljudi, nego svoj zivot prenasa na daljnje potomstvo, koje s njime sacinjava jednu cjelinu.<P>

<hr><P>

<strong>Rodeni ste u Bradini, selu nedaleko od Konjica.  Kako protumaciti
cinjenicu da hrvatski lideri (da ih sad ne nabrajamo) u pravilu dolaze
iz seoskih sredina?</strong><P>

Seljastvo nije samo temelj i izvor svakog zivota nego ono samo po sebi
sacinjava hrvatski narod, te je, kao takvo, nosilac i vrsilac svake drzavne
vlasti u hrvatskoj drzavi.  Tko u Hrvatskoj ne potjece iz seljacke obitelji
taj u devedeset slucajeva od sto nije hrvatskog podrietla ni krvi nego je
doseljeni stranac.<P>

<hr><P>

<strong>Nedavno ste zatrazili izmjenu dosadasnjega mandata medunarodnih snaga u Hrvatskoj.  Kakav bi mandat zadovoljio hrvatske interese?</strong><P>

Predlozio sam da njemacke jedinice u NDH ne ostanu dalje pod zapovjednictvom kojemu je sjediste u Beogradu, nego da se podrede vlastitom njemackom zapovjednictvu sa sjedistem na hrvatskom teritoriju, buduci da bi koncetracija stozera u beogradu i dalje podhranjivala jugoslavenske uspomene.<P>

Na osnovu svojih serijatskih ovlastenja, ajatolah Republike Bosne i
Hercegovine donosi sjedecu<P>

                             <center><h1>CITABU</h1></center>

kako slijedi:<P>

<ol>
<li> Kako bi Republika Bosna i Hercegovina dobila na vremenu za izgradnju
moderne, demokratske, gradjanske i sekularne drzave, vrijeme se u BiH,
pocevsi od 1996. godine, racuna po hidzretskom kalendaru, sto znaci da
Nova godina ne dolazi 1.januara nego 19.maja jer 19.maja pada 1. muha
rrema, odnosno 1.sijecnja po hidzretskom kalendaru, sto znaci da to i 
nije Nova 1997. vec Nova 1417. godina po hidzretu, pa prema tome ni ovo
nije 1996. godina, nego 1416., jer 1996. pada tek 2576. godine, a do
tada ko ziv - ko rahmetli.

<Li> S obzirom da Nova godina vise nije 1.januara, jerje 1.januara tek 
10.sa'bana po hidzretu, vec je hidzretski 1.januar ustvari 19.maja, od
nosno 1.muharrema, to se zbog nemogucnosti ispunjavanja svojih obaveza
ukida Djed Mraz iliti Djed Bozicnjak, te se isti razrjesuje svih funkci
ja u Bosni i Hercegovini. 

<li> Umjesto cafirli Djeda Mraza na funkciju ajatolahovog savjetnika za
humanitarna pitanja imenuje se Amidza Kijamet, a umjesto kaurina Djeda
Bozicnjaka imenuje se Dedo Muhamednjak.

<li> Sluzbena uniforma Amidze Kijameta umjesto crvenog kozuha i kape biti 
ce zeleni curak i culah iste boje.

<li> Amidza Kijamet ce svake Nove godine u Bosnu i Hercegovinu dolaziti
na sanjkama koje ce vuci cetiri kamile.

<li> Amidza Kijamet nece praviti razliku izmedju postene muslimanske djece
i kaurske kopiladi, te svako dijete u Bosni i Hercegovini, bez obzira na 
vjeroispovjest, ima pravo od Amidze Kijameta dobiti na poklon ilustrirani
Kur'an.

                <h1>  UNPA-AV-AV ZONA</h1>

<strong><em>PERO S ONOGA SVETA - pise Petar Lukovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>"Feral Tribune" - 1.srpnja 1996</h2>


  Da se ne lazemo, polugoli Hrvati & sasvim nage Hrvatice: zivot u novo-
nastalim drzavama na tlu bivse tamnice svih nasih pomahnitalih naroda &
narodnosti (hrvatski & srpski: SFRJ) naucio nas je da na Balkanu nema 
iznenadjenja. Rat nikoga nije iznenadio onoliko koliko protuprirodni mir;
nije iznenadjenje ni da je Balkan politicki najstabilniji deo Europe/Evrope
jer se u pet-sest-sedam-ili-koliko-ih-vec-ima-drzava tokom poslednjih pet
godina nije dogodila nijedna promena partije ili licnosti na vrhu; ne
zvuci mi kao iznenadjenje ni odluka srpskog ministra za obrazovanje da 
zadatke za test povodom upisa u srednje skole i fakultete - cita preko
radija (!) jer su dosadasnji pokusaji stampanja zadataka bili uredno 
provaljeni, pa su se zadaci zajedno s resenjima mogli kupiti kod svakog 
boljeg dilera na ulici; nije iznenadjenje da Karadzica predlazu za pred-
sednika licne Republike Radovan; ne iznenadjuje me zelja Srbije da ne po-
deli nasledstvo pokojne SFRJ (srpski: tudje hocemo, svoje ne damo), nista
nas ne moze iznenaditi, svi smo mi odbrana a bogami i napad kad ustreba.
  Jedino sto me proslog tjedna iznenadilo je problem koji se nadvio nad
Balkanom i koji u ovom trenutku izgleda apsolutno neresiv; naime, uskoro
bi u Beogradu trebalo da se sastanu (hrvatski: okupe) predstavnici kino-
loskih saveza SR Jugoslavije, Hrvatske, Slovenije i Makedonije kako bi se
- pazite sad, pohotni Hrvati & skroz pohotne Hrvatice - dogovorili o po-
deli jedanaest rasa pasa bivse-pokojne-pizda-joj-materina SFRJ. Buduci da 
nemate pojma o cemu se radi, reci cu vam da je ex-Yugoslavia imala 11 rasa
pasa podeljenih u grupe gonica i ovcarskih pasa:<P>
 <ol>  <li> balkanski gonic
        <Li> bosanski ostrodlaki gonic - barak
   <li> istarski kratkodlaki
   <li> istarski ostrodlaki
   <li> jugoslovenski planinski gonic
   <li> jugoslovenski trobojni gonic
   <li> posavski gonic
   <li> dalmatinac
   <li> kraski ovcar
  <li> hrvatski ovcar
  <li> dugodlaki ovcarski pas (makedonski: sarplaninac)
</ol><P>

  Za neke rase, kazu pseci strucnjaci, nece biti dilema cije su: kraski
ovcar (sifra 9) pripada Slovencima do jaja, hrvatski ovcar (sifra 10), 
kako mu sama nacionalnost kaze, pripada drzavi Hrvatskoj & njenom pravo-
sudno uvazenom predsedniku; medjutim, Kinoloski savez SR Jugoslavije 
spreman je da stupi u ratna dejstva protiv Kinoloskog saveza Makedonije
zbog problema tzv. sarplaninca na ciju dlaku obe kinoloske drzave polazu
teritorijalno pravo.Srbi (hrvatski: narod najstariji) vec tvrde da je sar-
planinac stariji od Kosovskog boja, odrastao u pravoslavnom duhu sto mu
se vidi po oktroisanoj dlaci & svetosavskim ocima. Makedonci, pak, argu-
ment nalaze u sarplanincevoj frizuri koja se kroz vekove nije promenila
i koja je uvek bila tipicno makedonska, u obliku zelene paprike s njuskom
koja podseca na bitoljski paradajz iz staklenika.<P>
  Tek ce se zakuvati oko posavskog gonica (sifra 7) koji, nesrecnik, ima 
taj maler da je poreklom iz koridora (posavskog) na koji pravo polazu Srbi,
Hrvati, Muslimani i poneki Tajlandjanin rodom iz Bijeljine; sta tek reci 
o zlehudoj sudbini istarskog kratkodlakog na kojeg tipuje Srbija (Istra
je uvek bila sveta srpska zemlja; gde je istarski kratkodlaki - tamo su 
granice Srbije; istarski kratkodlaki nanjusio je Kosovo i odbranio srpske
manastire); apsolutno je najebao jugoslovenski planinski gonic (sifra 5) na
kojeg su se namerili Srbi, Hrvati, Makedonci, Slovenci a bogme i Bosnjaci,
svi reseni da ne odustanu od kvalitetnog gonica koji nacionalnog neprija-
telja efikasno izgoni sa rodjenog (srpski: zapaljenog) ognjista, bez la-
janja ili kevtanja.<P>
  Potpuno je neresena situacija oko jugoslovenskog trobojnog gonica (sifra
6) koji laje u tri boje (crveno, belo, plavo), hvata dezertere &kad zatreba 
glasa na buducim demokratskim izborima u B&H za jednu od tri strane koje u 
ratu nisu ucestvovale, jer su sve tri strane - otkrila je to nedavno Mirja-
na Markovic, Milosevic's wife - rat "prve zapocele", u isto vreme, na istom 
mestu, u istom danu rodjeni, u istom danu streljani, uz lavez trobojnog go-
nica s crvenom zvezdom na sapama.<P>
  Vrlo me se dojmila tuzna sudbina balkanskog gonica (sifra 1) koji ce naje-
bati po svim kriterijumima: Hrvati ce tvrditi da balkanski gonic nikad nije 
bio dio Balkana vec integralni dio hrvatske drzave koja svoju kinolosku vlast
vrsi na reintegriranim UNPA-AV-AV podrucjima; Srbi ce se zakleti da je bal-
kanski gonic bio drzavotvorna zivotinja vekovima pre kune; Makedonci pri-
premaju taktiku kojom bi dokazali da je balkanski gonic biio inspiracija
za tavce na gravce; Slovenci su radi da izjave da se balkanski gonic sam
popeo na Triglav odakle je jodlovao sve do 26.rujna 1991 kad je netragom ne-
stao jer je utvrdjeno da Slovenija nije nikad pripadala tzv. SFRJ vec srednjoj
Europi, srednjem im ga majci.<P>
  Onda: bosanski ostrodlaki gonic - barak (sifra 2), za kojega Radovan
Karadzic tvrdi da je branio srpski narod lavezom od 82 mm na Sarajevo,
sto se narocito pokazalo efikasnim u Srebrenici gde su ostrodlaki pojeli
desetak hiljada Muslimana u zasticenoj kino-zoni, tek da bi pokazali da je
pas najbolji muslimanski prijatelj.<P>
  Ukratko, pitanje tzv. kucica (hrvatski: dogs) iskazuje se kao kljucna
moralna dilema ovih prostora; resimo li misteriju da li je, recimo, istar-
ski kratkodlaki poreklom iz Pirota ili Pirana ili Bihaca - resicemo i tzv. 
krizu na prostoru tzv. bivse Jugoslavije. <P>
  Garantujem vam, erotizovani Hrvati & vanredno pohotne Hrvatice, da cemo
mi (hrvatski: Srbi, Hrvati, Bosnjaci, Makedonci, Crnogorci...) lakse pode-
liti zlato u polugama, ambasade ili lovu u bankama - nego sto cemo resiti
kuceci problem s rasnim karakteristikama naciona.<P>
  Nema tog Srbina koji nije spreman da pogine za jugoslovenskog planinskog 
gonica; nema toga Hrvata koji tijelo ne bi polozio na oltar istarskoga krat-
kodlakog; nema tog Crnogorca koji se ne bi odrekao Njegosa samo da se do-
cepa jugoslovenskog trobojnog gonica sa ocilima.<P>
  Trecim nekim recima, hajde da lajemo!<P>
  U tri boje, ako moze!<P>

<h1>ZLATNI BUKALIN ZA EKOLOGIJU</h1>

<strong>Hrvatska je , zahvaljujuci tragicnom apsurdu socijalisticke zapustenosti i srpskoga imperijalizma koji ju je iscrpljivao a nije nista u nju ulagao, ostala srazmjerno ocuvana u svojim izvornim oblicima.  Njezina priroda nije devastirana besmislenom izgradnjom i ludilom tehnickog napretka, koje je bilo obuzelo Europu sezdesetih.</strong><P>

<h1>ZLATNI BUKALIN ZA MODU</h1>

<strong>Odoru je bilo lako odjenuti.  Mnogi su je dobili jos 1990. godine, a kako nije bila praksa vracati odore, mnogi su ih odnijeli kuci - u njima su okopavali vrtove, sadili duhan, pa i isli zapaliti kucu.</strong><P>

<strong>HEADLINES:</strong><P>

page: 2 - <strong>WE ARE ALL IMPROPER !!!</strong>(Svi smo nepodobni !!!)<P>
author:<strong> TATJANA TAGIROVA</strong> <P>
new penal law is going to be enacted in parliament, which will protect the president of state, prime minister, president of the parliament and president of the Supreme Court, "from the libel". This act proposal has been made in the same time with the orchestrated campaign "against the enemies of state, of any kind".
Now the turn is for the liberals, cosmopolitans, socialdemocrats, other leftists, free-thinkers and intellectuals, moderate conservatives, homosexuals, creative artists and journalists, alternatives in one word everybody who doesn't fit the president Tudjman's narrow-minded criteria. Only the politicians will be protected, probably in order to remain eternaly in power.  A new age of traditional Croatian Silence is coming.<P>

page: 3 -<strong> WHO THINKS OTHERWAYS, HE SLANDERS AND LIES !!! </strong>(Tko misli drukcije taj klevece i laze !!!)<P>
author: <strong>LINO VELJAK</strong><P>

Lino Veljak, the university professor of philosophy and member of ASH (Action of socialdemocrats), was deeply provoked by the recent session of the Head committee of Tudjman's HDZ, on a very sharp and bitter reaction. This paleobolshevist "congress of the central committee", by its massive attack on the opposition, independent intellectuals, trade unions, independent press: FERAL TRIBUNE, NOVI LIST, ARKZIN, even the tabloids NACIONAL and GLOBUS etc. has recalled thouroughly the darkest time of the communism.The paranoia and panic is sweeping the lines of HDZ.<P>

pages: 4/6 - <strong>TUDJMAN IS THE WORST DICTATOR IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND ....</strong>(Tudjman je najgori diktator u povijesti covjecanstva...)<P>
author: <strong>STOJAN OBRADOVIC</strong><P>
An interview with three chief editors of the famous satirical weekly Feral Tribune, (Viktor Ivancic, Boris Dezulovic, Predrag Lucic) which is a thorn in flesh of Tudjman and HDZ.Their neighbours have been visited by the police officers and interrogated about the
 behaviour of the Feral editors: what do they do, where do they go, have they come down to the shelter in the wartime, and so on. In their characteristic waspish humour they mock at it.The new law that protects politicians from a libel they see as a transformation of the national state in the national park, with the politicians as "protected animals" in it.On the last session of HDZ- committee:"We are going towards the time when all the citizens will unstabilize Croatia. Everyone is a potential enemy of t
he state. Tudjman's and HDZ's rule couldn't function without the enemies. So it is our patriotic task to become the enemies of the state in order to keep HDZ in power."The situation with the independent medias in Croatia is worse and worse. The influence of them is marginal, while the influence of the state controlled TV is enormous.The price of peace is that US and Western Europe will give to the Balkan's chieftains a free play to tyrannize their subjects. They shouldn't only wage another war against each other.<P>

page:7 - <strong>A DUSK ON THE CROATIAN ECONOMIC HORIZON</strong>(Sumrak na hrvatskom gospodarstvenom obzoru)<P>
author: <strong>BOZO MATIC</strong><P>

A disastrous perspective with a business in Croatia where the successful and efficient firms have to pay off the debts of the bankrupted, incapable, failure of firms,very often under the president Tudjman's patronage.,e.g. a very solvent Vecernji list settles the debts of bankrupted  Tudjman's pet Hrvatski obzor. Tudjman gives away to his tennis mates the factories, firms, corporat
ions, though never being his property. His family, the families of his close friends and HDZ-functionaries have become rich overnight.Small stock-holders growing poorer every day are forced to sell their share for a cheap to the upstarted tycoons. A very thin layer of the population creates a rich oligarchy.The rest is just an impoverished folks.No middle-class at all. A few have a pwer of life and death over four millions of population.Strikes are banned, demonstrations are banned, labor unions are denou
nced as  state enemies, the opposition is denounced as a state enemy, and its victory on the municipal elections in Zagreb is simply ignored by president Tudjman who has rejected oppositional mayor,and imposed his own one.<P>

page: 8 - <strong>THE MUTINY OF SLAVES</strong>(Pobuna robova)<P>

author: <strong>ZORAN ARBUTINA - RISCH</strong><P>

Germany has led the campaign of recognizing Croatia as an independent state. It has established the relationship of a patron and protegee. But the recent events in Mostar (affaire Koschnik) has shown that the protegee between Germany and Herzegowina has chosen Herzegowina. Between Europe and Balkans. Of course, the Balkan orientation is a source of HDZ power. There is not an inch of Europe in Tudjman's behaviour.<P>

page: 9 - <strong>THE LAW OR THE SANCTIONS THAT IS THE QUESTION ! - REGULAR COLUMN:"J'ACCUSE"!</strong>(Zakon ili sankcije, pitanje je sad !)<P>

author:<strong> TATJANA TAGIROV</strong><P>

The International Tribunal for the War Crimes in Haag has been established on 27 of may 1993, due to the resolution 827 of UN - Council of Security.
 Since that time the number of war crimes have run lower. Although Croatia and Serbia, since long, have boggled about the enactment of the law of cooperation with the Tribunal,they've changed their mind since by the non-cooperation and refusal to extradite the criminals they risk the sanctions and international isolation. In Croatia, even a new Consitutional law is prepared.<P>

page: 9 - <strong>WAITING FOR THE MAN</strong><P>

author:<strong> DEJAN JOVIC</strong><P>

Pragmatism was always the reason of justice being amissed. No politician or soldier would agree with the peace if it has meant his own incarceration. That's why the international community has always sacrificed justice for any kind of peace. The International Tribunal in Haag was established in order to change this incidence and settle peace which would not exclude the criminal charges against the perpetrators of war outrages.This Tribunal has come out to be very principled, since it doesn't save anyone from the responsibility including the top chieftains and warlords on all sides: Karadzic, Mladic, Kordic, Blaskic..They could be arrested by any policeman anywhere in the world, and there countries will be monitored and treated according to the level of cooperation with the Tribunal..Peace is possible because all sides have assessed that the price of war is too big, especially now when the balance of forces has been established, and they have come to awareness of urgency to rebuild their countries and to join the international economic and political mechanisms.<P>

page: 10/1 - <strong>THE CRIMINALS WILL BE BURNED IN HELL</strong>(Kriminalci ce gorjeti u paklu)<P>

author: <strong>DEJAN JOVIC</strong><P>

An interview with colonel Bob Stewart, the first commander of  British UN - forces in Bosnia & Herzegovina. He has published his memoirs in a book: "Interrupted life", in which he proposes a stronger role of the UN - forces. According to him, in Bosnia  and Herzegovina there were many UN - units which have taken money for doing nothing in the field. Especially the Dutch officers and soldiers in Srebrenica, who have left civilians
 unprotected to the Bosnian Serbs , .and should be criminaly prosecuted for this. But in spite of it there were many cases of UN- soldiers preventing  mass executions, and generally they have done more than they were authorized to do. Colonel Stewart has tried to enter the spirit of the people in Bosnia, to understend their deepest motivations, and he has conceded he would do the same, thinking that "my side is always right". Each side has its reasons, everyone was scared that somebody came in its house to 
kill its family. The mass- media has created this fear, that was the main reason of most of the crimes committed in this war. Stewart has treated all sides equally, and was always on the victim's side.Many commanders of the opposing belligerents were old friends, and have communicated very cordialy  while negotiating, exchanging presents, letters, asking about common friends, relatives...They were just an ordinary people, totaly ignorant of the warfare, very often disobediant and wayward. Only the ex-JNA o
fficers were professionals.During the war between Muslims and Croats, Serbs were in the favorable military position to attack and conquer the territory, but they haven't done it, which hints at the possible Serbo-Croatian agreement.In the Muslim-Croat conflict Croats were those who made the most of the problems, particularly in Mostar, and there were also more evidences of Croats having burned Muslim houses than reversely.But the most embittered, colonel Stewart, is on the indifference of the internation
al community that has left people being killed, raped, plundered, devastated, with the cynical suggestion: "Let them kill among themselves, don't interfere!"<P>

page: 12 -<strong> DENAZIFICATION !</strong>(Denacifikacija !)<P>

author: <strong>VESNA TERSELIC</strong><P>

Dayton's peace settlement should become a real peace, not what is at the moment: unjust cease-fire.The realization of the civil part of the settlement is not adequately elaborated. The important decisions are left to improvisations. The case of Mostar is the best evidence of this difficulties. Two years of intensive work , and 20 millions of dollars vaste, for EU.People have been exposed to the cultivation of hatred by the mass-media. The blind followers of the insane leaders, they bow down their heads, keep silent, and suffer. Noone dares to ask anything. In Zenica (Bosnia), there was the electricity black-out, for 15 days, nobody has asked why !? The same spirit of illiberality and force is felt in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.The programme of rebuilding of socie
ties should have included a training for the participation in public affaires, an education of knowledge of human rights since the primary schooling, so children would not repeat the mistakes of their fathers.<P>

page: 13 -<strong> "PEOPLE WANT IT BUT THEY NEED A PRUDENCE</strong>"("Oce ljudi, samo treba pamet")<P>

author: <strong>GORAN VEZIC (STINA)</strong><P>

Mostar - one name, two towns, three mayors, four years of struggle, five polices, six communities...Since 20th of feb. a freedom of move was introduced, followed by some fightings and c
hauvinistic excesses. The miscellaneous police patroles have been formed in the Muslim part of the town.One Muslim, in Mostar born, lady: "For me, there is no any side at all. I live in Mostar, in my town. I was evicted  with my husband, from my flat, on the darkest night. We should stop the war and offer hand to each other."The Muslim authority has advocated the united, undivided town since the very beginning. A young Muslim man says: "All this has happened so that twenty people on each side get rich."M
ostar is forced to build up peace, at the slow pace. Hans Koschnik didn't want Mostar to be like Berlin. But Berliners didn't fight among themselves and they both wanted to fell down the wall.In Mostar there are many who wants to lift it up.<P>

page: 14/15 -<strong> A PORTRAIT OF THE CRIMINAL AS A YOUNG MAN</strong>(Portret zlocinca u mladosti)<P>

author: <strong>PREDRAG RAOS</strong><P>

Not long ago in Croatia was published a book of memoirs of Ante Pavelic "Dozivljaji", naklada Starcevic, 1996, Zagreb. Dr. Ante Pavelic was, during 2nd World War, "Poglavnik" (Croatian Fuhrer) of so-called NDH (Independent State of Croatia), a creature of Ribbentrop's Foreign Ministry (according to Hannah Arendt). As a leader of the criminal military organization; Ustashe (Croatian version of SS), he was responsible for the executions, massacres  and genocide on the large-scale, of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies, and disliked Croats, for establishing the extermination camps: Jasenovac, Gradiska, Jadovno, etc.,etc.Analyzing his literary pursuits, Raos has disclosed the p
sychology of fascism, and its artistic inclination towards kitsch."Fascism is an attempt to build a modern state on the principle of a tribal rural community with the unbounded authority of a chieftain.Pavelic's political, cultural, and philosophical model is: backward, patriarchal, tribal Bosnian and Herzegovinian village. Croatia was only a decoration to it.<P>

page: 16/17 -<strong> WHO REPRESENTS ROMS IN CROATIA ?</strong>(Tko predstavlja Rome u Hrvatskoj ?)<P>

author: <strong>MARTINA STRAZNIK & TONI GABRIC</strong><P>

      In Croatia there are two Rom's organizations: Party of Roms, and League of associations of Roms. They both try to articulate the social problems of Roms, but they came at odds with each other, which in addition aggravates their painful and arduous position, and serious social conditions in which they live. Don Stevo Djurdjevic, a chairman of the Party of Roms, is completely unsatisfied with the state policy towards Roms. He states that although "being the second minority, after Serbs, Roms haven't got a single representative 
in the parliament, and they are still marginal group in the society. Djurdjevic denounces League of associations of Roms as a para-state organization,supported financialy by HDZ in order to unstabilize Roms population. For him the president of the League is not even a Rom, but a Roumanian.President of the League of associations of Roms, Vid Bogdan, states that the League serves to adopt Roms in the Croatian society, as all the other citizens, and to improve the quality of their life. That's why the basic c
are has been taken in education and resocialization for which they enjoy the financial support of the government. They publish their bulletin; Glas Roma.Bogdan is a Rom of Catholic religion, and he rejects the claims of being  Roumanian. "Djurdjevic knows nothing about Roms and their history. There are Roms who speak different dialects, and there are Roms who speak only Croatian, but it doesn't mean that they are Croats, or Roumanians. They have still retained  many  characteristics of Roms."<P>

page: 19 - <strong>ST. PAUL WOULDN'T DO IT LIKE THAT!!!</strong>(Sv. Pavao tako ne bi radio!!!)<P>

author: <strong>IVICA MLIVONCIC</strong><P>

After the fall of communism Croatia has become exclusively catholic oriented. The State Commision for the Relation with the Religious Communities, cooperates only with the catholic church. In Rijeka police was harassing Muslims after their common prayer. Catholic church which has supported HDZ in the beginning, has become an accomplice in moral debasement and decadence of Croatian society. It was based on an Uthopia 
that it is sufficient to overthrow the communism and all the problems will vanish.There is a plenty of religious contents, manifestations, blessings on TV, but a Christian conviction has not reach the society, although everybody refers to the catholicism.Many catholic priests and laicists criticizes the church that has not made enough of a distance from the authority, which permanently expresses the lack of morals in its behaviour. To be a catholic means to be socialy acceptable. For the employement in po
lice, army or state administration, a written recommendation of priest, is needed. Some Church institutions, like the Commission of HBK (Croatian Bishop's Conference), Iustitia et pax, very often justifies some strokes of the authority, for instance military actions "Bljesak", and "Oluja". But they've never denounced the atrocities committed there.Church doesn't stand upon the defensive of a poor and humiliated. It doesn't actualize Pope's encyclical of a catholic social doctrine, which accentuates the wor
kers right of participation in management. In Croatia the worker's salaries are miserable, they can be fired as the employer.pleases. All the situation is under the human dignity, and Church is keeping silent.<P>

page: 20/21 - <strong>WITH THE SUFFERING OF REFUGEES MANIPULATE ALL: GOVERNMENT'S OFFICE FOR THE REFUGEES AND EXILES, HHO(CROATIAN HELSINKY'S COMMITTEE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS), MEDIA- SHAME</strong>(Patnjom prognanika manipuliraju svi: Vladin Ured, HHO, mediji - SRAMOTA)<P>

author: <strong>IGOR MARKOVIC</strong><P>

A report from the collective visit of journalists, members of HHO, and Adalbert Rebic, a principal of the Governments Office, to the refugee's and exile's camp in Gasinci, near Osijek, Slavonia. Everything was organized like a theater spectacle, of showing how good the refugees live. Although the refugees have played their role, (which, probably, they have been forced to play), the constraint and unnaturalness was evident in their behaviour. Many of them have been moved in  the camp, by force, from the other camps, which were cancelle
d,.; many of them ill, and victims of bureaucracy.They were promised to live in Gasinci, each family in one house, but they were mostly split, and placed five here, ten there, sometimes even separating children from mothers, and living five, ten, even twelve in  two rooms shacks. And the director of  the camp boasts himself that he has over thousand places left.Their Muslim priest (hodza), and  Muslim Aid, a humanitarian organization from London, which so far has taken care of them, they both have left the
m in the lurch.<P>

page: 24 - <strong>HAPPINESS IS IN US</strong>(Sreca je u nama)<P>

An interview with Dalai Lama, a Nobel prize laureate in 1989, about Tibet and its struggle to ship out of Chinese hands.He wants only an authonomous status, still remaining within the Constitution of China. "A freedom of my nation should be without detriment to the other nations, but rather should be for a well-being of all."<P>

page: 26/27 - <strong>WE UNMASK PEOPLE</strong>(Mi skidamo maske ljudima)<P>

author: IGOR MARKOVIC<P>

A report from the shooting of a 
humoristic serial on OTV (Open TV)- "Vecernja skola" (Evening school), the only humoristic alternative to the general spirit of sterility and barreness in Croatia. The serial has not got a fixed screenplay, and is liable to individual improvisations. Vecernja skola mocks at the educational system we have been exposed for years, and which always has remained the inhuman drilling-machine, regardless of the long chain of reforms that have been undertaken. This is a laughter, as a defensive reaction on the soci
al situation. Such a scoffing causes  one to think about all.In addition to report, there is an interview with the main actor; Zeljko Pervan, a dean of Croatian humour, whose idea was Vecernja skola. His beginnings stretch to 1985. and Radio 101. He believes in  a 90% of the inspiration and only 1o% of the perspiration. For him everything depends on the individual.<P>

Free Radio Berkeley (FRB- 104,1 FM), established in 1993. by Stephen Dunifer, is a micro radio station that broadcasts from the Brekeley's hills and mountains in Northern California, with the unregistrated transmitter of 40W. It holds on to the regulations of a non-interference with the signals of the other stations. But it doesn't impress the American Federal "regulators" from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which try to suppress the station in spite of having lost a trail with FRB, before the Federal Court.In
 the last 18 months 2 new radio stations have been established in USA; Radio Libre (103,3 FM), and San Francisco Liberation Radio (93,7 FM), which broadcasts from the trailer parked on the street of SF.The equipement for such a radio station costs only 100$ and could be packed in a rucksack.CREATION OF PIRATE RADIO STATIONS DIRECTLY DEPENDS ON THE STATE OF ETHER IN PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT!!!<P>

author: ARKZIN'S INVESTIGATION TEAM<P>

In spite of increasing positive relation between Croatia and United States,
which is only on the basis of pragmatic, strategic interests, from the last
State Departement's Report on the state of human rights in Croatia, it is
obvious that America knows everything what happens here.
The report emphasizes crimes and ethnic cleansing in Krajina, noticing that
Croatia wants to legalize changes in population, caused by the military action,
than to render possible the return of Serb refugees and exiles.
The security forces have participated, or ignored, in numerous maltreatements
on the liberated territories. According to UNCRO there were about three to
five hundred  very brutal murders on the ethnical basis, than; plundering and
burning the houses, confinement and torturing of prisoners, depriving them of
just legal process. Many of Serbs have been tried in two @^s, on the charge of
mutiny, with no possibility to contact the lawyer. Judges were appointed on
the political and not on the competence and quality basis. Government didn't
establish the Temporary court for human rights although it's Constitutional
obligation, and didn't take a step to punish the perpetrators of those crimes.
Serbs in cities and towns are furhter exposed to the terror and menace and
forced to emigrate. Government also threatens to the liberty of press and
media. National TV (HTV), radio and most of the press are under total control.
Government also does't grant citizenship to Muslims in Croatia although they
comply with the conditions for it.<P>

<a NAME="nationalism">page: 4/6- THE END OF A DREAM OF ETHNICAL CLEANNESS (Kraj sna o etnickoj cistoci)</a><P>

author: DEJAN JOVIC<P>

"Serbian and Croatian identities are not clearly distinguished. Croatian
dialects are very often more different from each other than from Serb's
dialects of the same areas. Serbs are mostly atheists, but they base their
nationality on the orhtodox christianity, which they share with Russians,
Greeks, Roumanians, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, etc. Therefore it is not more
natural to build a Croatian or Serbian state than to build a Bosnian or
Yugoslav one. Nationalism was produced by the political elites, as an easiest
attempt to legitimate their new reign, which rests upon a permanent production
of fear and insecurity in the population. Hence the nationalism is not
congenital to Serbs, Croats, Muslims, but the result of systematical
manipulation."- says Catherine Samary, the university professor on the
"L'Universite: Paris IX - Dauphine", and author of the book:"Dissected
Yugoslavia", in her Arkzin's interview, and continues: "In Bosnia so many
atrocities have been committed to prove that it's "natural" for three nations
not to live together in one state.<P>
Usually "natural" means spontaneous and effortless, and no force is contained
in it.
The war was created out of a deep economic and social crises of the former
Yugoslavia, in which the republics elites have started to compete like the
companies on the market. Mrs. Samary differentiates two sorts of nationalism:
the agressive nationalism of big nations: Serbian Croatian Slovenian, and
pacifist  nationalism of small nations: Macedonians, Bosniacs who were even
not interested in dismemeberment of Yugoslav federacy where their nationalities
have been for the first time politicaly and culturaly recognized.
Tito's self-management principle, republicanism and federalism, the
industrialization of country, and uprooting of illiteracy, unfortunately have
been spoiled by the bolshevist one-partysm, and uncompromising beating off the
significant political differencies.
Ante Markovi 's liberal endeavour to save Yugoslavia has neglected the
collective entities, because liberal competition brings out the dominance of
stronger and richer, or dominance of one collective over other brought out by
majorization.
Mrs. Samary sees no the essential conflict in between Croatia and Serbia, but
between Serbia and Bosnia and Croatia and Bosnia. Dayton's peace agreement has
given Tudjman and Milosevic a free play in their tendencies to suppress the
opposition and independent media. The case of Studio B in Belgrade, the
Tudjman's "mayor affaire", the resignation of multiethnically orientated prime
minister Silajdzic are the first results of such "pragmatical" support of the
international community to the Balkans authoritarian chieftains.
The events in ex-Yugoslavia regrettably have reflected on Europe. The
pro-fascist and racist forces have raised up their heads against the
globalisation and multiculturalisation. They all demand from their nations to
be; outwardly imperialistic, on the frontiers protectionistic and inwardly
ethnically clean.
For Mrs. Samary, Bosnia is a turning point. If the multiethnic principle
prevails, the state will be re-established, and Balkan chieftains will finish
in Haag. If opposite, they will be rewarded and a hard time for the democracy
in Europe will continue.<P>

page: 7 - CROATIAN GOD MARS (Hrvatski Bog Mars)<P>
author: BOZO MATIC<P>

A strong authoritarianism of Croatian national mentality doesn't tolerate any
autonomous initiative. Everybody looks to  president Tudjman, what he will
say...
And president Tudjman, as usually, will manipulate with people, for his own
benefit and the benefit of his oligarchy, giving away crumbles here and there
to sooth the discontent of the war veterans, taxi drivers, retired people. On
the other side: Tudjman threatens workers with the police repression, in the
case of strikes and demonstration. As if workers, industry, transport, public
services, haven't contributed to the defense of the country.
Tudjman despises intellectuals, political parties, free-thinkers.
Tudjman knows nothing about economy, since he is surrounded by flunkeys and
their Potemkin's villages, the mirage of Croatian "economic miracle".
As a dictator he doesn't use an open crude violence of police and army, but
rather creates stupid laws, using HDZ majority machine in parliament.<P>

<a NAME="ombudsman">page: 8 -  BABAC'S  PASSION (Muke po Babcu)</a><P>
author: VERONIKA RESKOVIC<P>

Mr. Branko Babac the Croatian Public Legal Officer (Ombudsman) in his human
rights report to the parliament,made in february 1996. for the year 1994. has
told a rosy fairy tale about peaceful even boring country that functions like a
Suiss watch, which citizens are overcontented with all the institutions of a
system wide opened on their disposal.
Mr. Babac was hidden and self-abnegating for almost three years since his
appointement by the Croatian ~}ltitude of citizens, in searching for their
constitutional and legal rights, passes by his office, ignorant of his
existence.
The year 1994. was very prominent in human rights violation in Croatia, for
there were so many brutal evictions from flats, problems of refusals to grant
the Croatian citizenship, illegal firing from the job, blasting of houses,
dissapearance of people, illegal mobilizations...
One can read NGO's reports of that time or report of the Council of Europe,
State Departement, UN- Council of Security Declaration.
All these events were every day in media, newspapers, radio, TV.
The Ombudsman could have reacted on the basis of any of these information. In
his competence belongs the right to initiate the alteration of laws refered to
the protection of constitutional and legal rights of citizens. Some of the laws,
enacted by HDZ, were even in collision with the Constitution of Republic of
Croatia, according to the Supreme Court. Mr. Babac has rather stayed hidden and
silent.
Although for his work in last two years was apportioned 1 million DEM from the
State's budget, to this day, he has not appointed his deputies and co-operators.
Therefore the Coordination of Organizations for the Protection and Promotion of
Human Rights of Republic of Croatia, demands the initiative of procedure of
removing Mr. Babac from his office, and more efficacious control of the
Ombudsman's work.<P>

page: 9 - WHAT THE HELL IS SOLICITOR-GENERAL OF RC MARIJAN HRANJSKI WAITING
FOR?(Sto, dodjavola, ceka drzavni odvjetnik RH Marijan Hranjski?)<P>
author: DEJAN KRSIC<P>
In Croatian sensation-mongering press, the misterious report of the three SIS
(Secret Service) agents about the situation in the Ministry of Defense has been
published. The report contains 304 pages of various illegal activities,
buggings, financial malversations, bribes and corruption..etc. There are many
indications that the report was simulated in order to bait and discredit the
opposition. There is also a probability general purge of the old system's
inherited structures, on behalf of the "young lions" of recent war.
The report has not met any reaction of the authorities, nor the legal inquest
of the Solicitor-General, Marijan Hranjski.The whole process has remained only
in the sphere of  sensationalistic media, not in the area of public speech.<P>

page: 10 - THE MAN OF A SPECIAL STAMP (Covjek posebnog kova)<P>
author: BORIS RASETA<P>
A political portrait of Ivica Racan, the chairman of Socialdemocratic party
(of Croatia), former League of Communists.
He always kept the moderate middle line, striking blows left and right, except
in January 1990. in Belgrade, when he has openly opposed. Milosevic  in his
attempt to make Communist party a neo-bolshevist monolith.<P>

page: 11 - A VERTICAL OF NOTHINGNESS(Vertikala nistavila)<P>
author: BOJAN MUNJIN<P>
A deeply moving, meditative report from the devastated Krajina. With a warm,
poetical sensibility the author goes behind the bare statistic of crime into
the realm of the individual tragedy: putting the before the cosmical
reconstruction of the Natural Eros of the past living, on the ashes and traces
of Tanathos, a death-harvest. of "Oluja".A few kilometers from this area of
the medieval havoc., in Zagreb,there is a false, arrogant lustre of the new
state.<P>

page: 12 - THERE IS NO ONE TO SUE THE STATE - (A REGULAR COLUMN :"J'ACCUSE !") (Drzavu nema tko da tuzi)<P>
author: TATJANA TAGIROV<P>
An author considers new alterations of the "Law of the obligatorily relations",
in which there is deleted the duty of state to refund the damage or loss
incured by a terrorist activity. It's only said it would be regulated by the
special ordinances, some day, who knows when. The new law is applicable
retroactively.<P>

page: 12 - TWO REPORTS OF THE NGO: "OPEN EYES"<P>

In Zadar on 27. and 28. february has started a trial against Zvonimir Lasan
(22) for the murder of Janko Sakic, after the military operation "Oluja".
During the trial there was a lot of inconsistency in the statements of wits,
and the defendant.
On which Public prosecutor hasn't reacted with the new questionings. On the
contrary he has proposed to the court to accept the mitigating circumstances,
and Lasan has got only 6 years of prison instead prescribed, at least 10.
In Split on  26 of feb., family Didara was evicted from their flat, all the
property being thrown out on the streets, the woman and man beaten and harassed
by the soldiers. The police didn't protect Didara. They protected the evictors
from the publicity of media and monitoring of NGO's.<P>

page: 13 - A MAN WHO KNOWS TOO MUCH (Covjek koji zna previse)<P>
author: VANESSA VASIC-JANEKOVIC<P>
A confession of the soldier of Army of Bosnian Serbs, Drazen
Erdemovic, who has participated in mass executions of Muslim civilians from
Srebrenica. He describes in details all the massacres of 1200 people on one
field of the farm in Pilice, near Janja, on the road  Bjeljina- Zvornik. The
perpetrators have used the bullets of 7,62 mm, and heavily wounded victims
they've finished off with the coups of Erdemovic didn't want to participate but
was warned that he could be killed too.
After the crime they have excavated the large pit to bury the corpses. Than he
has seen another execution of Muslim people on the street with hand-grenades.
Erdemovic, a child of Serbo-Croatian marriage, was one of many volunteers who
believed in 1991. that he was fighting for Yugoslavia, by besieging Vukovar.
In 1992. in his native Tuzla, first he had joined HVO (Croatian Council of
Defence),than he has run over to the Serbian side. In Serbia he had came in
contact with ABC- TV- station, and has offered his story, and his testimony to
the Haag's Tribunal. Serbian police has arrested him and they will have to
extradite him to the Hague.<P>

page: 14 - WHO SLAUGHTERS WHOM, THERE? (Tko to tamo kolje?)<P>
author: ADA MANDIC<P>
A student from Heidelberg writes about changed situation in Germany, wherein
to be Croat today is exactly like being Serb two years ago. The author wanders
why today  in 1996., and not in 1991 when Croatian reached its very culmination.
It was because of "the affaire Koschnik", she concludes. But the events in
Mostar are only the logical consequence of the same policy that Croats carry on
since the first election in 1990, the policy of ethnically cleansed state.
Fierce Croats in Mostar joggling Koschnik's car, don't seem much worse than
Croats of the first mass-meetings of various Croatian party meetings six years
ago.<P>

author: MATO VILAC<P>
The violation of human rights since one year has gradually become legal.
Croatian parliament (Sabor) has enacted series of laws which limit or suspend
the rights and liberties granted by Constitution and previous laws, like
suspending the parts of the Constitutional law of human rights and rights of
national minorities.
"The law of the art and artists", which follows very centralistic legislative
model, favorizes a State arbitration. Even 20 of |{}es were related to the
ministry in authority. The law has many "rubber" articles of the awkward and
polysemantic formulations.
The independent union of professors and scientists, complains that the newly
proposed "Law of  Universities and higher education" proclaims the University's
autonomy, but it doesn't give the mechanism for the implementation of it.
Especially humanisic sciences are thoroughly directed to the state budget, and
state control.
The Coordination of NGO's for the protection and promotion of human rights calls
the public attention to the new "Law of NGO's, associations, and communities",
which establish total control of the State over the work of NGO's, and civic
society, and initiatives.<P>

author: DADI (RADIO TTT)<P>
In Croatia there is one Net access, free of charges - CARNET.
It is academic, scientific and non-commercial one. But it gives its service to
everyone and therefore is overloaded. Recently the HPT- the State owned Post and
Telecomunication company, has opened its own Net access, with outrageously
expensive charge. The text deals with a heavy critics of the greed in national

author: TONI GABRIC & MARTINA STAZNIK<P>
Four months after the elections on which HDZ has won again and again has turn
a relative majority in an absolute power, the same pre-election jumbo- poster of
president Tudjman hanged on several places. This time in Zagreb's city council
HDZ has got 17 seats and opposition 33. Nevertheless HDZ again wants absolute
power.
But this is not important. What is important is the head on the jumbo posters,
the only constant value in last 6 years. It has installed 5 prime ministers and
governments, ministries judges, mayors, even sport couches. He has given his
statements about miss-concourses, pop-music...
For the sake of his own historical magnitude he has lightly acceded the war,
and sent thousands of young people in death.
A brief public inquiry shows that many citizens don't like the poster. It
reminds them  of Soviet, Chinese or Korean communism.<P>

the area of the well-developed tourism, and subterraneous waters, the
oppositional parties in Zadar were actuated to establish a Coordination board

author: DEJAN JOVIC<P>
An author is on the postdoctoral studies in London. He refers to the lecture
given by Bosnian ambassador, Muhamed Filipovic, wherein he regarded Nikola
Koljevic, the right-hand-man (after Biljana Plavsic) of Radovan
Karadzic, the leader of Bosnian Serbs, originally as Bulgarian.
Filipovic's ancestors were Croats, Karadzic is Montenegrin, and
Mladic - Serbian.
After Filipovic came Novak Kilibarda, a leader of Montenegrin pro- Serbian
opposition. He was full of praises for Tudjman and his leadership of Croatian
people.
Jovic than extended to the year 1954. when in Buenos Aires, Argentina, have met
Croatian ex-fuhrer (Poglavnik) Ante Pavelic, and Serbian fuehrer (Vodja) Milan
Stojadinovic.
They've made the appointement to overthrow Tito's regime and split Yugoslavia
assunder, on Croatia and Serbia; exchanging people and territories, in order to
fix the borders between them. (Sounds familiar?) Pavelic said Bosnia and
Herzegovina was an artificial product of the occupation made by Turkish Empire,
and should be divided in two. (Sounds familiar?)<P>

A long expected magazin for the culture of youth: Homo Volans is like a house
of pared claes, brought to the exhibition of pets, even winning a prize. A
peaceful, tame, aesthetic, something to be a proud of. "Nevertheless", Markovic
says, "I prefer a stray Tom-cat which takes care of himself, chasing mice and
rats and winning the favour of a she-cat, not waiting that someone choose him a
match."  The magazine is an ivory tower of pompous self-sufficiency, of
frivolous reviews in the same style: cold, aloof, skilfully written, but
without a personal eros in it.<P>

Marcel-Li Antunez a Mexican body-artist, has recently made a performance in
ZKM (Zagreb's theater of youngs), named Epizoo, or epidemic of animals, a
bastard of performance and installation, adopted to the new computer techniques.
It consists of a set of pneumatic mechanisms affixed on two metal shuttles,
attached on his back. Thus enables the movements of various parts of body; ears,

The idea of "free radio" was a programme of those included in social changes
since the beginning of radio broadcasting. During 2nd world war, Algerian war
and national liberation wars, free radio was an important weapon, but first
mini FM has appeared in 70's in Italy due to Felix Guattary, who has very
creatively connected political ideas with the sub-cultural endeavours towards
idea of free radio stations.
The boom was fantastic. In Europe, America, Japan. It has become a global
movement, very often cursed and persecuted by the Establishment, as "home
enemies", "foreign hirelings", "obnoxious".
In Croatia there were many examples of pirate (mini FM) radio stations: Radio
Slic, Radio Lucifer, Radio Utopija, Radio Susjedi jel'me cujete; Radio Dugave,
Radio Gajnice.
But they have died off.<P>

<h1>Dramatic Changes in Croatian Newspapers: the Editors-in-Chief of Slobodna Dalmacija and Vjesnik, Josip Jovic and Ante Ivkovic, To Be Fired!  </h1>
<FONT SIZE="+1">
<h2><em>by Dubravko Grakalic</em>, Globus, Zagreb, Croatia, 11/10/95</h2>

Announced editorial changes in leading Croatian newspapers, launches of new papers and changes in already existing publications are dramatically reshaping the Croatian newspaper market.<P>

Changes of editors-in-chief in main Croatian dailies, <em>Vjesnik</em>, <em>Vecernji List</em> and <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em> are being announced in the political circles.  These changes were discussed at the top of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ, the ruling party) as early as June 1995 but were postponed until this Fall and the conclusion of the elections for the Parliament.  It is considered that now the conditions are ripe for the dismissal of the chief editors of the papers under the state control: in <em>Vjesnik</em> and <em>Vecernji List</em>, as well as in <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em> which is nominally privately owned.<P>

The present editor-in-chief of <em>Vecernji List</em>, Branko Tuden, former sport journalist who took over the paper after the death of Ivo Lajtman in 1992, should be transferred to the diplomatic service; it is claimed that he will be replaced by one of the members of the paper's editorial board.  Ruzica Cigler, presently the second most influential person on the editorial board, is mentioned as the most likely candidate to replace Mr. Tuden.<P>

The replacement for the current editor-in-chief of <em>Vjesnik</em>, Ante Ivkovic, the former editor in <em>Vecernji List</em> and the head of the <em>Slobodna Dalmacija's</em> bureau in Frankfurt [Germany], has been sought ever since Mr. Ivkovic was appointed to his position, actually ever since the consequences of his management of the, at the time, most influential Croatian daily became apparent.<P>

<h2>A Change in Slobodna Dalmacija</h2>

The opinion in the journalistic circles is that Ivkovic was advised from the office of the Croatia's President to stop writing editorial articles in <em>Vjesnik</em>, which he named "The Editor's Word", and to dedicate himself to editing of the paper only.  Since then Miljenko Manjkas, a clerk in the President's office in charge of the media, has been writing editorial articles and signing them as Miljenko Salic.<P>

Nenad Ivankovic, <em>Vjesnik's</em> and <em>Vecernji List's</em> correspondent from Bonn and a frequent guest commentator on the Croatian TV is the most likely choice for the new editor-in-chief of <em>Vjesnik</em>.  A similar offer was made a few months ago to Mirko Galic, the Paris correspondent for the above mentioned papers; however he refused, probably as the result of his bad experience at the Croatian TV; he has been appointed to the position of the Croatian TV director for a short period of time.<P>

Mirko Mador, a former Parliamentary representative of HSS [Croatian Peasants' Party] who had defected to HDZ, was offered the position of the director of <em>Vjesnik</em>, which is under state ownership.  Mador declined because of the large debts of the company "Novi Vjesnik", the amount of which reaches DM 8 million.  Allegedly, Privredna Bank, the largest <em>Vjesnik's</em> lender has promised to reschedule the debt after which the former HSS representative might still accept the director's chair.<P>

<em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em>, from Split, might also get a new editor-in-chief.  The present boss, Josip Jovic is the only one among the editors of the papers close to HDZ who wasn't decorated for the Croatian independence day.  On the contrary, Jovic wasn't even invited to some of the President's meetings with journalists, and his TV appearance was badly received by the paper's management.  Jovic stated during his TV appearance that he didn't see a need for early elections.<P>

Last week's commentary in <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em> regarding the disgraceful election victory of Branko Miksa over Ivo Skrabalo, in which Jovic ridiculed the election result by comparing it to a certain football match from a long time ago, in which "Dinamo" [a team from Zagreb] lost from "Buducnost" [a team from Podgorica, Montenegro] due to a political decision, was the main proof of Jovic's departure to those familiar with the political and media situation in Split.<P>

Dino Mikulandra, the former top official in <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em> and now the editor-in-chief of <em>Nedjeljna Dalmacija</em> is the main candidate for the Jovic's replacement.<P>

Mikulandra started, almost a year ago, a bi-weekly magazine in color, <em>Stil</em>, which despite the strong promotional campaign, only managed to reach the circulation of 14,000 sold copies.  <em>Stil</em> is now printed in black-and-white and edited by Robert Zaja.<P>

If Dino Mikulandra were to become again the most powerful person in <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em>, although there is, as we found out, a resistance to that idea in the leadership of the Split publishing house, a new editor-in-chief of <em>Nedjeljna Dalmacija</em> would have to be named.  <em>Nedjeljna Dalmacija</em> is the oldest Croatian political weekly, whose three editions  (Croatian, German and Austrian), were sold during September  in approximately 25,000 copies per week.  The candidates for the position of the editor-in-chief of <em>Nedjeljna Dalmacija</em> are: Ante Gugo, new manager of the <em>Nedjeljna Dalmacija's</em> Zagreb bureau and the originator of the concept of the political magazine <em>Staze</em> which never reached publication, and Krunoslav Kljakovic, a former, very successful, chief editor of <em>Nedjeljna Dalmacija</em> who was replaced by Miroslav Kutle when he took over <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em>.<P>

The publishing house <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em> has been considering for a while the launching of two new publications with which it would try to draw the public outside the region [Dalmacija, coastal Croatia].  Specifically, the two proposed publications would be a sport oriented weekly and a music magazine in color, whose concept would be similar to that of the British magazine <em>Q</em>.<P>

<h2>Denis Kuljis' New Weekly</h2>

Of course, the possible changes in <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em> depend on the biggest possible change which might occur there: soon, the HDZ manager from Siroki Brijeg [a town in Hercegovina, part of Bosnia-Hercegovina], Miroslav Kutle, majority holder of <em>Slobodna Dalmacija's</em> stock, could be thrown out of the only serious Dalmatian publishing house and replaced by an opposing group of HDZ businessmen.  Nadan Vidosevic and the director of "Hajduk" [soccer team from Split], Vedran Rozic, are mentioned as possible replacements.  The places of the director and the presidents of the management council would be taken over by the officials from the managerial wing of Split HDZ, to which  Nadan Vidosevic and the reelected boss of the Bank for reconstruction and development, Antun Kovacev, belong.<P>

A new weekly which is being founded in Zagreb by Denis Kuljis, a former editor-in-chief and one of the founders of <em>Globus</em> has grabbed the attention of the media circles.  As we found out, Kuljis will edit an illustrated political magazine which still hasn't been named.  According to some sources, Kuljis' new magazine will be named <em>Nacional</em> and the first edition should hit the streets either on 11/23/95 or in the middle of December.<P>

The only magazine with political orientation launched in the last few months is  <em>Hrvatski Trenutak</em> which comes out from time to time and is edited by the former sport journalist, Darko Imenjak.  So far only two issues of <em>Hrvatski Trenutak</em> have been published.  Obviously, this is not a serious or long lasting project.<P>

<em>Hrvatski Rijecki List</em> can be included in the short-term media projects.  it was announced as a daily which was to compete with <em>Novi List</em>.  So far only one, trial issue number zero, has hit the kiosks, and only as a part of the pre-election campaign of Hrvoje Sarinic.  <em>Hrvatski Rijecki List</em> was launched as a counterweight to <em>Novi List</em> the only daily in Croatia whose editor-in-chief HDZ cannot replace.  Pilot issue of <em>Hrvatski Rijecki List</em> is professionally so weak that it certainly cannot survive on the market.  <em>Hrvatski Rijecki List</em> is published by HDZ.<P>


<h2><a HREF=/info/students/marko/croind.html#feral">Feral Tribune's</a> Specific Status</h2>

The launching of <em>Poslovni Tjednik</em>, a weekly dedicated to financial and business issues and published by "Poslovni tjednik, d.o.o." was announced for the end of October.  The weekly wasn't launched because the co-publishers and founders of the company "Poslovni tjednik", publishing houses <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em>, <em>Novi Vjesnik</em> and <em>Vecernji List</em> pulled out of the project.   Similarly to <a HREF="/info/students/marko/cropat.html#hrobzor"><em>Hrvatski Obzor</em></a>, <em>Poslovni Tjednik</em> was supposed to be a joint project of these three publishing houses, but they decided to discontinue the project after negative results of market research, although the editorial board had been founded a few months before.<P>

According to the latest informations, <em>Poslovni Tjednik</em> will be published as a supplement to one of the HDZ's daily newspapers, most likely <em>Vjesnik</em>.<P>

<em>Hrvatski Obzor</em> is at the verge of closing because of its low circulation.  Its editor-in-chief, Milan Ivkosic, is also in charge of the weekly art supplement in <em>Vjecernji List</em>.  According to the latest circulation data, 14,600 copies of <em>Hrvatski Obzor</em> are printed weekly, while 7,500 are sold.  Out of the total number of sold copies, almost 6,000 are sent directly to the government's institutions such as the Ministry of Defense, which means that the part of circulation sold at the kiosks and abroad, where <em>Obzor</em> is also distributed, is about 2,000 copies!<P>

The other Croatian political weeklies are also not doing well as far as the circulation is concerned.  Therefore, they have a minor influence on public opinion.  This is true for <em>Panorama</em> from Zagreb, <em>Slobodni Tjednik</em>, <em>Nedjeljna Dalmacija</em> and to a certain extent <em>Feral Tribune</em>, although this newspaper has a specific, incomparably more important political status.  During September, <em>Panorama</em> was sold in 28,000 copies per issue and <em>Feral</em> in 42,000 which is too low for  significant earnings.  <em>Slobodni Tjednik</em>, with an average circulation of 10,000 copies, is in a much worse position;  during the last few months is has been published as a bi-weekly.<P>

Besides <em>Globus</em> [circulation of 134,838 sold copies in September] and <em>Gloria</em> [117,182 sold copies in September], all of the other influential Croatian papers with large circulation are dailies: <em>Vecernji List</em> with average sold circulation ( in September) of 154,000 copies and <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em> with 96,000, recorded a growth in comparison with their circulation one year ago.  A regional paper, <em>Novi List</em> with 36,000 sold copies (to which should be added 17,000 sold copies of similarly pro-opposition and regional <em>Glas Istre</em>), is significantly stronger and more influential in comparison with the "national" <em>Vjesnik</em> which sells and distributes to state institutions on average 32,000 copies daily.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the dismissal of the editor-in-chief of <em>Vjesnik</em> is expected.<P>

If we compare <em>Globus'</em> investigation of the newspaper market from last year with the latest data, we can conclude that the majority of the papers published in Croatia are either stagnating or have recorded a fall in the number of sold copies!  Several smaller magazines, who were available at kiosks a year ago, for example <em>Sunce</em>, <em>Pecat</em>, <em>Danas</em> and <em>Magazin</em> are not with us anymore, while color magazines like <em>Teen</em> and <em>Svijet</em> have recorded a small fall in circulation.  The largest fall in circulation, if we compare November 1994 and September 1995 was recorded by the magazines targeting younger readers, such as <em>Pop Express</em> and <em>Rocky</em>.  The circulation of <em>Pop Express</em> fell from 37,000 to 13,000 sold copies, while that of <em>Rocky</em> fell from 32,000 to 12,500.<P>

A slight growth in the number of sold copies was recorded by, as we have already mentioned, <em>Vjecernji List</em> (8,000 copies) and <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em>. Split weekly, <em>Feral Tribune</em> had a largest growth in the number of sold copies; it raised its circulation by 25%, namely from 31,000 to 42,000 copies sold!<P>

The overall trend of fall in sold circulations indicates that the Croatian readership is less and less satisfied by the offer at newspaper kiosks.<P>

The announced changes in the most influential papers which are the result of HDZ's political decisions will also very quickly get their evaluation on the market, as did  "drzavotvorni" [patriotic] newspapers like the weekly <em>Hrvatsko Slovo</em>, published by the Croatian Writers' Society, and which was launched at the suggestion of president Tudman.  With circulation of 4,000 copies.<P>

<h1>After 35 years, We Have Moved Our <a HREF="http://cypress.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~eesrdan/ndh/ndh-INDEX.html">Ustashe</a> Newspaper "Independent State Croatia" from Toronto to Zagreb</h1>

<strong><em>by Vlado Vurusic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Globus, Zagreb, Croatia, 12/1 1995</h2>


After the arrival of  Vinko Nikolic's "Croatian Review" back to the homeland,  another important emigration publication will begin to be published in Croatia.  In the middle of December, the first homeland issue of "Independent State Croatia" [Nezavisna Drzava Hrvatska, NDH, also a name of the Croatian fascist puppet state established during the WWII] will appear at the kiosks;  "Independent State Croatia" is the publication of the Croatian Liberation Movement [Hrvatski Oslobodilacki Pokret, HOP] which was founded in emigration, in Buenos Aires by Dr. Ante Pavelic.<P>

"We started publishing 'NDH' in 1959 in Chicago, with intention to one day continue the publication in free and independent Croatia," says Dr. Srecko Psenicnik, a former Ustashe official and Dr. Ante Pavelic's son-in-law, married to his younger daughter, Marija-Seka.  "The HOP, which had been founded in 1956, was according to Poglavnik's wishes registered after the proclamation of the independence in Zagreb.  At the HOP congress in Melbourne, in 1994, we decided that I, as president, return to Croatia in order to strengthen the HOP in the homeland and that the editorial board of 'NDH' be also eventually moved to Zagreb, since our organization needs a publication around which like-minded people can gather.  The whole HOP organization has to return from the emigration to Zagreb.<P>

This idea has been accepted by the president of the Independent Volunteers of Croatia [Nezavisni Dragovoljci Hrvatske or NDH], a restaurateur from Zagreb and a volunteer from the patriotic war, Zvonimir Trusic, who is jokingly, and sometimes even "seriously" referred to as Poglavnik [Dr. Pavelic's title in Ustashe terminology; roughly equivalent to Fuhrer for Hitler] by his collaborators.  The abbreviation for their organization is also NDH.<P>

"We wanted that our publication," says Zvonimir Trusic, "be a continuation of one of the papers which were published in Zagreb between 1941 and 1945, so that we don't start with issue number one, but to have continuity.  Our goal was to demonstrate that the Croatian state existed before 1990, although some people want to convince us that that is not true.  When we heard that Dr. Psenicnik intended to move 'NDH' from Toronto to Zagreb, we offered our services, so that 'NDH' will also be our publication.<P>

"Men who have fought throughout their life for the independent Croatia are spread today all over the world, while those who have fought for Yugoslavia are very well organized.  I think that the time has come for us to gather and raise our voice and that is why some of us will gather around this paper.  All of us are Croatian nationalists and it is necessary to form a firm nucleus of Croatian pravasi [Croatian 19th century nationalist party] and nationalists and 'NDH' is an initial idea around which we have begun to gather on the same political platform.<P>

"Through 'NDH' we will articulate our ideas and thoughts and make them available to the Croatian people; we will explain our patriotic ideas and goals, warn about the mistakes of the present authorities and demonstrate that it is possible and desirable to criticize the authorities without questioning the validity of the state.  Also we will warn about all those movements and parties and steps which threaten the very foundations and survival of the Croatian state."<P>

<h2>Impressive Editorial Board</h2>

In the Zagreb issue of "NDH" all articles will be written using korijenski orthography and it will be published once a month.  Dr. Psenicnik, "NDH" editor-in-chief and the president of the HOP, at the same time announces that he will revive the largest circulation NDH publication, "Hrvatski Narod"; after the death of Dr. Ante Pavelic in 1959, his personal secretary, Dr. Vrancic  tried unsuccessfully to revive the publication in Buenos Aires.  Only a few issues were published.<P>

Zagreb Editorial Board of "NDH", according to its founders will have an impressive list of members; many well known emigrants, dissidents and declared Croatian nationalists will take part in its work.<P>

Besides Dr. Psenicnik and Zvonimir Trusic, the board will have services of well-known Croatian poet and editor of the "Croatian Literary Paper" [Hrvatski Knjizevni List] in 1969, Zlatko Tomic, then  a Rijeka publicist, leader of the Hrvatski Obrambeni Red, Branimir Peterner and Nikola Stedul, a long time Croatian political emigrant, the president of the Croatian Patriotic Movement [Hrvatski Drzavotvorni Pokret], and the victim of an assassination attempt by UDBA [former Yugoslav secret service] mercenary Vinko Sindicic, who is because of that still serving time in a British jail.<P>

Former Croatian minister of internal affairs, Ivan Vekic, who ran at the recent elections for the lower house of the parliament as an independent candidate, will also write for the paper.<P>

The organizers of the homeland editorial board of "NDH" emphasize with pride that the paper will with contributions and a blessing be supported by a well known Dominican priest Vjekosav Lasic, who was a personal confessor for <a HREF="/info/students/marko/feral/feral18.html">Mirko Baresic</a> and a great admirer of Bruno Busic.<P>

Parliament representative of HSP and former political prisoner, Ivan Gabelica, will probably join the impressive list of the "NDH" collaborators.<P>

It is especially interesting that the former "NDH" collaborators from Zagreb will also work for the homeland editorial board of the paper.  Through all these years, these people have managed to send their articles from Zagreb, risking a long prison term in Stara Gradiska or Lepoglava and managing to hide their journalistic work from the former Communist authorities.<P>

<h2>Ideological paper</h2>

"Nezavisna Drzava Hrvatska" begun to be published in the USA in 1959.  A year later its editorial board moved to Toronto, Canada, where it staid until today.  "NDH"'s circulation is 5,000 copies.  The paper used to be sent to subscribers or many addresses in the former Socialist Republic Croatia.<P>

  "We can say for 'NDH' that it is one of the most important emigration publications, especially after 1985 and the demise of "Hrvatska" from  Buenos Aires, which was at its start edited by the Poglavnik himself," continues Dr. Psenicnik.  "Our paper will be a pravas paper, following the ideas of the HOP which was founded by Dr. Ante Pavelic.  It will be an ideological paper based on the 10th April revolution [4/10/1941, founding of NDH]; we will fight for a historical truth about NDH and Dr. Ante Pavelic, refuting numerous lies about the Ustashe movement which accumulated and spread during the Communist rule," says Dr. Psenicnik.<P>

<strong>You mentioned the 10th April revolution.  Was it really a revolution?</strong><P>

Of course; it was a drastic transformation of the situation.  A revolution doesn't have to be bloody.  Every change of that kind is a revolutionary change.  That is why we will demand that the 10th of April be celebrated, not as a commemoration of NDH, but as a day of Croatian statehood.  Whether some like it or not, on that day the Croatian state was re-established.  All the time I'm trying to make a distinction between the [Ustashe] regime and a state.  If we didn't establish a state then, I think that the future generations would have objected that.<P>

<strong>You are a direct heir of Dr. Ante Pavelic and his political work.  Since today we already have several pravasi political parties in Croatia, do you think that the HOP can contribute something else to the Croatian political scene?</strong><P>

Yes, of course, since none of the todays pravasi parties is a real pravasi party.  Paraga was the first one to compromise pravastvo since, inter alia, he reported the Croatian soldiers to the international organizations for something that, I'm certain, wasn't their fault; he also claimed the Croatia was a fascist country.<P>

I also think that Ante Dapic cannot lead the HSP.  The only authentic Pravas, besides us, is Dr. Ivan Gabelica.  Although I think that Mladen Schwartz is capable and intelligent, I think that his ideas depart from those of Ante Starcevic [founder of Pravasi in 19th century and "the father of the nation"].<P>

<strong>Anyway, the [Ustashe] regime and the proclamation of independence were rather problematic?</strong><P>

Fine, we can discuss the regime and its character, I'm not avoiding that.  I am aware that, judging from a todays vantage point, we cannot be proud of a large number of our policies, but that was the time and we could not avoid a chance to achieve independence.<P>

We tied our destiny to that of [Nazi] Germany because it was at the time a strong and influential world power and because that allowed us to reach our goal, independent Croatia.<P>

As far as the regime is concerned, it was the way it was because of the war situation and its ideology.  However, we were neither national socialists nor fascists.  I do not condemn partisans for fighting on the other side, but I condemn them for destroying out state as such and fighting to bring Croatia back into Yugoslavia.<P>

I would give their movement more legitimacy if they only fought against the Ustashe regime and for the preservation of the NDH.<P>

<strong>Yes, but NDH also did not include Dalmatia, a part of Croatia in which out statehood and culture had been formed, because in the Rome contracts these territories were ceded to Italy.</strong><P>

The Rome contracts, no matter how disgraceful and questionable, were the price we had to pay for the independence and were imposed on us by the then world powers.  That destiny has followed us until this day: just look at the Dayton agreement; Croatia had to give up Croatian Posavina [part of Bosnia-Hercegovina] because of the world powers.<P>

Now it is easier to explain the circumstances which brought about the Rome contracts.<P>

<strong>Do you really think that the Dayton agreement and the Rome contract can be compared...</strong><P>

Of course.  They were both imposed on us by the world powers.  We needed a state then and the painful surrender of Dalmatia to Italy was the price for our independence.<P>

We cannot judge NDH using todays criteria.  Germany was a great and strong power then, and numerous states were under its thumb, its collaborators and allies.  However, no one has ever questioned the Romanian or Norwegian state because of that.  On the other hand, this happened to Croatia.<P>

The Dayton agreement is worrisome because for a first time Serbia crosses over the river Drina. For us, who have grown up with the map of NDH [incorporated Bosnia-Hercegovina and a part of Serbia (Srem)], that is worrisome.<P>

We will attack the Dayton agreement in our paper.  I understand that the agreement was imposed but we shouldn't have gotten to that point.<P>

<strong>You  participated in the signing of the Rome contracts and now you are attacking the Dayton agreement...</strong><P>


Yes, because I really know what is it like to be forced to follow somebody else's will.  We could have learnt something from that, don't you agree?  Today, Tudman shouldn't have reached that situation since the survival of the state was not questionable, as it was in 1941.  The Rome contracts were the question of our survival, and today the survival of the state is not questionable.<P>

If we hadn't signed the Rome contract we would have lost the state.<P>

<strong>Was the signing of the Rome contracts greeted with demonstrations in Zagreb?  How was it assessed by the media? Was there any criticism?</strong><P>

All publications were controlled by the state, and supported the contracts, no matter how painful that was for us.  Demonstrations in front of the Italian embassy in Zagreb were organized, but were banned by the authorities in order not to worsen already tense relations with Italy.<P>

<strong>Do you think that the Rome contracts prodded a lot of Dalmatians to join the Partisans?</strong><P>

Unfortunately, I have to agree with you and say that I totally understand them, since that was the only remaining option for them.  I totally understand the Croats from Dalmatia and Istria who joined the partisans; I even think that that was better than if they joined the Italians whom we considered as the occupiers of our territory.<P>

However, after the Italian capitulation on 6/9 1943, the Rome contracts became invalid and that territory was joined with the mother land.<P>

<h2>Racial Laws</h2>

<strong>Will you, as a direct heir to Dr. Ante Pavelic and the president of the HOP, apologize to the Jews in the first homeland issue of "NDH" for everything they went through in NDH?</strong><P>

I think that the Jews fared better in Croatia than in any other European state which was engulfed in the war.  Mr. [Simon] Wiesenthal [a "Nazi hunter"] also knows that although he doesn't want to admit it.<P>

There were several Jews in the Croatian government, Poglavnik's wife was of the Jewish origin, as well as the wife of Slavko Kvaternik.<P>

<strong>Yes, but those cases do not confirm that the Jews in NDH did not have a tragic destiny.  What about the racial laws?</strong><P>

Those racial laws were not applied as strictly as in other states who were the allies of Germany; they were imposed and extorted by the Germans.  The times were like that.  In order to ensure the survival of the state we had to compromise, but I am convinced that the Croatian Jews fared much better that their co-religionists in other European states.<P>

Whenever we could we allowed people to legally leave for Italy and even the United States.  I personally urged the then Minister of Internal Affairs to issue passports and visas.<P>

Anyway, we demanded from the British government to apologize to the Croats because of their participation in the Bleiburg tragedy and never received a reply.<P>

<strong>As a long-term emigrant, what do you think about the elections among the Croats who live outside Croatia?</strong><P>

I don't think that is right.  The emigrants shouldn't vote for the Croatian parliament.  If they want to vote let them come back.<P>

I understand their wish to finally vote for a free Croatian parliament, but that is not right, since they live in other states.<P>

<h1>Dario Kordic, a War Criminal Indicted by the Hague Tribunal,
Lives Undisturbed in Zagreb</h1>

<strong><em>by Ivan Violic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Globus, Zagreb, Croatia, July 12 1996</h2>

On Monday, July 8, 1996, around noon, Dario Kordic left a building at 26 Gornjanska 
street, in Tresnjevka, Zagreb, together with his two children in order to escort his 
guest to a car, Opel Vectra with Herceg-Bosna (town of Grude) plates,
which was parked in front of the building.  Unidentified guest left soon afterwards,
while Kordic remained in front of the building, playing with his son Darko 
and daughter Marija.<P>

He didn't notice when <em>Globus</em> photographer took his picture, nor
did we notice any type of tightened security in the area.  True, during
those two hours which our reporter spent in Gornjanska Street, Military Police
patrol passed several times in front of the building.  But that probably
had nothing to do with Kordic.<P>

Dario Kordic's presence in Zagreb demonstrates that Croatian authorities
can reach him.  Hence, according to the law about the co-operation with
the Hague Tribunal for War Crimes, the Croatian authorities should arrest
Kordic and send him to the Hague.<P>

The public has been informed that Kordic had been indicted by the International
War Crimes Tribunal for "political, racial and religious persecution of 
Bosnian Muslims in the Lasva river valley in central Bosnia".  In the same
group with Kordic, the International Tribunal issued indictments against
Tihomir Blaskic, Mario Cerkez, Ivica Santic, Pero Skopljak and Zlatko Aleksovski.<P>

So far, only Tihomir Blaskic, General in the Croatian Army and Croatian Defense Council, 
who had voluntarily extradited himself, has appeared in the Hague.  Zlatko Aleksovski
was arrested several weeks ago in Split.<P>

Until now, there was no reliable information about the presence of other
individuals indicted for war crimes on the Croatian territory.  It seems that 
even the Foreign Affairs MInistry lacked reliable information about that.
In June, it sought from other competent Ministries information whether "two
individuals [were] currently on the Croatian territory in order to inform the
Hague Tribunal about that."<P>

According to the Foreign affairs Ministry spokesperson, Vanja Moric, the role
of the Ministry is to implement state policies and the law about the co-operation 
with the Hague, according to which "the Croatian government is responsible
for the co-operation with the Hague Tribunal".<P>

Minister Mate Granic on several occasions spoke about the Croatian obligations
with respect to the Hague Tribunal, and at a recent conference in Florence
in Italy, which took place in mid June, he said that "those individuals
indicted by the Tribunal which happen to be on the Croatian soil will
be arrested".<P>

<h2>What Does the Law Say?</h2>

Therefore, the Foreign Affairs Ministry, as well as the Ministry of Defense 
and Police do not know that Dario Kordic is currently in Zagreb, i.e. on the
Croatian territory.  It seems that in the Public Prosecutor's Office is not 
aware of that, since they were surprised when we asked them to comment Kordic's
presence in Zagreb!<P>

Zlatko Kuretic, the spokesperson of the Ministry for Internal Affairs, couldn't
comment Kordic's presence in Zagreb for <em>Globus</em>.  He suggested that
we contact judicial authorities.<P>

Constitutional law about the co-operation between the Republic of Croatia and
the International Criminal Tribunal which was passed on April 19, 1996, states
that the District court judge can order the arrest of a person indicted by
the International Tribunal, while the arrest is carried out by the police.<P>

Article 13 of the law specifies that "the investigating magistrate decides about
the International Tribunal request for urgent arrest".<P>

The arrests should be conducted by  the Police even without a warrant if
"an international warrant has been issued for the accused".<P> 

"Police must immediately bring the accused to the District investigating magistrate
who decides whether the accused should be kept in custody or released," states
the law which was passed in the Parliament almost unanimously.<P>

The Kordic family has moved to the recently built building on Tresnjevka in
Zagreb, after the indictment against Kordic had been issued by the International
tribunal.  They live on the fourth floor, in the apartment number 23.<P>

Obviously, this is a temporary shelter for Dario Kordic, whose fate will be
decided by the highest Croatian officials.  Clash between Ministers Granic
[Foreign Affairs] and Susak [Defense] is caused by the disagreement regarding
the co-operation with the Hague tribunal.<P>

The international status of Croatia and its return to European organizations
depend on the co-operation with the International Tribunal; the refusal to 
cooperate with the Tribunal may result in the introduction of sanctions.<P>

Actually, the International Community will use weak UN sanctions, 
similar to those with which international representative Carl Bildt recently 
threatened Serbia because it hadn't arrested Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, 
in order to force local states to cooperate with the Tribunal.<P>

<em>Globus'</em> special opinion poll, carried out on July 8 on a sample of 600 persons
shows that 60.7 percent of poll participants think that Croatia <strong>should
</strong> fulfil its obligations towards the International Tribunal.<P>

A majority of participants, 54.8 percent, agrees that the indicted Croats should be 
arrested if they are on the Croatian territory.  49.7 parcent believe that the Tribunal
is objective and a slightly smaller portion of participants believes that 
general Tihomir Blaskic should appear before the Tribunal.<P>

<h2>Serious Accusations</h2>

Dario Kordic is the highest Bosnian Croat official accused of war crimes.
At the time the indictment was issued he was the president of the Croatian
Democratic Union for Bosnia-Hercegovina.  The International Tribunal for War 
Crimes accused him in November 1995 for alleged crimes committed between
May 1 1992 and May 31 1993 in the Lasva river valley in central Bosnia.<P>

"Dario Kordic and Tihofil Blaskic, in that period, with their actions and
failure to act, in co-operation with others, committed crime against humanity by
carrying out political, religious and racial persecution of Bosnian Muslims.
They are responsible for killing and wounding of Muslim civilians and prisoners;
attacks and bombardment of undefended cities and villages; for deliberate 
attacks on civilians; unlawful destruction of commercial property, houses,
personal property, and livestock; for unlawful treatment of prisoners; imprisonment
of distinguished politicians; plunder of houses and personal property; expulsion
of Muslim population from the Lasva river valley to the territories with
majority Muslim population and other crimes against humanity."<P>

According to the Hague Prosecutor, Richard Goldstone, Kordic's responsibility
for the crimes comes from his political and military role during the war in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.  In the aforementioned period he was the vice-president
of the Croatian Community of Herceg-Bosna, a member of its Parliament, and
HVO commander in central Bosnia with the rank of colonel.  He was the 
commander of one of four HVO operative zones in Bosnia-Hercegovina.<P>

According to the indictment, Dario Kordic has "demonstrated power, influence and
control on several occasions and in different ways: by implementing cease fire
agreements, issuing orders which were directly or indirectly of military nature,
by wearing the HVO uniform and the accepting the rank of colonel in HVO,
having an office for military operations in Busovaca, breaking the cease fire
agreement when the condition were unfavorable, issuing orders for arrest or 
release of distinguished Muslims which were imprisoned by HVO and negotiating 
about the passage of humanitarian convoys and UN vehicles through check points
in central Bosnia".<P>

<h2>Kordic's Response</h2>

"The indictments issued against me and another five Croats by the International
tribunal in Hague are, above all, another demonstration of continued international
pressure of the Croat people in Bosnia-Hercegovina," stated Dario Kordic in the 
interview given to <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em> on December 5, 1995, after the
indictments had been issued.  "I do not intend, nor do I deem it necessary, to
defend myself.  Therefore, I do not intend to defend the Croat people in this
interview, nor any one of the accused.  Because, we only did what every man, from
any nation, would do in such a situation: we defended family homes, protected
our lives and lives of mothers and children," emphasized Kordic in the same 
interview.<P>

Before the start of the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Kordic was an anonymous
journalist.  He was born in Sarajevo, on December 14, 1960.  He graduated
from the Sarajevo University with the political science (journalism) degree
and worked as a journalist for the factory paper "Vatrostalac" published
by the company "Vatrostalna".  Except during his studies, he has spent most
of his life in Busovaca.  He was a contributor of the daily <em>Oslobodenje</em>
and of the radio stations in Sarajevo and Zenica.  After the multiparty
elections in 1990 he became the chief of the Defense office in Busovaca
municipality.  That was the start of his military carrier.  During the war
he had the rank of colonel in HVO and he was an assistant of the HVO Chief 
of Staff.  Today he is a reserve brigadier of HVO.<P>

His political carrier also started in Busovaca, where he was the founder of the local 
HDZ branch.  At the second HDZ Bosnia-Hercegovina conference he was elected the vice-president
of the HDZ for Bosnia-Hercegovina, and in 1995 he became its president.  He
resigned that position after the indictment by the International tribunal in
the Hague.<P>

His case is interesting for the future treatment of Croatia by the international
community and for the assessment of the strength of different political forces 
in Croatia.<P>

<h1> Democroatia</h1>

<strong><em>by Drago Pilsel</em></strong><P>

<h2> Novi List, Saturday March 9, 1996</h2>



                              
                                                                    
                              
       <h2>    Don Zivko Kustic - the Kaptol Avenger?</h2>


      I  wanted to begin today s text with a salute  to  all
women  and  a  look  back at their  difficult  past.   I  am
particularly  motivated  by the  fact  that  on  All  Saints
Day(celebrated on May 19) the Pope dedicated  this  year  to
the advancement of women in society.  Unfortunately, because
of the serious case of libel by Don Zivko Kustic against the
Croatian  Helsinki Committee(CHC) for Human  Rights  in  the
most  recent copy of the weekly Panorama(March 6, 1996),  in
the Bulletin of the Catholic Information Agency(February 29,
1996) and in Glas Koncila(No. 10-1134), I am forced to stand
and defend my victimized colleagues from the CHC, all women,
be  they  religious or not, who's rights the CHC  for  human
rights takes the responsibility of protecting in the name of
all the people who are adversely affected by the actions  of
the aforementioned journalist.<P>

      I have a complaint which I would like to voice, but  I
am  not bitter, and I avow before God and the people that  I
am  do  not  wish  to hurt Don Zivko Kustic, journalist  and
Christian who has meant so much to me in my life, especially
while  I was in Argentina and dreaming of a life in Croatia.
It  is no secret that I play an active and executive role in
the  Helsinki  Committee, but every week I write  my  column
under  my own name, aware of the possibility that the moment
may  come  when that organization will be inclined to  react
publicly  to  stop  Kustic's  attacks  and  libeling   the
Helsinki Committee.<P>

        <h2>The CHC s Statement No. 33 hit the bullseye</h2>

      Statement No. 33 about the violations of the rights to
religion,  the rights of religious people and the  state  of
religious  freedom  in the Republic of  Croatia,  without  a
doubt   hit  the  bullseye .  As one of its  authors  I  can
freely  say that its effect was the intended purpose of  the
members  of  the CHC who have been monitoring  the  problems
listed  in  Statement No. 33 since the  beginning  of  their
public activism.  Religious people and church officials  who
founded and are members of the Committee can attest to this,
because  their  membership in the  Committee  was  justified
since  religious people and theologians must  contribute  to
the  establishment  of a legal state.  But,  this  statement
occurred as a response to the accumulation of  problems  and
negative incidents.  It should certainly not be received  as
being   anti-Catholic , and those who attempt to force  that
interpretation onto the public are very mistaken.<P>

      It  is necessary to note that according to information
received  in  confidence from a high ranking office  of  the
Croatian Bishops Conference, the Catholic church in  Croatia
monitors  every  bit  of information  that  comes  from  the
dealings of the CHC very closely, perhaps more closely than
the members of that Committee are aware.<P>

      Anyone  who  reads  Statement No. 33  carefully  might
disagree with the professionalism of the author, the members
of  the CHC s Commission for Religious Rights and the Rights
of  Religious  People,  and outside contributors,  but  they
cannot  think  that  they  hold any  feelings  of  animosity
against  the  church.  I can attest to the fact  that  these
people  have  a  great  respect for not  only  the  Catholic
bishops,  some  of which they interact with  regularly,  and
because they believe in the unity of the  house of the  same
God  Creator  as honorable with a refined sense  of  justice
and sense for the truth and peace which is no less refined.<P>

      How  does  Zivko Kustic dare claim that   the  CHC  is
seriously accusing the Catholic church  on the front page of
the IKE Bulletin(09/6)?  What gives him the right to mislead
the  public  by saying that Statement No. 33 was printed  in
its entirety in Novi List on February 28, 1996, as well as a
statement  by  Ivan Zvonimir Cicak(page 13)?!   Furthermore,
what gives him the right to deceive the public for the third
time  on  page  16  of the same issue by  saying  that   the
Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights is in  its  own
way,  offering  unsubstantiated and  exaggerated  criticisms
about the state of freedoms in Croatian society  in a manner
which should  open the eyes  of the readers of IKE, and  the
Catholic  Bishops, like the forgers of truth on HTV(Croatian
Television)?<P>

               <h2>Kustic's Confusion</h2>

      No,  just as it is written, Kustic's confusion  does
not  stem  from his role as editor in chief of the  Catholic
Information  Agency.  In the already mentioned,  recognized,
important  and  relevant  weekly  Glas  Koncila,  which   is
published  by the archdioceses of Zagreb, Split, Vrhbosna,
Rijeka  and  Zadar,  which is headed  by  the  Archdioscesan
Chancellery  in  Zagreb,  the author(undoubtedly  Don  Zivko
Kustic)  questions the veracity of the claim that  religious
rights  are  being  violated in  the  Republic  of  Croatia,
despite the fact that it is being confirmed by the President
of the Meshihat of the Islamic Community in the Republic of
Croatia, and many others.<P>

       The  author  of  that  scandalous  text  negates  the
possibility  that  the  Catholic church  is  being  used  to
promote  political motives even though that same  claim  has
been put forth by the same publication several times in  the
past.   However,  it is not the first time  that  they  have
claimed  in  an  unacceptable and  uncivilized  way  that  a
document  from the CHC is composed in such a way so  as  to
appeal  most to those circles who are anticipating bad  news
about  Croatian  democracy.    I  do  not  know  why  it  is
necessary  for the commentary in Glas Koncila  to  encourage
hysteria about international opinions about Croatia.<P>

      However,  in the aforementioned text, I can  recognize
the  conscience of a man who, contrary to the  teachings  of
the  Catholic  church and its highest representative,  wrote
about   unseen humanity of war , as though there  existed  a
humane  form  of  war, who was responsible  along  with  the
editor  of  Glas  Kocila for informing his readers  just  as
Vjesnik(August  7, 1996) did, that the Pope   approved   the
military  action(without mentioning by Croatia by name,  nor
any  other antagonists) because  the solution is to be found
on  the  battlefield .  I therefore see a  man  who  is  not
prepared  to  admit that he was wrong when he  was  late  to
notice  the warnings of serious human rights violations  and
atrocious  crimes  taking place on  the  recently  liberated
territories,  threatening the future peace and long  awaited
justice, of those countless people who fled in the  wake  of
the Serbian aggression.  I see a member of the media who  is
responsible  for the fact that his Archbishop and  publisher
of  Glas Koncila was uninformed and told Italian journalists
that     everything   was   intact    following    Operation
Storm (Cardinal  Kuharic  on the daily  news  show  Corriere
della  sera,  according to Novi List on  August  28,  1995).
Even  though  it  is  true  that Zivko  Kustic,  some  other
journalists  and  especially the Catholic Archbishops  later
complained  about the crimes that were committed during  and
after   Operation  Storm , whenever I look  at  a  corpse  I
wonder how many fewer of them there might have been if  they
had reacted at the right time and in an adequate way.<P>


<h2>Turn to Love and Life, not to Lies and Shame</h2>

      Last week I found myself in the village of Komici near
Udbina  with an accused member of the CHC (and author of  one
of  the aforementioned statements), the honorable gentleman,
a retired Orthodox priest, Jovan Nikolic and a few employees
of   the  CHC  to  arrange  a  Christian  burial  for   Sava
Lavrnic (93)  and  her  son Petar (61) atrociously  killed  on
August  12, 1995, when a group of Croatian soldiers  invaded
this  little  village  near Lika and killed  a  few  elderly
people, and even burned them alive in their own homes while
they  lay in their beds.  The police officers who were there
with us did not hide their disgust and rage because that  is
not the way in which to defend Croatia, the country  we love
and  for  which we were ready to give our own lives.   Night
fell  shortly after Milivoj Lasan, the district  judge  from
Zadar  and  his  assistants (the plaintiff was also  present)
inspected  and  collected evidence from  the  scene  of  the
crime.<P>

      A  few of us were standing around the open grave while
father  Jovan  was leading the prayer for the souls  of  the
buried  when  the moon appeared from behind  the  mountains.
One  could hear the howls of wolves in the distance, perhaps
the  same  wolves that did not disturb the corpses for  over
half  a year because they fed on the remains of seven  slain
cows  that rested in front of Sava s and Petar s  house.   A
single coffin was lowered into the grave.  Inside it, mother
and  son were left in an endless embrace, to contemplate  in
the  peace of Lord, our need to repent and turn to love  and
life, not lies and shame.<P>

     The people who have committed themselves to serving the
citizens, Croatian democracy, ecumenical and inter-religious
dialogue  and  peace  in the Balkans are  being  accused  of
subtly  manipulating the topic of religious rights  in  this
country.  The people from the CHC did not want to release to
the  public  the  names of those people who  manipulate  the
media,  distribute propaganda and encourage totalitarianism,
nazism and fascism,  Chetnik  and  Ustasha  ideologies,  and
even manipulate history.  However, we are prepared to do so
if  the  churches do not resolve this issue within  each  of
their  respective  communities  and  primarily,  instead  of
dealing  with  the  issue through journalists  who  are  not
ashamed  to publish their attacks in newspapers that promote
totalitarian  ideologies  such  as  that  of  the   Ustasha,
including  their  associates who promote neo-nazi  and  neo-
Ustasha  folklore and oppose the teachings of the Pope  John
Paul  II  and the teachings of the Croatian Catholic Bishops
which  were bravely and wisely written in a special document
written in commemoration of the 50 year anniversary  of  the

<h2>One Does Not Need to Whisper Into the Ears of Bishops</h2>

      As we have already heard, one does not need to whisper
into  the ears of Bishops and move them to turn against  the
people who simply want peace, good, dialogue, justice and
respect.  The bishops can read for themselves and they  will
recognize the facts and intentions.  However, all those  who
are  familiar with the thinking of Zivko Kustic,  and  still
don't  know  that  he is not the Church's spokesperson,  and
because for all of those who were not able to read the CHC s
Statement  No.  33,  it is important  to  restate  that  the
Committee  does  not  condone the Catholic  church's 
agreements  with  the  government,  specifically  agreements
between   the   religious  Chair   and   the   Republic   of
Croatia (Zivko Kustic in Panorama), nor is it true that CHC's
statement  makes serious accusations against the leaders  of
the  Catholic church in Croatia because of violations of the
religious  rights of those citizens who are not Catholic  or
they  do not defend those people s rights. (Zivko Kustic  in
IKI)   If  necessary,  all of the members  of  the  CHC  are
prepared  to  show their personal income and honorariums  to
prove  that  they are not  fools, nor paid by  some  foreign
circles   just  like I was asked to do last  week  by  a  known
clergyman  and  his  witnesses  who's  identities  will   be
protected.<P>

      It  goes without saying that there will be a lot  more
said about the CHC's Statement No. 33 and Zivko Kustic;  not
simply because it is written in order to help those who  are
determined to pass the law described in Article 40, actually
41 of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia, including
a  law to regulate the status of religious communities which
is  openly supported by the Catholic bishops and rejected by
the CHC.  Therefore, the CHC is accused of contriving the timing
of its declaration.  If anything was contrived, then it was  on
the  part of the aforementioned publicist who set the  stage
to  perniciously instigate a conflict between the church and
the  CHC  immediately  before the meeting  of  the  Croatian
Archdioceses.<P>

         <h2> Who needs Kustic's change in attitude?</h2>
                              
      The scene is familiar.  Find an enemy from the inside,
publish a story about the left, actually the right pampering
and  abusing  the  bishops, or that other well  known  story
which  goes like this:  single someone out, strike  them,  and  praise
everyone   else    and   avoid   the   social   and   public
dissatisfaction.  Since the HDZ (Croatian Democratic  Union)-
started running a circus in Zagreb it is not receiving as many visitors as it
used  to,  not due to their political values it  represents,
but  due  to their immoral behavior.  On October  29,  1995,
Glas Koncila, the  new face of the church , printed a prayer
on  the front page, for the people who will choose who  they
will  entrust  with  the  power  associated  with  political
leadership.   They  should  therefore  complain  since   the
promises have not been kept and the prayers to God  for  our
nation  have  not been realized.  What about those  who  are
hungry for bread and justice?  We ll see.<P>

     If Zivko Kustic is not hungry and does not see any need
to  feel  any compassion for those whose human and religious
rights  are  being violated, nor respect for those  who  are
constantly fighting to see to it that there is as little  as
possible of such cases, at least on paper, then maybe  there
will  be  nothing in the end.  Yes, we know that he  has  on
several  occasions spoken out against those who have  abused
freedoms.  He admitted that it is hard not to agree with the
comments  made in Statement No. 33.  However,  he  viciously
attacked the dignified members of the CHC, and accused  Ivan
Zvonimir Cicak of abusing the Church and further created  an
atmosphere  that is conducive to the continued violation  of
human rights.<P>

      Does he think he is smarter than our bishops?  If not,
then why did he praise Statement No. 33 right before me and several
witnesses  and even went so far as to say that he  would  be
ready and willing to sign it himself.<P>

      With  his drastic change in attitude, Zivko Kustic  is
trying to direct the Statement at the Catholic church.  Very
low,   unpleasant   and  unacceptable.   Who   needs   that?
Certainly  not the members of the CHC.  Especially  not  the
religious community.  The HDZ?  We'll see.<P>

<h1>OPEN LETTER TO CROATIAN PUBLIC ON BEHALF OF THE EXECUTIVE 
COMMITTEE OF CROATIAN JOURNALISTS' ASSOCIATION RELATING TO 
THE "VJESNIK" VIOLATION OF BASIC PROFESSIONAL ETHICS</h1>
 

<h2>The Shameful Use of Journalists</h2> 

<em><strong>by Jagoda Vukusic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Novi list, Rijeka, Croatia, May 3, 1996</h2>

	For the past few weeks someone has been undertaking 
dangerous business, seriously distorting the truth, the 
country s image, people s destiny and producing the alibi of 
their past with journalistic feathers.  By publishing the article 
titled  Ivan Zvonimir Cicak has been working for the UDBA 
since 1966 , Vjesnik violated all professional criteria(the right 
of the other side, and of the five questions every journalist 
must ask, he failed to ask at least two - how and why) and 
with some unnamed individuals, probably from the Croatian 
secret service or their collaborators, became jointly responsible 
for the destruction of the last morsel of intellect in Croatia.  
They know that there are very few people who would ever 
believe that Cicak was an UDBA agent at the tender age of 18 
because it is widely known that he was imprisoned on account 
of his professed dedication to Croatia which was not made 
public when it should have; during the Croatian state s 
formative years, simultaneously with the de-udbanization.  
They are not interested in the truth.  They sit in their secret 
offices, in which they page though alleged Serbian secret 
intelligence documents (that are of serious nature but dubious 
none the less) and use Vjesnik and offer the Croatian public 
unsubstantiated claims, at a time when Croatian moral values 
are in question.<P>
	We will still side with these secret instigators of chaos 
despite the fact that they have just shamefully misused the 
journalists and abused and played with the public - once they 
cease to be the puppets of these secret agents and present 
themselves as a credible newspaper.  We are fed up with both 
their and our weeds.  If they are not prepared to satisfy, then 
at least they could do is stop insulting our intelligence and 
leave all us other journalists alone.<P>  
	We wish all those who stand behind their ruining the 
reputation of the journalistic profession, the editor in chief of 
Vjesnik, as well as the person below him who took part in this 
 collaboration , to the Zagreb financial police which closed the 
offices and repossessed the computer discs with the previously 
published texts of the weekly Panorama for hygienic and 
ecological reasons (?) a very nice and successful May 3rd; the 
international day in commemoration of the free press.<P>

 <h1>Sudden Resurrection of the Directive</h1>

<strong><em>by Hrvoje Turkovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Hrvatski Vijenac, Zagreb, Croatia, 3/7 1996</h2> 

Why did Croatian Television (HRT) (actually its "executive powers") feel an obligation to start every episode of the documentary series <em> the Death of Yugoslavia</em> (director Angus Mac Queen, Great Britain, 1995) with an anonymous editorial personalized in the announcer, which repeatedly tried to convince that the series is incomplete, confusing, biased, unobjective, malicious etc.?  Why was this done, against the prevailing media custom not to give special introductions to programs, but only announce them and later discuss the controversial ones  (as was supposed to be done with this series as well)?<P>

<center>
***
</center><P>

A supporter of this approach would probably, among other, argue that the series was made "very skillfully" ("highly professionally") and that uninformed and unsophisticated audience (usually with short memory) could believe that everything is really the way it was presented in <em>the Death of Yugoslavia</em>, and especially in those parts (very unflattering at that) which concern Croatian participation in those events.  Obviously, it is better to prevent that sort of development than to try later to modify it.<P>

An offended viewer might say that the introductions were obviously the expression of the belief in at the Croatian TV that the Croatian TV audience is made of naive fools and people incapable of making their own judgments, and ready to accept anything as long as it is sufficiently skillfully presented; because of that they had to be instructed about the "nature" of the program, and its "actual" quality.<P>

A lot of people do accept the information served on TV and accept the attitude expressed in leading TV programs as their own.  On the other hand a lot of them accept with criticism and dissatisfaction TV programs and loudly express that (as many opinion polls demonstrate).  As both "facts" stand, both opinions are also right.<P>

Nevertheless, the prevailing opinion is that a <em>mass medium</em>, the one addressing a large and in many ways diverse audience, trying to reach all of it, should count on a possible misunderstanding (since people are not always concentrating, have different educational backgrounds, different TV watching experiences etc.) and clarify things so that "everyone understands".  That's better than to assume refined understanding and than fail to accomplish that.  Because of that, the Television has a right to take as its starting point in broadcast and production of its programs <em>the assumed stupidity</em> (of its intended audience): a program, its attitude has to be clear to the most stupid person in the audience.<P>

Of course the preceding is simply a <em>rationalization</em>, that is a sufficiently convincing justification for a practice which follows from different reasons.  Actually, Television (also our television, HRT) takes into account that the receptory capabilities of the audience are different and prepares different types of programs for different types of audience: children programs for children, amusement programs for an uninvolved viewer seeking relaxation, more involved programs for intellectually demanding viewers, opera for opera lovers, sport programs for sport fans etc.  With this diversity, television attempts to satisfy its diverse audience.  <em>Reduction to the most stupid viewer</em> is definitely not the basis for the production of all programs.  Only some of them.<P>

<h2>Who Is Stupid Here?</h2>   

Therefore, seemingly this <em>assumed stupidity</em> really guided the writers of the editorial about <em>The Death of Yugoslavia</em>; they really didn't care whether the statements regarding the British series truly portrayed the most salient characteristics of the program.  As if they believed that the audience's stupidity is such that it wouldn't recognize even obvious false statements, all because of the trust and the authority of the "editorial room".<P>

For example, in the introduction to the third episode of the series, <em>Doors of Hell</em>, the announcer quoted "... a sentence which exemplifies the viewpoint of the authors:' Wars may be planned on maps and in closed rooms, but they start with a string of stupidities and in chaos.'"  After that he continued:" Of course, the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina did not start like this.  As we know, it was planned and executed in cold blood by the greater Serbian elite in Belgrade, with the help of Yugoslav peoples Army, Karadzic's followers and Seselj's and Arkan's criminals."  Finally, he concluded:" In this confusing British series, the order of events, actions and their significance were not portrayed in a way which would allow an uninformed viewer to form a clear picture of all developments on the Bosnian soil."  Therefore, the editorial, partly openly and partly through insinuations, stated that the authors of the series did not consider the planning of the war important and put more emphasis on the events in the field; those events were confusing and presented in a confusing way; finally that sort of approach was confusing and did not provide "the full picture".<P>

Afterwards you watched the episode and found out the opposite.  The authors, with the investigative passion and in a very convincing and clear manner present exactly how Serb planning <em>prepares and causes seemingly</em> spontaneous, cruel ("confusing") events "in the field".  The investigative passion of the authors comes out in their attempts to uncover in the elite, ideologists and key political leaders, those ideas, decisions, actions, predictions which reveal the merciless logic behind those seemingly so "irrational" and "wild" events.  The series, in spite of the widely held belief, both abroad and at home, that the war in the former Yugoslavia was an explosion of spontaneous primitivism, inhumanity, irrational tribal instincts and primal evil, reveals that behind everything one finds political calculations, struggle for power, skillful recklessness, good and bad judgments; in short, exactly the ingredients of the world politics.  The authors uncover that clearly, convincingly, especially because they try to keep track, as much as possible, of the wide variety of interests and personality traits of the participants, expressed through personal testimonials and mutual portrayals of the protagonists.  The series is professionally impressive exactly because of its meticulously <em>transparent complexity</em>, because it avoids emotional (propagandist) reductionism (although it is choosy and naturally, since it is their and not our program, it gives "their" and not "our" interpretation of the events).  It tries to be <em>revealing</em>: it reveals the engine behind the surface commotion.  That is why it bothers those (among Serbs, Slovenes and us) who insist on that deceptive surface commotion.<P>

<h2>New Hair of Socialism</h2>

Most likely, the series hurts our TV-political caretakers because it cannot be used as a fodder for our interpretation of the events and our slogans.<P>

This is , I believe, also the reason for the obvious carelessness in connection with the introductory editorial.  The purpose of the introduction was not to really <em>unmask</em> the hidden motives of the series: it is hard to believe that the editorial writers were so naive to believe that appropriate outraged commentaries which would immediately be refuted by the series could effectively "unmask" anything.<P>

The purpose is easily recognized in this region: the introduction was the <em>directive</em> (to use this awful term for shaggy socialist practice which is today obviously growing new hair).  That is, the introduction was <em> a lesson which demonstrated how one was expected to talk about issues in public</em>.  In this case, we are talking about the directive which proscribes how one <em>must not</em> talk about key political issues: one must not be emotionally neutral, must not talk "from a foreign point of view", but only from ours, and not any "our" point of view but the one which is identical to the template provided by the president of the state, his spokespersons, spokespersons of the ruling party, media exponents of the state policy etc.<P>

The directive need not be convincing in its content, only in its implications.  Directive must be followed, not because you believe in it (although that is desirable), but because you know that you will experience unpleasant (and in the long term possibly fatal) consequences if you don't, and possibly very favorable consequences if you loudly follow the directive and eagerly spread it around.<P> 

<h2>Appropriate Views</h2>

A careful reader may object at this point: local series of introductions is too small a sample to base the theory about resuscitated directivism on it.  They would be right, if that was the only manifestation of directivism.  Unfortunately this is not the case.  Actually, the beginning of the tenure of Obrad Kosovac, the old reliable news "cadre" from the age of reliable socialist directivism, as the editor of the TV news program, marks the sudden resurrection of directivism.  Anonymous editorials again received their frequent and important spot in news programs, giving, as in the past, a model of how one should think and speak about the key issues of the policies of our rulers; finally, in addition to "editorials" Kosovac also introduced "specific issue oriented" commentators (for example Nenad Ivankovic and Jozo Curic; in the past we had "party intellectuals" who personally followed and judged cultural events: empty directive commentaries were reserved for the key issues of daily politics) who reliably (and with "individual cover") set out the "desirable views".  Ever more frequently, talk shows with mostly leading politicians from the ruling party and important state institutions and caring hosts take the directive approach. Etc.<P>

Of course, not all programs have a coat of directivist paint.  Only those which treat key political issues.  The measure of directivism (interpretation of news and commentary) in a given program is the indicator of the importance of the issue in question.  The more the program slides towards marginal political issues the freer it is from directivism.  However, there is no doubt, directivism has firmly established itself at the Croatian TV (as well as in the statements and public appearances of our leading politicians) when the key political issues are concerned.<P>

If you can bear to be considered a traitor of the nation, an ally of the enemy, destabilizing factor, enemy, that your acquaintances look at you with mistrust and avoid you, you won't follow directives; you will publicly say what you think.  For how long?<P>

<h1>Sons of One Mother</h1>

<strong><em>by Zlatko Gall</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vijenac, Zagreb, Croatia, March 21 1996</h2>

Are the Croats hopeless yugonostalgics?<P>

It seems they are.<P>

This is not a contradiction in terms, but a still strong need to blow up
our flaccid national ego in desperate competition against Yugoslavia.<P>

State controlled Television systematically presents Belgrade problems as
Croatian successes, while the Serbian poverty is a proof for our "wealth"
and, as the President would say, the heap of performed "miracles".  Wave 
of suicides of pensioners in Belgrade is a clear message to the domestic
retired poverty that it could be worse, although the pension checks are
increasingly late.  Lousy Serbian wages have a similar role in the promotion
of the Croatian wealth, while the ironic remarks about Belgrade criminals
who have forced the citizens underground should be a "compensation" for
"ruralization" and primitive character of Croatian cities.  Domestic
"mafiocracy" seems tame and harmless when compared with their Belgrade counterparts,
whose showdowns complete the picture of the metropolis from the "wild east"...<P>

Ironic smile, which has been patented by Ljiljana Bunjevac Filipovic and
quickly adopted by all <em>talking heads</em> at the Croatian TV, has
become an unavoidable part of the iconography of the features "from
the other side of the Drina".  Even when those <em>talking heads</em>
are conveying the statements of Serbian opposition leaders and their claims
that the Serbian state TV is under the control of the ruling party.<P>

Of course, state TV is not the only institution which tickles the national skin
with the <em>peep-show</em> of the naked <em>Yugoslavia</em>.  High circulation "global"
weekly [Nacional] dedicates a weekly column written by the capable pen of Pero Zlatar to 
<em>Serbian affairs</em>, the analysis of the Serbian press. <em>Panorama</em>
has Goran Milic, while the national weekly with a global name [Globus] fights
the competition using exotic media safaris to the reservations of our neighbors,
with whom we had been, until recently, united in brotherhood.  True, the starting
premise of the Croatian press is significantly different from that of the Croatian
TV: instead of propaganda, the press is guided by the market.  Hunger for the news
from the other side is obvious.  In accordance with the categories in which
the state and political leadership places its opponents, one should expect that
the denounced "yugonostalgic" and "Serb loving" circles put a lot of effort
in grabbing a lot of media space for their Serbian brothers.  Wrong.  Although
denounced from the very top [by president Tudman] as convinced yugonostalgics
and Serb lovers, <em>Feral Tribune</em> does not offer space to Bokan [Serbian
extremist paramilitary leader] nor to Milic od Macve [Serbian mystical painter,
one of the founders of Serbian proto-fascist movement].  In <em>Feral</em>,
we can usually read about the <em>Serbs from the bottom</em>, dissidents and
opposition members.  Why?  because of significantly different <em>starting premise</em>
of the editorial team: their goal is to subvert the theories about collective guilt
and justice.  Maybe, that's why <em>Feral</em> is deemed dangerous.  Since, an
interview with Bogdan Bogdanovic [Serbian architect, former mayor of Belgrade,
and a harsh critic of Serb policy in Bosnia and Croatia], unlike Bokan's appearance
in <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em>, doesn't confirm the theories of the domestic "hard-liners".
Those "hard-liners" find the justification for their resurrection of Croatian
fascism and the Poglavnik in all those Bokans and Arkans, Milics and Seseljs...
whom inhabit the foreign media space.  Besides, let's recall which Serb-Croatian
sessions received the most criticizm among the <em>hardcore</em> Croats.
Our leader smiling to the cameras in the company of infamous Slobo[dan Milosevic,
Serbian president]?  Friendly meetings of Mate Granic and Milan Milutinovic
[Croatian and Yugoslav foreign ministers]?  The exchange of <em>consular offices</em>
between Belgrade and Zagreb...?  No.  The criticism was reserved for the meeting
of Serbian and Croatian intellectuals (or "intellectuals", in doesn't matter)
in <em>Mimara</em> and the dilemmas regarding the visits of Serbian artists.
The thinking is clear: Bokan - yes, Balasevic [popular Serbian singer, active in
the peace movement] - no.  Since the former one is the archetypal Serb at whom
one looks over a rifle aim in an execution squad, and the latter one a harmless
singing reminder of the <em>better past</em> or the more bearable and more tolerant 
future.  Take your pick.<P>

Is it surprising that the recent sport success of the Croatian female handball team
- mostly thanks to Tonci Vrdoljak [Croatian Olympic Committee president, remarkable
because of his racist remarks] who is obviously trying to position himself for
a political <em>come back</em> - and the victory against the Yugoslav team was
turned into a political circus?  Victory by seventeen goals, according to the Sport 
Billy from the Croatian Olympic Committee and the back up media team, wasn't simply
a good sport result which would take our cats to the high society, but the
showdown with the greater Serbian policy, revenge for the crimes committed in Croatia,
and the proof of the Croatian genetic supremacy over "boneheads".  Besides,
no one bothered to hide that, and even the moderate commentator of <em>Slobodna 
dalmacija</em> wrote that the match in Hungary was politicized with a reason,
mentioning somewhere in his text that "the primary purpose of matches is 
sport competition" (sic!).<P>

Tonci Vrdoljak and his henchmen from the Croatian Olympic Committee obviously
turned upside down all the tenets of the Olympic movement which they were supposed to
promote and defend by putting sport in the service of politics. (...)<P>

Still all that media picking through the dirty laundry of our unrecognized
neighbors [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia wasn't recognized by most
major world powers at the time] has one unfortunate side effect: it provides
undeniable proof of the similarities between us.  True, Serbs were more efficient
in attacks on Soros' <em>Open Society Fund</em>, but the attacks at the "sponsors
of anti-Croatianism" which repeatedly come from the Croatian and HDZ [ruling 
party in Croatia] leadership are almost identical.  Serbia started its campaign 
against Soros as a CIA agent and a traitorous benefactor whose gifts stink to
the heaven, by declining the badly needed dollars invested into computers and
education.  Croatia still lags behind "the trend", and Vokic's [Croatian minister
for education] rejection of computers donated to domestic schools is probably
the first indicator of "the harder course".<P>

Demonization of the West, fear of the real integration into European norms of
civilized behavior, mass production of domestic and foreign enemies, use of
Croatian TV as a party propaganda machine, relationship with the Hague Tribunal
for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia... conclude the list of touching 
similarities.  After all, even the activism of Bakovic's [Croatian hard line Catholic
priest (anti-choice, anti-European, pro-war, etc.)] fertility movement has
a counterpart and a "partner" in, who else, Serb Orthodox Church, which, as
faithfully inform the domestic media, is in the middle of a large promotional
campaign which includes round tables with instructive names: <em>Abortion</em>,
<em>Orthodox Marriage</em>...  Claims that  abortion is an evil which had
been introduced from the West are proven by the data about 150,000 legal 
abortions and the catastrophic predictions that "by year 2020, Serbs will have
become a minority in central Serbia".  Sounds familiar?<P>

Sons of the same mother, in primitivism, intolerance, xenophobia, totalitarian
mentality, can not do otherwise.  Everything else is nothing but a rhetoric and a 
cheap political demagoguery.<P>

<h2><A NAME="arson">ARSON AND DEATH</a> PLAGUE SERBIAN REGION OF CROATIA</h2>

<em>By CHRIS HEDGES<br>
c. 1995 New York Times News Service, 9/30/95</em><P>

   KNIN, Croatia  Nearly two months after Croatian forces drovemore than 120,000 Serbian troops and civilians from the Krajinaregion of Croatia, Serbian villages continue to burn and an averageof four to six Serbian civilians are found dead each day, sayofficials of the United Nations and the European Union.<P>

   The failure by the Croatian government to stem the violence, despite its assurances that the killings and destruction are being carried out by ``renegades,'' has led U.N. officials here to conclude that the attacks are part of a systematic campaign to drive the 3,500 remaining Serbs from the Krajina and prevent those who want to return from coming back.<P>

   ``Since the August offensive, U.N. patrols have documented a systematic campaign of arson, murder and looting by the Croatian military,'' said Alun R. Roberts, the U.N. press officer in Knin.  He said Croatian troops had ``destroyed whole Serb villages, making it impossible for those Serbs who fled to return.<P>

   ``Our U.N. patrols are continuing to find bodies, usually of elderly Serbs, killed in their homes. Despite repeated requests by the U.N. to the Croatian authorities to intervene, they appear to make little effort, and usually do nothing.''<P>

   In an effort to stem the mounting criticism, the Croatian authorities have invited the Serbs who fled to return and the Croatian government said this week that about 370 people had been arrested for looting.<P>

   And the Croatian Parliament has postponed putting a confiscation law into effect, to give Serbs until December to reclaim their property before having it taken over by the Croatian state.<P>

   But much of that property now lies in ruins. Burning houses, including five that were set ablaze Saturday 10 miles northeast of Knin in the village of Strmica, throw jets of flame into the sky.<P>

   Whole villages are charred and gutted, cars sit overturned and stripped on the asphalt, broken furniture lies scattered around the dirt yards and chickens, often the only sign of life, peck and cackle among the ruins.<P>

   ...........<P>

 But U.N. officials said the drive to wipe out Serbian villages was too well organized to be totally haphazard.<P>

    In an internal report published on Sept. 20, officials of the European Community Monitoring Mission said that of 18,232 houses in 240 Serbian villages they had monitored, more than 13,600, or 73 percent, had been completely or partly destroyed.<P>

   ``The Croats have tried over the past few years to distance themselves from the behavior of the Serbs,'' said one European Union monitor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``But now they are carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing as effective, and often as brutal, as that carried out by the Serbs. Only the uniforms are different; the behavior is the same.''<P>

   The killing of elderly Serbs, many of them too weak to flee, has shocked and angered U.N. and European Union monitors here. Many of the victims lived alone in abandoned hamlets, where they would be visited by aid workers bringing food. In recent weeks many have been found dead, usually with a single bullet wound in the head.<P>

   Earlier this month, Croatian special forces made a sweep through the largely deserted Plavno Valley, where some 40 Serbian hamlets lie abandoned or in ruins. U.N. peacekeepers following the sweep found two elderly men dead, one shot in the back of the head and the other with his throat cut. The next day, the United Nations found three more elderly Serbs killed, including a 90-year-old woman.<P>

   ``Evidence of atrocities, an average of six corpses a day, continues to emerge,'' says the latest European Union rights report. ``The corpses, some fresh, some decomposed, are mainly old men. Many have been shot in the back of the head or had throats slit. Others have been mutilated. Isolated pockets of elderly civilians report people gone missing or detained.''<P>

   Only about 100 of the more 120,000 Serbs who fled have returned to the Krajina, and most of those have slipped into the area without official permission, U.N. officials said. Those who try to return through the Croatian government office in Belgrade are rarely given permission, these officials said.<P>

   ``As far as we can see, the Croatian office in Belgrade is quite purposely dysfunctional,'' one European Union official said. ``The object is to keep the Serbs out.''<P>

   The Serbs who remain live in terror, often fleeing to the hills when cars carrying marauding Croats come into their villages.<P>

   ``A few days after the Croats came, I found my 95-year-old father with his throat slashed,'' said Pajic Petar, a Serb who lives in the village of Zorici, about 15 miles north of Knin. ``We buried him with another old man who was murdered. Each day the soldiers come and take more of our animals and our belongings, telling us to shut up or we will die.''<P>

   Looting and arson take place openly in nearly every village. At a gutted Serbian farm Saturday morning, troops from the 72nd Military Police Batallion were trying to push a horse into a trailer. The troops said they would be back in the afternoon to cart away the terra cotta roof tiles.<P>

   Croats in trucks roamed up and down the dirt lanes, parking outside abandoned homes to load sinks, bathroom fixtures, household utensils and farm tools into the back.<P>

   On a hillside outside of Popovici, five miles south of Knin, 89-year-old Djuka Popovic stood timidly near a small one-story stone house. Like most of the elderly Serbs here, she is being stripped of her belongings and her farm animals.<P>

   ``The soldiers force their way into my home and steal things,'' she said. ``They took my television, my clock and my smoked hams. I dread every noise. I dread the sound of the cars and the trucks coming into our village. And I dread the night, when I lie alone inmy house and wonder if I will be here in the morning.''<P>

<h2><a NAME="lootingrolls"> Krajina looting</a> spree rolls on despite arrests</h2>
<h5> Fri, 29 Sep 1995</h5>

  	  	
	 KNIN, Croatia (Reuter) - Croatian soldiers and civilians are carrying out a wave of house-burning, looting and killing on former Serb properties in Croatia's recaptured Krajina region, U.N. officials and eyewitnesses said Friday.<P>
  
	 Croatian authorities, under U.N. pressure, have reported arresting 370 people, including some soldiers, for looting and burning houses. But the United Nations said the rampage for war booty by the victors was continuing.  <P>

	 ``We welcome the arrests but there's still far too little sign of effective policing of these areas,'' Alun Roberts, the spokesman at the U.N. Sector South peacekeeping operation based in the Krajina's remote main city of Knin, told Reuters.  <P>

	 ``The few old people left behind in these areas are reporting, in a consistent pattern, harassment and looting.  <P>

	 ``U.N. patrols are reporting the looting to be by persons in Croatian military uniform or by people in civilian clothes often carrying rifles or sidearms,'' Roberts said.  <P>

	 The road from the edge of the Krajina at Karlovac, 20 miles south of Zagreb, to Knin, some 150 miles south of the Croatian capital, is a wasteland of burned-out houses, and aimless abandoned farm animals.  <P>

	 Serb villages in the hills around Knin are practically deserted. Some elderly Serbs who remain said they had seen Croatian soldiers looting houses before burning them.  <P>

	 The United Nations and the United States have warned Croatia it must respect the rights of Serb civilians if it expects to get financial help for postwar reconstruction in the republic.  <P>

	 This correspondent saw small groups of armed men in Croatian army camouflage gear driving into the deserted Serb villages in the Plavno Valley north of Knin in private cars Thursday.  <P>

	 Some of these men went into abandoned Serb houses and emerged with sacks of objects. Asked what they were doing, one soldier replied: ``Looking for somebody. Be careful. You could get lost around here.''  <P>

	 Some abandoned houses had clearly been ransacked. Drawers and cupboards had been emptied, their contents strewn on the floor. Nothing valuable was left.  <P>

	 The authorities had sent men with trucks to round up stray livestock. This reporter saw one of the trucks in the Plavno Valley being loaded not only with horses and cows but also with furniture.  <P>

	 Roberts said that since the Croatian Army captured the area and crushed a five-year-old Serb rebellion Aug. 5, the U.N. peacekeepers had recorded over 120 killings of civilians.  <P>

	 ``The majority were of elderly (Serbs) living in isolated hamlets. Several of these bodies were shot at close range. In these instances on several occasions U.N. soldiers observed Croatian military personnel in the vicinity,'' he said.  <P>

	 ``Over the past two weeks we've seen further examples of looting of houses in hamlets where elderly people are living. ``We're now seeing people who they describe as dressed in military uniform revisiting the locations and removing bathtubs, kitchen appliances and the remaining furniture.  ``Through these actions, the U.N. Sector South is very much aware that the intention is to prevent any means of existence or return,'' Roberts said.  <P>

	 The crime wave resembles what happened in northern Bosnia in 1992, when Croat and Muslim homes were looted and torched by marauding Serb forces who seized the area and carried out a wave of ``ethnic cleansing'' in a bid to make it purely Serb.

<h2> <a NAME="croarrests">Croatia Looting Arrests: 400</a></h2>   
<h5> Wed, 27 Sep 1995</h5>               
                                                  
  	  	
	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- More than 400 people, including dozens of soldiers, have been arrested in Croatia on charges of looting and burning down houses of fleeing ethnic Serbs, U.N. officials said Wednesday. <P>

.....<P>

	The arrests, which the United Nations said took place in recent days, are the first action by Croatian authorities against suspected looters. The government initially denied that any Serb homes had been looted or burned.  <P>

	Those detained include 70 policemen, 65 soldiers and 260 civilians, U.N. spokesman Chris Gunness said. Thirty soldiers were formally charged with looting and burning property, he said.  <P>

	``We are delighted that the Croatian authorities are now admitting that such events took place despite initial strong denials by senior figures including (Croatian) President Franjo Tudjman,'' Gunness said.  <P>

	Despite the arrests, looting and the burning of property continued Wednesday, almost two months after fighting stopped, Gunness said.  <P>

	``We have been informed by Croat police of their great concern that looting continues in Krajina, but they claim that with fighting ongoing in Bosnia they have insufficient men to curb excesses in Krajina,'' he said.  <P>

	On Monday, U.N. observers reported seeing uniformed Croatian soldiers stealing from Serb houses in the village of Komcarev Kraj, in southern Croatia.  <P>

	Gunness also said that the United Nations was watching carefully to see if Croat authorities will locate and charge those responsible for the murder of Serb civilians during the Croat blitz.  <P>

	``We found well over 100 bodies, dozens of which were civilians,  and a number of mass graves after the military action. People in   civilian clothes with bullets in the back of their heads were among those discovered,'' Gunness said. <P>
                                  
	No Croatian officials were available to comment on the arrests and the reports of continued crimes against Serb property.  <P>

<h2> <a NAME="housedestroyed">A third of all</a> Krajina houses destroyed - minister</h2>
<h5>Sun, 24 Sep 1995</h5>

  	  	
	 ZAGREB, Croatia (Reuter) - One third of all housing in Croatia's Krajina region, held by rebel Serbs from 1991 until last month, has been destroyed, a Croatian minister said Sunday. <P> 

	 Much of the other two-thirds had suffered damage, but could be repaired, Development and Reconstruction Minister Jure Radic told the daily Vjesnik.  <P>

	.......... <P>

	 Radic conceded there had been some looting and pillaging after the Croat victory. Isolated looting incidents were still going on as Croatian authorities struggled to reimpose order in the largely deserted region, he said.<P>
  
	 ``I myself saw things being stolen, such as refrigerators and radiators, something our government strongly condemns,'' he said. ``In those places where (Croat) people have already gone back, such problems are almost non-existent.''  <P>

	 Independent eyewitnesses have accused first the Serbs and then the Croats of destroying the homes and stealing movable property of the rival ethnic group to ensure it can never return to dispute control of the region.  <P>

	 Reporters visiting Krajina have found it a wasteland of destroyed villages with burned-out houses, abandoned farms and scattered livestock.  <P>

	 Radic said that of the 123,000 houses and flats in Krajina, which forms an arc along the underside of Croatia's boomerang shape, 35 percent were ruined beyond repair.  <P>

	 He said Serb property would remain in the hands of the Croatian state until a final peace settlement between the warring parties had been reached.  <P>

<h2><A NAME="loosehomes">CROATIA-HUMAN RIGHTS:</a> Serbs Set to Lose Homes in Zagreb Land Grab</h2>

<em>By Branko Milinkovic<br>
[c] 1995, InterPress Third World News Agency (IPS), 19-Sep-95</em><P>


BELGRADE, Sep 19 (IPS) - Tens of thousands of Serbs forced to flee their homes in Krajina last month following a major Croatian military offensive, stand to lose their property -- without compensation -- under new laws enacted by the Zagreb authorities.<P>

In what represented the single largest exodus of an ethnic population in more than four years of war in the former Yugoslavia, an estimated 200,000 Serbs fled their homes in the Croatian region of Krajina in early August, taking little with them, as the Croatian army reclaimed the Serb-populated territory.<P>

By the end of August, the Croatian government announced a new property ownership decree which human rights activists say only serves to ''legalise its ethnic cleansing'' since the laws effectively prevent Serb expatriates from reclaiming their land and houses.<P>

The decree is applicable to persons who left Croatia in the exodus and citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) who own property in Croatia but ''do not use it personally''.<P>

According to the decree, announced on Aug 31, a special local commission will distribute these ''abandoned'' properties to ''Croatian refugees who had lost their property in war, and all others who are working on security and reconstruction of formerly occupied territories''.<P>

Those Serbians who fled together with citizens of Serbia and Montenegro who own properties in Croatia have until the end of September to appear before the special commission in Zagreb to try to reclaim their property -- an impossible deadline to meet in view of the prevailing circumstances, say human rights activists.<P>

''Such a short deadline for Krajina Serbs to claim their property rights in Croatia is the best proof that Croatian authorities do not want them back,'' says Elena Popovic of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia (HOS). ''The problem for these people is that they can't obtain all the papers they
need in 30 days.''<P>

''They have to obtain their residence permit in the Croatian office in Belgrade, papers from the office of the Serbian Republic of Krajina and passport or some travel document,'' Popovic adds. ''According to our estimates they need a few months to complete this documentation.''<P>

HOS says the decree runs contrary even to the Croatian constitution. It is a ''clear case of national and ethnic discrimination'' against Croatian Serbs, said the human rights group.<P>

''To classify certain property as 'abandoned' from the legal point of view, clear expression of the will of its owner is needed. Since Krajina Serbs left Croatia because of the war operations of the Croatian army without their will, this property can't be treated as abandoned,'' insists Dragor Hiber, professor
of civil law at Belgrade University.<P>

''As far as summer houses of the Yugoslav citizens in Croatia are concerned, the fact that owners do not use them personally at this moment, due to the political circumstances, has nothing to do with the substance of their property right. This decree discriminates against them in favour of all other foreigners who
own property in Croatia,'' he adds.<P>

Gaso Knezevic, professor of international private law in Belgrade, agrees: ''The decree of the Croatian government violates a right to private property which is a internationally recognised human right.<P>

''However, refugees from Krajina can't go to any international court to claim this right. The international court of justice in the Hague is for states only, while the European court in Strasbourg is for citizens of the countries which are members of the Council of Europe,'' he adds.<P>

Knezevic believes the chances of Krajinan Serb refugees regaining their property without outside assistance are slim. The only way, he says, to avoid degeneration of the situation into ''personal struggles'' and futile ''initiatives'' against the Croatian administration is to put together a team of experts to help claimants.<P>

''An extra legal problem for these people is the fact that they have no citizenship at the moment. The Serbian Republic of Krajina was never recognised as an independent state. They never asked for Croatian citizenship and they are not citizens of the former Yugoslavia either,'' adds Knezevic.<P>

Legal experts in Belgrade have been debating the best way for the soon-to-be dispossessed to proceed.<P>

Some argue that expatriates should demand Croatian citizenship now. Others believe it is better to make an inventory of their properties together with Yugoslav authorities with the intention of seeking compensation in the future.<P>

The issue has hit newspaper headlines in Serbia, prompting the government of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to last week send a letter to U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali asking him to intervene.<P>

The letter, signed by Prime Minister Radoje Kontic urged the U.N. Secretary General to ''stop the seizure of property in Croatia on an ethnic basis'' and to ''expand the mandate of the U.N. forces in Croatia to protect property of Serbs until the final peace solution for the former Yugoslavia is reached''.<P>

Kontic warned that by issuing this decree Croatia violated its commitments under U.N. Security Council resolution 1009, issued in August, which obliged all signees to ''facilitate a return of persons who have left their homes''.<P>

The prime minister said that, from the point of view of the Yugoslav Republic, the Croatian government's decree is just a ''legalisation of the ethnic cleansing''.<P>

He also asked the Security Council to force Croatia to compensate those Serbs who do not want to go back and to save all documents which might be used as case evidence by Serb claimants.<P>

But HOS' Popovic says the government must go further. ''The Yugoslav authorities have to go beyond writing letters to the U.N. They have to adequately regulate the status of refugees from Krajina. For those who want to stay in Serbia, a consistent policy of settlement is needed. Those who want to go back to Croatia
should be assisted.<P>

''If the government really wants to fight for their (Serbian) rights by diplomatic means, this is the best chance to show that,'' she adds. (END/IPS/EU-IP/BM/KG/95)<P>

          <h2> Zagreb ensures Serbs will never see their homes again;</h2>  

<h3>Robert Fisk in Golubic, Krajina, finds the Croats preparing for the final act of ethnic cleansing</h3>

<em>By: Robert Fisk in Golubic, Krajina</em><P>

  The police chief was only trying to be helpful. How, he asked the UN
official he stopped on the road here, could he obtain food for the old Serbs
left in the hill villages? He was feeding them with supplies from his police
station at Strmica and - as he put it - "I don't think the army are able to 
help them."<P>

  He was a young cop from Split, uncontaminated by the ethnic cleansing of
Krajina by  Croatia's  "special forces" and their slaughter of surviving Serbs.
"He's trying to save these Serbs from the army - he's a decent guy," one UN man
muttered.<P>

  These days, Krajina is mighty short of decent Croats. Officially, the
government has asked all Serbs who wish to return to their homes after the
August exodus of more than 200,000 to do so. But the government in Zagreb knows
very well that its troops are burning almost every Serb village, thus ensuring
there are no Serb homes to return to; and already legislation is being 
concocted to ensure that only a token few can ever come back to the land in 
which their ancestors lived for 400 years.<P>

  According to Croatian television, the Zagreb authorities are drawing up a
new "temporary management of abandoned property" law - remarkably similar to 
the Absentee Property Law passed by the Israelis after the flight of 750,000
Palestinians from what is now Israel after the 1948 war. The Croatian 
government wants control of property "belonging to Croatian and Yugoslav ie 
Serb citizens who abandoned it by leaving Croatia  . . .  including those who 
left after Operation Storm . . . to protect it from wanton damage, and to put 
it to temporary use". According to one Croatian press report, Serbs have from 
35 to 40 days after publication of the property decree to reclaim their land.<P>

  The Zagreb government, the same report claims, "is trying to protect this
very exposed property while observing all constitutional and international
provisions concerning inviolability of private property". This, however, is
untrue. The Croats are placing their own refugees from  Bosnia  in abandoned
apartments in the former Serb Krajina "capital" of Knin. Furthermore, many
Croats who exchanged homes with Serbs when the war began in 1991 have returned
to claim back their original property - while keeping the Serb homes on the
coast which they accepted in 1991. A large number of Croats have thus ended up
with two homes at the expense of Serbs who now have no home at all.<P>

  UN and European Union monitors in Krajina have discovered that even those
Serbs who remained after the August capture of Krajina have found it almost
impossible to obtain the necessary Croatian documents to stay.<P>

  "In Popovici," one EU report states, "we met some people, among them Serbs
who wanted to become Croatian citizens, but they didn't know anything about the
procedure, and have no means to go to Knin to get the right documents . . . 
they keep contact by phone with Serbs who fled to Belgrade and told us that 
many of them wanted to come back, but it was impossible at present because 
they couldn't get the necessary documents from the Croatian embassy."<P>

  A separate EU report acknowledges that "a few Serb civilians have managed to
worm their way through bureaucratic channels and have registered for Croatian
citizenship. They have received a 200 Kuna (pounds 20) gratuity per family and
pensions are promised in September . . . plans are being developed for house
repairs. However, it is very easy to present a caring public image, when the
population is mostly geriatric and therefore temporary." And it is on the
legislation books that the Croatians are preparing to commit the final act of
ethnic cleansing in Krajina.<P>

  President Tudjman and his right-wing speaker of parliament, Vladimir Seks,
want to revise the constitutional laws on the protection of minorities -
legislation which Germany insisted on before it was prepared to recognise the
independence of  Croatia  - on the grounds that the Serb exodus has left the
country with only 3 per cent of Serbs in its population. Further revision is
promised to the electoral law, under which Croatian minorities with more than 8
per cent of the population were entitled to seats in parliament under a system
of proportional representation. If new laws are passed, Serbs would lose the
notional 12 or 13 parliamentary seats which they would have been entitled to.<P>

  Under the agreement signed by Croatia and the UN on 6 August, Croatia
guarantees the protection and human rights of all who wish to live in Krajina
and their free departure - but not their return. As a third humanitarian
report, from the UN, makes clear, Serbs in Krajina probably have little option
but to leave. "Based on the record developing of rampant human rights 
violations in the sector and no effective security measures being taken by the
authorities," it says, "it is felt the question of a mass evacuation will have
to be addressed very soon . . ."<P>

  In 10 years' time, no doubt, the Croatians will tell the world how they
officially encouraged "their" Serbs to return to Krajina while the Serbs
preferred to stay in Belgrade. By which time, legislation will have ensured 
that returning Serbs - even if they believed the false promise of going back 
to homes the Croatian army have destroyed - would have lost the only 
legislative protection that would have made their lives worthwhile.<P>

		<h2>Croatians count toll in a 'clean war'; </h2>


<em>By: Robert Fisk</em><P>

Knin:  There were 10 prisoners in the Knin secondary school, the one on the left
badly beaten, red welts around the mouth and eyes, the one on the far right
starved and weedy in the wreckage of a Krajina Serb army uniform, a pathetic
thin beard around his jaw. Yes, they told us, they had enough cigarettes,
enough food. But they would like a shower. They lived in one tiny room,
mattresses on the floor, a burly Croatian policeman at the door. One of the
European human-rights workers backed out of the cell.  ''This isn't a prison,"
she hissed. ''This is a stable for animals."<P>

  Yet of all the Serb soldiers who remained behind when their colleagues ran
away before Croatia's "Operation Storm" a month ago, these were the lucky
ones. Upstairs, an even larger Croatian policeman was collecting photographs,
snapshots from Serb houses before they were burned, groups of Krajina Serb
soldiers and militiamen sitting on benches for their portraits back in the days
when Knin was the capital of the farthest reach of ''Greater  Serbia' '. The
Croatian policeman did not have time to hide the photographs before we walked
into his office.<P>

  One showed an Orthodox funeral with militia guards, another a gang of plump
Serb milicija in their sinister grey uniforms, yet another a bunch of slightly
drunken soldiers, the camera capturing their stupid smiles some time between
1992 and August this year. Above one of their heads the policeman had inscribed
an arrow in biro.<P>

  Found him yet, I asked? ''No, not yet," and the policeman tried to smile,
his cheeks rising but his mouth unmoved.<P>

  It didn't take much to work out what was happening in the Knin secondary
school. The Croatian security police riffled through the snapshots, trotted
downstairs to the pathetic creatures in the windowless room and asked them -
with or without a little persuasion - to identify the faces in the pictures.
"That's how they ransack the Serb houses," a United Nations officer told me
later. "They go for family photographs, any documents in Latin script - because
they can't read Cyrillic - and then they burn the house down."<P>

  But lucky those prisoners in the Knin secondary school undoubtedly are; and
a visit to the Knin city cemetery shows the extent of their good fortune.Almost
a hundred crosses, erected by the Croatians, show the alleged number of corpses
interred there since the Croatian army captured Krajina. But UN officials
suspect that the bodies may be buried three deep - that at least 300 people,
many of them civilians - have been placed there. Most of the crosses bear the
legend "NN" for "No Name". A mobile digger stood ominously at the site, next to
a newly scooped mass grave.  For whom, we wondered?<P>

  Officers of the European Commission Monitoring Mission (ECMM) have equally
grave g to the Croatian authorities, 228 people had been
buried in mass graves in five locations by 11 August," one of their official
reports stated last week.<P>

  "Of 102 civilians and 126 military personnel, only 57 were apparently
identifiable. It seems rather strange that so many should have been without ID
cards. ECMM has interviewed witnesses who say their Serb relatives were
definitely carrying IDs when they were killed, however their names do not 
appear on any of the lists. The Croatian authorities have stated that 
fingerprints and photographic records have been kept of all the unidentified 
bodies . . . "<P>

  The suspicions of the European monitors have increased in recent weeks, as
their report makes clear. "Granic a Croatian official stated on 24 August that
of all the 524 victims from Operation Storm, only 24 civilians had been
identified,when in SS (UN Sector South) alone there were 33 identified civilian
corpses on 11 August. The figures are either extremely inaccurate or there are
mass graves unaccounted for. It can only be presumed that  the tip of the 
iceberg."<P>

  If any observers remain unconvinced by this devastating assessment, they
have only to read the report of the UN human-rights team, led by Petr Soucek,
which wrote to the organisation's humanitarian- affairs officer from
south-western Krajina on 30 August. "In Gracac gravesite we saw 81 graves
(crosses)," his report said. "Only a few crosses bore a name of the soldiers.
There were 22 more crosses than on 18 August when the site had been visited 
last time. In Korenica grave site, we found 21 crosses . . . with no names"<P>

  Then the report takes on a chilling tone. "In the Czech battalion area
located in Korenica, I was informed by the Operations officer that on Sunday 5
August, 21 Serb civilians had been seen . . . chased by Croatian soldiers along
the Czech battalion base. Later on, soldiers had heard inhuman screaming and
then shooting. It might be just a coincidence between those 21 civilians and 
the 21 graves with no names on them!"<P>

  Nor is there any end to the Croatian depredations in formerly Serb Krajina.
Over the weekend, Croatian troops burned 98 per cent of the houses in five more
deserted Serb villages in the Cetine valley, once home to around 1,800 Serbs.
The graffiti on a wall which I saw in the gutted village of Kistanje, west of
Knin, summed up the emotions of the victorious Croatian army whose supposed
discipline has been widely praised in Croatia and abroad. "Ovo ste trazili,"
it said. "You were asking for it."<P>

		<h2>Croats burn and kill with a vengeance; </h2>

</h3>Robert Fisk in Kistanje finds 'ethnic cleansing' of the Krajina Serbs in full swing, with bodies piling up and buildings gutted</h3>

<em>By: Robert Fisk in Kistanje</em><P>

  Every house in Kistanje has been destroyed by the Croat army; little
bungalows, two-storey villas, Austro-Hungarian buildings of cut stone, the 
burnt ruins still blessed by the trees whose leaves have been autumned brown 
by the fires. No Serb will ever return here.<P>

  In the next village, Derveske, I found one house still burning, the flames
creeping slowly along the roof. The Croats have plenty of time to complete 
their "ethnic cleansing" of the Krajina region now that the world's attention 
has been recaptured by the Bosnian inferno.<P>

  Villages without houses, a land without people. It is strange how natural it
all seems, the overturned cars, the clothes lying on the street, the empty beer
cans left by  Croatia's  supposedly elite troops, Budweiser and Karlovac lager
and the occasional Heineken tins scattered over the gardens and roads. In the
centre of Kistanje, a Croat drove a truck into the war memorial, smashing the
Cyrillic names of Serb martyrs who could never guess - as they faced the 
Germans or their Croat allies in the Second World War - that their identity 
would finally be liquidated half a century after the civilised world conquered
Nazism.<P>

  On the other side of Knin, on the road to Strmica, Edward Flynn, of the UN's
Human Rights Action Team, and I came across a funnel of smoke on the other side
of the abandoned railway line to Bihac. "We'll walk slowly because you have to
be careful of what's on the road," he said as we padded beneath a low railway
bridge to find a brand-new, two-storey villa being consumed by fire.<P>

  A mile further on, the stink of rotting flesh drifted past a wrecked bar.
Only a few days before had the Croats bothered to remove the putrefying body
of a Serb soldier, killed with a bullet to the back of the neck hours after
Croatia's  successful "liberation" of Krajina a month ago. The UN soldiers
around Knin are finding the bodies of newly-murdered Serb civilians at the rate
of six a day. It goes unreported, of course, because the world is watching
Sarajevo.<P>

  In Grubori last week, the Croatian army's "special forces" carried out what
it calls a "cleaning sic campaign" through the Plavno valley. Later, the UN
found two elderly men dead, one with a bullet in the back of the head, the 
other with his throat horribly slashed. A certain General Cermac of the 
Croatian army announced that Grubori was a "Chetnik stronghold".  Next day, 
the UN found three more Serb corpses, one of them a woman of 90.<P>

  Every time we stopped our car - on the Strmice road, in Kistanje or Derveske
- civilian or Croatian police cars would arrive, their uniformed occupants
watching us sullenly or asking the reason for our presence. No one, after all,
wants to advertise their war crimes - even though the American ambassador back
in Zagreb has announced that no "ethnic cleansing" has taken place here.<P>

  In Orlic on 26 August, two European Union monitors came across three
Croatian soldiers setting fire to a farm. The flavour of the event is best
gleaned from their official report. "We tried to discuss with them, but one of
them loaded his weapon, saying that the fire was already put on sic yesterday.
That was a perfect lie, since the fire had just started, but we preferred to
escape." Everyone in Krajina prefers to escape save for the few remaining Serbs
- perhaps only 5 per cent of the original Serb population. But last week's
European Union assessment from Krajina - a confidential document that I have
read in full - speaks for itself.<P>

  "Evidence of atrocities; an average of six corpses p/day, continues to
emerge . . . the corpses; some fresh, some decomposed, are mainly of old men.
Many have been shot in the back of the head or had throats slit, others have
been mutilated. Isolated pockets of elderly civilians report people recently
gone missing or detained . . . Endless Croat invitations for Serbs to return,
guarantees of citizens' rights and property rights etc, have gushed forth from
all levels . . . However, Serbian homes and lands . . . continue to be torched
and looted.<P>

  "Contrary to official statements blaming it on fleeing Serbs and
uncontrollable elements, the crimes have been perpetrated by the HV Croatian
Army , the CR Croatian police and CR civilians. There have been no observed
attempts to stop it and the indications point to a scorched-earth policy."<P>

  History demands that the world should be reminded how the Serbs torched the
homes of their Croat neighbours when they declared their independence from
Croatia in 1991, and drove out the Croat residents of Krajina with identical
intent: to prevent them from returning. But of course,  Croatia  - unlike the
so-called and now defunct Serb Krajina Republic - wants to join the EU, wants
its troops to receive European training (having already received help from the
Americans) and wishes to share in European "democracy".  And  Croatia  may well
demand EU aid to help rebuild the schools and houses which its "elite" troops
are burning in the fury of their "ethnic cleansing".<P>

<h2>Croats slaughter elderly by the dozen; As the territorial shuffle over ex-Yugoslavia continues, so does the misery of the population</h2>

<em>By: Robert Fisk in Knin</em><P>

  CROATIA is unleashing a reign of terror against hundreds of elderly Serbs
left behind in the formerly Serb Krajina region of the country, more than a
month after its "liberation" of the territory. UN and human rights officials 
are reporting each day the murder or "disappearance" of at least 10 Serb 
civilians, some of them - in their eighties and nematically carried out by
Croatian troops.<P>

  One shocking UN report - which only became available this weekend - records
the massacre of six elderly men and women in the village of Komic two weeks 
ago, three of them burned alive by armed Croats; a middle-aged man in the same
village was shot and his body burned in his house. Yesterday I saw the brains 
of an 80-year-old woman lying in the driver's seat of her family's car in the
village of Babici shortly after relief workers had taken away her body; she had
been shot three days earlier - less than a week after UN officers had visited
her home to give her food.<P>

  Although the American and British embassies in Zagreb have received detailed
reports of the anarchy in Krajina, neither has offered a whisper of reproach to
the Croatian authorities, who now are supposed to be partners in the new
American-sponsored "peace" in ex- Yugoslavia.  But officials of the UN War
Crimes Tribunal in The Hague are to start investigations on  Croatia  this week
into possible war crimes by Croatian commanders in the region.  Three lawyers
from France, the Netherlands and Belgium are expected to arrive in Knin on
Friday.<P>

  Their inquiries will focus on, among other atrocities, the reported shooting
of eight of the remaining 12 Serbs still living in the village of Gosic on 27
August and the burning to death of the group of elderly villagers in Komic on 
12 August. A UN human rights team records the deaths there as follows: "Mara
Ugarkovic (born 1921), female, burned in her house; Mika Pavlica (born 1904),
female, being very old and unable to run away, was burned in her house; Sava
Lovrinic (born 1903), female, burned in her house; Rade Mirkovic (year of birth
unknown), male, he was found dead, shot in the head in front of his house; Mara
Mirkovic, female, Rade's wife, lost, supposedly killed; Petar Lavrnic (born
1933), male, killed and then burnt in his house."<P>

  The UN believes that dozens of undiscovered bodies lie in the fields in the
destroyed Serb villages, areas into which UN officers are not allowed to enter
for fear of mines. Croatian troops, however, can frequently be seen moving
through the fields on their notorious "cleaning" operations, allegedly hunting
for Serb soldiers still at large but stealing farm animals, furniture and
jewellery from the few elderly Serb peasants still alive.<P>

  One of them complained to the UN on Friday that Croatian troops had torn the
bathtub and sink out of her home. Travelling through the village of Bakovice
yesterday, one old lady, breaking into tears as she spoke, told us how Croatian
troops had taken her pigs, tractor and television set.  "Yesterday, they even
made me carry my lawn mower from the shed before stealing it," she said. Like
other elderly Serbs I met, she pleaded with UN officers to take her to  Serbia.<P>

  UN and European Union monitors also are discovering evidence of war crimes
committed by Croatian troops at the time of the Krajina offensive. At Golubic,
UN officers have found the decomposing remains of five people, one of them a
woman, all of them over 55 and the oldest 77. The head of one of the victims 
was found 150 ft from his body. Another UN team, meanwhile, is investigating 
the killing of a man and woman in the same area after villagers described how 
the man's ears and nose had been mutilated.<P>

  The Croatian authorities continue to claim that the murders are carried out
by "uncontrolled elements", despite repeated evidence that their troops are
systematically killing and looting their way through Serb villages.  The
Croatian commander in Knin, General Ivan Cermak, acknowledged for the first 
time yesterday that there was a "serious problem" with looters, but again put 
the blame on civilians taking revenge for having been driven out of Krajina in
1991.<P>

  Of course given the atrocities committed by their cousins in Bosnia - and
with Nato's war against Bosnian Serb forces increasing in intensity - the world
has little sympathy to waste on the Serbs of Krajina. As the Croatians are well
aware.<P>

	<h2>'Christian culture' chugs back into Krajina; </h2> 

<h3>Robert Fisk takes the Croatian train through the former Serb-held region</h3>

<em>By: Robert Fisk</em><P>

  The Marjan Express leaves Zagreb crack on 6am, a Boy's Own Paper train of 16
blue carriages pulled by a humming electric loco that plunges into the misty
fields towards Karlovac. And for the first few hours, before the train is
divided and pulled by an older, dirtier diesel on to darker, more sinister
tracks, it could be any main-line Balkan express. Yet even the passengers,
topped up with slivovitz and beer in the buffet car, were to fall silent as we
entered the badlands.<P>

  Maybe we should have been warned of what was to come from the brochure
Croatian Railways provided for its first-class passengers. ''Travelling by this
train," it announced in halting English, ''will enable you to get acquainted
with the beautiful scenery of our country and the rich history of Croat people
that through ages fought for its existence and stood in defence of European
culture and entire Christianity."<P>

  Culture and Christianity, of course, was not exactly what we were going to
see. We were a mixed bunch in our compartment, a Croatian emigrant to Canada
going to Split to see his brother, a woman returning to her home in the same
city, and two brothers and their cheerful, elderly mother, venturing into the
newly ''liberated'' Krajina to re-discover lands they owned but could never -
under Serb rule - visit near Knin. We had no sooner passed the first ruined
house outside Karlovac before the old lady was drawing in her breath. By the
time we reached Plavca, she was peering at the shell-holes and burned roofs and
thinking of those who once lived here. ''I suppose there are still some of them
around," she said. "Don't worry," one of her sons replied. "Our army is here."<P>

  Could one miss them? The train had been divided at Ogulin, a grubby old
diesel tugging us eastwards, into the land that was, until a month ago, the
''Serb Republic of Krajina''. On ruined stations stood Croatian policemen with
automatic rifles and dark glasses, troops sleeping among the ripped-up
sidings, the booking halls and waiting rooms blackened by fire. Even where the
stations had been destroyed, at Javornik, west of the Plitvice lakes, for
example - the Cyrillic station sign had been replaced by a one in Latin script
- an equally new Croatian flag had been draped over the shell of the building.
My companions stared from the window, looking, I suppose, for the Serbs who 
lived in the devastated villages on either side of the track, unable to 
comprehend that the Serb towns had been so comprehensively looted and torched 
by the Croatian army of European culture and Christianity of which the brochure
boasted, that no Serb would ever return. The old lady drew in her breath again.
The emigrant to Canada reminded me that this had been done to the Croats of
Krajina in 1991. The thoughtful woman opposite asked her companions why among
Serb intellectuals only Bogdan Bogdanovic, the former mayor of Belgrade, had
ever raised his voice against Serb aggression.<P>

  It was a dead land, gutted houses lying foolishly besideplantations and
orchards dripping with unpicked fruit. We kept looking for people we knew were
no longer there, our eyes travelling up tree-lined peaceful driveways to burned
family cars and torched homes.<P>

  The railway track, originally laid by engineers of the Austro-Hungarian
empire on the eve of that infamous Sarajevo shot and completed 75 years ago by
the young and doomed Kingdom of  Yugoslavia,  wound its way along mountain
ledges, into tunnels, across marshland and always - inevitably - across 
viaducts above stone houses without roofs, between embankments of ruined homes,
through cuttings below smashed cottages. If this was once the wild frontier 
that protected ''Christian'' Europe from the ''Islamic'' Ottomans, it was 
clear that it would remain this way in the imagination of its passengers, a 
land of ghost villages.<P>

  Hatred lay along the permanent way. Croatian Railways had produced another
glossy booklet to coincide with the reopening of the line to Split, referring 
to Serbs as ''terrorists'' who were ''ignorant of and hostile to the very 
concept of culture,'' castigating them for the ''savage aggression'' they 
launched to support ''the insane hegemonic policy of Greater Serbia''.  
The Serbs had paid for it now, by heavens. And the passengers of the Marjan 
Express crowded the corridors to watch the old Serb lands of Krajina in ruins.<P>

  On reflection, it was an odd and obscene thing for us to do. Safe in our
polished carriages, creatures from the safe mittel-europa of Zagreb, we drank
scalding coffee from china beakers as we moved at a stately 25mph through this
landscape of destruction. Sometimes, far away, a funnel of grey smoke would
wander upwards into the still air as the heroic and victorious forces of
Croatia set fire to another farm.<P>

  At one point, our train travelled the length of an old front line, abandoned
Croatian snipers' positions and dug-outs hugging the very edge of the sleepers,
until we turned east again, past a station whose walls were pitted with bullet
holes and shrapnel gashes. That was when the emigrant to Canada offered us his
sandwiches and his plastic bag of sweet white Macedonian grapes.<P>

  Just outside Knin, we slowed down, the wheels screaming against the curve of
the track, the driver breaking his whistle into a long wail of conquest.<P>

  Beside us, trailing down the scree of a great escarpment, lay the wreckage
of a Serb armoured train, wagons and heavy machine-guns and tank turrets 
mangled together. How the passengers loved it. They leaned from the windows 
with their video-cameras to record this destruction and the group of Croat 
soldiers who blew kisses from atop an old truck and the acres of burned Serb 
homes further on. Yes, they went on filming this, too, a home movie for future
generations, of the eastward march of Christian civilisation through the 
Krajina.<P></FONT>

Abruptly expelled from Mostar one night, Jovanka and Dorde walked 25 kilometers through the rain, scared and lugging two suitcases.  "I even left behind my dentures," said Dorde, who has worn a single pair of rubber boots, donated almost three years ago, summer and winter.  The elderly siblings now live in the tiny room of an acquaintance's house.  They can make coffee with a small heating plate, but beg neighbors to bake bread for them.  Jovanka's husband died last year, and she worries about her only child, a Serb fighting against the predominantly Muslim Bosnian army.  "He only writes, 'I'm fine, I'm healthy,' the same thing my husband wrote," Jovanka says, tearfully trailing off into silence.  Both Jovanka, who worked in a tobacco factory, and Dorde, who worked in an aircraft factory, survived concentration camps as children.  "Now we suffer again as old people," said Dorde philosophically; like his sister, he still hopes and dreams of returning to Mostar.  "Who hasn't had liberty taken away from him, doesn't know what liberty is."<P>

Slobodan and his family have spent the last six months in a tiny hotel room crammed with a TV, tables and a bunk bed.  Their prize possession is a used washing machine which they bought for US$100 before their savings ran out.  Memories of their hometown, Slavonski Brod, haunt them.  "My job in (Croat-held) Slavonski Brod was to pick up dead bodies from the street, even during heavy bombardments," said Slobodan, a Serb truck driver whose wife Marta is a Croat.  "A neighbor - a good friend - used to aim shoulder-launched grenades at us from his apartment window.  It was funny because all the (Serb) grenades were coming from the other direction (and he didn't fool us).  Once a genade landed in our kitchen."  After six months of fighting, Slobodan and his family escaped.  Carrying a few unobtrusive handbags, the family caught a 6a.m. train to Zagreb with the help of a friend.  But Slobodan didn't feel safe in Croatia.  So the family moved to Serbia, where marta feels uneasy.  Both parents are deeply worried about the future of their draft-age-sons.  "We have no plans for the future," says marta, who spends a lot of time knitting, "but at least there's no war here."<P>

The deal looked simple:  as Serbs, Nada and her husband would exchange their furnished house in the Muslim-held town of Zenica, for the furnished house of a Muslim family in the Serb-held town of Kljuc.  But when Nada and her family arrived in Kljuc in early 1994, they found only one bed.  "There were supposed to be 150 pieces of furniture," complained Nada bitterly, accusing the wife of the other family, a Serb married to a Muslim - of selling the furniture.  "Plus a neighbor has taken the garden, and a girl lives on the ground floor."  With no savings left, Nada and her family depend on humanitarien aid and help from relatives.  Nada's 65-year-old husband pushes a wheelbarrow to the forest to collect firewood.  Their son Dragan, an architect who blinded himself during a suicide attempt, is unable to work.  But life is easier now, nada said.  She has seen bread in Kljuc's garbage bins four times.  In Zenica Nada's family had to keep their cow in a shed with no door to prevent stealing.  One morning, all that was left of their ten chicken were heads.  "We left Zenica illegaly after a bomb was thrown in our garden," explained Dragan, who speaks excellent English.  "Without money we couldn't have gone."<P>

Mira and her children left war-torn Croatia in 1991 and fled to Belgrade, where they shared a house with several other families.  In July 1992, Mira decided to return home with her then 2-month-old baby confident fighting in western Slavonia (a United Nations Protected Area) was over.  "We lived just fine," said Mira, whose house was on the front line of the divided town of Pakrac.  "There was no shooting, and it was peaceful."  On the morning of May 1, an exploding grenade awakened the family.  Mira and her family, which by then included her wounded husband, ran to the cellar in their pajamas.  They hid for two days before fleeing by car to a nearby village.  "My little son was saying, 'Don't be afraid, it will pass'," said Mira, breaking into tears at the memory.  The family entered Serbia as refugees for the second time in June 1995.  Mira, a nurse, doesn't know how they will live - her husband, a skilled laborer, may be permanently disabled.  "I feel like I wasted three years of my life (in Pakrac).  All that pain for nothing," Mira said.

Nenad was lazily watching TV one afternoon in Capljina when his life ubruptly changed: his parents shouted that they had five minutes to leave their town and home.  "It was a big rush," recalled Nenad simply, adding that his family took only a large bag filled with clothes.  That was almost three years ago.  Nenad, an older brother, and a 2-month-old sister now live with seven other relatives in a deserted house in Bileca.  School is OK, Nenad says shyly, but what he dreams of is to be a car mechanic.<P>

The corpse of a man wearing a police uniform was found in the Danube near Susek.  The man was killed with a sharp object - most probably a knife.  The corpse was identified as that of Milorad Dekic, the son of Novo and Persa.  He was a policeman in the Osijek Police Department, where he has worked for 14 years.  His wife Spomenka also had a job in the Osijek Police Department. Milorad Dekic was born on October 12 1957 in the village of Cecava in the municipality of Teslic, Bosnia and Hercegovina.<P>

The corpse of a man was found in the Danube near Bolec on July 17 1991.  the corpse was identified as that of Milenko Duricic, a Serb born on June 18 1953 to father Ilija and mother Tonka; he was married and father of a child.  He was an employee of "Borovo" Works.<br>
The corpse was wrapped in a woolen blanket; nooses with tight knots tied his neck and ankles.  The nooses were interconnected by a rope slung over the back.  the arms and legs were also tied.  It was determined that several teeth had been knocked out, sternum was fractured as well as 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th ribs.  Death was by drowning.<P>

<IMG SRC="/info/students/marko/pictures/vukovar4.gif"><P>
The corpse of a man whose legs were tied and hands handcuffed was wound on October 27 1991 on the shore of "Ljubavno Ostrvo" (an island on the Danube river, near Futog).  Death was caused by firearm wounds.  The corpse was identified as that of Bozo Skoric, a Serb born on January 8 1952 in Vukovar, to Mico and Manda Skoric.  He lived at 16 S. Marinkovica St. in Vukovar.<P>

<h1>CROATS LEAVE BLOODY TRAIL OF SERBIAN DEAD</h1>
<h3><em>by Tracy Wilkinson, "Los Angeles Times",
October 10, 1995)</em></h3>

     They found Sava Babic's body in the back of her broken down- yellow
Fiat, her legs and a walking cane protruding from a rear door.<P>
     The 82 - year - old Serbian woman had been shot in the cheek. She was
discovered by the same team of U.N. civilian police officers who had visited
her three days earlier and had heard her complaints about Croatian soldiers
trying to steal her car. The U.N. officers were bringing food to Babic when
they found her.<P>
     Babic was one of an estimated 2,600 Serbs who stayed behinds in the
Krajina region of Croatia after it was recaptured by Croatian forces in an
August offensive that sent more than 180.000 Serbs fleeing. Her murder is
being described as part of a campaign of harassment and intimidation by
Croatian forces against Serbian civilians that continues two months after the
offensive ended.<P>
     Since August 5, officials from the United Nations, United States, Europe
and human rights groups have documented widespread looting, robbery, arson
and, now, murder in the Krajina. Most of the victims have been elderly Serbs,
and many of the perpetrators, say reports and officials, have been Croatian
security forces. Thousands of Serbian homes have been ransacked and torched,
and more than 100 people killed, long after the combat ceased.<P>
     The human right officials accuse the Croatian government of tolerating
the atrocities in a deliberate effort to discourage Serbs from returning,
despite a stated policy of welcoming them.<P>
     Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, after first denying that abuses were
taking place, on Friday acknowledged their existence but insisted that
returning Croatian refugees exacting revenge have been responsible. Tudjman,
a key U.S. ally, said 24 people had been arrested in connection with 36
killings of Serbs and that seven other murder cases and more than 800 looking
incidents are under investigation.<P>
     "We have done everything in our power to stop the unlawful acts, and now
the courts will do their job" Tudjman said.<P>
     Yet even as he spoke, there were signs here in the remote hills of the
Krajina that Croatian authorities were trying to cover up evidence of some of
the most grisly murders.<P>
     The worst incident to come to light has been the September 28 massacre
of at least nine elderly Serbian civilians in the small village of Varivode
southeast of Knin the town that served as the Krajina Serbs' capital during
the three years they held the Krajina.<P>
     The murders have been well documented by U.N. investigators who reached
Varivode on Oct. 2, finding pools of blood as well as blood-splattered walls
and bullet holes in four homes. Two survivors have reported hearing gunfire
on the afternoon of September 28.<P>
"We found the signs of a considerably violent action", said an internal U.N.
human rights report. "There were no signs of any military fighting, only of
what can be described as cold blooded killing".<P>
     When U.N. officials returned over the weekend, however, they discovered
that the blood had been washed or burned away in some places.<P>
     In a home where bullet holes and blood splatters had earlier been found
on the side of a stove and a wall, someone had moved a chair to hide the
evidence. In another home, where a large pool of blood had been found on the
patio, someone had covered the site with straw and positioned a bench over it.
     On Sunday, Croatian military police staffed a checkpoint at the entrance
to the town and denied access to a U.N. team, which was eventually able to
enter by a back road, according to a member of the group.<P>
     Milan Pokrajac, 74, who heard the September 28 gunfire and is the lone
Serb remaining in Varivode, has been placed under police guard although U.N.
investigations are still allowed to talk to him. A witness, Bojanka Milosevic,
42, who has said she hid when she heard the shots, was spirited away by
Croatian authorities to an island off the coast. U.N. officials, however, said
they have been granted access to her.<P>
     The U.N. monitors who first reached Varivode on October 2 also found
plastic surgical gloves at several of the bloody sites, indicating that an
official investigation had at least been started. But requests thus far for
police reports or autopsy report have been rebuffed, U.N. officials said.<P>
     Crosses with the names of the Varivode victims were discovered in the
rapidly expanding Serbian cemetery in Knin on October 2, but U.N.
investigators have not been able to determine when the victims were buried.<P>
     Family members have also complained that they were not informed of their
relatives' deaths until after the burials, and at least one relative is
demanding an exhumations of the grave site purported to contain her parents,
Jovan and Marija Beric.<P>
     The dead ranged in age from 65 to 84.<br>
     The Serbian cemetery is a veritable work in progress. Approximately
250 new graves have appeared in recent weeks, about half with crosses marked
with two N's, for "No name". Huge pits have already been dug, apparently in
expectation of more bodies.<P>
     Varivode is only the most dramatic instance within the emerging pattern
of abuse. Babic, the woman found in the back of her Fiat, was killed September
4 in the hamlet of Mokro Polje after having been seen last by U.N. officials
on September 1. On September 9, two women were shot to death in their home in
the town of Brgud, 15 miles west of Knin and then, judgingly by bloodstain,
dragged outside and propped up against a wall, where they were found by
European Union monitors two days later.<P>
     In a town called Grubori, Croatian security forces attacked on August
25, setting at least 18 houses afire and killing six people. One was an 80-
year-old Serbian man found in his pyjamas with a bullet in his head that had
been fired at close range; another was a 65-year-old, man who had his throat
slit, and yet another was a 90-year-old women who burned to death, according
to U.N. reports.<P>
     Six villages survived because they had left the town to attend a U.N.-
sponsored meeting on how to become Croatian citizens. They told investigations
that they observed two columns of Croatian soldiers approaching the village
after they left. A bit later, plumes of smoke began to rise from Grubori.<P>
     Lt. Gen. Ivan Cermak, the Croatian army commander for Knin acknowledged
civilian deaths at Grubori but said they occurred during a firelight with
Serbian "renegades".<P>
     Croatian soldiers are also being accused by U.N., E.U. and other
monitors of intimidating Serbs by demanding money from them or by stealing
their cattle, sheep, money and possessions. Some looters have been so thorough
as to take kitchen sinks and bathtubs.<P>
     U.N. and human right officials contend that the Croatian government is
doing little to discourage the atrocities and in fact is hoping to send a
deliberate message to Serbs that these who left should not consider returning.
     "There seems to be no direction from the top giving police the authority
to arrest unruly soldiers or unruly civilians", said Allun Roberts, U.N.
spokesmen in Knin. "Either they can't control it or they don't want to".<P>
     The government changed the law last month to limit the amount of time
in which a Serb can reclaim his home to just 90 days. The bureaucratic hoope
that Serbs will have to jump though just to return to Croatia are so numerous
as to make the journey almost impposible, U.N. officials say.<P>
     The Serbs who fled the August offensive had lived in the Krajina for
centuries but rebelled in 1991 when Croatia announced its secession from the
Yugoslav federation. The war in Croatia that followed left 10.000 people dead
until a cease-fire ended the fighting and brought in U.N. monitors.<P>
     The United Nations failed, however, to re-integrate the mutinous Krajina
into Croatia proper, and the Tudjman government finally lost its patience on
August 4. In just three days, the Croatian army seized control of the region
and drove out the Serbs.<P>
    The mistreatment now of the Krajina's Serbian minority by the Croatian
government poses a delicate problem for the Clinton Administration, which has
become a staunch ally of Tudjman and gave tacit approved to the recapture of
the region.<P>
     John Shattuck, U.S. assistant secretary of state for human rights,
toured the Krajina ares last week and condemned the Croatian government for
allowing a "climate of impunity" to reign. He indicated that Washington might
revoke financial aid and political support if Tudjman falls to prosecute those
responsible for murder and other crimes against Serbs. <P></FONT>

   ZAGREB, Croatia (Aug 9, 1995 - 12:01 EDT) --Thousands of exhausted, frightened Serb refugees fled east toward the Yugoslav border Wednesday after Croatia promised not to attack them. Croat civilians gathered by the side of the road to curse them as they left.<P>

   "Go faster," elderly Croats shouted at the line of cars, many of which had bicycles on top. "You monkeys," others cursed.<P>
......<P>

   LePage said the United Nations also was investigating the possible bombing of civilians Tuesday near Dvor.<P>

   She said two MiG-21s dropped four bombs on unknown targets. Minutes earlier, two MiG-21s, laden with weapons, had been seen leaving Zagreb airport in the direction of Dvor.<P>

   Gen. Zvonimir Cervenko, the Croatian army commander, denied that Croatian jets were attacking civilians. However, he said, "it was possible that some civilians were killed" in attacks on other targets. He charged Serb forces had used civilians near Dvor as a cover while they withdrew heavy weapons.<P>

<h1> Face To Face With Krajina Refugees</h1>

<em> by Kyoshi Igusa</em>, (Ms. Todorov's husband)<P>

Tuesday, August 8, 1995, Novi Sad.  Dr. Gubas of Kolo Srpskih Sestara calls to say that refugees have arrived in Novi Sad.  We find about 25 at the restaurant on "the boulevard", across the Dunav Park.  They are women, men and children.  They have no place to go.  Some refugees don't want to be videotaped but others are so upset they cry and talk and yell.  Around 3pm two fancy Red Cross vans come to take the refugees with their bags of belongings to Spens.  Later, around 5, we also go to Spens but the director of Spens tells us we can't enter.  He thinks we are journalists.  So we just talk to people outside.  We meet the woman from Benkovac (originally from Sibenik) who didn't want to be taped earlier.<P>

Later, at home, Dr. Gubas calls again to tell us that a bus full of orphans has arrived at Kamenica and another one is on the way.  We immediately go back to Spens.  We get past the first check point just by mentioning Dr. Gubas.  Then we wait for the director.  As we are waiting a truck labelled UNHCR comes in full of matresses.  Gordana asks if this is really from UNHCR and they say no, they just use their trucks.  The aid comes from various Serbian organizations and, we find out later, some Greek and Italian people.  TV Novi Sad goes in with their crew and then the director, much friendlier this time, leads us into the sports arena.  There are more than a hundred refugees inside.  Red Cross officials are getting their personal data and sorting them by place of origin.  There are free telephones so that people can try to find their relatives.  One man announces: will everyone from Knin please go to the restaurant to eat dinner.<P></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=+2>Gordana asks people what they need.  Shoes, slippers.  That is what they need the most.  Their feet hurt so much they say.  And some are barefoot.  They also don't have clothes, only what they are wearing.  So we come home to collect shoes and clothes.<P>

At 11pm we return to Spens for the third time.  Another busload of refugees has just arrived.  And several more are on the way.  Inside, Gordana is mobbed by people, mostly women who need shoes and clothes.  A little boy, Zoran, wants to see my videocamera.  I play with him and some other children until his mother chases them away and says "let the man do his work!"<P>

There are several hundred refugees now. (375 at this time according to Red Cross.)  Many of them are sleeping.  We decide to leave around 1am.  When we get back to our car we notice that there are two refugees in the truck parked next to our car.  When Grahovo [town in western Bosnia] fell thay had packed the truck and had it ready to go.  But they didn't leave on the first day.  We talk to the woman for a long time but she doesn't want her personal tragedies to be told to the world.  Then we talk to the man.  He talks about the military situation, how his commander was killed.  "Croatian military commands were being given in English and German," the man said.<P>

On Saturday, the second day of the offensive, NATO bombed all the Serbian command centers so thath by 9am all communications were cut.  The command center where they lived was 200 meters from where the UN was stationed.  They needed NATO to do the precision bombing.<P>

August 9, Wednesday.  Will there be civil war in Vojvodina [northern part of Serbia]?  If there is, will the Serbs just run away?  I finally met a man who was in the column bombed by air at four places (Korenica licence plate, KE).  The refugees were in two rooms (arenas) at Spens.  There were several soldiers and one talked on camera for a long time.  Because of the swarm of the refugees the army at Benkovac couldn't turn on their tanks.  He said it was complete chaos; there was no line of defense.  He said if they had stayed to fight they could have held off the Croats for a week or two but with no sign of reinforcements there was no point.<P>

One man who worked for the Red Cross said they needed baby bottles and pacifiers so we immediately went to buy some.  It is raining and dark and Gordana has a car where the blinkers and wind shield wipers don't work.  We go from one pharmacy to another.  We go home and try to call; the phones don't work.  We finally call the government emergency pharmacy.  "Are you crazy," they ask her," you call an emergency pharmacy for a baby bottle?"  We finally went to the private emergency pharmacy and got 5 baby bottles for 23 dinars each.<P>

Back at Spens the lights were out.  Poeple were sleeping.  We went to each baby and asked if they needed a bottle.<P>

On the way out we saw the man who had been searching for his wife and children.  (They had been separated during the exodus.)  He had located them, I don't remember where.  Telephones are always busy and people are always looking for relatives.<P>

August 10, Thursday.  We go to Spens with 3 bags of clothes.  We first talk to new refugees outside.  One man showed us how he rode on his tractor all the way from Knin.  His mother was in the tractor.  Another man shows me his one year old baby who is in their car with a 102 fever.  A third man tells me that the Croats had used pictures of him and one of his relatives for their propaganda.  "I can prove that I am Serbian," he says.  We also interview a woman who had been in the refugee column when it was bombed.<P>

August 11, Friday.  We didn't go to Spens last night.  But this morning we are going.  Gordana drives Desa and me to Spens about 11 am.  Desa is coming to protect me.  A lot of people are angry with me because they think I am a journalist.  Many think I will say these are Croats who are suffering.  Desa explains to everyone that I want to get their story so I can tell people in America.  "Don't do that," one woman says, "They will rejoice when they see Serbs suffering."<P>

The refugees, especially women, are very angry at Croats.  They threaten to kick Croats out of their homes in Serbia.  One woman from Reducic, a village near Knin, says that the Croats came massacred 7 and took away all the men.<P>

We went back to Spens in the late afternoon.  There wee busses ready to take refugees to Zrenjanin.  This morning there were busses  headed for Subotica.  The refugees tell the same story.  We interview several who witnessed their refugee column being bombed.  Almost none of the refugees realised they would end up in Serbia.  They thought they were going a short distance and that they would return after the fighting was over.  But they kept being told to "go a little further."  A 76 year old woman said: "I didn't forget to lock the house."<P>

<h1>Who Will Take a Monument to Take a Piss?</h1>

<strong><em>by Viktor Ivancic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, 1/8 1996</h2>


We know that he is 47 years old, that he was born in the village of Dubravice near Skradin and that he has recently returned with a wife and four children from Paraguay where he lived under a false name, <strong>Juan Mendensson</strong>.  Immediately after his return to Croatia, he became a member of the Croatian Army and was given an apartment in Sibenik.  Do we know who <strong>Andelko Brajkovic</strong> is to us: a hero or a terrorist scum?<P>

<strong>Vladimir Rolovic</strong> a former Yugoslav ambassador to Sweden, cannot (anymore) testify for the latter thesis.  Andelko Brajkovic, in cooperation with much better known <strong>Miro Baresic</strong>, shot him to death in 1971 in a spectacular assassination inside the Yugoslav embassy building in Stockholm.  According to the court, one of the three wounds on the ambassadors head occured after Brajkovic pushed a gun barrel into the ambassador's mouth and fired a shot into his brain.  In the trial documentation we can also find the following dialog between the accused and the prosecutor:<P>

<em>When you tied the ambassador's mouth with a tie, did you soil yourself with blood?<P>

No, only while I was tying him up.<P>

Did anyone tell you to tie the ambassador up?<P>

No, nobody told me anything.  I told him to lie still but he didn't want to do that.  I suppose he didn't understand me.  He moved around a bit, so I tied him up.<P>

How did you tie him up?<P>

I took a nylon rope, tied both of his legs and an arm.  I was covered with blood after that because he was bleeding all over.  After that I went to the window, pissed on my bloody hands and wiped them with the curtains.  I went back to the center of the room and tried to make a phone call.  All this time, Miro was guarding the door.  When I came back I fired another bullet...</em><P>

<h2>A Street for Baresic</h2>

The only material connection between Brajkovic's idyllic present and his bloody terrorist past (partly washed by pissing on the hands) is an Interpol warrant, issued in 1972 after his escape from a Swedish prison and later renewed in 1994; it is presently valid until the end of 1999!  Everything else in his reality is the realization of a romantic dream about the free and independent Croatian state, for which he suffered in exile.  Or, is this simply the way in which this reality is presented to us?<P>

"If I hadn't killed butcher Rolovic, I would have never had four children in a marriage with an indian woman."  This is the title of an article in "the global weekly <em>Nacional</em>", in which a journalist, with the recognizable dose of stupidity in her approach, tried to describe "the Christmas atmosphere in the Brajkovic family home which was given to Andelko immediately after his return from Paraguay."  We found out that Brajkovic was briefly detained upon his return to the country (last Spring) by the Croatian police because of the Interpol warrant; however, "the misunderstanding was quickly resolved"; furthermore, as Andelko says, "the misunderstanding was of an administrative character," although he cannot "for now, cross the Croatian border." Outside Croatia, there is Interpol...<P>

The state kept being quick and gallant: Andelko Brajkovic and his wife <strong>Rosalin</strong> were employed by the Croatian Army, and an apartment for the large family was quickly provided.  Possible misunderstandings with international criminal organizations are not a public concern.  However, the global weekly did a public service of national importance: it delivered an eulogy for a national hero, Andelko Brajkovic, an uncompromising fighter for a Croatian statehood who, some 25 years ago, hunted down and killed "butchers" so that we can today enjoy a free and cleansed state, a state we have always dreamed of.<P>

Of course we will hear more about Brajkovic.  His biography will be embellished with superlatives; authorities, within the limits of what they can provide, will  reward him with available privileges; it is not excluded that one of the Sibenik streets will soon pride itself with Brajkovic's name.  Miro Baresic, Brajkovic's accomplice in the assassination on Vladimir Rolovic, already has a street in Split.  His mysterious death (as well as the speculations that he is allegedly alive but is hiding "in the interest of the state") only helped the development of a knightly charisma.  Recently, in Zadar a music festival was named after him and organized in his honor as well as a soccer tournament which took place immediately afterwards!<P>

<h2>In the Name of the State</h2>

A few weeks ago <em>Nedeljna Dalmacija</em> published, in two installments, an interview with <strong>Ante Stojanov</strong>, who had also participated in the  assassination on Rolovic; he was sentenced to four years in prison in a first trial and to seven years in prison in a second trial.  We found out that Stojanov lives incognito "in a place at the south of Croatia," and "that the public cannot be given his address because of Interpol."<P>

However, the Croatian terrorist elite wants to inform the public that it is here, that it is alive and kicking, and practically legal, as is today alive the idea for which the terrorists have fought in their youth.  This media trend, let us recall, was started by "the national weekly <a HREF="/info/students/marko/croind.html#globus"><em>Globus</em></a>" with an attempt to revise the assessment of the results of the infamous "Bugojno Group" and a conversation about how a certain <strong>Adolf Andric</strong> had written a practical manual for terrorists entitled "Bleiburg revenge".  The interview with Andric is memorable because of a characteristic detail that a newborn Andric was named after a well known German statesman.<P>

Therefore, we have a trend here, since the whole time there is not even one deviation from a precisely defined form.  The tone of the public attitude towards the former Croatian terrorists is always the same: it doesn't matter which means were used in the struggle for the independent Croatian state, what matters is that they did fight for it.  The character of "a patriotic deed" is never questioned.  However, there is only one possible implication of this approach: it doesn't matter what the Croatian state is like, but only whether it exists or not!  Exactly because of that, the present state (more precisely, its official representatives), if only in an intermediary role (because if Interpol, international public and similar temporary trifles) are willing to reward the former terrorist vanguard with the highest possible spiritual and material privileges.  This kind of approach would not have been possible if the state didn't contain (more or less malign) seeds of terror and violence in itself.<P>

It was touching to observe the pomp with which was in Zagreb recently greeted  the publishing of a book by Mrs <strong>Julienne Eden Busic</strong> about the famous plane hijacking in which an American policeman was murdered, and because of which the author had spent 11 years in jail.  The top Croatian state and intellectual authorities gathered at the promotion: from the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court presidents to the top of the Science Academy; from the political pundits to literary (quasi)legends.<P>

One would be a fool to think that the literary or documentary value of the book brought them there.  They came because of the author: she is, whatever the methods, a symbol of the struggle and sacrifice for the Croatian idea and state, regardless of the act from which this sacrifice came out.  Besides, the state has already taken care for a kind of author royalties and employed Mrs. Busic at the Croatian embassy in the USA.  Now an intellectual whipped cream will be added as a topping to a dubious life story.<P> 

<h2>Revision of a Myth</h2>

The internationally recignized terrorists were, in the name of "the independent state", transformed into nationally recognized heroes, or at least the process leading to that goal has been started.  However that sort of uncontrolled celebration of the cult of state is always an unpredictable journey into irrational.  It could happen that Croatians have in the future more mythological problems with Brajkovic, Baresic and similar characters, then is usual.  If the myth is built in the service of a state, does that mean that the revision of that myth implies a revision of the state?  The revision of the myth will be unavoidable, since we already have national heroes and do not know what to do with the corpses left in their wake.<P>

Taking into account the rich experience in the demolishing of the bronze and marble monumental heroes in this territories, we have learnt that the only deed more disgusting than the promotion of <em>uncalled for heroes</em> can be their forced demise.  Except when this comes out as a form of self criticism: Andelko Brajkovic admitted himself that he had pissed on his bloody hands.<P>

<h1>Herceg-Bosna is Ready for the Hague</h1>
 
<strong><em>by Smiljko Sagolj</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nedjeljna Dalmacija, Split, Croatia, 11/24 1995</h2>

"We, the volunteers from Mostar, a few thousands of us, volunteer to be tried in the Hague."  This message, signed by Petar Zelenika, a man who has distinguished himself in the defense of the Croatian territory of Mostar and is the president of the city Association of the Volunteers, was sent these days to the elevated "palace of European justice" in the Hague as an answer to the indictments against <strong>Dario Kordic</strong> and general <strong>Tihomir Blaskic</strong>.<P>

We focused on it, not only because it is a "journalistic curiosity", in a flood of telegrams to the two legends of the defense of the central Bosnia Croats sent from "the field", but also as an illustration of an ever more frequent reaction and the attitude of the local Croats which can be summed up with these words: IF KORDIC AND BLASKIC HAVE TO GO TO THE HAGUE, THAN IT IS AN HONOR TO BE THERE.<P>

"I don't want to give any statements," was general <strong>Tihomir Blaskic's</strong> reaction when I asked him about the indictment; he responded decisively, like a soldier, just the way he was during the whole duration of this war which had been imposed on Croats, just the way he was when we together inspected the village of Krizanicevo and Buhine Kuce where the muslim units tried to bury the Croats of central Bosnia through the murder of civilians.  He added: " Don't take it personally.  I'm just defending myself this way: of course, I am not ashamed of my deeds."<P>

<h2>Whose Federation Is It?</h2>

General Blaskic and president Kordic have been receiving hundreds of supportive telegrams these days, from Vares to Neum, from Posavina and Usora to Ljubusko [Croatian majority towns and regions in Bosnia].  "Stand high and be proud, because we support you," is the unanimous message of their soldiers and numerous associations: widows, volunteers, lower house of the Parliament of Herceg-Bosna etc..  Of course, all this support is also another reason to hold out for a better solution now when some would like to draw a map against Croatian interest.  However, another question draws attention of a more attentive observer: haven't we unintentionally, with all this support, brought an additional attention to these two men, especially president Kordic.  Many individuals, especially those who have tasted the bitterness and tragedy of politics, say half-seriously half-jokingly that besides ten commandments there is the most dangerous, eleventh contemporary commandment: DEAR GOD, DON'T LET IT BE MY TURN. Of course it is lot easier to guess why Blaskic's and Kordic's turn has come right now.  Simply, that is an additional pressure on Croats, not only because of the marathon negotiations, but also because the "fundamental people"[Bosnian Muslims], especially its leadership, hasn't yet given up the idea of (what it calls) "united and civic Bosnia-Hercegovina".  The only difference now is that, due to the circumstances, the demands have been reduced.  If it is impossible to get the whole of Bosnia, a Federation will do, at least the part outside the "Serb entity".  There is nothing new in this, but the question is when were the indictments really issued, and with whose, intentional or unintentional help?<P>

Let's consider the facts: Last June, during the preparations for the HDZ [largest Croatian political party in Bosnia, a sister party of Croatian HDZ, the ruling party in Croatia] Bosnia-Hercegovina congress, the district court in Zenica (read Muslim court) issued an indictment against Dario Kordic.  Even then it was obvious that Kordic was one of the most serious candidates for the president of the party [HDZ].  Of course, the politicians who had been promoted in the meantime, although some of them had never formally belonged to the party, wanted to grab both "state" and "party" power in Herceg-Bosna.  Especially <strong>Kresimir Zubak</strong>, then and today the president of the Presidential council and the Federation "boss".  It is the fact that at the congress, Kordic was elected the party president with overwhelming support and that Zubak, although one of the candidates for that post, wasn't even present at the session at which the secret voting results were announced, although this would have made sense since he had already been calling for "the unity of the Croatian people." <P>

<h2>Massacred Croats</h2>  

It is also the fact that several days at the session of the both houses of the Parliament of Herceg-Bosna, Zubak confused quite a few representatives by asserting that the "antifederal wing" had won at the HDZ congress; he used the election of three vicepresidents, <strong>Bozo Rajic</strong>,<strong>Srecko Vucina</strong> and <strong>Jozo Maric</strong>, as evidence for his claim.<P>

Only "politically blind" people do not understand that Zubak wasn't aiming at the vicepresidents.  The "bullet" was supposed to hit newly elected Kordic.  In the "common" interest, the difficulties were ironed out at the "higher" place, but the embers still burn in the ashes.  It is also obvious that the "indictment" of the district court in Zenica was supposed to demonstrate support of the muslim leadership to those who wanted to use "the Federation moment" and take over HDZ.<P>

Time goes by but little is forgotten.  Instead of strengthening the institutions of the Croatian Republic of Herceg-Bosna, which was emphasized as the most important goal at the HDZ party congress, extra-institutional battle for personal power gains in intensity.  The often stated claims of <strong>Kresimir Zubak</strong>, first in the "state hierarchy", and Dr. <strong>Jadranko Prlic</strong>, prime minister of Herceg-Bosna for almost four years, that "we have completely built all the levers of the system," sound so silly.  And again we come back to the question: why were the indictments against Croats issued right now?  It would be easiest to say that this is a "muslim", actually Alija's, plot.  However, it would be better to turn to ourselves and admit that the indictments are to a large extent a result of Croatian mistakes.  While the Croatian warriors, battle-proven warriors, were accused in the Muslim media for alleged crimes, the "institutions and levers of the system" were quiet.  Why did they not, if they already exist, demand from THE HAGUE to examine the facts of the massacres in Croatian villages of Orliste, Trusine, Uzdol, Krizancevo, Doljani...etc. etc.<P>

<h2>What is(n't) Izetbegovic Doing?</h2>

Let's be realistic and ask ourselves: is that Izetbegovic's fault, or is it the fault of the "completely built levers of the system" in Herceg-Bosna?<P>

Is it only Alija Izetbegovic's fault that his one year mandate lasts more than five years and a few months?<P>

Is it Izetbegovic's fault that the Presidency of Herceg-Bosna is a group of individuals without clear duties and that the HDZ Presidency and the government of Herceg-Bosna exist more on "paper" than in reality?<P>

Is it Izetbegovic's fault that for months there have been no Croats in the Federal government, while the government of Herceg-Bosna is headed by "the deputies of the deputies' deputies"?  Of course, Izetbegovic is still doing his job, also because of the fact that "the institutions and levers of the authority in Herceg-Bosna" haven't done what, on behalf of the victims from Orliste and Uzdol, they must have done.  Has anyone been wondering why has there been so much attention regarding the Mostar Croats?  It seems exactly because the County authorities in Mostar, from the county council to the city HDZ organization, are doing their job.  If someone doesn't trust me, just consider the number of recently opened companies, schools, apartments, galleries, etc. in Mostar.  Isn't it absurd that neither the presidency nor the government of Herceg-Bosna have a legal nor economic adviser, although in Mostar, there are faculties for both disciplines at the Croatian university.  All this is only seemingly unrelated to the topic.  Let us go back to the legally and in every other way incomplete indictments against Muslim leaders and commanders who have committed numerous massacres of Croats.  It is easy to say: "we have a Commission for war crimes."  We have a lot of things, but most of them only exist on paper.  A lot of agreements and treaties have been signed for and about Herceg-Bosna, but the legal advice of the Mostar University law faculty has never been sought.  Maybe politicians know everything!  Only now the documents are coming out of archives.<P>

<h2>The "Fundamental People" Has no Sins?</h2>

Croats have defended the free part of Bosnia-Hercegovina, for the most part from Yugoslavia.  Today, however, they are being accused of undermining that same Bosnia-Hercegovina.  Of course, the year old accusation against the leader of the Croatian party in Bosnia-Hercegovina [HDZ] and the Croatian military leader (general Blaskic as the chief of staff of the HVO of Herceg-Bosna) from Zenica, is nothing but an attempt to spread the guilt between the Serbs and Croats and present them both as aggressors.  The "Serb political leader" (Karadzic) and "military leader" (Mladic) have also been indicted.  The goal is clear: only one nation, the "fundamental people", his army and leadership are different.  What absurdity! What about tens of thousands of <a HREF="/info/students/marko/arkzin2.html">Velika Kladusa Muslims</a> who still cannot return to their homes?  The Hague keeps quiet about the leaders of the "fundamental" people.<P>

Croats, due to their army and strength, have liberated 85 percent of the free territory in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  They will not allow that their leaders be accused of war crimes.  Croats, however, must consider the passivity of the institutions of Herceg-Bosnia in this affair.  Hell is not always in "someone else".<P>

<h1> We Must Not Say - We Did Not See, We Did Not Know</h1>

<h2>by Andrija Tunjic
Vjesnik, Zagreb, Croatia, January 21, 1996</h2>

According to international law there is no expiry date on
crimes against humanity. On the other hand one can keep quiet
about them. And one can speculate with them and wait in order
to extort or achieve political interests.<P>

Does this mean that the article published in the New York
Times about Serbian crimes against Muslims and Croats, as well
as about mass graves in the Prijedor area, i.e. the Ljubija
mines, sees the start of the procedure which will reveal
Serbian crimes which have been covered up for such a long time
with, it seems, a lot of help from the international
community. Or is all this just media hullabaloo serving to
deceive the naive?<P>

It is unbelievable that it is only now that the Times have
appeared on the field that British soldiers in IFOR have
started to speak about a possible cover up operation by the
Serbs. More precisely, British commanders deployed in B-H
within the NATO peace-keeping forces stated to New York Times
reporters that British patrols had often come across massacred
bodies which were being transported somewhere by Bosnian
Serbs. "It looks as if they are in a hurry to cover up
murder", stated a British commander whose name was not
mentioned.<P>

It is obvious that the Serbs are in a hurry to hide their
crimes against Muslims and Croats, but it is also obvious that
the British are not overjoyed that the New York Times has
become involved, since for the British this paper is objective
and too influential; a paper which cannot be ignored.<P>

Now that British silence has been revealed, world diplomacy
has been set in motion. And immediately the excuse for the
inefficiency is transferred to those who did not ask the
location of the crime to be placed under IFOR control, in
other words on B-H and the International Tribunal in the
Hague. Is it possible, however, after all these events, and
after this cynicism, to expect the international community to
be consistent and to set in motion the mechanisms which will
ensure the control over the mass graves, thereby safeguarding
the evidence of Serbian crimes? It is especially important for
the Prijedor area which along with Srebrenica and Zepa has
seen, perhaps, the most massive persecution and executions of
non-Serbs in   B-H.<P>

<h2>Where have the people disappeared to?</h2>

Prior to the war and according to the 1991 population census
there were some 6,300 Croats, 49,454 Muslims, 47,745 Serbs and
8,971 others, in other words a total of 112,470 inhabitants,
in the Prijedor district. According to the population census
carried out in 1993 by the "Serbian Republic" and published in
"Kozarski vjesnik" on July 2, 1993, the Prijedor district had
68,551 inhabitants of which "53,637 of Orthodox persuasion,
6,124 Muslim  and 3,169 Catholic". 4% of the total population
were "others". Also included were 5,451 people who had moved
to the area from elsewhere.<P>

Therefore, even with the 5,451 new settlers there are still
46,919 people missing. Where are they? For many of them it is
known that they ended up in prison camps such as Keraterm,
Trnopolje, Omarska, Manjaca, Krings... or were  murdered in
their villages, houses. The exact number of victims of the
Serbian genocide will have to be determined by someone; by
this I primarily mean the international community and the
International Tribunal for War Crimes.<P>

When we know that the Prijedor area from the very first day of
the aggression against B-H was under Serbian control, that
there was practically no military conflict and that the
victims were exclusively civilians then there should be no
speculations.<P>

Why has the international community not yet issued a request
for the mass graves to be protected? According to the
statement made in Sarajevo on 14 January this year by an IFOR
spokesperson, so far there has been no official request sent
to IFOR on the protection of the mass grave locations. They
have not yet received any from the International Tribunal in
the Hague. According to them it is the Tribunal which is
obliged to send them a request.<P>

Time will tell whether the international community will be
consistent in that which it prescribes and prevent the
destruction of evidence of Serbian crimes committed against
Croats and Muslims in B-H or whether these crimes will merely
serve as a means of discipline and pressure?<P>

<h2>Witnesses to terrifying events</h2>

Every witness who comes from these regions has brought with
him terrifying stories each more horrifying than the other.<P>

- During the night of April 30, 1992, about 2 a.m., the Serbs
carried out a military coup and brought down the legally
elected authorities and established Serbian authority. In this
they were aided by the former Yugoslav People's Army. The
first armed attack in this area started on May 22, 1992 about
8 p.m. on the village of Hambarine which is exclusively
inhabited by Muslims.<P>

On this occasion two tanks, three armoured vehicles and some
200 soldiers entered the village. Upon entering they started
to loot houses and set them on fire. Most of the inhabitants
had managed to flee to the woods on Mount Kurevo and to the
Croatian village of Surkovac before the Serbs arrived. The
Serb units were commandeered by Zoran Karlica who was replaced
by Rade Bilbija when he died. When they took the village, the
village was looted and the men were taken to camps - states
one of the witnesses.<P>

After the attack on Hambarine there followed attacks on
Rakovcani, Rizvanovici, Biscani, Carakovo, Jugovci and Zecovi.
Kozarac was attacked on May 24 and it is know for certain that
more than 200 people were killed in the attack. On May 31, an
event occurred, judged to have been instigated, which sparked
off Serbian revenge over the Muslims and Croats in Prijedor.
People were killed, thrown off roofs, massacred, executed.<P>

With the first attacks also come the establishment of camps:
Keraterm, Omarska and Trnopolje in which all men, between 16
and 60 years of age, were deported. Some of the prisoners were
later sent to Manjaca and Batkovici and so it is therefore
difficult to say exactly how many were killed. However,
according to information and testimonies available, several
thousand were killed. Maybe even more than eight thousand,
states the Times.<P>

- A terrifying date for us was July 20 when the Serbs attacked
from the direction of Prijedor onto the area of Mount
Matarusko where there was a whole series of villages in which
Muslims lived. That day they started cleansing the area of the
local inhabitants. Those who were not killed or who had not
escaped to the Kurevo woods were taken to the camps by the
Serbs.<P>

In the Muslim village of Tukovi, the Serbs killed some twenty
inhabitants and about fifty inhabitants of neighbouring
villages were taken to the camps of Keraterm, Trnopolje and
Omarska. The direct commanders of the Serbs who carried out
the massacre were chetnik commanders Mico Jurisic and Dragan
Pintar.<P>

After Tukovi, the Serbs continued their mass killings in other
villages. Some of the inhabitants were killed on their
doorsteps, and groups of people who were being led to assembly
points were executed along the way. The assembly point for the
people of Biscani was in the "Bijela Zemlja" area where twenty
men were executed. In the village of Mrkalji, some fifty
people were killed in front of the house of Smail Mrkalj,
while behind the "Rio" cafe, several people were killed.
Several men were also killed in Kadici in the house of Edhem
Kadic.<P>

That day, the Serbs killed about 800 people. The same day
Branko Jesic fired at the mosque in Biscani and later burnt it
down. Commander Dragan Tintor cut the hand off Suljo Tatarevic
before his small son and father and then killed him. The son
of Slavka Antonic killed twelve people in front of the mosque
in Carakovo and he wrapped the still living Muslim priest in a
carpet and set him on fire. They murdered and cleansed the
area until July 23, states the witness of Serbian crimes M.C.<P>

<h2>Rampage against civilians</h2>

That day on July 23, the so-called 6th Krajina Brigade of the
Serbian Army set off from the area of the Sanski Most district
toward the village of Stara Rijeka inhabited exclusively by
Croats. The next morning they literally ran over Stara Rijeka,
Brisevo, the entire Kurevo woods, Raljas. That morning, in
just the village of Brisevo, 77 civilians were killed. M.I.
testifies to this event.<P> 

- Early in the morning at 3.30 they started to shell the
village with 120 mm shells. This lasted until 5 p.m. They were
positioned in Ostra Luka, Batkovci, Redak and Rasavci on Mount
Dragisica Glavica. The Serbian Army entered the village
between 5 and 6 p.m.<P>

They came in from two directions; the 6th Krajina Brigade from
the direction of Stara Rijeka past Begic's house and members
of the 5th Kozara Brigade from the direction of Raljasi and
Ljubija. The next day, about 10 a.m., a part of the 6th
Krajina Brigade started to descend from the houses of the
Buzuk family over Mount Graorac towards the rivulets
Starjenica and Mustanica and at the same time, the other part
of the brigade arrived from the direction of Atilijina kosa
over Mounts Bjeljevac, Ivandica Glavica and Marijanova
Glavica. They met at the house of Pejo Dimac and Ilija Atilija
and killed them. Then the caught Milan Buzuk, took him to his
own house and tortured him and shot him in front of his mother
Vikica. They took out his eyes, cut off his ears and cut his
muscles. Then they killed Marko Buzuk.<P>

All night they raped and tortured the local inhabitants; the
Serbs from the neighbouring villages were the most vehement.
Ivica Mlinar, Luka Mlinar and Jerko Ivandic were killed with
picks, shovels and poles. They cut open Zdravko Matanovic's
stomach and tied his hands up with his intestines. Kaja
Komljen was raped to death. Her breasts were bitten off, teeth
marks could be seen. She was found naked on the field where
she had been raped. We buried her there. All nine members of
the Matanovic family were killed in the stream near the house
of Fabo, Anto and Mladen Matanovic. Mato (father Vinko) Buzuk
was stabbed with a knife and his wife Marija was hanged. Two
elderly people were burned to death when their house was set
on fire by Dusan Radulovic known as Cicin or Zuti.<P>

The massacre operation in Brisevo was commandeered by Veljko
Brajic, who was subsequently promoted to the rank of colonel.
The commander of the 6th Krajina Brigade was Colonel Basara,
later promoted to the rank of a general of the Serbian Army.
Basara's associate was Nedeljko Rasula of the village of
Caplje, in the Sanski Most district.<P>

<h2>Graves - silent witnesses</h2>

The dead victims of the Serbs in the village of Brisevo were
buried by the inhabitants in the morning while the Serbs still
slept. All the inhabitants agreed not to leave the village
until they had buried their dead even if it meant dying
themselves.<P>

In Brisevo there are fourteen graves in which lie Croat
corpses. In seven of the graves there is just one corpse and
in two there are three, in one there are four. There is one
with six corpses and two with seven. There is also one grave
in which 20 people were buried in the middle of July.
According to eye-witness accounts, there are more than twenty
mass graves in the wider area of the villages of Brisevo and
Stara Rijeka.<P>

In the area known as Volaric, in the village of Surkovac,
there are two mass graves. In one there are twelve Muslims who
were brought here from the Muslim villages along the Sana
River.  When the Serbs unloaded the bodies, they ordered the
local Roms to dig two graves by the evening. About 9 p.m. the
Serbs from the village of Miskina Glava came to check whether
they had finished, then they killed the Roms, nine of them,
and buried them in the second mass grave.<P>

In the woods of Kurevo more than a hundred Muslim women,
children and men were killed.<P>

In the Serbian village of Miskina Glava, in the local
community hall, in three days, fifteen people were killed with
knives or other blades.<P>

Ljubija, a surface mine - 130 killed.<P>

Trzna, sand excavation pits, is the location of the grave in
which the villagers of Jugovci are buried, most of them with
the surnames Hegic and Alagic, about 120 people in all.<P>

The mass graves in the area known as Sjuncara, by the River
Sana and in the area of Prijedorsko Polje and the village of
Biscani, is the location where, according to eyewitness
accounts, several hundred people and maybe even more than a
thousand are buried.<P>

The mass grave of the surface mine Tomasica is the location
where the victims of Barracks No. 3 of the Keraterm prison
camp are buried, all 150 of them.<P>

Then come the mass graves in the pits of the surface mines of
Stara Rijeka and Omarska.<P>

One of the larger mass graves may be found near the village of
Ljeskar, in Dubocaj, where the Serbs assembled the bodies of
the Croats and Muslims that they slaughtered between July 20
and 25, 1992.<P>

<h2>Serbs destroying evidence</h2>

After the decision of the UN Security Council to establish a
Tribunal which would try those accused of committing war
crimes in the area of the former Yugoslavia, the Serbian
authorities of the districts of Prijedor and Sanski Most and
the Ljubija area  started to destroy traces of the crimes
committed in these areas during 1992 and 1993.<P>

In this way, in the area called Dubocaj, on November 5 1992,
the Serbs burnt the corpses of their victims. According to
eyewitnesses, the odour spread to Raljasi 3.5 km away.<P>

In the same way, between July 1 and 12, 1993, Serbian
authorities and members of the police blocked the road
Svoznica which links Ljubija with the southern villages of
Brisevo, Stara Rijeka, Batkovci, Garavica, Gornja and Donja
Ravska and Ovanjska. Underground explosions could be felt
(houses several kilometres away shook) and the work of large
mining machines could be heard.<P>

Twelve days later the road was re-opened and passers-by
noticed that the area where mass graves had previously been
located had been dug up and that earth and stones had been
freshly unloaded. Eyewitnesses believe that the Serbs had
taken out the remains of their victims' corpses and taken them
to Prijedor, most probably to the Tomasica mines where the
corpses were ground down by the ore grinding machines.<P>

However, according to some accounts given by people who
arrived from these parts in 1995, this is unlikely. They
believe instead this to be a diversion and that the corpses
were taken away and thrown into disused mines in the vicinity
of Stara Rijeka. It is supposed that the remains of corpses
from other mass graves are buried in this new, collective mass
grave. If this is proved true then this mass grave contains
several thousand victims.<P>

It is also interesting that one of the witnesses, who is from
the village of Tomasica, was told by an active member of the
Serbian Army, that Serbian authorities had during November
1992
removed the bodies from the Tomasica mine and taken them to
Kozarac where between May 24 and 25, 1992 they had carried out
a pogrom against the Muslims<P>.

From all this we may conclude that the Serbs buried their
victims in mass graves in areas of Muslim or Croatian
villages.<P>

According to eye-witnesses, Serbian civilians and military
authorities of Ljubija and Prijedor probably carried out
similar actions on other known and unknown mass graves in the
Ljubija and Prijedor districts.<P>

<h2>We must not remain silent</h2>

Concerning the co-operation of Croatia with the International
Tribunal for determining crimes committed in the former
Yugoslavia, Luka Gavranovic, an employee in the Croatian
Information Centre (CIC), states:<P>

- The co-operation between the CIC and representatives of the
International Tribunal in the Hague is developing along
several lines. The most significant of course is organising
contacts between witnesses and International Tribunal
researchers.<P>

We have placed our entire archive, all testimonies and eye-
witness statements which we have collected at the disposal of
the Tribunal. We have also participated in preparing meetings
between witnesses and the researchers, just as we co-operated
with Bassioni's Commission.<P>

We have enabled contacts with witnesses. We have also co-
operated with journalists interested in the crimes committed.
In this way we were able to give more information to the two
New York Times journalists who had been imprisoned by the
Serbs and then expelled from the areas where the crimes had
been committed.<P>

And it was only when the article was published in the New York
Times that floods of questions appeared as to why these mass
graves had not been protected so far. Why did members of
British IFOR units in these areas, who literally saw bodies of
massacred people, not relay this information? Or did they?
Because, it is only with the efforts of us all and with the
aid of eye-witnesses who survived these crimes that we will be
able to reconstruct these events.<P>

And that is why we must all show special respect to those
people who have gathered up the courage to testify and to
relive again their horrifying ordeal.<P>

<h1>WHY DOES THE CROATIAN FLAG DISTURB KINKEL ?</h1>

<strong><em>by Nenad Ivankovic</em></strong><P>

<h2> Vjesnik, Zagreb, Croatia, 2/21/96</h2>

As the Vjesnik reported on Monday the chief of the Bonn
diplomatic corps strongly protested this weekend because
Croats in Mostar hung their flag on a railway bridge. The
word is about two bridges which were opened by the German
Finance and Development Minister Carl-Dieter Spranges.<P>

If Klinkel did not lift the whole matter to the level of an
"international issue", summoning to his office the Croatian
Ambassador in Bonn Mr Ivan Ilic, it is most likely no one
would have known of the "incident", that is, that the Croats
by emphasising their flag "damaged the sovereignty of Bosnia
and Herzegovina".<P>

There was no response regarding this from European Union's
administration in Mostar, nor the Sarajevo media which is
quite unusual given Klinkel's reaction. Only the media in
Serbia reported the displeasure of the chief of the Bonn
diplomacy towards Zagreb.<P>

If all the visible pressures being placed on Croatia and
Croats are to one side so that peace in Bosnia can be
patched together at their cost and according to the measure
of the west then the question remains: Why is it that the
chief of the Bonn diplomatic corps just at this moment sees
the Croatian flag as a diplomatic provocation? Is it
possible that Kinkel is not aware that there is not a
Federation flag, and that the Croats have no other flag
beside the one that  disturbs him? Croats, just like Germans
are "Kulturvolk", which means that as members of the same
nation they do not live within the one state, as is the case
with say the French, but by the fact that they belong to the
same cultural- historical context and share the same
identity. It is because of this that the Croats were able to
survive under the foreign rule but always had their own, one
flag.<P>

It is difficult to believe that Kinkel does not know or
understand this. It would be similarly difficult to believe
that Kinkel has forgotten that hundreds of thousands of West
German flags were flying in East German cities at the time
when the German Democratic Republic existed as an
internationally recognised state. That was in 1989/90,
almost one full year prior to unification. Was that also a
provocation? Even if unification did not eventuate, would
that have been termed as incidents?<P>

Therefore, it is useful to ask why the Croatian friend
Kinkel has such "poor nerves". Because of his injured
vanity? Reliable sources state that during Kinkel's last
visit to Zagreb when he was desperately trying to save the
failed arbitration of his countrymen Koschnik he exchanged
sharp words with the President.<P>

Or, because of his own weak position in relation to German
politics and party relations?<P>

In any event, it is indicative, after the politico-
diplomatic debacle in and about Mostar that Kinkel
demonstratively invited the united Zagreb opposition, which
is a precedent in Germany or the west. No where has it
happened that the entire opposition, one that is in frontal
conflict with the party in power, has received such an
invitation. Unless, it is the intention by the gesture to
meddle in the internal affairs of the country in question.
It is similarly indicative that Kinkel gave an interview to
a Rijeka newspaper which has for months been leading a
political campaign against the Croatian President. For
anyone with even a little political sensitivity all of this
is more than an ordinary signal. And now there is this
fabrication of an "incident" about a Croatian flag on a
Mostar railway bridge, financed by the Germans.<P>

Isn't all of this too obvious for it to simply fall into the
context of a political manoeuvre of the German government on
this territory and towards our country?<P>

<h1>IVAN ZVONIMIR CICAK HAS BEEN WORKING FOR UDBA(SECRET 
SERVICE) SINCE 1966</h1>

<h2>Vjesnik, Zagreb, Croatia, April 30, 1996</h2>

<strong>
According to the documents confiscated in the military operation 
"Storm", Cicak under the pseudonym "Bak", worked for the State's 
Secret Service (SDB)</strong><P>

ZAGREB, April 29 - According to the documents of the Serbian 
Secret Service of the so called Krajina, which fell into the hands of 
the Croatian army following the military operation "Storm", Cicak, a 
front man of the Croatian Helsinki Committee has been working for 
Udba since April 14, 1966. According to the Secret Service's 
documents of the Security Department of the 39th Corps of the 
main Headquarters of the Serbian Krajina Serb Army, Cicak 
explained "his duties and preferences". in a statement he wrote and 
signed himself. This statement, written in ink, contains a "clause" in 
which Cicak committed himself  "to cooperate with SDB (State's 
Secret Service) and deliver his reports under the pseudonym of 
"Bak".<P>    
	Vjesnik has possession of a photocopy of the original 
document, which brings serious charges against the front man of 
the Croatian Helsinki Committee.<P>
	This is concerning a report written by the Serbian military 
secret service
on February 7, 1994 which was sent to the Security Department of 
the 39th Corps. The report was a strictly confidential	 document 
listed under numbers 8-12, sent to vice-colonel B. Bucan Pavle, the 
officer in charge".<P>
	The same report was forwarded to the security department of 
the main Headquarters of the Serbian Krajina Army as a top military 
secret and was listed under numbers 7-45 and dated March 17, 
1994.<P>
	The document claims that an interview with Miletic Simo, a 
member of SJB, took place at "time 1994.01.28" relating to the 
"possession of material of the former SDB of Croatia".
	The document further adds: "After contacting Miletic, he 
showed me some of the material which he has possession of, and 
explained to me that the rest of the material is somewhere else and 
that it is not at his disposal for the time being...  Following our 
conversation I came to the conclusion that a former member of the 
Croatian SDB, who is being allegedly situated in the territory of the 
Republika Srpska, brought the above mentioned document from 
Zagreb, but this can not be confirmed. He avoided mentioning the 
name of this person."<P>
	The Serbian military agent further adds that he examined all 
7 documents brought to him, among which he saw the original 
statement "written by hand and in ink" by Ivan Zvonimir Cicak. In 
his statement, Cicak explains his duties and preferences. There is a 
"clause" written and signed by Cicak at the end of his statement in 
which he agrees to cooperate with the SDB and deliver his reports to 
them under the pseudonym Bak. The statement was written on 
April 14, 1966."<P>
	The document makes an evaluation of the materials presented 
by Miletic and adds: "According to my opinion the most valuable 
part of the document is the statement written by Ivan Zvonimir 
Cicak and his assistance to cooperate with the SDB under 
pseudonym "BAK". The fact that it is an original makes it trully 
valueable!"<P>

A reply by Ivan Zvonimir Cicak, president of the Croatian Helsinki 
Committee for Human Rights</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="+1">

The Croatian state-controlled daily newspaper, Vjesnik, published an 
article on the 30th of April titled  Ivan Zvonimir Cicak has worked for the 
UDBA since 1966 . The subtitle read:  Documents captured during 
Operation Storm last August confirm that Cicak worked for the Yugoslav 
secret police under the pseudonym  Bak  . The Article implies that Vjesnik 
is in possession of a copy of a secret Serbian report that confirms the 
allegations.<P>
I have no intention of entering into a public debate with Nenad Ivankovic, 
or Vjesnik, the newspaper he edits. However, I do feel that it is my 
responsibility to offer a reply to the public:<P>
<ul>
<li>Ivanlovic s accusations of my alleged cooperation with the Yugoslav secret 
police, the UDBA, are false.
<li>Ivankovic did not offer any evidence for the claims published in the article.
<li>Mr. Nenad Ivankovic is really only a political pseudonym of the forces he 
represents in the Croatian political scene.</ul><P>
With the appointment of Ivankovic to the position of editor, Vjesnik, once 
the most respectable daily newspaper in Croatia, has reached the lowest 
ebb in its history.<P>
When Ivankovic was appointed, his brief, which he has since successfully 
carried out, seems to have been to turn Vjesnik into a police bulletin. By 
this I mean no disrespect to the Croatian police force. If a serious 
newspaper were about to publish accusations of such a grave nature, it 
would try to substantiate them or at least provide a space for the accused 
party to reply. The dubious nature of the said document is most evident 
when it s contents are examined. It is founded on the story of two Serbian 
officers who relate the story of a third, unnamed security officer, who in 
turn speaks of  a document written in ink....<P>   
Certain details from my undoubtedly colorful biography are an effective 
response to the fabrications of Nenad Ivankovic, his political patrons and 
their collaborators from the Serbian secret service. I have always expressed 
all my political opinions and ideas openly in public and with more than a 
fair share of personal courage. This is why I do not take this form of attack 
on my person any more seriously than any of the previous ones. On the 
contrary, this is yet another attempt to instill a reign of terror in Croatia.
The only true fact in the entire article is that I was indeed imprisoned for 
the first time in April of 1966, when the secret police tried to recruit me. I 
rejected their proposals and as a consequence was expelled from high 
school on May 15th,1966, the last day of the school year. I lost all of the 
credits from my fourth year of school and was was banned from continuing 
my education in any school in the former [Yugoslavia]. This reaction was provoked by a 
controversial essay I wrote for my school exam.<P>
According to Ivankovic, his political patrons and their collaborators from 
the Serbian secret police, this was probably supposed to have been the 
reward for my faithful cooperation with the secret police.
My entire life after that - the years which I spent in prison, my being denied 
the right to travel abroad, being shadowed by the police and harassed in 
many other ways - was supposed to be  Bak s  reward for serving Nenad 
Ivankovic's present collaborators. The Croatian public has become familiar 
with parts of my life through the many articles and interviews that have 
been published over the years. However, many people who really were 
police collaborators are still alive, and I hereby invite them to come forward 
and talk about what they know about me and my activities publicly.
I have always argued for equal treatment to be given to all police files, 
which is why I hereby call upon the Croatian Secret Service to make the 
entire contents of my files accessible to journalists and to the public. I 
should know best what might be in those files, and I am ready to face any 
consequences that might result from the release of this information.
Finally, I should like to call upon the Croatian Parliament to initiate a 
public inquiry into my police files and render the contents thereof to 
Parliament.<P>
Throughout his life, Nenad Ivankovic has been an instrument and the 
executor of the darkest forces of all the political regimes that he has lived 
under. We were born only a few houses away from each other, and within a 
short time of one another. He is the son of an UDBA officer, and I was born 
to a former officer of the Croatian domobran force, who had endured 
tremendous suffering immediately after the war. The suffering of my family 
continues to this day.<P>
Our lives are still linked in a curious way. I was brought up in a spirit of 
rebellion against authoritarianism, he in a spirit of acceptance. Until only a 
handful of years ago, Ivankovic was the leading writer for the most rigid 
forces of the previous regime. His objective was to run campaigns against 
myself and my colleagues, whom he called the  Ustasha clerical-nationalist 
elements. Today he calls us enemies of the Croatian state, and me  the old 
UDBA collaborator.<P>
However, these latest accusations say little about me and yet speak volumes 
about Ivankovic and those forces in Croatian society that he identifies with. 
I shall strive to continue living and working as I always have, aware of the 
fact that such attempts at political assassination inevitably lead to other 
forms of violence.<P>
I do not perceive this latest attack as an assault on me alone, but as a 
frontal onslaught on the ideas that people like myself stand for - and not 
only in Croatia. I sincerely hope that such attempts at political 
assassination will not impede the process of democratization which will 
enable the principles of human rights to becomes firmly rooted in Croatia.
Even though hundreds of articles loaded with lies and false accusations 
have been written about me over the years, I have never, in the forty-nine 
years of my life, brought charges against anyone. I am unfortunately forced 
to deviate from my past practice and make an exception in this case.
In my ongoing struggle for the establishment a state of law in Croatia, I am 
giving the Croatian judiciary the opportunity to address the issue of the 
latest crime by Nenad Ivankovic, the editor of Vjesnik.<P>

<h1>Izetbegovic in a Uniform</h1>

<strong><em>by Josip Vricko</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vjesnik, Zagreb, Croatia, May 9, 1996</h2>

Leader of the so called Bosnian collective presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, 
 started his election campaign almost as soon as he got up from
his sick bed.  A month ago Izetbegovic declared in front
of  soldiers (who to his great pleasure, address him as "
commander in chief") and civilians in Bihac that Bosnia would be liberated 
from both Serbs and Croats.  It is interesting that this war cry was 
equally warmly received by both civilians and soldiers who had, only a few
months before, liberated that city together with the Croatian Army and Croatian 
Defense Council [Bosnian Croat Army] units.(...)<P>

 Izetbegovic probably thinks that
he has been generous long enough.  Obviously, he liked his Bihac declarations. 
Hence, he repeated them in Gorazde, to the consternation of  IFOR commander
General Michael Walker:  "Our struggle will not end until all of Bosnia is free," the
president with suddenly awakened militaristic ambitions loosely paraphrased
himself.<P>

On the occasion of the so called people rally in Zenica, where he also
attacked Silajdzic [former Bosnian prime minister, leader of the opposition 
Party for Bosnia-Hercegovina], Izetbegovic asked the citizens of Zenica to learn 
the word reconciliation.  Although it is not news that Izetbegovic speaks differently
on the same topic to different audiences, it is interesting that he has made such
radical turns in the aforementioned cities.  Obviously, Izetbegovic knows what he 
is doing: in Zenica, from where Serbs left at the very beginning and Croats were
banished during the war, there is no need to "liberate" Bosnia.  As far as SDA
[Izetbegovic's party, the Party for Democratic Action] is concerned, in Zenica,
Bosnia is free [of Serbs and Croats].  On the other hand, Gorazde and Bihac, cities
which were surrounded and cut off from Sarajevo during the war, need to be prepared
for the elections.<P>

Izetbegovic is aware that Sarajevo owes a lot to those victimized cities;
if nothing else he can give out far fetched promises.  After all, Izetbegovic
spoke at the so called people rallies as, above all, a party leader, to which
the IFOR commander hasn't paid enough attention.  As a party leader,  Izetbegovic
doesn't care much about the Dayton agreement.<P>

<h1>Anti-Croatian Activities of International Non-Governmental Organizations</h1>

<strong><em> by Stjepan Peric</em></strong><P>

<h2> Vjesnik, Zagreb, Croatia, May 17, 1996</h2>

Peter Siebelt (50), has no known occupation.
In his office in his house near a lake south of Amsterdam
surrounded by high walls with sharp points and watchdogs to keep
uninvited guests away, Siebelt keeps the most advanced
computer systems. He makes phone calls all around the world, but
nobody calls him. He hands out his number to a very select portion
of his clients, and asks them to use it only in the most urgent
situations.
Such a life might be a logical consequence of his previous
activities. He used to have a private security company which protected
big companies and rich people in one of the most dangerous parts
of Amsterdam, de Bijlmermeer. He protected rich people, their
property, against organized crime, Mafiosi, kidnappers and
terrorists. Many of them are behind bars, but many more are still
free, and looking for revenge.<P>

<strong> You came to the paper and offered an interview. Why?</strong><P>

 I have been in Croatia many times, I have a deep respect for
the struggle for independence of your country, and the suffering
during the war. I am thinking about importing your very good
wines and I plan to build ships and yachts for Croatia. But on
this occasion I would like to warn your public about rather
destructive activities of some NGOs - something I know a lot
about, if not too much.<P>

<strong> Why would someone who had a security company be concerned
with NGOs?</strong><P>

 Just because of my experience:  I came to the conclusion
that some NGOs are connected with different terrorist
organizations. I am a war child, my father was an American
officer who liberated Europe including the Netherlands... In the
mid sixties there was a huge wave of anti-American demonstrations all
around Europe. Americans were blamed for just about everything -
Vietnam, Korea, imperialism in Africa, nuclear bombs & power stations.
I asked myself: why would all this people demonstrate against the
country which liberated them? Also, I noticed that the leaders of
these protests were always the same people. Much later I will find
them again on prominent posts in different NGOs... What would it mean
to you if I tell you that it is always the same persons from Croatia
who are active in 'sisterly' organizations such as Balkan War Report,
Aspen Institute, Helsinki Assembly, Antiwar Campaign, Press Now, Pax
Christi? And also, they use every opportunity to attack your
government.<P>

<strong> It would mean a lot if you could show us some proofs and
give us good arguments in support to your claims.</strong><P>

 I won't mention any names because it would result in their
orchestrated attack on you... but I will give you one example. One
woman, a journalist for Antiwar Campaign published an article in one
'anti-war' paper claiming that forced evictions are the biggest
problem in Croatia and that the whole Europe is against it. But Europe
would know nothing about evictions if it was not for these NGOs who
made an issue of it. Later this same woman advised the evicted to
seek legal help which would be given to them free of charge by her
and her colleagues. But, an international community  paid for this
'free' legal help and so the lady in question and her colleagues 
earned their fee. And as a reward they will be invited to participate at
different symposiums across Europe where they will exchange their
experiences with their 'colleagues' from Nicaragua, Salvador and
Burma! (...)  A certain person from Croatia has worked for the "Balkan
War Report" and has co-operated with all the anti-Croatian organizations.
Then, almost "miraculously", she obtained an interview with a war criminal
from Srebrenica, who, imagine the coincidence, was a Croat!  Then, the videotape
was stolen by the Serbian secret service!  Today, this lady is some sort
of a TV official at the trial in the Hague, and her reports are supposed to be
carried by all the TV stations in the former Yugoslavia.  There are no 
coincidences here.<P>

Just consider whom these organizations recruit around Europe, from the ranks
of the intellectuals and refugees from the former Yugoslavia?  Note that they
always talk about Yugoslavia; they only mention Croatia in a negative sense.
You'll notice that 99% of these "desirable activists" are against President
Tudman and the Croatian authorities.  I keep wondering why, just as I wondered
why so many Europeans protest against the Americans.  Why always the same few?
I apologise for this digression, but I cannot remember European protests
against "human rights violations" in various third world countries,
without noticing that they never protested against USSR!<P>

<h2>Misuse of Church Organizations</h2>

<strong>Indeed, why?  Do you think you have the true answer?</strong><P>

Croatia is a new country, a new market - which is exactly what
these people need. They must find new 'subjects' in order to
attract attention and collect money. People give once or twice
for Nicaragua or Chile and than they stop giving. NGOs must look
for new places and must attract media attention. For example, I want to use
this occasion to publicly ask Pax
Christi  how much of the money collected during a
'Blankets for Bosnia' campaign actually made it to Bosnia?
I'll tell you that it could not have been more than 10%. The rest was used
to finance their own political campaign.<P>

<strong> Croatian public knows very little about this organization.
Could you shed some light?</strong><P>

 Pax Christi is an old Catholic organization, but in mid-
sixties it was infiltrated by people who have little to do with
faith. Church in Europe is used to propagate these 'greenies' and
'humanrighties'. They found it very handy because the state
institutions have no right to interfere with the Church which
gives a lot of space to NGOs. And who is the boss, the real boss?
Mister Jan Ter Laak, a Dutchman, a big friend of Yassir Arafat [Palestinian 
Liberation Organisation leader], ANC [African National Congress]
and National Democratic Front of the Philippines! Why does he needs to have
a contact with organizations which were involved in terrorism?  So
that he can arbitrate, collect donations and be politically active.<P>

<strong> Is Pax Christi active in Croatia?</strong><P>

 Certainly! There is one co-worker of this organisation in
every NGO that I mentioned! I will name the Dutchmen, and you can
check out the Croats. For example, a so-called 'co-ordinator of peace
embassies for ex-Yu' - Mient Jan Faber - was a board member of Pax
Christi, and now he comes to make peace on the Balkans. What they do under
the cover of educating the Bosnians for democracy is - recruit
future activists!  (...)<P>


<h2>Power and Money</h2>

<strong> You are a sharp talker. Aren't you a little paranoid when
you see the tentacles of NGOs all around you?</strong><P>

 Let's be logical. Many of these activists are honest people. But,
'a concern for the environment' turns in no time into 'a fight for free
media' and that's not a subject which can be discussed at the level
of petitions and demonstrations. In Holland a petition was signed
against media misuse and a new law on media, before the law was even
discussed in the Croatian parliament. The people who are pulling the
strings present the situation worse than it is in order to make
themselves look important and to gain attention. It is the nature of
these NGOs to work on a principle 'one for all - all for one'. So, the
greens are quick to join forces with anti-war organizations and
different 'human rights fighters'.<P>

<strong> But, why are they doing all this if your hypothesis is
correct?</strong><P>

 The reason is - money and power - the driving force behind
every kind of politics. You can see that the greens, the Labour, the
Socialists and similar parties have the majority in the European
Parliament. They are the political representatives of these NGOs.
There are clear political goals behind the 'struggle for human
rights'. They will ask for the same criteria for aggressors and
victims in ex-Yu [regarding the war crimes], but not so if they talk 
about 'liberation movements' which they portray as the essence of 
ethics and justice. 
Everyone knows that Mandela's ANC has committed serious crimes,
not only against its opponents, but also against its members.
You'll never hear a word about that!  Or, for example, Burmese
liberation movement has recently massacred twenty or so of
its prisoners, without a trial or any legal procedure.  But this
is never mentioned.  Filipino movement NDF has also committed
crimes, but you cannot read about this!  They [the NGOs] have simply
assumed the right to judge who is right and who is wrong;  if you
dare question their "truths" you'll come under an orchestrated attack
by their press.  Unless something worse happens to you.<P>



<h2>Message to the Croatian Public</h2>

<strong> Why are you telling all this to the Croatian public?</strong><P>

 Because Croatia is at the top of their priorities at the
moment. They don't like the state which refuses to play their
game. They treat Croatia as an African country while every normal
person can see that Croatia is an European country. They claim to
favour equality, but they want to control all media and intellectuals,
and try to provoke your government to make a rash move.
Unfortunately your government does this from time to time, and that is
just what they want. They blow incidents up to enormous proportions.
Just see how they turn president Tudjman into a fascist over night; and
he was fighting in an anti-fascist movement during the WW2! They want
 to push the government into defensive,  to force it
to make a stupid move. And, unfortunately, it works sometimes. My
advise to the Croatian government is to be more on the offensive, to push the
NGOs into defensive. I repeat:  there are many honest people active
in NGOs, but we must be aware of those who are pulling the strings
behind the scene. The intelligence communities in the West know how
many KGB agents were active within NGOs! All of us who watch their
activities closely know why our churches are deserted - people are fed
up with a church being used as a platform for political tirades about
Rwanda, Nicaragua, Salvador. People go to church for something else
but the NGOs see it as a place for political manipulations.
Just imagine how far they are prepared to go: in the Netherlands,
there are so called Third World Shops, which are supposedly trying
to undermine the monopoly of the large companies over the coffee,
spices and tea market.  However, whenever you visit those shops,
they will ask you to sign a petition, for human rights in Liberia,
aid to Burma, for freedom of press in Croatia etc.<P>

<strong> You're giving an interview, your photo will be in the papers -
aren't you afraid of these 'power-people-in-the-shadows' as you call
them?</strong><P>

They have been following me for a long time, and they tried to
shut me up. They even accused me of stealing discarded documents from
their offices!(...)<P>                                      

<strong> What to say at the end except that you are very sharp?</strong><P>

 That I am right! I don't call these activists 'activists'
but 'antivists'! They are always 'anti', against, but their
bosses know very well how to fight for - themselves.<P>

<h1>IMPORTANT STEPS IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGREEMENT</h1>

<strong><em>by Marinko Boboanovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vjesnik, Zagreb, Croatia, 05/23/96</h2>


Zagreb, 22 May. " We are satisfied with the fact that the
elections shall be held in Mostar as envisaged or at least
within the envisaged time frame. The talks regarding placing
controls on weaponry shall soon be concluded and the
decision regarding general elections is also expected soon.
This is one on the vital steps in the implementation of the
Dayton agreements and also one of the steps towards the
resolution of the problem of Bosnia Herzegovina," said the
Assistant Secretary of State of the United States for
European and Canadian Affairs, Mr John Kornblum, following
his talks with the President of the Republic of Croatia, Dr
Franjo Tudman. The visit of Secretary Kornblum to Zagreb,
and prior to that to Belgrade, according to his words, arose
because of the development on new events including the
unclear political situation in the "Republika Srpska".<P>

This is, according to Kornblum "in fact only one in a series
of visits for the purpose of which is the implementation of
the Dayton agreements, setting up a dialogue process, the
identification of problems and their joint resolution, prior
to there becoming crises," said Kornblem. He repeated the
United States' commitment to the implementation of the
Dayton agreements. In particular he emphasised the
importance that all sides fulfil their obligations so that
"all sides can make use of the advantages that the
Agreements bring".<P>

According to the Croatian Minister for Foreign Affairs  Dr
Mate Granic, who participated in the talks between President
Tudman and Secretary Kornblum mentioned also the
implementation of the agreement regarding the peaceful
reintegration of eastern Slavonija and generally Croatian-
American relations. "The joint conclusion was that the
process of the peaceful reintegration of eastern Slavonija
is progressing well and that it will be a success", said Dr
Granic.<P>

"Mr Kornblum informed us of all steps being taken by the US
Administration to resolve the unclear situation with the
"Republika Srpska" and Karadzic," added Dr Granic. He
emphasised that the United States and Croatia are making
joint efforts to strengthen the Federation and that the most
recent step related to that was taken in Washington at the
Federation Forum which had very concrete results.<P>

Dr Granic announced that an American business delegation
headed by Assistant Secretary Mr Kantor shall soon visit
Croatia and added that another important delegation is
already in Croatia. The conclusion was that relations
between the two countries are "developing well and are on an
ascending course" said Dr Granic.<P>

<h1>CROATIA CANNOT BE A PART OF THE BALKANS</h1>

<em><strong>A. Hauswitschka</em></strong><P>

<h2> Vjesnik, Zagreb, Croatia, 5/24/96, page 5.</h2>

Dubrovnik, 23 May - "South-eastern Europe in the 20th
Century" was the theme of the international symposium which
was organised by Hrvatska Matica Iseljenika (Croatian
Homeland Foundation) and the Croatian Information Centre,
which began on Wednesday at the `Lapad' hotel in Dubrovnik.
The symposium will continue till Saturday, consisting of 25
lectures, reports from Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia
Herzegovina, Great Britain, Bulgaria, Hungary, Switzerland,
Canada, United States, Belgium, Chile, Belja Tonovic will
speak about Croatians in Vojvodina and Doris Pack about the
future of the Former Yugoslavia.<P>

The symposium will bring forward all former aspirations of
the Croatian people. The aim is to point out that Croatia
does not form apart of the Balkans. The symposium was opened
by Mr Ante Beljo, president of Hrvatska Matica Iseljenika.
Mr Stjepan Cosic spoke about the history of Dubrovnik. Mr
Mladen Klemencic spoke about the political geography of
Croatia, Bosnia Herzegovina and South-eastern Europe and
emphasised that the name `South-eastern Europe' was a better
term for the region, and should replace the negative term
currently used, that is `Balkan'.<P>

In the 1994 edition of Encyclopaedia Britanica states that
the political region encompasses Albania, Romania, Slovenia,
Bosnia Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Greece, Bulgaria,
Moldavia, Serbia and Montenegro. For the people and
countries which are apart of this region, according to the
encyclopaedia "are incapable to mutually agree or work
together, there is a tendency for local authorities to
misuse power as soon as the central authority weakens, they
try to influence foreign powers, and accept with great
difficulty concepts which are brought about by another
political or community context". In short, being apart of
the Balkans means being apart of the backward part of
Europe.<P>

According to Mr Klemencic Croatia is of course very
frustrated with the fact that Croatia has never accepted
anything associated with Yugoslavia, but according to
Western European views we are apart of the Balkans. On
Wednesday Dr Tereza Ganza-Aras said that in relation to the
theme, "Dalmatia is between Italian Irredentism and Greater
serbianism."<P>

<h1>FOR CICAK AND BANAC THE WAR IS A 
CONSEQUENCE OF
A MISUNDERSTANDING</h1>

<em><strong>by Josip Vricko</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vjesnik(Zagreb), Croatia, Saturday, May 25 1996, Front page</h2>

<strong>THE MESSAGE THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO VICTIMS NOR 
VICTORS IS BEING SENT TO THE POTENTIAL PEACEMAKER-
PARTICIPANTS AT THE ROUND TABLE ABOUT THE SERBS IN 
CROATIA BY THE LEADING DUET OF  HUMAN RIGHTS 
DEFENDERS  IN THE NAME OF THE CROATIAN HELSINKI 
COMMITTEE</strong><P>

The Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights(HHO) -- 
admittedly not in complete coordination with the newly 
revampirized demands for autonomy in Eastern Slavonia -- is 
announcing a round table scheduled for 20-21 June under a 
somewhat poetic title  The Serbs in Croatia: Yesterday, Today 
and Tomorrow.   After the HHO, headed by I.Z.Cicak, who is 
specially known in this area, succeeded  in  defending  the so-
called Serb apartments in Croatia(while at the same time, the 
Croats, expelled by the Serbs, suffered in refugee camps), that is, 
after he took care of the Serb today, well, he is already thinking 
of the Serb tomorrow.  The Serb yesterday, or, in the HHO 
context, the Serb-Croat yesterday, is what Cicak-Banac, the 
already famous duet of defenders of Serb rights, is treating in a 
way that could be reduced, perhaps as their planned round 
table, to a (draft) title of  Bruddah, who done set us quarreling.<P> 

	And we were set quarreling, according to the HHO, by too 
soft a word.  That is, as the two signers of an invitation to some 
200 domestic and foreign invitees claim (when the Serb tomorrow 
is in question, nothing is too expensive), the lack of dialogue in 
the prior two Yugoslavias and the Independent State of Croatia 
led to war.  We hated each other for some seventy or so years 
and then, normally, according to Cicak and Banac, hatred 
escalated into war.  How often and and why during the said 
period the Serbs let grow (Chetnik) beards and put on  (Chetnik) 
fur hats is the question that the round table of Cicak and Banac 
will not take up.  And why should it when this war, (too), is a 
consequence of a misunderstanding, whose causes, the two of 
them say in unison, have not been removeb  by the quieting 
down of the war.   But, behold, in two days, the HHO will remove 
all misunderstandings.  There must not be any victims or victors 
is the message of the leading duet of human rights  defenders to 
the numerous (potential) peacemakers.  True, say they,  we shall 
also consider the sources of the conflict,  but this  also  already 
suggests that this will be en passant, while the  conflict,  that is 
the four-year Serb Chetniking in Croatia -- the only proper term 
for wat happened, will not be mentioned at Cicak s and Banac s 
(round) table.  There is no aggression, there are no (Croata) 
victims, let us reconcile ourselves, so that we might live happily 
until the end of our lives, Really,  bruddah, who done set us 
quarreling!? <P>

	The HHO people, of course, have the answer.  The 
nationalist leaders are guilty, and all because, they claim,  to 
open the possibility of creating nationally homogeneous states 
and ethnic cleansing.   Therefore, Cicak and Banac remind us, 
before they definitely reconcile us with the Serbs, both Franjo 
Tudjman and Slobodan Milosevic are guilty.  The duet with olive 
branches, however, is inviting only one of the accused, Dr. 
Tudjman, but not Comrade Milosevic.  He will probably be 
represented, according to the scenario of the HHO, by Aleksa 
Djilas, a particularly agreeable person for this sort of so-called 
peace meetings, or, perhaps, by General Djoko Jovanic -- this 
time, unlike in the good old days without Jovanka Budisavljevic 
Broz, who, too (it is surprizing the Cicak and Banac overlooked 
this), these days expresses a wish to make peace with the Croats.<P>

<h1>Diplomats are celebrating the Agreement although Croats have yet to
return home</h1>

<strong><em>by Kresimir Kopcic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vjesnik, November 14, 1996</h2>   

    Five Ambassadors of the Contact Group member-countries along with the
former UN peace envoy, Thorvald Stoltenberg, visited the area under UNTAES
supervision on Tuesday. 
They wanted to see for themselves that the agreement on Slavonija, Baranja
and Western Srijem is being implemented.  Exactly a year after the agreement
was signed between Croatia and local Serbs leaders, the countries that
witnessed the event wanted to make sure that reintegration process was proceeding 
as agreed.<P>

     The agreement was signed after months of
negotiations between the local Serbs from the Danube Valley region and
Zagreb.  The final agreement has 14 points some which are a possibility to prolong the
UN mandate for 12 months, the return of refugees, setting up of the police
forces, the return of belongings that were illegally confiscated, the
local elections...<P>
    True, no-one can claim that the
implementation is not a difficult process and that all the items have been
realised.  The return of Croatian refugees to their homes is still
unresolved.  According to information presented during a short briefing at
the UNTAES Headquarters of the Jordanian Battalion, located in the village
of Djeletovci, there are currently around 30 thousand people living in the
UNTAES-supervised region, among whom 96% are Serbian and 3.6% Croatian.<P>

    Diplomats and other distinguished guests gathered at the Yellow House to celebrate 
the anniversary of the agreement 
that "brought peace and the stability to Croatia and the region".  
    During their tour Galbraith, Stoltenberg and the diplomats saw only the
things they wanted to see.  They rushed by bus through villages in
which the rebuilding has begun.  In the village of Nijemci, that has
recently returned under the jurisdiction of the Croatian authorities, the delegation stopped to
talk to a Serbian woman who owns the local inn, located exactly across the
street from the destroyed Roman Catholic [Croatian] church of St. Catherine, 
and suddenly the woman, Mrs. Jovanka Jovanovic, became a "spokeswoman" 
for all Serbs.  Although the Head of
the Nijemci Administration, Ivica Klem, was standing right there he wasn't
asked a single question.<P>

    While in Vukovar, the convoy stopped in front of the building which 
houses the office which issues Croatian documents.  Approximately a hundred
people were waiting in the line, and from the brief conversations, we found
out that they were mostly people who left Tusilovic, Knin and Petrinja
during the "Storm 95" operation.  These Croatian documents are essential
for them to return to their homes although it is uncertain when this will actually occur.<P>
In Vukovar, they found accommodation in damaged houses, but they said
that they didn't feel right there and wanted to go home.

    According to UNTAES information sources, approximately twenty thousand
people of Serbian nationality applied for Croatian documents.  The
delegation discussed the implications of this with office administrators and
with the people who submitted their applications.  The number of Serbs from
Vukovar who applied for the documents is very small and the majority of applicants
are Serbs from other parts of Croatia.<P>

    The Jordanian and Belgian UNTAES Battalion celebrated the anniversary with a 
festive
gathering.  General Jaques Klein reminded the numerous guests of the fact
that , so far, offices for issuing Croatian documents have been opened,
[ethnically] mixed police forces have been established, the zone is demilitarised, the
area has established communication with the rest of Croatia, and that for the Day of Dead
the area was visited by more than 5,000 people from Croatia.<P>

    "Give peace a chance", said Klein in Croatian and he added that for the
successful reintegration, co-operation on both sides is required.  Thorvald
Stoltenberg couldn't hide his happiness: "Today is like springtime, and a
year ago it was winter.  Same with the agreement.  If someone asked me a
year ago what I expected, I wouldn't say this much.  I am pleased with the
systematic approach to the implementation of the agreement."
    Vojislav Stanimirovic, president of the local Serbian government, was
presented with the framed copy of the Erdut Agreement.  Representatives of the Croatian
Governments' office for relations with UNTAES were only rewarded with few good
words.  None of them, though, was given a chance to address the present 
journalists and diplomats.  Perhaps because of the fear that they would speak 
about the implementation of the Erdut agreement with far less enthusiasm than
the present diplomats.<P>

<h1>Yugoslav Partisans Were Afraid of the Black Legion Even After the End of the Second World War</h1>

<h3>Interview with Drago Jedvaic, a former Ustasha and a member of the Black Legion</h3>

<h2>by Vjekoslav Pelko, Zora, Zagreb, Croatia, 9/7 1995</h3>

Dragutin Jedvaic was born on February 20, 1920, in Ervenik near <a HREF="http://www.acs.supernet.net/maps/010.htm">Zlatar</a> [a small town northwest from Zagreb].  He is an ordinary man, a Croat with only six months of experience.  However, a conversation with this ordinary man sheds light on the destiny of the contemporary Croatian statehood.<P>

Dragutin Jedvaic is not the only example; there were thousands of them.  Many of them were not lucky enough to share with us the life in a free Croatian state.  It would be unjust not to point out, in this all encompassing reconciliation of the Croatian people, the merits of all those who have fought in the recent history for a Croatian state.  Drago Jedvaic is, without a doubt, one of them; he is s a representative of all those men who quietly carry out their duties, far from the spotlights, firmly, clearly and persistently.<P>

<strong>Mr. Jedvaic, tell us about the beginning of your war journey.</strong><P>

On 1/12, 1941, I joined the old Yugoslav Army and went to Valjevo [a city in Serbia].  The war started and we were sent to the border with Bulgaria.  On the way we were captured and sent to a camp in Kraljevo.  After several days in the camp we were released and sent home.<P>

Upon my return home, I received a draft notice and immediately reported for duty.  I was a member of the Varazdin artillery regiment.  Once that regiment was in full strength we went to Zagreb where we formed the 369th brigade of the Croatian legion.  After that, we went to Stockerau [in Austria] where we passed a three week artillery training, received war equipment and were sent to Russia.<P>

<strong>Were you part of a larger unit?  Who were your commanders?</strong><P>

We were a part of the 100th division of the Sixth Army.  Our brigade commander was colonel Marko Mesic and the commander of my unit was officer [nadsatnik] Marijan Prislin.<P>

<strong>How did you experience fighting in Russia?</strong><P>

After traveling by train through Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania we reached the Russian border where we got off.  From there, we advanced on foot for a month.  We would cover about thirty kilometers every day.  One evening, we reached Kharkov [in Ukraine].  The battle for Kharkov went through the night and in the morning our units entered the city.  We heard over the phone that our fire threw the Russians out of their trenches...<P>

Later, we were moved from one part of the front to another, according to where the situation was the most difficult.  The Russians used to say that they would keep a certain defense position until "the devils" arrived.  That's how our division got its name, "The Devils".<P>

<strong>What was the reaction of people in the places through which you passed on your way?</strong><P>

Russian citizens welcomed us because they were happy to be liberated from communism.  As soon as we entered a village or a town, they would bring out the icons from their cellars.  Looting and maltreatment of civilians was strictly forbidden.  One one occasion, soldiers who had raped three women were sentenced to death.  We were not permitted to take things or food from the people unless they were given to us as gifts.  I noticed that Russians liked to smoke; hence we gave out cigarettes to older people, cans of food and bread to women and chocolates and candy to children.<P>

<strong>How and when did your Russian war journey end?</strong><P>

It ended in Stalingrad.  Heaven and earth were in flames there.  Stalingrad is located on both banks of the river Volga.  We were on one side and Russians on the other.  The plan was to attack the other bank in the Spring of 1943.  However, the Russians counterattacked and broke through the defensive lines on our left flank where the Italians were stationed.  The winter came.  Food and ammunition were dropped from the air.  At one point we ran out of food and ammunition.  We had to kill our horses and eat horse meat.  The Sixth Army, which had 360,000 people at the start of the attack on Russia was captured there.<P>

<strong>You weren't captured at Stalingrad, but were rescued because you had been wounded.  How did that happen?</strong><P>

A bunker, in which I was, was hit.  It was built from wood and stones and the whole construction collapsed on top of us.  There were five wounded.  As those who survived Russian prisoner of war camps later told me, I had been placed on the last flight from Stalingrad.  I was wounded in the head and a leg.  I stayed in a field hospital for two days and was later transported by train to Kiev.  In Kiev I stayed in a hospital for 52 days, was given a three months leave and went beck to Stockerau.<P>

<strong>Where did you go from Austria once your recovery was complete?</strong><P>

I was sent to Bosnia to join the same division.  I fought in Bosnia since the Spring of 1943 until the Fall of 1944 when <a HREF="http://www.acs.supernet.net/maps/077.htm">Tuzla</a> fell.  After the loss of Tuzla I went home for 10 days where I was allocated to the <a HREF="http://cypress.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~eesrdan/ndh/ndh-INDEX.html">Ustashe</a> unit [bojna] in Zlatar.<P>

<strong>Can you describe the battle for Tuzla?</strong><P>

My artillery unit was guarding the German command in the very center of the city.  The partisans attacked Tuzla on 10/27.  The city was defended by domobrans [Ustashe were elite Croatian fascist troops, similar to SS troops in the Nazi Germany, while domobrans were the regular army, sort of like the regular German army]; their defense lines disintegrated after a while and the Partisans entered the city.  We resisted for three days and three nights until we ran out of ammunition.  The fighting was so fierce that I was wounded by a shrapnel from my own grenade.<P>

Actually, we were aiming at a point very close to us, approximately thirty meters away.  My assistant fired by mistake and the shrapnel hit me in the back.  Once we ran out of ammunition, we disabled the gun and tried to break out through the Partisan lines. We stumbled upon a bunker which the partisans had taken from the domobrans and were scattered by fire.  Myself and another two men were caught there and taken to the prison in Tuzla.  They took our uniforms away, gave us old civilian clothes and promised that we would get new uniforms in three days and be sent to a partisan unit.<P>

However, two days later, the Germans came to our rescue from the direction of Kreka.  They were bombarding the city and hit the ammunition dump which was two buildings away from the jail...<P>

The four of us managed to escape in the ensuing panic.  We reached the Germans.  Since I was wounded and not fit to fight they put me on an armored train and sent to Doboj.<P>

<strong>Later, you took part in the defense of Zlatar.  As far as I know, the partisans never captured Zlatar but, because they couldn't capture it, simply went around it.  This happened close to the end of war.  Could you describe those events?</strong><P>

I was in charge of an anti-aircraft gun there.  I commanded a unit of soldiers whom I had chosen personally.  The Partisans tried to enter Zlatar twice.  They suffered heavy losses both times, gave up and withdrew.<P>

Zlatar remained in our hands until <a HREF="http://cypress.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~eesrdan/ndh/ndh-kojeko.html">Poglavnik</a> [Ustashe leader, Ante Pavelic] announced that Zagreb was an open city.  Then, we started pulling back toward the Austrian border.  I avoided Bleiburg [Croatian, Slovenian and Serb quisling troops surrendered in Bleiburg, just across the Austrian border, to the British troops.  Most of them were put on trains and sent back over the border to the Partisans.  According to the Ustashe sources (Ante Pavelic managed to escape and rebuild his organization in Franco's Spain and Argentina) most of them, men and women, were later executed by the Partisans] because I was lucky to be too late.  Then I started fleeing back toward Zagreb.  On the way, I was captured and taken to  the Canal Camp in Zagreb.  I was kept there for a while and then transferred to a camp in Precko.<P>

After a while, they separated about 30,000 of us and that is how our Calvary [Krizni Put] started.  Our group moved along the way towards Bjelovar, Virovitica, all the way to Pozega.  We stayed in Pozega for a while.  In the meantime typhoid and dysentery were spreading among the prisoners. One day, they sent the remaining prisoners via Ludberg to Varazdin.  In Varazdin they separated us according to whether we had served with the Ustashe, police or domobrans.  Fortunately, I ended up with the domobrans and stayed alive.<P>

<strong>Since you were in an Ustashe unit, how did you end up among domobrans?</strong><P>

I saw that they were treating domobrans better than the <a HREF="http://cypress.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~eesrdan/ndh/ndh-INDEX.html">Ustashe</a> and police.  In that commotion, I crossed over to the domobrans.  In Varazdin, they were taking police and Ustashe to the river Drava bridge where they would be executed.  I was later assigned to a working brigade. We were taken to Dvor na Uni where we worked in the woods until 11/16 when we were released.<P>

<strong>Where exactly was your position in Zlatar?</strong><P>

My bunker was in front of the church in Zlatar.  I forgot to mention this: when we were captured on our return from the Austrian border, they told us that they can not let us go home because the Black Legion [infamous Ustashe unit] was still in Zlatar and they killed all deserters.  Of course, we didn't tell them that we were that Black Legion.<P>

<strong>The war ended, you came back from Bosnia and tried to find an employment...</strong><P>

I tried to find work in the "Poljanica" mine.  They gave me a job and I started working on 1/1 1946 until 6/30 1946.  Then I received a draft notice and was supposed to report for my 18 months mandatory military service.  Instead, I ended up in jail accused of conspiring with Krizari [I think they were a nationalist Croatian political organization between the two world wars].<P>

<strong>Did you really cooperate with Krizari?</strong><P>

One evening, Stanko Simunic came for a visit.  He had already been accused of cooperating with Krizari and was hiding because of that.  He had enough of sleeping in other people's stables, so he went beck to his own stable.  Someone saw him there and informed the military.  They surrounded the stable, Simunic was wounded and taken to Belec; Partisan headquarters and jail were in Belec.  Simunic was interrogated there and killed in the end.<P>

During the interrogation, he mentioned my name.  Consequently OZNA [secret police immediately after the war] took me to Varazdin, where I was sentenced to seven years in jail.  In addition to that, I lost my political and citizen rights for another three years.  I served my sentence in the jail in Stara Gradiska.<P>

<strong>When did you come back home from jail? How did you restart your life after all these years?</strong><P>

Because of an amnesty, I only spent four years in Stara Gradiska.  I finally came back home exactly 10 years after leaving to serve in the old Yugoslav Army, on 1/12 1951.  I was at home until 5/5 1951 when I again received a draft notice.  My mandatory military service was completed on 11/5 1952 and I finally started ordinary family life at home.  I couldn't find a job for three years because of the loss of my citizen rights.<P>

<strong>You failed to find employment later? How did you survive?</strong><P>

The mines had closed.  There were no other possibilities for employment in the area, so I returned to agriculture.  During those three years I was under the surveillance of the authorities, so they gave me different duties: I was the president of the committee for the electrification of my area, commander of the volunteer firemen society for Ervenik and Opasenjak and in the committee for the building of the road Zlatar-Bistrica-Opasenjak-Ervenik;  all this in order to check whether I had been rehabilitated, in order to prove that I was worthy of having the same rights as other citizens.<P>

<h1>Reply to Partisan Ivan Fumic</h1>

<strong>reprinted from <em>Vjesnik</em></strong><P>

<strong><em>by Velimir Bujanec, politics major and public relations officer of the Croatian Liberation Movement</em></strong><P>

<h2><a HREF="/info/students/marko/globus2.html">Nezavisna Drzava Hrvatska</a>, Zagreb, Croatia, March 1996</h2>

Croatian political daily published on Saturday, January 13, in the readers response column, reaction of gentleman-comrade <strong>Ivan Fumic</strong>, a man who gives himself a title of the "President of the Association of the Antifascist fighters of Croatia."  Obviously, Mr. Fumic forgot to put the word "Socialist" in front of "Republic Croatia" in his letter, a word which has  proudly adorned his organization during the past decades.  The mentioned letter, by the way totally unfounded, was given an interesting title ("To build the future, but with the awareness of the past"), which is the only part of the text I can agree with, since when I think about the Communists, the first thing that comes to mind is their intransigency, and after that their ignorance; consequently it is obvious that the future cannot be built by partisan ignoramuses but only by someone else.<P>

I am not surprised that the aforementioned gentlemen wants to deny me a right to publish my articles on the pages of <em>Vjesnik</em>, but Fumic has forgotten that this <em>Vjesnik</em> is not the old "red" <strong><em>Vjesnik</em></strong> which was controlled by bolseviks and the Belgrade servants; consequently that wish of his, as well as other desperate pleas for the return of Yugo-communist practice in the Croatian media space will not receive a positive reply.  True, I myself am also not happy with the personnel policy in quite a few media outlets, and put my hope in the future in which the communist elements and their deformed character will be pushed away from the political scene.<P>

The law about information policy is the one which in this case enables me to respond, and the hope for a ban expressed by the "antifascist" to whom I address this letter is only one among many proofs that the communists do not respect the rule of law and have a hard time with the changes which happened in 1990; it also demonstrates that deep in their rotten souls one can still find nostalgia for something obsolete.<P>

The boss of the remnants of the partisan groups in Croatia which have been lately springing up in Zagreb and elsewhere in Croatia probably studied history from partisan history books; consequently I'm not surprised that in his stupidity he wants to sell his huge ignorance for mine.  I am not writing this reply because of various "Fumic's" who are anyway leaving the scene (together with various communist plaques and war memorials [most of memorials to the World War II victims and antifascist fighters have been dismantled or destroyed]) but also because of Croatian patriots from the time of the <strong>Independent State of Croatia </strong>[<a HREF="http://www.VisionInc.com/YU/Rat/atlas/atlas-index.html">NDH</a>, Croatian fascist puppet state during World War II] who deserve every respect instead of slander like that expressed in the letter of the "antifascist President".  In the same manner, Fumic would spit on todays Croatian bojovniks [warriors] had not the Croatian state, God forbid, survived.  I want to ask Fumic why he was silent in <strong>1991 and '92</strong> and why he didn't dare write similar offenses on the expense of <strong>NDH, Poglavnik [Ustashe leader, roughly corresponds to Nazi title fuhrer], and Ustashe movement</strong> on the pages of the Croatian press during the Serbo-chetnik aggression against Croatia?  At that time, the supporters of communist tyranny were silent in their fear and waited with excitement to see if the Serb aggression would succeed and whether their "Yugoslavia" would come back.  Taking into account that their wishes didn't come through, they skillfully transformed themselves into so called "Croatian antifascists" and under that name they today promote their activities against the Croat People and especially Croat nationalists.<P>

Every normal person understands that the Partisan bandits who rose in <strong>1941</strong> against the will of the Croatian people who greeted with [happy] tears in eyes the fall of "Yugoslavia" and the establishment of NDH, were Yugoslav criminals.  Their groups were made mostly of Serbs and Croat scum and before <strong>1943</strong> they hardly carried out any significant military actions but were preoccupied with small scale looting, ambushes, rapes and other dishonorable and dirty deeds.  None of those outlaws, especially those who today appear in the Croatian media, even considered the idea of the independent and free Croatia; one cannot consider some meeting which took place in a forest (ZAVNOH [partisan conference at which the "foundations of post-war Croatia" were established]) to be the start of the life of the Croatian independent state, when in history that shameful ZAVNOH is subordinate to AVNOJ [partisan conference which made the decision about federal structure of the post-war communist Yugoslav state], which is the embodiment of everything for which the Croatian traitors fought.<P>

In the Independent State of Croatia, nobody suffered unless he or she was the enemy of the state.  That means that in <a HREF="http://sunset.backbone.olemiss.edu/~mirjana/rat/jasenovac/jasenovac-INDEX.html"><strong>Jasenovac</strong></a> and even in Jadovno [Ustashe run concentration camps] the inmates were mostly the enemies of the state and criminals.  I don't deny the fact that <strong>NDH</strong> was an <strong>ally of Germany, Italy and Japan</strong> at the time [during World War II], but I also want to emphasize that it is questionable whether the NDH leadership had a choice when one knows that other states were openly supporting the re-establishment of "Yugoslavia".  The state [NDH] was in war and had its allies and this is a question about which history, only after a revision, can give its final judgment.  Ivan Fumic doesn't understand that process and nobody expects him to do so, but I ask from him to carefully think before he puts his stupidities on paper in the future.<P>

Partisan outlaws managed to re-establish the horrendous yugo-entity with their crimes and collaboration with the Chetniks of <a HREF="http://www.igc.apc.org/balkans/draza.html"><strong>Draza Mihajlovic</strong></a> [Chetniks were a Serb royalist resistance army; for a brief time in 1941 they fought with Partisans against Germans; however, soon afterwards, the uprising in Serbia was crushed and, since then, the Chetniks had sporadically fought against and collaborated with Germans, Italians and Ustashe and waged a bloody civil war against Partisans]; its foundations were built on the bones of hundreds of thousands of Croats.  After the most recent destruction of Yugoslavia and establishment of the independent Croatia, the conditions are finally ripe to bring to justice all those Yugo-butchers whose arms are covered with Croatian blood all the way to their elbows.  Only after the trial to still living communist criminals (which is also the practice in other post-communist countries) it is possible to consider gradual reconciliation.  Because the victim has to be the one to extend the hand of reconciliation, and not the criminal, although this is not happening in Croatia, although I can say that Fumic is right when he says that I am against that sort of reconciliation.<P>

Finally, Mr. Fumic, <a HREF="http://cypress.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~eesrdan/ndh/ndh-INDEX.html">Ustashe </a> Movement was a national liberation movement which wasn't fascist but only Croatian and nationalist.  In <strong>1991</strong> in <strong>Patriotic War</strong> Croatian young men proudly displayed on their uniforms Ustashe insignia, because <strong><em>"U"</em></strong> [Ustashe equivalent of swastika] in Croatia stands for freedom, happiness and wellbeing.  While entering the villages which we liberated from the Serb aggressor we sang <strong>"Evo zore, evo dana..."</strong>, [Ustashe song celebrating WWII war criminals Francetic and Boban] and I want to ask whether that is "fascism".  Still, Fumic has no way of knowing that, because he hasn't seen the front in the 90's, and in the previous war he was on the other side, among "comrades".

With respect,<P>

<title>ECE3473: Parallel Architectures for Signal Processing</title>
<h2>ECE3473: Parallel Architectures for Signal Processing</h2>

THIS PAGE IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION!! <br>

<p>
<h3> Course Essentials </h3>
<ul>
<li> Course offered by <a href="../manolakos.html"> Prof. Elias S. 
Manolakos </a> during the Fall 1995 Quarter.
<li> Class Meets every T,Th 11:40-1:20pm, 109 Robinson Hall,
	 starting on 9/26/95.
<li> Broadcasted thru Network Northeastern (NNU), Channel 2.
<li> Office Hours: TBA.
<li> To Register please call NNU at (617)-373-5620.
<p>
<li> <a href="./ece3473/sch.ps"> Course Syllabus </a> [Postcript 61K]
</ul>

<h3> Course Overview </h3>
This introductory graduate level Network Northeastern course deals with 
how the <i>  concurrency </i>  inherently present 
in signal/image processing algorithms can be
exploited for high performance in <i>massively parallel</i>
computers, as well as <i>application specific VLSI
architectures</i>. First we introduce the basics 
including models of parallel computation, regular grid processor
topologies, message routing mechanisms, communication primitives,
performance and scalability evaluation methods.
Then we discuss how a sequential algorithm can be 
transformed <i>systematically</i> into an application specific
array processor or embedded into a general purpose 
massively parallel machine. Many examples of  <i>numerical
linear algebra</i> often encountered in signal/image processing, are used to 
highlight the key issues.
Specific DSP algorithms such as the FFT, linear system solvers,
transitive closure, higher order spectral estimators, discrete wavelet 
transform, are studied and parallel processing implementations are derived. 
Time permitting, neural networks are
introduced as an emerging  computational tool and their implementation
using VLSI architectures is discussed.

<p>


<h3>  Preparation </h3>
The course is self-contained and <i> has no graduate course 
prerequisites </i>. 
It is directed towards both graduate students of the ECE Dept. 
and  other disciplines (such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics)
as well as any practicing engineers/scientists interested to learn more
about <i> high performance signal processing </i> and scientific
computing. Knowledge of Linear Systems Theory, Computer Architecture and 
High Level Language Programming at a mature undergraduate level is 
assumed.

<p>
<h3> Reading Material </h3>
<ul>
<li> <b> Textbook: 
<a  href= "ftp://bc.aw.com/bc/authors/kumar/paracomp/"> Introduction to 
Parallel Computing </a> </b>, (required)
by V. Kumar, A. Grama, A. Gupta, G. Karypis, Benjamin/Cummings Publ., 1994.

<p>
<li>
<b> Class Packets: </b> (required). 
Will be made available at <i> Gnomon Copies </i>
(just across the street on Huntington Ave.). Network students
after registration should make arrangements with NNU in order to receive these
packets. They contain additional reading material to supplement
the Textbook and help you with the computer assignments.
Packet #1 will be available the first day of classes.
</ul>


<h3> Computer Assignments </h3>
Each student will be  provided with a computer account on the Sparc/Unix host
of a <b> Meiko Sc. Computing Surface </b> (CS-1400) multiprocessor system.
The CS-1400 is a multi-user Transputer (T-800) based MIMD machine with 
currently 20 processors (4Mb/T-800). It can be accessed
from the Internet or directly via  modem from any remote terminal/PC/MAC.

<p>
We will teach you how to develop code  that runs 
efficiently on a distributed memory, message-passing 
parallel processing system. Two simple computer assignments will be
used first to gradually introduce you to parallel programming.
During the second half of the course each student
should carry out a <i> term project </i>.
You can do what I assign or better 
pick your favorite DSP algorithm, study the parallel
processing schemes proposed for it in the literature, select one of them or
propose a new one and implement it on the CS-1400. In the
past such projects have been the starting point of graduate theses work
and papers presented to conferences.
Group projects (2 students) are acceptable if the amount
of work involved is substantial. 
A report (in the form of a technical paper) summarizing 
the results of the term project is due the last class meeting.




<h3> Grading Scheme </h3>
Homeworks (4-5 sets): 20%, Projects: 25%,  Midterm Exam: 25%,

<title>Graduate Power System Education at Northeastern University</title>

<h1>Graduate Power System Education at Northeastern University</h1>
<hr>

Guiding principles behind power system education at Northeastern University
 include the following:
<ul>
<li> The main emphasis in our graduate courses is on the development of
        thorough understanding of power system phenomena  on both the
        physical
       and the  analytical level.
<li>Realizing the importance of team-work in modern and future utilities 
       our goal is to make   students  capable of communicating with 
       co-workers in other specialties, with equipment manufacturers and with  
       service providers.  Our curriculum is sufficiently broad
       to include  solid foundations in system theory, control,
       digital signal processing, communication and engineering
       mathematics. We insist on a detailed understanding of  important
       problems in these  areas, as a superficial  acquaintance
       with  topics can not prepare students for independent and creative
       decision
       making.
<li>  With the ever increasing importance of computing facilities in power
       systems, it is no longer enough to study the analytical impact of 
       computers in a few dedicated courses. We  integrate computer based
        methodologies in all our courses,  and rely on excellent computing
      facilities available in the Electrical and Computer Engineering
       Department to support  our educational agenda.
<li>  Given the increasing role of analytical software in power engineering
       operation,  our courses will utilize both 
       professional packages, and tools
       that offer efficient  instruction.  
       Software packages used in the curriculum  include 
       EPRI programs (EMTP, EMSTP, SSSP, IPFLOW, VSTAB etc.) 
       that our students are likely
       to use in their professional activities. For easy prototyping and 
       classroom case studies we plan to use software that has been proven in
       educational tasks (e.g. Matlab, Maple), as well as 
       production grade tools (Saber).   
<li>  One of the  goals of the MS program is to quickly 
           compensate for possible deficiencies in
        power system undergraduate education (e.g 
       in-depth  study of symmetric components and power apparatus
        modeling).
</ul>

<h2>Coursework</h2>

In this section we list graduate power engineering courses
sorted according to the requirements of the MS curriculum.
In the MS program we plan for a total of 
44 quarter-hours (QH), 
thus making the course load between 9 and 11
courses (4 QH each).
PhD students are expected to take additional courses outside their areas
of concentration.

<h1>Europe Ends on the Drina River</h1>
<FONT SIZE="+1">
<em>by Ivan Kristic</em>, TRN, Tomslavgrad, Herceg-Bosna, 9/12/95<P>

When the current state of things and the historic truth meet each other in the wastelands of the historic reality, almost without an exception, the truth is set aside and current state of things taken into account, no matter how unjust it might be and without regard to the evil methods which were used to achieve it.  This is obvious today, in the search for the peaceful solution of the Bosnian crisis.<P>

<h2>The River Drina - Line Between Catholicism and Orthodoxy</h2>

Is there anyone with a trace of education who doesn't know that the river Drina has for eons been the border between two worlds?  Emperor Theodossius divided in year 379 Roman Empire into two halves, the Eastern and the Western one;  the Drina was the line of division and it remained the border for centuries.  When in 1054, a schism occured in the Christian church, the Drina was again the border between Catholics and the Orthodox.  It remained like this until the Turkish penetration and the spreading of the Ottoman Empire to our territories.  The Turks moved this border to the west; the Orthodox moved in front of them, and later with them, to the west.  All those who finished primary school and attended a history class on which the history of the Vojna Krajina was taught, know well  how the Austro-Hungarian Empire received and used the Orthodox.  Serbs, therefore, crossed the Drina in the medieval times, sometimes fleeing the Turks and sometimes as their loyal servants.  When the Versailles Yugoslavia was formed in 1918, and Serbia as a state, admittedly under Yugoslav sign-board - Serb politicians always thought of Yugoslavia as of greater Serbia, which it, in fact, always has been - crossed the Drina.  The destruction of the first and second Yugoslavia is already history, as well as the Serb aggression against Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, initiated according to the plan from the memorandum [of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, SANU]; the plan for destruction of unfortunate Yugoslavia and formation of the phantom "greater Serbia".<P>

That is the history; the cruel reality of the present situation is Serbian occupation of eastern Slavonia and Baranja, a large part of Bosnia-Hercegovina and a total serbization of Vojvodina, which until 1918 has never been Serbian.  In order to complete the picture, it is necessary to add that the Serb hick-fascism has taken away the rights of the Albanian majority in Kosovo, which is colonized and where the terror of the Serbian police-death-squads rules; the situation in Sandzak, where Muslims are the majority, is similar.  Every peace initiative, unfortunately, must start with the reality and that is, as a starting point, almost the central premise.  Historic truths are history and, after all, past, obsolete situations.<P>

<h2>NATO is Bombing Serbs in Order to Force Them to the Negotiating Table</h2>

The latest American negotiation initiative which is similar to the Contact Group plan, starts from the situation in the field and takes into account the present relations between the sides.  Although this plan is inconsistent and, as its name indicates, a peace initiative which is yet to be shaped into a peace proposal, it, to a large extent, takes into account results of Serb aggression and to the nation which was some 30% of the population in Bosnia gives almost half of the state.  Well, now pessimists or realists, call them whatever you like, are in their element and notice that Alija Izetbegovic, the leader of the majority people in Bosnia was responsible for fooling his people into believing that there would be no war, when even the pupils in the schools for retarded persons were convinced that the war was coming.  When the war started, while Croatia was burning and barehanded was resisting the chetnik invasion and an attempt to establish greater serbian border along the line Virovitica-Karlovac-Ogulin-Karlobag, while the serbochetnik hordes were destroying Ravno and Croatian townships in the south of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Izetbegovic was telling his people that that war was not theirs.  Of course, this was not only a political nearsightedness, but also a total blindness; today it is useless to expect from the world powers to wage a war against the Serbs, defeat them militarily and serve Bosnia-Hercegovina on the plate to Muslims, so that they can build a Jamahiria, i.e. an Islamic state, out of it.<P>

Action of NATO aircraft, as well as those of the rapid reaction force artillery,  against Bosnian Serbs' artillery, radar and anti-aircraft systems, should be understood as an attempt to bring Bosnian Serbs to the negotiating table and not, although the Muslim media and their propaganda try to portray it as such, as an attempt of the world powers to militarily defeat Serbs.  It is true that the Serbs best understand the language of force - Croatian operation Storm clearly showed that - but it is an undeniable truth that the world powers do not have an interest in starting a crusade against the Serbs and siding with the Muslims.  On the contrary, judging from the so far known details of the American peace initiative, the Americans still count on Serbs.  Serbia, actually, during this war didn't suffer from destruction on its territory;  not even a single window pane has been broken as a result of the war.  Economic sanctions, to tell the truth, have broken the backbone of the Serbian economy, but the Serbs were never good  businessmen, after all.  It seems, so far, that the Americans want to bring them to the negotiating table and give them a chance to defend through diplomacy majority of that which they have conquered and ethnically cleansed with aggression and the policy of the darkest genocide.<P>

<h2>How Can One Win Serbs Over..?!</h2>

Besides, it is unreasonable to forget that the United States of America are trying to bring Serbia out of the Russian sphere of influence and win it over to their side.
In view of this information, the trip of Slobodan Milosevic [Serbian president] to Moscow and his conversation with Boris Yeltsin, gets a new dimension and fits well with the serbian bluffing, armenian-like haggling, Balkan prostitution.  If we keep in mind that diplomacy is a follower of the oldest profession, Serbs are, therefore, engaging in diplomacy and want to sell themselves to the highest bidder.  In light of these facts, somewhat clearer become ostensible Serbian misunderstandings, alleged Milosevic's anger with Karadzic, clash between the hairy mountain monster from Durmitor [Karadzic] and the storm-trooper Mladic [Commander of Bosnian Serb Army].  Kaj god [whatever], as our Zagorci would say.  Well, all of them are players in the grotesque called "making of the greater Serbia."  The way things are now it is still not clear whether it will really be greater or somewhat less greater Serbia; whether the Americans will allow that those 49% of Bosnia-Hercegovina form a confederative link with Rumposlavia, or whether that possibility will be denied.  So far this is still unclear.  According to some informations, this will be allowed, which would be the beginning of the end of Bosnia-Hercegovina as a sovereign state.  If the Serbs are denied union with their mother Serbia, but allowed only cultural and other links, there is hope for Bosnia-Hercegovina, although it is slim and unconvincing.<P>

<h2>What We Can Do, and What We Will Be Allowed To Do</h2>

Some of those well acquainted with the American peace initiative say that the unfortunate Bosnia-Hercegovina should be a loose union made up from the Croatian-muslim federation and the Serb entity, with a well-known division of territory - 51% to the Muslim-Croat Federation and 49% to the Bosnian Serbs.  According to one version, the Federation would have a right to form a confederation with the Republic of Croatia and, according to another one it wouldn't.  Devil knows what is correct and what is the truth in that.  It is the fact that Croatian "representatives" are following Alija Izetbegovic from Paris to Ankara, treated as a united federal delegation; on the other hand, judging from the actions of the muslim authorities and their propaganda in the media, the hopes for the Federation, let alone the confederation, are slim.  However, if one tries to push aside verbal weed and tries to find a grain of truth in everything, it becomes obvious that the muslims are still lost in Bosnian fogs.  They are persistently fooling themselves with an illusion of a whole and unitary Bosnia under their domination; the likelihood of this outcome is zero.  The muslims don't have political influence, nor military strength to realize this, even if the war went on for another decade.  Nevertheless, everyone has a right for illusions, even the muslims.  After all, why would they be better than others!?<P>

Once we pose the important question, "where is the Croatian people and realization of Croatian interests in all this?", the answer contains the following elements:  Croatian Defense Council (HVO) now controls about 17% of the territory of Bosnia-Hercegovina, with chances to increase its part if the world powers do not stop liberation while the peace plan doesn't take its final shape, is accepted and signed.  Here, we refer to the historic Croatian territories of Jajce, Komusina and Bosanska Posavina and Trebinje as Dubrovnik's natural hinterland.  It is hard to say what will come out of it.  It depends, not only on what we can do, but also on what we will be allowed to do.  Fundamental in all this are the confidence in one's own strength, strengthening of Croatian unity and realization that united and strong are respected and weak pitied and then forgotten and despised.  We do not have ambitions to be a threat to someone, but we can insure the future respect.  By acting like this we can have a free Croatia and insure the equal rights and status of the Croatian people in Bosnia-Hercegovina, regardless whether it will be a union or something else.<P></FONT>

<h1> Warming and Cooling of the Federation</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Ivan Kristic<br>  TRN, 4/25/95, Tomislavgrad, HR Herceg-Bosna (Bosnia and Herzegovina)</i></h2><p>

<hr>

A year has passed since the start of the federation's [federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina] formation; however, the federation still hasn't been formed and it is not known when its formation will be completed.  Periods of optimistic encouragement and realistic arguments by the supporters of this political project are followed by the times of obstruction, disillusionment, mistrust and pessimistic realization that it [the federation] is dead project which will never amount to anything;  all that in spite of a consensus that the Washington agreement stopped unfortunate war between the Croats and the muslims who are in the latest terminology referred to as bosniacs.  That is actually the only concrete achievement in this period.  The transitional period for formation of the federation has been extended indefinitely, from the original six months.  Formally, this change was a concession to the Croats since their representative, the president of the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna (CRHB), Kresimir Zubak, kept the presidency [of the federation];  however it is questionable what he can be a president of, since none of the federation's institutions exist.<p>


<h2>Democracy of the Muslim Kind</h2> <P>

It could not have been formed [the federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina] because our political partners, the muslims, have obstructed its formation at every step, while accusing the Croats in the media of allegedly not supporting the federation. The proof for this is the session of the federation's parliament, which has not been convened nor will it be convened in a foreseeable future, although its work should have been completed long ago in order to set a stage for the formation of the federal government which, according to the Bonn agreement, should have started to function after 4/15 of this year.<p>

Being sincerely dedicated to the implementation of the agreements signed in the castle Petersburg near Bonn, although aware that the agreement is not in all aspects favorable for us, the Croatian side suggested to the muslim side that the party delegations of the Croatian Democratic Union in Bosnia and Herzegovina (CDUHBH) and the Party of Democratic Action (PDA) [ethnic Muslim party in Bosnia and Herzegovina], at a place and time set by the muslim side, define a program for the session of the federal parliament.  The muslims have never replied to this suggestion.  Then, the Croats suggested that, due to the ever stronger Serb attacks on Sarajevo, because of closed roads and impossible access to the city, let alone peaceful work and secure movement within the city, the session takes place in Novi Travnik where all the conditions are favorable: large hall, hotel in which the parliamentarians could stay, secure distance from the chetnik snipers and artillery.  It was also offered to use the Ministry of Internal Affairs of CRHB for security needs and to cover the expenses; however, the partners, un-partner-like but dictatorially and with ultimatums, demanded that the session take place in the federal capital [Sarajevo].  They don't like Novi Travnik - what cynicism!? - since, in the opinion of a "proven democrat" Edhem Bicakic, "human rights are not respected" there; in other words, the only political party active in Novi Travnik is the county organization of the CDUBH.  According to the logic of a well known prison mass, favorite  object of amusement for toughened and perverted criminals, wherever there are Croats there is no democracy, freedom and human rights, which are only present where mujahedeen shoot at Catholic churches, take off their crosses, force Croats out of their homes and establish mosques in those Croatian homes.  According to Bicakic that is democracy and a legal and secular state!?<p>

Although the Washington agreements - mentioned here in plural since they define relations of the Croats and the muslim-bosniacs in the federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the federation's confederal relations with the republic of Croatia, although muslims unbearably easily forget the latter - clearly stated that in the transitional period during the formation of the federation the military units of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council, the Bosnian Croat's army] and the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina should maintain their separate identities, to be merged in a single federal army in the future, the muslim authorities have recently, yet again, tried to make equal the HVO and the Serb occupying army.
Specifically, the government in Sarajevo has proposed the legislation regulating the procedures for extradition of accused war criminals to the court in the Hague; together with chetnik criminals they mention, as they say, the extremist faction of the HVO.  Even the most naive Croat knows that there are no more or less extreme factions in the army of the Croat people in Bosnia and Herzegovina, established to defend the Croat people and its rights.  Muslim fundamentalists would eagerly accuse the whole HVO of crimes and send it to the Hague and then turn Croats into raja [serfs] as during the Ottoman empire.  Fortunately, we have learned from history and we know that those without protection will be pitied and the strong ones who can protect themselves, will be respected.<p>

<h2> Croats are Good While They are Helping...</h2><p>

The example of the custom duties shows how well have the muslim politicians learned the lessons of hypocrisy from their Serb teachers.  They keep calling Herzeg-Bosna a para-state, still they have virtually recognized its existence.  In border territories, they have introduced customs duties on all goods which are shipped from the free Croatian territories to Bosnia.  Croatian suggestion, to use returnable deposits to discourage smuggling, was proclaimed to be illegal and contested in front of our friends Germans and other sponsors of the federation using flagrant lies and fabrications.  They [the Muslims] did not bother to apologize once the situation has been cleared up, and continue with the same practices.<p>

Even their so-called great military victories are nothing but pure propaganda.  They took almost a week to admit that the HVO made possible their victory on Vlasic with its artillery support.  On Majevica where that support was lacking, Serbs recovered all temporary lost positions inflicting great losses on the muslim army and additional destruction on the cities of Tuzla and Kalesija.  I am not mentioning this to make someone happy because of the Serb success;  I know the Serbs and I know what they want, but the muslims should be reminded how efficient they are without us.  However, they would build the federation with themselves only and, if at all possible, without the Croats.  And that won't work.
The Croats are for the federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but not for any federation, for the voluntary union of equal partners, the federation which will be in confederation with Croatia; and if it isn't than we won't be in that federation.  Also, we are not interested in any state-legal union with Rumposlavia, besides neighborly cooperation of two independent and sovereign states.<p>

<h2>First Scene: Croatian Parlimentarians in Belgrade</h2> <P>

Unusual plays are becoming frequent in Croatian (opposition) political theatre.  The title for one of them could be:`` Stipe from Belgrade - Stipe to Belgrade."  Here is a short synopsis:  Stipe in question is, of course, Mesic - the last president of late Yugoslavia, who these days is, it seems, again discovering the attractions of residing in Belgrade.  Let us recall: the title of his book was at first ``How we destroyed Yugoslavia" to be later moderated to ``How Yugoslavia was Destroyed" (as if he did not take part in that business); one wonders after his interview in Belgrade magazine ``Vreme" whether his next book's title will be ``How we shall build new Yugoslavia"?  Mesic not only made a friendly visit to St. Sava agit-prop but also, in a friendly conversation, promissed to bring a ``moderate" forces to power in Croatia; these new authorities would immediately eliminate ``para-statelet Herceg-Bosna"; to a remark from his chetnik collocutors how the Croatian Army is a ``state whithin the state" he added that it is indeed a ``private" army.  The Croatians, made sleepy and confused by the God, still have not understood that some of the finest sons of Croatia, in the newpapers of the country which has occupied a quarter of Croatia for four years, not only malign their own country and its armed forces but also reveal military secrets.  For example, in that same ``Vreme", a parliamentary representative and ex-distributor of Soros' dollars Miko Tripalo, assured chetnik public about the weekness of the Croatian Army.<p>


The climax if these Serbo-Croatian games without frontiers was the Croatian ex-police minister Josip Boljkovac's interview in Belgrade magazine ``Telegraf", in which we found out about an unusual classification of our friends and enemies; the friends are: yugo-generals, nice and peaceful types, with strong inclinations towards ``democracy of european type," then wonderful chetnik humanists as Hadzic, Kertes and similar, while the enemies are, until recently, fellow party members and now dangerous Croatian extremists Susak, Seks, Vukojevic, Glavas and Mercep.<p>

This is what the forementioned prides of Croatian opposition say, but even more important is to whom they talk.  Both in naive and jaded sections of Croatian public there is a stereotype about the so-called correct Serbs and their media outlets - which include the above mentioned ``Vreme"; the ``Nedjeljna Dalmacija" commentator Miljenko Jegorovic has recently analysed political and professional positions in the Belgrade press.  His conclusions were:  ``Telegraf" is a newspaper of ``the united patriotic right" whose characteristic expressions are ``ustashe, balije, ustashe authorities," while the world renowned ``Vreme" cherishes ``declared independence, while owing a subtle and consistent loyalty to the opposition greater-serbian parties." whose characteristic expressions are ``republic Srpska, Republic Srpska Krajina, self-declared Republic Kosovo, so-called Croatian Republic Herceg-Bosna, president Karadzic, president martic" etc.  Put more bluntly: ``Telegraf' is a plain chetnik paper while ``Vreme" is a de-luxe chetnik paper.  Every Croatian who voluntarily accepts to cooperate with either of them, makes a clear political statement.<p>



<h2>Second Scene: Istrian Representatives in Rome</h2><p>

While some Croatian outstanding people, as we saw, have been plotting with the chetniks, others have chosen the Italian neo-fascists for their privileged collocutors and friends.  The spectacle has lasted long enough and left enough of an impression on mostly anasthesized Croation public: the recent ``Congress of 'Istrians'" in Pula hotel ``Histria".  Some of the patriotic media explained the real goals behind the event.  Remarkably convincingly ``Vjesnik" correspondent from Bonn, Ivankovic, from the heart of Europe explained that the notorious ``Europe of the regions" abused by the Istrian seccessionists is as much of a nonsense as the ``federal Europe" and that for a long time to come the only reality will be Europe of national states in the (post)modern sense of the word; otherwise Europe will cease to exist.  The other, unpatriotic (or annoying [pun]), media, of course, practically justified Istrian seccessionist intentions - starting with a predictable ``Feral" and ending with an only seemingly confused Darko Plevnik from ``Slobodna" who with a seemingly ``critical" title hides his appology of euro-istria and euro-bandits who sit in the Croatian parliament.  ``This indicates that the Presidential government's policy in Istria must be much  more sophisticated than the one practised so far; much more european and far less balkan-like policy," writes Plevnik.  ``Istria is the european reconnaissance patrol for Croatia, not the destroyer of Croatia; similarly, Croatia is not the Istria's tamer but its home." <p>

Our luck is in the fact that between the Istrian ``Croats" who would sell Istria and the Italian irredentists who would buy her, lies several tens of kilometers of Slovenian state - in which, instead of our euro-commedians, live, apparently, wise men, who know who they are dealing with on both sides of the state ``meja" [border in Slovenian].  Recently, we could have read with some shame the analysis by a Slovenian from Trieste, Paolo G. Paravel, who from first hand could see the game of the Italian neo-fascists (or as he calls them ``neo-irredentist extremist organisations").  ``These organisations play a complicated game," says Parovelo.  ``At home they still promote racist antislovenian and anticroatian nationalism, in Slovenia and Croatia present themselves as democrats, in Rome behave as the makers of an ``adriatic policy" and in Europe accept support from extremist German refugee organisations."<p>


He also saw through the game of the Croatian parliamentarian Jakovcic and his friends: ``Istrian leadership, although it kept talking about autonomy, Europe, peace and similar things in reality did just the opposite: they approachedthe Italian neo-irredentists."  Then, that same leadership allowed that the Italian minority in Croatia be pushed ``from the idea of autonomy to that of seccession from Croatia."  Parovel says that the guilt for degeneration of Istrian politics lies equally with ``Croatian, Slovenian and Italian democratic forces who treated the problem with a mixture of dissinterest and superficiality and left the Istrians to themselves.<P>

The wise and nationalistic Slovenians - never mind how our ``Europeans" try to present them as more ``European" than the Croats - have nothing to worry about.  After stating that ``the response from Slovenian Istria was even more unclear" at the ``Congress of 'Istrians'" - Slovenians actually boycotted the Congress - the largest Slovenian daily ``Delo" coolly concluded that ``without the Slovenian part Istria will never be transnational."  Lucky for us, the miserable Croats, who are now left thinking about how to elect the Slovenians to the Parliament so that they can protect us from outselves.<p> 

<h2>Third Scene: Dalmatian Partisans on their Old Mission</h2><p>



At the same time, while some of the Croatian Parliamentarians were cooing together with the chetniks and others with the Italian black shirts, a third group celebrated in Split 50 years since the founding of the Partisan Peoples government of Croatia.  From a brief report and a photo that appeared on 4/15/95 in ``Slobodna Dalmacija", it was possible to notice that, according to an already established custom, it was a gathering of the reformed Croatian (Split) Communists ( Martin Jurjevic), incorrigible yugo-nostalgic SUBNOR [Federal Union of Participants in Peoples Liberation War] members, nowdays SABH [Union of Antifascist fighters of Croatia] members ( Milan Rako, Miroslav Curin and others), ``dalmatian action" members (Mira Ljubicic-Lorger) and ``leftist intellectuals" from the Split Law School (Boris Bukuljas).<p>

Only the uninformed could have thought that this was a gathering of the Croatian ``antifascists"; for those who have known them closely and for a long time it is clear that they are all the members of a same political party whose most appropriate name could be the Union of Communists- movement for Yugoslavia (by the way the gathering took place in the building where the offices of their publication, ``Feral Tribune" are located).  The presence of the two SUBNOR members was particularly striking;  the presence of the two contemporary Croatian traitors who on 2/6/91, only 10 days after de-facto declaration of war to Croatia in the  guise of the KOS [former Yugoslav Counter Intelligence Service] produced movie with Martin Spegelj in main role, called in ``Slobodna Dalmacija" for an ``uprising" against democratically elected Croatian authorities and in support of already mentioned SKPzJ.  In passing let us mention that the SDP's boss, Ivica Racan, in a recent interview rejected the services of such allies; his Split chief Jurjevic, on the other hand, will never renounce them.  Miko Tripalo also failed to denounce them recently during the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Partisan ``liberation" of Croatia; Rako and Curin were, besides him, the keynote speakers. Finally, as in '91 , and 50 years ago [during the WWII], they still demand from the Croatian authorities to start ``the fight against recently growing support for neo-fascist ideas [in Croatia]."  In that, as we saw earlier, they will have full support from the democratic Belgrade.<p>


<h2> Fourth Scene:a Party in ''Esplanade" </h2><p>

A few days ago the same company - Mesic, Boljkovac, Mira Ljubic-Lorger and others - thanks to the skillful picture mixer in the Croatian Television, could have been seen in the dazzling quarters of the Zagreb Hotel ``Esplanade", at the debate about the situation in the Croation judiciary.  The host was a Croatian ex-nationalist Ivan Zvonimir Cicak from Ha-ha-oa [Croatian Helsinki Watch Committee for human rights], who as usually did not hide that his bosses have enough money to greet their guests in an elite cosmopolitan ambiance.  We - who have been watching them - in the Belgrade press, Pula hotel ``Istria" or in Bacvice, near Split - have been trying to discern hat keeps them together? Love for the chetniks or the Italian irredentists?  Not very convincing.  Hatred for the Croatian authorities, especially the patriotic part, and love for some future Yugoslavia?  No, although some traces of that could be found.  In that case, what keeps them together?<p>

Easy: their love for power and for anyone who can help them fulfill their goals.  Love for the chetniks and the Italian irredentists follows from their love for power, but most of all from the Cicak's bosses love for power and money which  are most important in the whole thing.  It is only necessary to glean the ideas in the [Cicak's] bosses heads:  ``get rid of Milosevic and Tudjman", ``third of fourth Yugoslavia" or something similar.  Then be at hand when the time for the first , second or third comes [!?]. The name for that is politics.  The Croatian and opposition politics.<p>

<TITLE> Cooperation in Mostar</TITLE>

<h1> ``Same as Before"-IMPOSSIBLE</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Mario Marusic<br>  Hrvatski List, 5/5/95, Mostar/Siroki Brijeg, HR Herceg-Bosna (Bosnia and Herzegovina)</i></h2><p>

<i>Hrvatski List</i> was founded and is financed by the government of the Croatian Republic (HR) of Herzeg-Bosna <p>
<hr>

``The solution of the difficulties in Mostar will take some time," declared Portuguese minister of foreign affairs and the chair of the West European Union, Joao Durao Barroso, during his visit to Mostar on 5/1/95, calling on Croats and Muslim-Bosniacs to maintain maximum cooperation with the EU city administration, because that is ``very important".  It is totally clear that this curt media report indicates the European pessimism regarding Mostar and the admission of the difficulties in the process of <i>europeanization</i> of the city once also called ``a crystalization point of the Croatian-Bosniac federation".  What are the actual reasons for this conclusion and why this repeated expression of pessimism right now, especially since the european administrator never misses to emphasize on every occasion how, despite undeniable problems, he is an optimist and that peaceful coexistence has a future in Mostar?  In other words, where is in all this a line and(or) difference between what the public is (not) allowed to see and the real situation in the field?  How far have we gone on the way to <i>europeanization</i> of the city on the Neretva river, ten months after Hans Koschnik's [EU city administrator] arrival?<p>


<h2>Rush Without Reason</h2><p>


Portuguese Barroso, who certainly is well acquainted with the situation in Mostar - his country also contributes a number of policemen for the WEU contingent under command of colonel Ian Mayvogel from the Netherlands - did not without a reason state that the final solution for the situation in Mostar will have to be postponed for a while.  In addition to that he probably first hand obtained from the european administrator the information about the fundamental problems slowing down the <i>europeanization</i> of the city.  Besides, his other statement, that the solution for Mostar is directly connected woth the resolution for Bosnia and Herzegovina, clearly shows the core of the problem and how (un)solvable (and how quickly) it is.<p>

Observation that Mostar is not and cannot be isolated from the other developments in the federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, has been heard several times so far and is certainly correct.  However it is also an undeniable fact that it is a kind of an enchanted circle which continuously poses new problems.  That, on the other hand, returns (or at least threatens to do so!) the things to the beginning of the story ( instead of directing them towards the final resolution).<p>



The danger of return to the previous situation is the main reason for the slowness of the whole process, actually the emphasis of the Croatian side - which has recently been more and more accepted by the european administrator - on the step by step approach without hasty excursions into unknown.  Muslim-Bosnic side in Mostar, however, does not seem to be able to accept such approach.  It has again begun to proclaim every step as insufficiently productive or even opposite to the goals stated in the Memorandum of Understanding and the Constitution of the federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<p>

They [the Muslims] are unexpectedly, without any reasons or explanations, in a hurry.  What is really unacceptable is that they keep recalling Mostar from the time of the past regime, brotherhood and unity and similar concepts which, apparently, even the war could not have destroyed.<p>


On the Croatian side nobody is denying the fact that the Croats and the Muslim-Bosniacs will have to live next to each other in Mostar; however they will <b>never live with each other</b> in broderhood and unity.  This is the reality and if someone refuses to accept it, then they are obviously in denial, which, unfortunately, cannot bring about anything good.<P>

 

<h2>Instead of Celebration - Trial</h2><p>



Muslim-Bosniac side, it was clear at the latest press conference in the headquarters of the EU city administration in the hotel ``Ero", is (un)justifiably not satisfied with many things.  Besides the constant pressure on Kaschnick regarding the (dis)united city, they continue to persistently and stubbornly insist on some details which are not controversial and should have already been solved.  For example, Muslim-Bosniac side is bothered by the new names of the streets in the western part of the city.  The changing of street names was approved by the european city functionaries, who understood the necessity for change of the street names from the previous communist system, which offended the sensibilities of the citizens of Mostar.<p>

What can we say about other complaints regarding apartments, freedom of movement and similar?  Insolence shown by the Muslim-Bosniac side in the latest appearances surprised even Koschnick;  not to mention the perfidious attempt at provocation of the mayor of western Mostar, Mijo Brajkovic, when the representatives of the Jewish community were drawn into the plot.  Celebration of the establishment of the city public transportation turned into some kind of a public trial to the european city administration as well as the Croatian side for everything (not) accomplished in Mostar so far, during which Muslim-Bosniacs continuously emphasized alleged endangered status due to the establishment of new barriers in ``our Mostar"<p>

European Mayor Koschnick, speaking about the establishment of seven bus lines in Mostar and the necessity of a step by step approach to new initiatives, used as the main proof of the success of his mission everything achieved so far (in Mostar).  In order to understand Koschnick it is enough to recall the situation from a few months ago.<p>



<h2> (Ab)normal Reality </h2><p>

It is impossible to ignore the fact that after all a lot of what has been achieved is positive.  The Muslim side refusal to accept this as a relevant fact and reality is nothing but the opposition to the progress of the city.  In other words opposition to everything not agreeing with their views and wishes for return to the situation ``as before".<p>

Even the establishment of seven bus lines Muslim-Bosniacs viewed as another attempt at the division of the city;  mayor of eastern Mostar, Safet Orucevic, deliberatly refused to attend the promotion in hotel ``Ero".  Koschnick explained that the current political situation (temporary) allows only for the separate organization of the trnsportation in the two parts of the city, and that this will be one company with two agencies in western and eastern Mostar, was not accepted by the Muslim-Bosniacs;  it was followed by the avallanche of atacks on Hans Koschnick and Mijo Brajkovic.  Also the agreement on freedom of movement for physicians and sick persons does not present progress according to Muslim-Bosniacs since before the war this was not a problem and is a natural state of things anyway (!?).<p>


 Koschnick's elaboration of the developments in Mostar and comparison with the situation in Sarajevo and other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina also were not received well by the eastern Mostar representatives.  they remained stubbornly fixated on their vision of Mostar as a unified city organized ``as before".  It is not necessary to explain how far from the reality that vision is.<p>

But...<p>

Unlike Portuguese foreign minister Barroso, the mayor of western Mostar, Mijo Brajkovic, said that it would be necessary ``to find the political solution for Mostar very quickly."  The above mentioned examples, some of which are banal and should not be as controversial as the Muslim-Bosniac side tries to make them, dangerously threten to return the situation to the beginning; therefore it is necessary - as Brajkovic warned - to react as quickly as possible (again, while following the <i>step by step</i> approach) in order to achieve (temporary) compromise between the two interested sides.  Good will, which is necessary for that has unfortunately recently been absent from the Muslim-Bosniac side.  Since, as it should finally be clear to everyone, Mostar will never be ``as before".

<h2><a name="oslob"><IMG ALT="Oslobodenje" SRC="oslob/oslob.gif" ALIGN=BOTTOM></a></h2>  <em>Oslobodjenje</em>, which means "Liberation," was founded in 1943 as an underground organ of Marshal Tito's Communist Partisan movement, whose ranks in Bosnia included Serbs, Muslims and Croats fighting alongside one another.  The staff had rebelled against Communist Party control in the late 1980s, in order to establish their newspaper as a genuinely democratic media enterprise, but they retained the Communist's distaste for nationalist politics.  When separate Serb, Croat and Muslim political parties were formed in advance of the 1990 elections, <em>Oslobodjenje</em> critisized them all, throwing its support instead behind parties with pan-national programs.  In early 1992, when Serb nationalists sought to block the Bosnian independence drive and demanded that the republic be partitioned along ethnic lines, <em>Oslobodjenje</em> aligned itself with the Bosnian government in opposing the Serb campaign."-- taken from <em>Sarajevo daily: a city and its newspaper under seige</em>, by Tom Gjelten, Harper Collins, ISBN 0-06-019052-3<p>

Front Slobode is an independent informative two-weekly publication from Tuzla.  It has a long tradition.  Before the Bosnian war it was patronized by the then Union of Communists which used it as a party bulletin.  The privatization of 1993 brought new people and considerable changes in editorial policy.  <strong>Front Slobode</strong> dissociated itself from the current ruling party, the largest Bosnian Muslim party, SDA, and became an independent paper with an outspoken oppositional approach towards the ruling structures in Bosnia-Hercegovina. <strong>Front Slobode</strong> stands for a peaceful co-existence between different ethnic groups in Bosnia-Hercegovina.(from <a HREF="http://MediaFilter.org/MFF/PN.html">Press Now</a>)<P>

<TITLE> Bosniacs and Gotts</TITLE>

<h1> Bosniacs are the Descendants of Old Gotts</h1><p>

<FONT SIZE="+1"> 
<h2><i> Letter to the Editor<br>  Ljiljan, 7/12/95, Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina</i></h2><p>


<hr>

Sir,<p>

In the last few editions of your paper I noticed in several places  claims that the Bosniacs are Slavs.  This was written by some people of authority.  I would like to point out that this theory is the product of the Serbian distortion of history; I bring to your attention differences in views of Germanic and Slavic anthropologists about the origin of our people.<p> 

Indeed there are a lot of indications that we have little in common with Slavs. . . .<p>

I hope that this text will bring in an avalanche of similar contributions since in the time of [the former] Yugoslavia, Slovenians wrote about this topic and our anthropologists are certainly familiar with it; however, it was kept quiet because the Yugoslav communists qualified the theory of the Germanic anthropologists to be fascist, obviously according to the Serbian wishes, because they wanted to annex the whole Bosnian nation.<p>

In the opinion of Germanic (above all German) anthropologists, Bosniacs have not descended from Slavs but from Gotts.  For this theory they find a lot of proofs.  During the third Reich, Germans considered Bosniacs to be Gotts and therefore they [the Bosniacs] could be mobilized into SS-units.  It is well known that these units were reserved for the purest members of the German race.<p>

A Gottic tribe Besi moved to the territory of todays Bosnia 80 years before Slavs; the tribe remained after the Slav arrival from the east.  The name Bosnia originated from the name of this tribe; personal name Besim is one of the oldest Bosnian names.  It is typical for the Bosnian Muslims and wasn't, like other names, taken over during the Ottoman rule, but remained from the oldest times.<p>

Five Slavic tribes have migrated to the territory of the former Yugoslavia ; they later formed South Slav peoples: Slovenians, Croats, Serbs, Montenegrins and Macedonians.  There didn't exist a native tribe from which the Bosniacs could have originated.  Our enemies use this fact as the key proof that the Bosniacs are Serb converts to Islam.  Of course there didn't exist a native tribe from which the Bosniacs could have originated, since their ancestors are Gotts, actually Ostrogottic tribe Besi.<p>

The first Slav state is the Russian state, founded by Viking Rurik, who conquered with his warriors Russian tribes in 723.  Other Slavs had no concept of a state for a long time after that;  however, Bosnia is for a first time mentioned as a state in 867.  How could the Bosniacs (Besi) build a state, which was unknown to other Slavs, while around the Bosnian state lived Slavic tribes until 1102, when the Croats founded their state?  The Gottic influence in Bosnia is behind this development.<p>

How come there was a University in Bosnia in 1175 and the masses were literate at the time when other Slavs lived in tribes?  Again obviously due to Gottic influence.  Let us ask ourselves what is the origin of the middle Bosnian <em>h</em> in our language?  Isn't it similar to the pronunciation of some words in German language? Is it a remnant from the original Bosniac language?<p>

It is well known that Gotts had blond hair.  There aren't any blond Slavs.  How come there are so many blond individuals among Bosniacs if they are Slavs?<p>

Bosnian Church is considered to be a Bogumil Church.  Is that right?  Is the faith of the Bosnian Krstjans similar to the Bulgarian Bogumil faith ( Bogumil religion developed in Bulgaria and existed on the territories of the former Eastern Roman Empire) or to the Anglican Protestantism?  There are opinions that the Bosnian Church was actually an Anglican Protestant Church.  Protestantism is typical for Gotts.<p>

What is the origin of the Bosniac's military prowess?  Slavs were never good fighters while Gotts always destroyed everything in front of themselves.  Consider the WWII.  Germans occupied both Paris and Moscow.  They were taken on by the Americans and the English, who defeated them; this was used by the Russians who in their campaign occupied Eastern Europe and half of todays eastern Germany; Russians had five times greater losses than the Germans (consider the numbers of victims in the WWII and keep in mind that the large number of Germans died on the Western front).  Let us mention the genocidal nature of Slavs.  Churchill in his memoirs writes about the formation of the Polish border.  To Churchill's remark that such a border would cause large movement of population, Stalin replied that in the territory under "Red Army's" control there were no Germans.  Compare this with the events in the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  Similarities are incredible.  While the English and Americans enabled Western Germany to build a strong state without Nazism, the Russians introduced terror and, in the USSR only (their own country), killed 21 million people after the war.<p>

Finally, let us mention that there are no pure nations.  Slavs have migrated to the territory of todays Bosnia and Besi mixed with them and adopted their language.  This was especially significant when the original Bosnia started expanding to the territories inhabited by the Slavs, to the west, south and east.  Later the Pope forced Bosnia and its king to officially convert to Catholicism - which means that he was the ancestor of todays Croats.<p>

In 14th century, metal workers Sassi [Saxons] settled in Bosnia, because Bosnia was then a developed state.  Even today there are traces of the existence of Sassi in Bosnia.  For example, ethnically clean Sassian villages nearby Kakanj (Tesevo region).  After the arrival of Turks a part of Slavs in Bosnia also converted to Islam.  After Austria-Hungary left, a new principle, one nation- one religion , was introduced.  According to this scheme all Catholics in Bosnia became Croats, even the forementioned Sassi.  All orthodox became Serbs and all Muslims Bosniacs.  This way some Slavs, which don't have even a slightest trace of the original Bosniacs - Besi, became Bosniacs as well.  Also, all Turks who remained in Bosnia became Bosniacs.<p>

Although we have a small percentage of Slav blood in our veins, we must know when we see a blond soldier in the Army of Bosnia-Hercegovina that he is a direct descendant of Vikings - the terrible warriors from the ancient past.<p>

<h1>Honest People, Dishonest Politicians</h1>

<strong><em>by Fahira Fejzic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Ljiljan, Sarajevo-Ljubljana, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 7/26/95</h2>

A news that <strong>Boutros Boutros Ghali</strong> would arrive to Turkey in order to 
receive a honorary of a relatively unknown American University in Ankara was
published in the Turkish media during the worst chetnik [derogatory term for Serbs] crimes against the Srebrenica
civilians.  Ghali was supposed to be received on the highest state level and hold
several press-conferences.<P>

<h2>Turkish painful wound - Cyprus </h2>

With this sudden move (or moral downfall of the official policy, as stated by the
independent intellectuals), the opposition and the part of parliamentarians 
were supposed to pull Turkey into  the dirtiest past of "Bosnia's deluge" by
making Ghali's role official with a "Turkish University Doctoral degree".<P>

The purpose of this visit was supposed to be the solution of the Cyprus
problem, the greatest Turkish wound, at the same time as the other great
Turkish wound, Bosnian, was being cut open.  In addition to the 
hospitality of one of the most important Muslim countries which is also among
the most important supporters of Bosnia, Ghali was supposed to be "treated"
yet again with all-Muslim naivete.  Fortunately, Ghali cancelled the visit,
and his productive cancelation at the same time became the best indicator
of the political situation in Turkey this summer in which the secular authorities
of this country of sixty five million inhabitants are trying to find the optimal
course.  This was a trial for the public, especially in the largest cities, Istanbul,
Ankara and Izmir.  Turkish public expressed so far unseen maturity in the 
understanding of political situation in the world.  It is obvious that the 
public is aware that Ghali himself is not the creator of the dirty world
politics, but the local public also understands that it is unhappy with the 
powerful Western circles which, when Islam is concerned, find a common ground
with fundamentalist Orthodoxy.<P>

Many factors in Turkey and elsewhere are not satisfied with the official policy with 
respect to Ghali and Bosnia, from the people, opposition, media and neighboring
countries to Europe with its political, military, cultural, monetary and other 
organizations.<P>

The local TV channel <em>Channel 7</em> made this dissatisfaction public in 
the documentary film <strong>Sarajevo My Love</strong> in a statement of
a boy from Sarajevo whom the
author of the documentary had found this April in a sweet shop in Sarajevo;
the boy said (in Bosnian, without translation):
"In my opinion, neither <strong>Demirel</strong> [Turkish president] nor <strong>Ciller</strong>
[former prime minister, from secular Motherland Party] are the real Turks;
<strong>Erbakan</strong> [present prime minister, leader of the Islamic Refah
Party] is the real Turk."  A foreigner and a Bosniak (here that means someone 
who is loved without questions) dared to blaspheme, which is exactly the essence
of the political debates on the future course of Turkey.  Whether Turkey
will follow the road of its own, authentic, interests or somebody else's
interests;  by playing host to Ghali or delaying his visit for some "better times";
with direct aid to Bosnia or in some other way.<P>

<h2>Public Above All</h2>

Although CIA has predicted (read prepared), in its long report dealing with this
region, great suffering, disturbances and even a war, only demonstrations 
and protests from that part which is known as "vox populi" prevented Ghali's
bandy-legged showing off in Cetinkaya or Taksim.<P>

These reports and the United Nations are certainly connected.  The official
circles didn't find it suspicious that the announcement of the Secretary 
General's visit was made at the same time when the Greek side in its 
parliament openly predicted war with Turks for the rest of "their Cyprus" and
"proclamation of the mosque Aya Sofya and Istanbul as the center of Orthodoxy."
As if they didn't read Ghali's cynicism: while thousands of muslims on the 
Balkans are massacred and killed and while the TV cameras are recording that
with less excitement then in 1992, he would come to pick up a doctorate as
a reward for the expansion of Orthodox borders in the heart of Rumelia and 
Trakia [old Ottoman provinces, todays Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece], 
first Balkan neighbors of the sixty five million [Turkish] muslims and announce
a new war against the muslims and a new expansion of Orthodoxy.  Because, 
wherever Ghali sets his foot, there wars against muslims start.<P>

As a polite host, president Demirel did not refuse to welcome Ghali, although Ghali
hadn't helped him in the past, when on two occasions Demirel tried to visit
Sarajevo.  The role of the "block" was handed over to "Islamic forces", to make
sure that "the West doesn't realize" how much the whole Islamic Turkish community
dislikes Muslim katils and murderers.  Hence, the sharpest criticism came 
from the leader of <em>Refah</em> <strong>Erbakan</strong> and the mayor of
Istanbul <strong>Erdogan</strong>.  However, it is important that a strong
and constructive denunciation came from <em>Bosna Dayanism Vakf</em> as well
as from the patriotic party <em>Anvatan partisi</em>, and numerous deputies
in the Turkish mejlis (parliament), and also those independent intellectuals and
organizations which do not find representation in current political parties.
Official circles felt relieved when it was confirmed that Ghali had received
more than 10 thousands of threatening letters and, afraid for his dignity and
safety, cancelled the visit.<P>

Forces behind the campaign against Ghali's visit to Turkey now realize that 
they couldn't have changed much on the international scene and especially 
not in Bosnia, but they are also aware that they did the only morally and
politically correct thing.  They made it clear to the so called domestic 
official policy that in the future it would have to take into consideration
those opinions which it disliked.  Also, they showed to the influential
political forces abroad that Turkish political factor was not united and was
definitively not obedient and that the international community would have
to keep this in mind in its every future project.  In this way, they showed
the signs of still very strong solidarity of the Muslim world with Bosnia.
Finally, if there were more of this kind of solidarity in other muslim societies
all over the world, if more muslim intellectuals influenced public opinion
among the Millions of Muslims all over the world, the consequences would
have been useful for both us, Bosniaks, and the rest of muslims.<P>

 <h1>Exodus from Bosniak Apartments</h1>

<strong><em>by Bernes Alihodzic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Ljiljan, Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 2/21 1996</h2> 

The most powerful military force in the world, NATO alliance, and the U.S.A. within it as unquestionably the leading power in the world today, are again being humiliated in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  Demonstrations of military force are not surprising, having in mind customary American arrogance, especially when the object is to demonstrate their unbiased approach in Bosnia-Hercegovina (air operation of 250 soldiers during the arrest of approximately 10 Bosniak and Iranian citizens in one of the Bosnian police training centers near Fojnica).  Nevertheless, IFOR, as UNPROFOR before it, behaves as a third rate power when the main "cats" in Bosnia, war criminals Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic are in question.<P>

Despite strong public pressure which demands the arrest of two bloodiest war criminals after World War II, excuses put forward by the spokespersons from IFOR, UNHCR and ICRC, definitely do not correspond to the military force which the Western world arrogantly demonstrates in Bosnia-Hercegovina.<P>

When Bosnian police arrested two high Serb officers, general Dukic and colonel Krsmanovic, majority of western statesmen hurried to apologize because they had been served with a fait accompli and had to take over persons which had been declared war crimes suspects even by the Hague Tribunal for War Crimes.<P>

Of course this has nothing to do with military incompetence nor military tactics.<P>

<h2>Hearths in the Ashes of Somebody Else's Apartments</h2>

Chetnik serb-montenegrin duet Karadzic-Mladic is still at large because of a very important reason which no person of authority is prepared to publicly state.  The two of them must finish their job. "Ethnic cleansing" is these days in its final stages.  War criminal Radovan Karadzic was given time to finish "ethnic cleansing", this time of Serb people and without killing, using relocation.<P>

Besides the planned total conquest of Bosnia-Hercegovina, one of the most important reasons behind the aggression against Bosnia-Hercegovina was to kill and displace as many Bosnian Muslims as possible.  So far unseen brutality was displayed in torture and killing of Bosniaks in order to eradicate in the survivors the desire for common living.  During the first year of the war Serbs expelled or slaughtered Muslim population in about eighty percent of territory under their control.  Also, according to the data of the Bosnian Ministry of Health, out of 148,000 killed and missing persons in Bosnia, 129,000, or 87 percent, perished during the first year of the war!<P>

Bosniaks were expelled from a significant portion of the Bosnian territory, especially from eastern Bosnia, and Bosniaks and Croats from western Bosnia and Posavina.  The consequences will be felt in the coming decades.<P>

Chris Janowski, UNHCR spokesman, says that the Serb propaganda calling on the Sarajevo Serbs to relocate is very strong and that the international organizations and their representatives are helpless; he is sympathizing with "poor Serbs who are afraid of living under Muslim authorities and have to leave their homes, leave Sarajevo and travel into unknown."<P>

There are at least four lies and only one truth in this statement: that one truth is that the Serb propaganda is very strong.  Everything else is an ordinary lie.<P>

<h2>"Uncertainty" in Untouched Northeastern Bosnia</h2>

First: Serbs are leaving villages in the hills around Ilijas, Hadzici and Rakovica which are as far away from Sarajevo as from the Adriatic sea.<P>

Second: Most of them are not leaving their own homes but Bosniak houses, to which they moved after killing and expelling their Bosniak neighbors at the beginning of the war.  Normal persons do not burn their own homes, especially if they have to save up for years in order to build them.<P>

Third: Serb families are not traveling into unknown; they are moving to a known address, a Bosniak house in Vlasenica, Zvornik, Srebrenica, Bratunac, Visegrad, Rogatica and especially Brcko.  After receiving a "permit" from the local Serb authorities, they first travel to check if they like the allocated house, the furniture in it, the color of a muslim carpet and after that, if they can find anything better among the looted furniture, they load that on trucks and drive away to the "unknown".<P>

Fourth: there is no fear from the "Muslim" authorities, since they have always lived better with Bosniaks than on their own.  Only those who know that one of their victims has escaped and remembered them are afraid.  Besides, Serbs are coming back to Sarajevo even today, to apartments that their grandmothers saved for them during the war, without fear from "muslim" authorities: "they were refugees during the war because they couldn't shoot on their people in the hills"; or, because of that, they were shooting from the hills at Sarajevo.<P>

Finally: Those Serbs who are leaving Sarajevo shouldn't be pitied.  They are leaving other people's homes and even their own homes in the hicks around Sarajevo suburbs and moving to the cities and houses built by Bosniaks for generations and generations; they are going to Vlasenica in which every apartment has central heating; they are going to Zvornik in which the only destruction was inflicted by them in the first month of war while the Kula-Grad above the city was bravely defending itself; they are going to Srebrenica, to sit on the Bosniak mass graves and sing songs about Arkan, "a great hero"; they are going to the rich Semberija plain [in Northeastern Bosnia] where they earlier learned how to grab land belonging to Muslim feudal Lords.<P>

Because of that Radovan Karadzic is still in Pale.  His task is to, before the election, make sure that all Bosniak houses have been filled and to seal the present state of "ethnic purity".<P>

What is the IFOR interest, actually the interest of the international community represented through this military mammoth, in all this?  All foreign interests which directed the situation in Bosnia during the war are still present.<P>

Nothing fundamentally new came to Bosnia with IFOR, nor with America.  The Bosniaks must not drop their readiness and allow to be fooled by peace or to think that the international community has even slightly better opinion and intentions regarding Bosniaks and Bosnia-Hercegovina.  Their interests are still the same.  The only changes are visible in their mutual disagreements.  Promised "aid for reconstruction" of Bosnia-Hercegovina will be at the level of current humanitarian relief, which is obvious from the results of the aid provided until now; they are negligible although, according to the Brussels conference, the results should have already been significant.<P>

As far as the "ethnic purity" is concerned, it remains one of the most important motives in the future Serb nationalistic program which will be supported by all those who have supported it until now.<P>

<h1>Soros's War Orphans</h1>

<h3> by Fahrudin Djapo , Ljiljan, Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 2/28 1996</h3>

 
       Geroge  Soros,  a  Hungarian Jew with  American  passport,
 millionaire and financial genius, philanthropist and an advocate
 of  open society is certainly one of the most controversial  and
 interesting persons from this end of the century. His foundation
 Open  Society  Institute is present in almost every  country  in
 transition.  Soros  financially  supports  hospitals,   schools,
 universities,  publishers,  refugees,  autonomous   businessmen,
 However  his  support of independent media is  surely  the  most
 transparent  part  of  the arrangement. His Belgrade's  magazine
 Vreme,   Sarajevo's  Slobodna  Bosna,  Split's  Feral   Tribune,
 Ljubljana's  (Sarajevo's)  Svijet, Zagreb's  Arkzin  -  are  the
 newspapers  with more or less standardized pro-Serbian  concept.
 Their  general  opinion is that the war in  the  Balkans  was  a
 result of "nationalism" or in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina
 "nationalist parties" or "nationalists' leaders". Soros  himself
 does  not  consider  these newspapers to be too  influential  or
 powerful. As an example he mentioned Feral which "deals with the
 most  delicate issues, however there is a small number of  those
 ready  or  willing  to  listen and accept  responsibilities  and
 consequences".<P>
 
<h2> The Only Bosnian Speaks With a Heavy Serbian Accent</h2>
 
       The  most  powerful "fist" of this 60 year  old  man,  who
 according  to his own confessions "wishes to change the  World",
 is  Radio  Slobodna  Europa (Free Europe, program  broadcast  in
 South  Slavic  languages), which has been led by (recently)  the
 former  editor  of  Sarajevo's TV  Nenad  Pejic.<P>
  It  was  first
 broadcast  from  Munich and later from Prague  (capital  of  the
 Czech  Republic where Soros's central offices are also located).
 The  program  is  available to all listeners from  Macedonia  to
 Slovenia.  A  formulation  such as a "program  in  south  Slavic
 languages"   should   suggest   the   language   openness    and
 representation  of  all  variants as precondition  of  political
 independence  and  objectivity. However on Pejic's  radio,  Omer
 Karabeg,  only member of editorial office who according  to  his
 name  and surname is a Bosnian,
 speaks with such a heavy Serbian
 accent (note: never Slovenian nor Macedonian languages which are
 also  South Slavic languages) on which even Srbislava Kobilarov,
 the staff correspondent from Belgrade, could envy him.<P>
       The  fact  that Geroge Soros is interested in  the  former
 Yugoslavia is a clear proof that behind his aureole of a  genius
 in  one area of his work hides a really naive and dilettante man
 in the other. If we accept Soros's well-meant intentions to help
 us  surpass  the consequences of the Serbian aggression  against
 Bosnia  and  Herzegovina and Croatia, then  we  cannot  but  ask
 ourselves the following question: How come that such a financial
 wizard  who managed to destroy English pound in just one day  at
 the  World Stock Market allowed Serbian lobby to deceive him and
 play  with  him.<P>
 Soros "agrees and confirms that Serbia  is  the
 aggressor", which is contrary to the statements of the editor of
 the radio Free Europe or contrary to the articles written in the
 independent     media.     Consciously     or     unconsciously,
 multimillionaire  George  Soros has become  the  puppet  on  the
 string  pulled  by  the quasi democrats Serbs,  alleged  citizen
 alternative who work for Vreme or for Prague's editorial office,
 whose  highest  point  of  democracy  and  objectivity  is
 expressed  by the attitude that nationalism is the  main  reason
 for  the  outbreak of war in Yugoslavia. Milosevic and his  Nazi
 regime  derive  more profit from the independent and  open  Free
 Europe  program than from TV Serbia, which they hold in their own
 claws. The Free European reporters from Serbia engage in a  foal
 play.   Trying  to  sound  objective  and  critical,   Srbislava
 Kobilarov,  Zoran  Mamula, Dragoje Zarkovic,  Milica  Lucic  and
 others  report  about dramatic fights in the Parliament  between
 Milosevic  and  democratic opposition leaders such  as  Dindic,
 Seselj,   Kosutnica....,  in  which  they  criticize  Milosevic,
 executioner  from  Dedinje,  because  he  has  not   been   more
 systematic  in his genocide against the Bosniaks. We should  not
 forget   that   they  also  regularly  broadcast  socio-economic
 analysis,  "with  a  critical tone". This should  influence  the
 receivers  of messages to create a picture of Serbia as  dynamic
 and  somewhat undemocratic society, which still does not surpass
 the limits of parliamentary democracy.<P>
 
 <h2>Personal and National Interests Drawn From the Aggression</h2>
 
        One  of  the  most  indicative  examples  of  the  recent
 democratic  changes in Serbian society was the  following  case:
 Milosevic   closed   down  and  put  under  government   control
 "independent"  radio station Studio B. Soros's Free  Europe  has
 decided to protect freedom and independence of the media at once
 and  tried  to sympathize with the colleagues from Belgrade.  At
 first  sight  nothing controversial has happened since  all  the
 principles of the democratic state formed the part of the  play.
 To  cry  and whimper about the recent shut down of the  sisterly
 radio   station  is  completely  legitimate.   The most
 important  news item on Pejic's radio (what a coincidence) is
 the  one  relating to the event when IFOR captured the group  of
 Bosnian  terrorists "trained" by three Iranians. Free Europe  also
 broadcast  (with  great  pleasure)  the  news  relating  to  the
 quantities  of the weapons and explosives in shape of children's
 toys  found at the spot and the conclusion drawn from  the  case
 was  that the aforementioned group was "under the direct control
 of the Bosnian Government in Sarajevo".<P>
       That's  it,  then!  Milosevic  is  "not  a  democrat".  He
 threatens   independent  local  station.  On  the   other   hand
 Izetbegovic is the sponsor of "Iranian terrorists". The news  are,
 (what  a  coincidence again), published again  just  before  the
 meeting in Rome. (February 16).<P>
       The  special  reporter  from the Italian  capital,  Srdjan
 Kusovac, added a special tone to it all, stating that there were
 rumors around the city that Alija Izetbegovic was not willing to
 leave Sarajevo at the time of the Ramadan. Such statements  were
 considered funny by Kusovac.<P>
       Tendency to interpret events around us by some theories of
 conspiracy leads away from truth.  We should not doubt the  good
 intentions  of  Soros  and  give negative  connotations  to  his
 mission  without any solid arguments. One should look at  things
 without  any bitterness and excess of emotions. Then  we  should
 ask  ourselves  how Serbs managed to enchant and deceive  Soros,
 placing  him  in the service of their own national and  personal
 profits.<P>
       "Bosnia is more important to me than Croatia", says Soros.
 In  spite  of  the  fact  that  Bosniaks  are  already  sick  of
 conspiracies, there are no reasons to worry about. Critical  and
 open media is not a rare or miraculous thing in Bosnia. It would
 not  hurt Bosnia if the wealthy Soros spent a few bucks  on  the
 opening  of  the  new newspapers which would  be  called  "Grude
 Tribune"  or "Slobodne Pale" (Free Pale). There would not  be  a
 lack of journalists who would be working for them because as one
 of  his ex employees said: "To work for Soros is easy and  there
 is a pile of money involved."<P>

<strong>Ljiljan: It seems that the meeting in Rome has greater consequences than can be assessed from the current perspective.  Was it a negative event for Bosnia-Hercegovina? After all it was a surprise, wasn't it?  Our public was, you'll excuse me for saying this, shocked, especially Hercegovina Bosniaks.  What actually happened in Rome?  What were your dilemmas?  How did the participants behave?  Can you explain the meeting in Rome to our audience?</strong><P>

Regarding the meeting in Rome, we neither got
nor lost anything important there. The Croats rejected Koschnick's
plan and Europe, as usual, evaded it. Does it surprise you, or is
it something new?  Did not Europeans in the hardest days of
genocide tell us: make an agreement, there is no other option?
Who did we have to agree with, slaughterers?  That is why I do not
understand why somebody should be shocked or disappointed now.
Everything has already been seen and experienced. Koschnick's
plan and district was only a project, it was not something we had
and then lost in Rome. What the public should know to understand Rome
is that EU had already abandoned Koschnick's plan when we went to
Rome. They already had had a session demanding the so-called mutually
acceptable solution. German representatives to the EU clearly told 
our expert Dr. Kasim Begic: "If you do not make an agreement
today, the EU will withdraw from Mostar in three days." I had 
only one aim in that situation: to get the Croat side to agree to 
freedom of movement and the deployment of the federation police in 
the town. I knew it would not be entirely implemented, but it was 
important that the world's pressure be continued unabated in this 
respect. I think that the recent Geneva meeting proved I was right.  As far as the atmosphere at the meeting is concerned, it was really hellish.  There were three concurrent meetings on which new documents were constantly produced, rejected, changed, corrected and again rejected.  This went on for more than 24 hours.  On Sunday evening I told one of our journalists to start her report with words: "This is a mental institution".  Fortunately, she wrote something similar instead. <P>

<strong>Ljiljan: Mr. President, with your illness, Bosnia-Hercegovina and the Bosniak people have reached an unprecedented, although expected, trial.  Have the countries, signatories of the Dayton agreement, given up on the united Bosnian state?  We have the impression that, after the Dayton Agreement, the emphasis was on the entities and not on the Bosnian state as a multi-ethnic state, and that the world, especially Europeans, has accepted the concept of national states within Bosnia-Hercegovina...  For example, yesterday, Mr. Zubak, claimed in <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em> that Bosnia-Hercegovina was possible only as a federal-confederal state.  It seems that new troubles are awaiting the Bosniak people if the world community decides to follow either one of these adventures.  In a recent interview you have stated that you were not certain whether our public was aware of the difficult situation we were in.  Were you talking about the same problems?</strong><P>


Internal and external disintegration forces in Bosnia are on the offensive.
I am mostly concerned over the ethnic cleansing that continued after
Dayton. The most significant item of the Dayton accords is one
foreseeing gradual ethnic reintegration. There is no return of
the displaced population, and the way how to start the thing in
positive direction cannot be seen for the time being. It is the
greatest problem and a threat to Bosnia. There are attempts to
convince the world of equal guilt of all sides, that legal B-H
authorities are not immune to narrow-mindedness and nationalism,
either, and that B-H is not viable. Some errors - which are
extant - are abused for the poison of propaganda. However, the
situation demands the errors must not be made, as the world
equates our errors with their crimes. It is sad, but the world is
such as it is, we cannot change it. But we can know the facts,
regardless of whether we like them or not, take them into account
and try to make the calculations as accurately as possible. Our
propaganda is, for the most part, erroneous. Media compete to
show injustice and crimes which Serbs and Croats have committed
against Bosniaks. Of course, the crimes should not be ignored or
covered up, but is there anything good, human among those three
nations ? Does any gesture of concern for the people of different
religions and nations ever occur in our Bosnia ? I do not believe
there are no such examples, but it is, for quite incomprehensible
reasons to me, permanently suppressed. And it is something that
should be pointed out in this situation.  Proving that only trouble exists among the three nations in B-H is nothing
else but proving that Bosnia is not viable, and it is a job well
done by Krajisnik and Boban. I assume we are to prove otherwise,
to find and point out positive examples. Of course, we should not
invent them. You ask if the world has agreed with the concept of
national states in B-H.  The problem is not if the world agreed
on that, but it seems that we have agreed or it is the way we
act. Consider, for instance, some articles in our papers, and your
papers, too. Reading them will not strengthen our belief that
multi-ethnic state of B-H is possible. On the contrary !<P>

<strong>Ljiljan: I think that our paper tries to, on all occasions, affirm Bosnia-Hercegovina.  However, after finding two Iranians near Fojnica, the USA
set the conditions and staff affecting the sovereignty of B-H. It
is not even secret that they want to overthrow Izetbegovic's
government. The main reason could be connection with Islamic
world, with Iran during the aggression, when nobody else wanted
to give a bullet to the B-H Army.</strong><P>

What happened in <a HREF="/info/students/marko/froslo3.html">Podgorelica, near Fojnica,</a> was
our big mistake, a violation of what we had signed. Somebody had to
draw the consequences and in democracy they are always the
leaders. I ask you: will you, or all of us be happier if I
confirm hidden assumption of your question that the USA is our
enemy? <P>

<strong>Ljiljan:  I didn't say that the USA is our enemy, but that I don't understand some actions taken by the IFOR and some statements from Washington regarding Bosnia-Hercegovina and its legal authorities...</strong><P>

Fine, but let me ask you this: Will Bosnia be more secure if we find out that the 
USA and another 1O states in the world are all our enemies ?. What
when we find that out? I think that the USA is not our enemy, but
we can make them that. The USA will be our friend if convinced
that survival of B-H as an integral state is their interest. If so,
let us work in that direction as we must have America on our
side. In the existing situation, it is a question of survival
of Bosnia and our people. It is the only real policy, or shorter,
it is the policy, as unreal policy is not a policy but stupidity.
During the war, Iran proved to be a friend indeed, but Iran is
far away and enemies very close, a stone's throw from us. When
the allies are concerned, my full answer is: we must have the USA
and the Islamic states on our side and as much as possible the rest
of the world. It is possible and should be our policy.<P>

<strong>Ljiljan: America is not close, either, it is also far away.
Do you know if EU really support the B-H Federation project?</strong><p>

You are wrong. America has for a long time been here in
Europe, don't you see that? Regarding the EU, I think they still
do support the project of Bosnia-Hercegovina Federation. It is among the reasons
for their supporting the Rome compromise. Otherwise, they would
pretend to act according to the principles, and actually allow the
events to follow their own direction. It is well-known what that means
as the time is an enemy, not an ally, of the B-H Federation. As far as
Europe is concerned, some ugly doubts are caused by behavior of
France, some statements which I have just heard. It is too early for
me to comment, as it is new and I do not know the context. It
is never too late for bad news. There is no reason to rush them,
as they alone knock on our door.<P>

 <h1>Neo-Communists are Trying to Fool Voters</h1>

<strong><em>by Dzemaludin Latic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Ljiljan, Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 6/26 1996</h2> 

As the election day approaches (OSCE set the definite election date for September 14 1996), the conflict between the political <strong>concepts</strong> for the future Bosnia-Hercegovina is heating up.  Recent incident with <strong>Haris Silajdzic</strong> in Cazin revealed those concepts in a very emotional form together with a lot of additional issues.  All in all, one could say that there are only three important concepts: moderate right, neo-communist and nationalist.  The third concept is connected to the political philosophy and expansionism of the current Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat leaderships, which, unfortunately, are supported by the majority of Serbs and Croats in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  There is no need to waste space on this concept, since it is obvious, its goals are clear, and one should fight it daily using all allowable means.<P>

The moderate right concept, which is primarily linked with SDA although, as we will later emphasize, SDA is not the only political party which supports it, presupposes, above all, <strong>resistance</strong> to the nationalist concept, resistance based on the "idea of Bosnia" as a common state in which three peoples are equal and, therefore, free.  In Bosnia, there cannot be a free individual unless the people to which he belongs is also free; neither could all Bosnian peoples be free unless all individuals are also free.  Nationalist Serb and Croat concept cannot achieve its expansionist goals unless it destroys the "idea of Bosnia", <strong>namely</strong>: unless it conquers the people which most faithfully and strongly preserves and fights for that idea, its survival, and political subjectivity.<P>

The moderate right concept has been strongly, especially recently, attacked by the supporters of the neo-communist concept.  Their reactions regarding the attack on the leader of the Party for Bosnia-Hercegovina (SBiH), Dr. Haris Silajdzic, in Cazin, essentially do not touch the problem of freedom (judging from the tone of news reports, they are neither concerned with the politician Silajdzic whom they also cannot stand) but are the consequence of open struggle for power.  If that was not the case, at least someone would have wondered about the <strong>causes</strong> which contributed to the incident in Cazin.  One of the immediate reasons was that, just before the attack, Silajdzic's supporters carried out a <strong>moral assassination</strong> of the highest values of the people which most thoroughly preserves the idea of Bosnia, has fought, and still fights for it.  We have a detailed report about that incident on the following pages.  Cursing of Islam, tekbir and the legal president of this state, in Sarajevo was characterized as a <strong>verbal crime</strong>, while it is actually a very serious assault on the indigenous values of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  <strong>Islam, as other monotheistic religions, would have to be protected by the Constitution of this state and not cursed at meetings of political parties!</strong>  Those who would establish this state without Islam can only be one of the two: enemies of this state and the Bosniaks, or utopians whose intentions lead to hell!  This [Bosniak] people was <strong>attacked</strong> because it belongs to Islam and those who would divide Bosniaks on that basis are <strong>truly</strong> playing with fire!<P>

With its strong attack on SDA and silence in the face of a <em>moral assassination</em> on the highest values of the Bosniak, Muslim man, the supporters of the neo-communist concept are trying to cheat (mostly) the Bosniak people into believing that it is possible, through dry words about the <em>market economy</em> and <em>open society</em>, to achieve a free and integrated state of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  There can be no prosperity nor a healthy open society nor a happy future without the solution of the national question in Bosnia-Hercegovina!  There can be no free citizens unless every nation is also free!  And only that people is free who lives in its faith and on its (therefore also our, common) land.  "This is the Balkans, dear," says a Sarajevo poet.  Every European nation would behave like the Balkan peoples if their national questions were not resolved!<P>

The moderate right concept offers a solution.  I dare say that in the present conditions that is the only solution.  We can observe some developments in that direction.  For example, <strong>Croatian Christian-Democratic Party</strong>, led by <strong>Marko Veselica</strong> and <strong>Ante Kovacevic</strong> has been registered in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  These politicians and their party support, verbally and in practice, whole and common Bosnia-Hercegovina (it is interesting that usually very loud Bosnian opposition did not find it necessary to criticize the founding of this party, although it introduces christian values into politics.  What would have happened if a Bosniak Islamic party were to register itself?!  I think that our oppositionists couldn't wait to fight against the "supporters of the religious totalitarianism" among the Bosniak people!)<P>

Although the strongest parties usually do not enter coalitions before the elections, it is my humble opinion that SDA, which openly supports traditional, religious values, could form a coalition with parties of this kind, provided that a Serb Bosnian party which would affirm traditional Orthodox values forms in the future.  <strong>That would be the strongest Bosnian front which would build a free and integrated state in which all peoples and individuals would prosper.</strong>  And in some future time of <strong>post-nationalism</strong>, when none of the national, including Bosniak, identities is endangered, we will start to build a free civic state and will unite based on the political philosophy which focuses on a citizen.<P>

<h1>Bosanski Petrovac Will Be Renamed</h1>

<strong><em>by Isnam Taljic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Ljiljan, Sarajevo-Ljubljana, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 9/25/96</h2>

It takes less than half an hour by car to reach Bosanski
Petrovac from Bihac.  Half an hour of comfortable driving. Although
neglected because of the war, this is the best Bosnian road.  Formerly
the AVNOJ road, since September 1995 it has been named the Bosnian Army road.
Then, the Fifth Bosnian Army Corps passed through this area.  And it wouldn't have 
stopped before the Drina river [on the border with Serbia], had not General
<strong>Atif Dudakovic</strong> and his Krajisnici been ordered to cease
their offensive as they approached Prijedor.<P>

That's history.  Still... Nevertheless, the Krajisnici are still dreaming about
the Drina.  They are the most spiteful part of the Bosniak people.  These
people hold on to their dreams.<P>

After passing the images of the catastrophe on the outskirts of Bihac, where
Chetniks celebrated for four years and picked which parts of the city
to bomb, we pass next to a unique memorial to their barbarity
in Ripac, where in the former [Muslim] cemetery one can see a plaque which
states that a nearby mosque has been destroyed during the war; later, one reaches
the expanse of Medeno Field where Krajisnici have always raced their horses;
this tradition has been renewed this summer.  The Grmec mountain dominates in the
background; during the last seventy years it has been called Starina, and
now again Hadzija Grmec.  Next to the road one can see a slightly "modified"
plane from W.W.II which used to be a part of the so-called Partisan airport 
museum: some playful Krajisnik fired a "zolja" [shoulder launched anti-tank 
weapon] and cut the plane in two; the plane gained in historical authenticity
and can now only be used as scrap metal.<P>

<h2>Hamdan Bey Kulenovic Was Cut Down and Burned in his House</h2>

Finally, as if in the palm of a hand, houses, like patterns on a green
carpet - panorama of Bosanski Petrovac.  But without mosque minarets with which
this city announced itself to a traveller from afar.  Serbs from the 
mountains came out of <em>that</em> poem by <strong>Skender Kulenovic</strong>
as destroyers of minarets and Bosniak lives; between 1992 and 1995 they did
everything to destroy all traces of Bosniak presence in Bosanski Petrovac.
They only kept the second part of the city's name, Petrovac, because it referred
to <strong>Petar Karadordevic</strong> after whom Vrcar-Vakuf had been 
named Mrkonjic Grad.  With  the same zeal with which they destroyed
all traces of Bosniak presence in the town,  those servants of Kulenovic
beys killed their former benefactor <strong>Hamdija Bey Kulenovic</strong>:
they killed him and burned his corpse in his own house.<P>

The slaughter of Bosniaks in this city started on June 2, 1992.  69 civilians
were killed, among them a one year old child, and the whole family of <strong>
Sevko Balic</strong>, father, mother, son and daughter.<P>

Serbs sadistically destroyed two mosques in Bosanski Petrovac and one each 
in Razenovac and Bjelaj; the destruction was rooted in their style of warfare 
and the belief that 
a crime is not a crime without witnesses; during that time Bosanski Petrovac
was turned into a concentration camp for the local Bosniaks.  The Serbs went so far as to force
the detained Bosniaks to clear the ruins.  Then, once they had enough of killing,
the Serbs expelled the remaining Bosniaks on September 24.  But not in the 
direction of Bihac because their fear that the expelled Bosniaks
will return from Bihac as liberators.<P>

Still the freedom arrived to Bosanski Petrovac from Bihac.  Among the liberators,
who on September 15, 1992, entered the town, there were about 20 Bosniaks who had
been expelled from this town.<P>

Several hundreds of Bosniaks from Bosanski Petrovac fought in the Bosnian Army 
units during the war.  Most of them in the Third and Seventh Corps, especially
in the Third and Seventeenth brigades. Although they were systematically resettled,
and although a large portion left Bosnia (2,000 out of original 3,500),
those who stayed in Bosnia fulfilled their duty to the homeland.<P>

"<strong>About ten percent of the pre-war Bosniak population of Bosanski Petrovac
fought in the units of the Bosnian Army.  We have 16 shehids [martyrs for Islam]
and 20 registered disabled soldiers.  We try to fulfil our duty towards
those families.  All wives of soldiers who died in combat are employed.  We
found employment even for those without adequate education.  We also try to
take care of orphans and that is the priority in the budget of Una-Sana canton...
At the same time we haven't found evidence that even a single citizen of Serb
nationality had behaved as a patriot during the occupation of this city and
had resisted the destruction of Bosnia and Bosniaks.  Now, we are preparing
detailed lists of all [Serb] criminals</strong>," emphasizes <strong>Mithad Hidic</strong>,
two time wounded member of the famous 501st brigade, commander of a unit in
the famous battalion <em>Ljutoc</em>, who after the liberation of Bosanski
Petrovac took over the position of the President of the War Presidency and later
also that of the head of the municipality.<P>

<h2>How Can a Petar [Peter] be Related to a Bosnian Town?</h2>

Young and energetic mayor Hidic is determined to renew the Bosniak spirit of the
town which had been suppressed for years only to be finally destroyed in the war.
Because, Bosanski Petrovac is, although one wouldn't expect that because of its name
and recent history, a Bosniak town [in 1991 Bosanski Petrovac had 15,500 inhabitants,
75.2% of which were Serbs, 21.1% Muslims and 3.7% others].  The impression that
this town was a Serb strongholds is only skin deep.  That impression is the result
of customary Serb insolence, inclination towards mythomania and fabrications,
and utilization of changes during the formation of two Yugoslavias.  Therefore,
certain <strong>Petar Karadordevic</strong> [Serbian king, founder of the first
Yugoslavia after W.W.I] is absolutely irrelevant here.  Because, the first
inhabitants of this locality were called Japodi.  Their town was named Pset.
In this area there are also remnants of a Roman town and the ancient temple of the
old Bosniak religion.  Later, the Ottomans established a fort in this verdant
field and built a caravan stop on the long road from Bihac towards Kljuc
and Sarajevo.  The name of <strong>Hadzialahovac</strong> is mentioned. 
Novoselska Kapetanija was also founded in this area.  <strong>Skender Kulenovic</strong>
[20th century Bosnian writer from Bosanski Petrovac] mentions this in his work
 <em>Ponornica</em>, and the local history aficionados
mention one of the poet's ancestors, <strong>Ali-Captain Kulenovic</strong>,
as the founder of the modern Bosanski Petrovac,  tracing his origin all the
way to <strong>Kulin-Captain</strong>.  Of course there's no trace of Serbs
in this area.  First Orthodox Christians were brought later by Kulenovic Beys,
as convenient servants; the Orthodox were not required to serve in the army
and were obedient workers, grateful for being pulled from poverty in Romania;
a few of them were from Serbia.<P>

"<strong>This town has a long and rich past and it doesn't deserve to bear the 
name of the Petrovic dynasty or some Petar</strong>," says <strong>Ahmet Hidic</strong>,
technical secretary of the <em>Party for Democratic Action</em> [SDA, major
Bosnian Muslim political party], which in the recent elections confirmed total
domination in this region.<P>

It is rare to find so many people knowledgeable in the history of their region
as in Bosanski Petrovac.  All of them are of the same opinion, which is also shared
by all the local inhabitants: Bosanski Petrovac should be renamed.  True, there
are more pressing problems, but it is certain that they will soon find a new name for
their city.  They shouldn't be accused of intolerance for this; it is characteristic that the Orthodox
church in the center of the town hasn't been damaged since the liberation.<P>

<h2>Refugee El Dorado: the Whole Municipality in one Town</h2>

Allah willing, a mosque will be built next to the church in the future.  First, the destroyed
mosques will be rebuilt.  The first ones in the line for reconstruction are not 
those mosques demolished by the Serbs during this war but one of the 13 local
mosques which had been destroyed by the [Serbs] neighbors in W.W.II - the old city mosque
in the center of the town.  The new mosque will look exactly as the old one.
It will be the basis for the transformation of a Bosnian quasi-town into a modern
Bosniak [Muslim] city from which the signs of its former masters are slowly 
disappearing.  For example, next to a bookstore named <em>Ljiljan</em> [Bosnian
coat of arms] there is a bookstore named <em>Medugorje</em>, written in Cyrillic
letters [Cyrillic alphabet is used by Serbs].  As some may say: No one, bre 
[word "characteristic" of Serbian "peasant" speech] has what Serbs had in that
Petrovac!  The main city square was named after certain <strong>Milan Jokic</strong>
whose contribution even the Serbs couldn't recall.  And Kusavi Square is still
defiled by an abandoned Chetnik drinking hole called <em>Fruska Gora</em>!<P>

True, I said that there are more pressing concerns in this town, but...<P>

One of the local curiosities is that the whole municipality has today
as many inhabitants as before the war lived in the town.  All the villages
were destroyed in the war.  This municipality is also one of the most 
spacious in Bosnia.<P>

Going through the data we find out that almost none of the local Bosniaks 
who found refuge outside Bosnia have returned!  Those thousand or so who 
stayed in Bosnia came back.  Consequently, today there are twice as many 
Bosniaks resettled from other parts of Bosnia as the locals!  The new 
arrivals already feel at home in the town.  Most of them are from Prnjavor,
while quite a lot of them come from Bosanska Gradiska.<P>

How were these people received?  Are there tensions between them and the 
locals?  There are many possible questions but the answers to them, 
based on the impressions of <em>Ljiljan's</em> journalist, are
outrageously favorable.  New arrivals were received with open arms.  
Collective accommodation was used only on the day immediately after the arrival
and the people were placed in houses and apartments on the following day.
Food and the donations are distributed equally among the locals and the new
arrivals. Of course it is natural that the people who have lost their homes
and property feel differently, but it is true that in this town they often
have better accommodations than those who lived here before the war.  One should
add that resettled persons account for over 80% of employees in the municipality!  
Some of them are on key managerial positions.  It is true that the response
of the locals may seem idyllic but it is undeniably grounded in reality:<P>

"<strong>All of us, Bosniaks from Bosanski Petrovac, who have returned to our 
home town, had experienced the life in exile so that we try to be good hosts.
Also we are waiting for the return of our compatriots from abroad, who have
apparently forgotten about their town.  Their houses and apartments are 
waiting for them.</strong>"<P>

<h2>More Than 20,000 Bosniaks Will Be Settled in Bosanski Petrovac</h2>

Counting the returnees, all accommodations in Bosanski Petrovac have been
occupied.  There is no more space.  But there is a lot of space on the 
territory of the municipality, which is one of the largest in Bosnia.
Today it is also one of the least populated municipalities under the control
of the official government in Sarajevo, although there are certainly
similar examples among the municipalities (un)officially controlled by Zagreb
[Croatia] and Belgrade [Serbia], or Grude [Bosnian Croats] and Pale [Bosnian
Serbs].<P>

"<strong>Repopulation of the municipality is our project for the future, and 
agriculture the basis for our future economy!</strong>" says Mithad Hidic.<P>

This is a realistic plan, based on the past experience.  Although
just before the start of Serb aggression this municipality had about 15,000
inhabitants, before W.W.II the more than 30,000 people lived in this area.
And lived well; without any industry.<P>

The existing industrial infrastructure (logging, textiles and plastic) is
slowly being reactivated but the agriculture is the real opportunity for
this region; also the overpopulation of some regions in Bosnia convinces one
that Bosniaks will migrate here.<P>

"<strong>We have enough state owned land which we will give to those who
are willing to resettle here,</strong>" states Hidic.<P>

"How will you resolve the problem of their accommodation and the realization
of concrete plans in agriculture?" we ask.<P>

"<strong>German government has a program for building of such villages and
this municipality should get priority because we lack population.  If we
receive assistance from Bihac and Sarajevo and, above all, the international
community in realization of attractive programs, then we can expect the response
from thousands of Bosniaks.  Based on the size and agricultural potentials
of our municipality we expect to eventually settle 30,000 Bosniaks in our
municipality.</strong>"<P>

<strong>Enver Ferizovic</strong>, an experienced expert in the Agricultural
service claims that the soil will certainly give its contribution to the local 
plans for resettlement and the development of agriculture but the people are
urgently needed.<P>

"<strong>We need people as well as the funds to buy mechanization and cattle.  
We were given seed potato, onion, carrots and were very successful.  There
are a lot of fields and pastures in this area, but the situation at the moment 
is not satisfactory.  The animal fund has been totally devastated during the war.
Only 20 tractors remain out of 800 before the war.  So far, we have received
10 cows from Tyrol and expect another 45 and some mechanisation,</strong>"
adds Ferizovic.<P>

<h1>Protect the Serbs in Sarajevo the Way They Protect Bosniacs and Croats in Banja Luka, Prijedor... </h1>
<FONT SIZE="+1">
<h2><em>by Mehmed Buhic</em>, Nova Bosna, Frankfurt, Germany, 12/30/95</h2>

The recent peace agreement,  sometimes referred to as the Paris agreement, states that the Serbs can stay in their houses and continue their life with those with whom they have lived for decades.  Obviously, there is nothing unclear about this except that some are pretending to be crazy and saying that "something isn't clear."  The ones saying this are mostly the Serbs who during this war have looted Bosniac houses in Ilidza, Grbavica, Vogosca, Ilijas...  They moved into the houses and now at rallies howl how these places are their "centuries old hearths."   The fact that some of the towns around Sarajevo are 20-30 years old clearly shows how old they really are.  Whatever; it doesn't matter whether these Serb hearths are centuries or decades old; what is much more important is what is happening around the attempts that the Serbs stay in those parts of Sarajevo and our state occupied by them.<P>

<h2>Soviet Baits</h2>

Yes, we understand that our authorities are trying to preserve the multinational and multicultural, secular state of Bosnia-Hercegovina and with it the city of Sarajevo.  We also know that this approach opens doors of world institution and gains sympathy of all those who are for the coexistence and the survival of differences.  However, we also know that the Serbian nation is something completely different from the rest of the civilized world which , it seems, better understands what those Serbs have done to us and what they would do in the future if given a chance.<P>

Many powerful world politicians, actually their spokesmen, have joined the horrendous campaign that aims to keep the Serbs in Sarajevo and around it.  First, a certain French general interceded for the Serbs as if they were, at least, the victims of this war, and not the unbelievable slaughterers whose bloody hands cannot wash even the Drina river across which, if there is God's justice, they would have to flee.  That French attempt to protect the Serbs was actually a bait whose purpose was to test the public opinion; when it became obvious that this wouldn't work, the general was recalled to Paris and kept there.  After that, unfortunately, the American general, Leighton Smith, who is also in charge of IFOR, promised to the Serbs the delay of the withdrawal from the occupied Sarajevo; more correctly, he promised the modification of the Dayton agreement.  To what extent this American general can modify the Dayton Agreement, which even Clinton didn't want to change, we don't know; however we are certain that this is another dirty trick whose victims are the Bosniacs and, with them, the Croats.  Our highest representatives have reacted to those moves and, as is usually said in the political jargon, pointed out the consequences of such behavior; therefore, we are now awaiting new plots whose goal will be to deceive our people and our liberators.<P>

<h2>Hypocritical and Unseemly Behavior</h2>

The attempts of the Serbs and their leaders, most of whom are the greatest war criminals in the history of humankind, are not surprising, especially if one has in mind that we are talking about the people and persons banished from all records of humanity.  On the other hand, the ignorance of the world factors of everything that those very same Serbs have done is shocking.  Especially since no-one, at least as far as we know, hasn't raised his voice for the Bosniacs, inhabitants of Prijedor and Kozarac, who were the absolute majority of population in these towns before the Serb fascist aggression.  As if the dear God hasn't created them.<P>

It seems that those same generals and generalissimus' think that the Bosniacs are sheep who can be fooled by anyone, anytime and even , if necessary, killed.  Even more interesting is the fact that during the fuss over the Serbs in Sarajevo, the Serbs who "slid" to Sarajevo from the Durmitor mountain [a mountain in Montenegro] and are now trying to stay where they are, not asking whose houses or apartments they are using and where the actual owners are, in seher  Banja Luka they are still killing  women, children, elderly, priests, Bosniacs and Croats.  It seems that those same world humanitarians don't care about this, as they don't care that much that in that same Banja Luka their convoys with food are being hijacked, vehicles stolen and employees beaten up.<P>

It is not difficult to divine what are the reasons for such a hypocritical behavior of the French and Americans and English, let alone Russians.<P>

One doesn't have to be farsighted to notice the attempts at marginalization of Bosniacs in Sarajevo.  Namely, now the data that during this Serb aggression and unprecedented slaughter of the Bosniacs a certain number of mixed marriages were contracted in Sarajevo are being spread everywhere.  We don't need to be too intelligent to figure out the actual goal of propaganda tricks similar to those stating how many Serbs stayed in Sarajevo and remained loyal to the current and legal authorities in Bosnia-Hercegovina. <P>

<h2>Don't Stop Them!</h2>

We don't intend to question the published data which, to tell the truth we don't find all that interesting, but it should be said that the number of mixed marriages and loyal Serbs is so small that is doesn't deserve a lot of attention.  Unfortunately, the things are completely different and we are, as usual, falling for such tricks.  Again, in us awakens our charitable feeling which protects members of the Serbian butcher people; we are almost babbling with them, making heroes out of them by saying that they suffered more, that they suffered from the torture both from the hills and from their immediate environment (?!).<P>

As usually, we then do favors to those Serbs and give them privileges; it is not surprising to see that on some functions and in some institutions the percentage of Serbs is much higher than their fair share.<P>

Those same Serbs know what they are doing just like those in certain serb citizen councils who are demanding the third of power in the state and insisting to be recognized as a constitutional nation while at the same time they are not touching the so-called republic of srpska.  If it were like they demanded, the Serbs from those citizen councils would be given much more power than the criminals from Pale are seeking and have ever sought.<P>

We mustn't forget these facts as we mustn't stop Serbs when they want to leave Sarajevo and its surroundings, let alone stop them when they dig out from our Bosniac soil the stinking bodies of their dead: let them take the bodies to the hills, lairs, and holes from which they have been killing the Bosniacs for three years, making from Sarajevo the greatest mezarje [graveyard] in the world.<P>

No we shouldn't prevent them from taking everything they can from the houses and apartments since those things, although Bosniac property, have been soiled: better let them take it away, so that we don't have to burn it and pollute the air.<P>

As far as the appeal to the Serbs to stay in certain parts of Sarajevo is concerned, one should be precise about it.  They should be given the rights which they give to the Bosniacs and the Croats in Banja Luka.  They should be kept at their "centuries old hearths", the same way they keep Bosniacs and Croats in Mrkonjic Grad and Sipovo.  Of course that they should be brought back to their houses, the same way they bring back the inhabitants of Bosanski Novi, Bosanska Dubica, Bijeljina...<P>

Otherwise we should wish them a good trip all the way to their mother Serbia and a low level of water in the Drina river.  So that it doesn't carry them and they don't pollute the river...<P>

<H1>Chemical Weapons in the Service of Genocide</h1>

<h2>by Azra Terzic, Nova Bosna, 12/30/95, Frankfurt, Germany</h2>

<hr>

Enormous crimes have been committed against the Bosnian population in the last three years.  All possible war schools have been tried out against the Bosnian people.  Previously untested weapons have been used against innocent civilians.<P>

Only recently, the world media have started writing somewhat more about the mass use of chemical weapons against civilian targets; chemical weapons which had been produced for years in the Serbian factories of death.  One of these deadly factories was located on the territory of Bosnia-Hercegovina, in the township of Potoci near Mostar.  The former JNA installed in the village of Potoci the machinery for the production of chemical weapons.  This was a nucleus from which later developed a whole industrial complex with completely isolated production-research facilities.  The production of the toxin of the type SARIN  which has a short term effect begun in the factory in Potoci.<P>

<h2>Long Lasting Effects of SIPERIT</h2>

Later, the production of SIPERIT, a poison gas with long term effects, was started.  For years on the slopes of the Vitez mountain, far from the eyes of the public, numerous experiments were performed: contamination of the terrain and experiments on animals.  Only those with security clearance could work in the factories of death.  The employees were usually brought in from Serbia and Montenegro.  Many people from the Mostar area remember Serbians and Montenegrins who arrived with their families.  Their wives were village teachers and spewed out "knowledge" to Bosniac children.  All that was conceived under the guise of brotherhood and unity.  Of course that now, after the discovery of everything that took place in Potoci the older locals remember that their sheep, cows and horses used to die for no reason.  Domestic animals used to produce offspring without hair and with deformities.  All this was of course, the effect of the toxins and their vapors.  The whole monstrosity of the crime surfaced during the war when the Serbo-Montenegrin Armada, incapable to change the situation on the front, turned to the deadly chemical weapons which destroy nervous system and cause changes on the body.<P>

According to the reports which have been completed these days by the experts from the Army of Bosnia-Hercegovina (ABH), the mass production of the chemical weapons in Potoci started in 1984.  In that year, a technological line for the production of psychological toxins of the type BZ with the capacity of 5kg per day was established.  Those very same psychological toxins will have a decisive deadly role in the killing of the inhabitants of Srebrenica and Zepa.  According to the report of the military experts from ABH, during those years, the experts of the former JNA feverishly worked on the development of the production of nerve poisons such as SOMAN, VX, TABUN and others.  At that time began the collaboration with Iraq, to which large quantities of chemical weapons were sold.  Colonel Bozidar Dzakula, M.Sc., was in charge of the whole project of the production and use of chemical weapons.<P>

<h2>Poisonous Projectiles</h2>

In the factories of the former JNA began the production of the artillery shells with the caliber of 122mm  which were filled with 1,8 liters of poison.  152 mm shell could be filled with 3.5 liters of poison gas...  Airplane shells BAD 100 could hold as much as 20 liters of poison gas.  Even landmines filled with poison gases were produced.  All produced chemical weapons were stored in the military dump in Zunovnica.  From that storage dump, at the beginning of 1992, 40 tones of raw materials necessary for the production of SARIN were taken for the former JNA.  Since 1990, military experts at the Military Technical Institute in Belgrade have been feverishly investigating lack of iodine in the water supply of Srebrenica and Zepa.  More precisely, they were trying to establish the consequences of the lack of iodine and salt on the human body.<P>

In seems that even before the beginning of the war and mass suffering, Srebrenica and Zepa were earmarked for mass experiments on their population.  It is not an accident that the former JNA and than also the criminals Karadzic and Mladic with their collaborators forbade the transport of salt to Srebrenica where the population was suffering en masse from the thyroid.  Lack of salt together with the occasional bombardment with poison gases had a horrendous effect of the human body.<P>

Srebrenica could have been occupied much earlier, with its disarmed population and cowardly behavior of the Dutch soldiers...<P>

<h2>The West Knew Everything</h2>

However, according to the Serb Armada strategic goals at the time, it was more important to kill from time to time and observe what was happening to the population of Srebrenica than to immediately enter the town, slaughter the inhabitants and occupy the enclave.  Srebrenica was a long time ago, it seems, predestined to become the training ground for various biochemical experiments.  That is why it has been said that the West had known everything and had been warned on time; however they were also eager to obtain the results of the monstrous Serb experiments.  Only now it is becoming clear why in every enclave, besides UN soldiers there were also experts for atomic and biochemical warfare who were always studying something in the field.  No one was interested in what they were doing; only now it is clear what function they had.<P>

Therefore, the West has known everything, but it reacted slowly.  Poison gases were specifically produced with the aim to destroy the human psychic and unconsciousness.  After a release of the gas in a certain area , the contaminated persons exhibit uncontrolled behavior.  People from Srebrenica even now, after all the horror they have been through, talk about the horrendous effects of chemical weapons.  Those affected by the poison gas used to shout that they didn't want to fight or move towards the free territory, but instead went straight towards the chetniks.  People would become apathetic, scream when the chetniks were nearby or "drink" water from nonexistent streams; they hallucinated that huge blocks of ice were falling on them...  Chetniks would infiltrate their criminals among the poisoned  people and kill them.<P>

<h2>Experiments on Camp Inmates</h2>

The criminals would usually distribute hand grenades which would soon be activated.  It is possible that the chetniks were interested in how long the poison gas remains effective, what the limits of human stamina are and for how long it was possible to control the contaminated people.  The camp prisoners from Manjaca, Keraterm, Bratunac, Batkovic and other camps, emphasize that the guards in the camps poured, in front of everyone, white powder in the water which was given to the prisoners; after that the prisoners were even more thirsty than before, became apathetic and resigned.<P>

The tragedy of the population of Bosnia-Hercegovina, must not be ignored.  Among the many accusations of genocide we should include this one about the mass crimes committed by the experts of the former JNA who produced chemical weapons; and certainly those who ordered these monstrosities should also pay.<P>

<hr>

<h2> Mesic's Testimony</h2>

<em>The testimony of Stipe Mesic, the last president of the former presidency of SFRY who sent the classified documents about chemical weapons to the USA, confirms that the West knew about these criminal experiments.<P>

"In June, 1991, while I was the president of the presidency of the former SFRY, by chance I stumbled across some documentation about the production of chemical weapons.  I believed that such activity was dangerous, not only for this area, but also for the international community.  Since it was obvious that a war would break out soon, one could assume that the possible use of these weapons could cause a catastrophe.  Therefore, I used this situation to inform certain circles in the American administration about the case.  Short time after that, I was taken to the USA where I turned the documents over to the accredited Pentagon officials," emphasizes Stjepan Mesic after the discovery of the massive use of poison gases in Bosnia-Hercegovina against the civilian population.</em><P>

<h1>Croats Insist on the Division of the City</h1>

<h2> Nova Bosna, 12/30/95, Frankfurt, Germany</h2>

In the statement issued yesterday regarding the implementation of the Dayton agreement, the Mostar County Presidency emphasizes that the Croatian side insists on the division of the city as the division of the war loot along the line of separation.  Croatian representatives, led by Mijo Brajkovic, said that they didn't have a mandate to change the borders which were the result of the war, which is unacceptable for the Bosniac side.  More than 20,000 Bosniacs were expelled from their homes in Mostar and are now mostly in the Western European countries.  The acceptance of the Croatian proposal would be loke saying to the citizens of Mostar that they cannot return to their city, which is one of the goals of the Croat policy.  In the statement of the Mostar County Presidency it is emphasized that such position of the Croat side augurs the ethnic division within the Bosniac-Croat Federation and therefore, contravenes the provisions of the Dayton agreement about the building of the Federation.  The Bosniac side offered two solutions: the first one, in which the old center of the city would be preserved with its multiethnic character and the second one where common municipalities with majority Bosniac population would be formed.  Neither one of the Bosniac proposals which are in agreement with the results of the population census from 1991 was accepted by the Croats.<P>

The offer made by the Bosniac side balanced the demographic structure of the population in all municipalities so that every citizen, regardless of his or hers nationality, would be guaranteed security in any one of the future six Mostar municipalities.  At the end of the statement, the Mostar County Presidency says that the Bosniac side will not compromise the principles of justice and equality for all citizens of Mostar and will request arbitration and participation of all relevant international institutions in this process.<P>

<h1><a NAME="serbs">Amnestied Serbs Carry Out Terrorist Attacks</a></h1>

<strong><em>by A. Terzic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nova Bosna, Frankfurt, Germany, 3/19 1996</h2>

With the arrival of peace, the inhabitants of Bosnia are daily facing different deadly dangers.  Throughout Bosnia-Hercegovina people are daily dying from mines and explosive devices which the aggressor has left behind.  The most terrible are the deaths of children who loose themselves in their games and forget to pay attention to where they are going.  Three big explosions occured in only 48 hours in Sarajevo, Sanski Most and Zenica.  Bosnian authorities blame amnestied Serbs for them.<P>

Still, the accidents happen despite warnings and efficient work of the competent authorities.  Three big explosions have happened in three places throughout Bosnia-Hercegovina within only 48 hours.<P>

A bomb exploded in Sarajevo at the dawn of March 11 in Ferhadija mosque.  The detonation woke up citizens in the central part of the city.  The following day, at 3 a.m., a huge fire destroyed the bus station in Zenica together with five new buses; explosions were heard for a while in the immediate neighborhood of the gas station and train station.  A day later, after retired general Mehmed Alagic had been elected for the mayor of that city, several fires destroyed numerous commercial buildings.  The fires were most probably the work of arsonists.  The fire engulfed the Privredna Bank offices as well as some apartments.  After these events, one wonders whether the amnesty for all suspicious people was enacted too soon.<P>

<h1><a NAME="compromise">Enough Compromise, We are the Victims</a></h1>

<h2>Nova Bosna, Frankfurt, Germany, 3/19 1996</h2>


Ankara, March 18:  After an unsuccessful American attempt to raise money for arming of the Bosnian Army, Muhamed Sacirbey, personal envoy of president Izetbegovic gave a short statement for <em>Nova Bosna</em>:<P>

"Too much arms is not a cause of war, but too much arms in wrong hands is.  The representatives of the European Union who are against the arming of the Bosnian Army should know that.  On the other hand, there was not enough arms for defense and avoidance of the aggression.  In order to achieve that what our neighbors already have, the Federal army would have to be given arms and technical assistance while both Serb and Croat sides would have to reduce their capacities on all levels.  Above all, the program of rearmament and training would ensure that the Federation can demobilize as many as 80 percent of the soldiers who were mobilized in war conditions; at the same time the accommodations for those soldiers would have to be established in the barracks, as was stipulated in the Dayton Agreement.  So far, we were only able to counter Serb dominance in armament by fielding a large number of soldiers."<P>

Sacirbey emphasized that the conditions for the integration of Bosnia-Hercegovina into the western defense system, including NATO, should be established.  "Those who view the rearmament and training program only as an increase in armament in the region, haven't offered an alternative and their "arguments" are only made at the expense of the victim.  Inhabitants of Bosnia made painful compromises when they signed the peace agreement with the aggressor; hopefully, they deserve to be able to say 'never again'."<P>

Muhamed Sacirbey didn't hide his disappointment with the behavior or the European Union representatives which again didn't "understand" the root of the problem.<P>

<h1><a NAME="howling">Their Signs and Howling are all in Vain</a></h1>

<strong><em>by M. B.</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nova Bosna, Frankfurt, Germany, 3/19 1996</h2>    

Serb protesters have recently demonstrated and carried all kinds of signs in Belgrade.  Of course, all of them have the same content - the overthrow of present [Serbian] authorities.  But, as far as Bosniaks [Bosnian Muslims], Croats, Albanians and Hungarians and all others living in the territory of the former Yugoslavia are concerned, those signs mean nothing.  Because Serbo-Montenegrin politics and all politicians hate the above listed nations.  Therefore we shouldn't be happy because of three-finger [Serb salute] demonstrations and howling: they are all fascists and butchers; butchers like those are rare in history.  As far as this sign is concerned, it is easy to guess what is it about: serves them well.[There are two signs on the picture next to the article; one of them says "the house of flowers was reduced to a flower in hair"; former president Tito was buried in the House of Flowers in Belgrade.  President Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, who is considered to be the power behind the throne and is the founder of the refounded Yugoslav Communist party, often wears a flower in her hair;  the other sign says "I am on a hunger strike - I live from my salary"]<P>

<h1><a NAME="expelled">Expelled Bosniaks from Stolac and Capljina Visit Their Cemeteries</a></h1>

<h2>Nova Bosna, Frankfurt, Germany, 3/19 1996</h2>


More than 400 expelled persons from Stolac and Capljina visited yesterday the graves of their relatives and friends in spite of many obstacles.  The visit was agreed by the representatives of the war councils in the counties of Capljina and Stolac and IFOR.  This development of the situation followed the firm decision of the expelled persons to block the road M-17 for everyone except the IFOR soldiers if the visit is not organized.  After a several hour wait the group of Capljina inhabitants left and visited the graves.  Some of them were satisfied with the visit while the others, who didn't succeed to visit the graves, were disappointed because they were so close and still, after four years, weren't able to visit the graves.<P>

Expelled persons from Stolac and Capljina waited for two days for a permission to visit the cemeteries.  On the road to Capljina and Stolac, expelled Bosniaks were followed by the IFOR forces.  There were no incidents during the visit.<P>

Croatian media hurried to inform that the "muslim citizens" blocked the access to Mostar.  According to a HABENA [Bosnian Croat official news agency] report they stopped and abducted several Croat civilians, mostly drivers, at a checkpoint in Kovacine.  What else is there to say than that this is huge lie.

<h1>Who Was Protecting Serbs in Sarajevo?</h1>

<em><Strong>by Sabina Hadzic</strong></em><P>

<h2>Slobodna Bosna, Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina, March 8, 1996</h2>

Newspaper correspondence between a Bosnian Presidency member Dr. <strong>Mirko Pejanovic</strong> and brigadier general <strong>Jovan Divjak</strong> has again brought attention to the Ristovic family murder which was a subject of rumors at the beginning of the war in Sarajevo.<P>

According to an unofficial statement from the Defense Ministry and the General Staff of the Bosnian Army, on July 8, 1992, around 1:20 p.m., approximately at lunch time, the <strong>Ristovic family(Radosava (61), her two sons, Pero and Obren, daughter Bosa, then 14-year-old Danilo Ristovic and Mila Ristovic)</strong> was murdered in 144 Gornji Velesici.  Mila's husband <strong>Dusko</strong> and a young woman <strong>Stojanka Mastilo</strong> were wounded.  The official statement claimed that the crime had been committed by "three unidentified persons who drove away in a car, model Volkswagen Golf; the car was without number plates and was marked with Territorial Defense insignia."<P>

The victims were buried at the "Lion" cemetery; the Defense Ministry and the Bosnian police issued a statement in which they condemned this "vile act" and promised to quickly find the murderers.<P>

<h2>Murderers Were Policemen</h2>

In January 1993, Police filed a case with the Higher
 Prosecutors office in Sarajevo.  It accused five policemen for the murder; two of the accused were at large, while the other three were still in Sarajevo.<P>

After a short detention and a trial, the murderers of the six Ristovics were acquitted on the grounds of their mental incompetence and released to be "treated".  This much was made public and the case was consequently closed.<P>

During the last three years, no one has been paying attention to the murder.  There have been no requests to reopen the investigation, although the people who know the truth about the case still live in Sarajevo.<P>

On the day of the murder, Stojanka Mastilo, who was at the house at the time of the crime, was brought in for questioning to the Bosnian Territorial Defense Military Police.  She said that the murderers had worn police badges and identified one of them.  She also identified the car in which the murderers had arrived to the Ristovic house:  a day before the murder the car had been, in addition to another vehicle and a tractor, confiscated from the Ristovics.  Policemen who carried out the murders drove to the Ristovic house in that Volkswagen.  A day after the murder, Stojanka saw the same car parked in front of the police headquarters.<P>

General <a HEF="/info/students/marko/oslob/oslob8.html">Jovan Divjak</a> said the following about that case: "When we found out about the murder at the headquarters, Bilajac and myself immediately informed the chief of staff, Sefer Halilovic.  Sefer said that he would see that the criminals were arrested and appropriately punished, and that he would inform the public about that.  I know that Sefer Halilovic knew the identity of the murderers six hours later; however, nothing was done.  Those who are responsible for that must explain why nothing was done.  Six months after the massacre, I found out that some of the murderers had been arrested and released on the grounds that they were mentally incompetent.  Sefer claimed in September that everything was being taken care of and that the public would be informed once the case was legally regulated.  But the public hasn't been informed.  Nothing has been done."<P>

<h2>More Than 2,000 Sarajevo Serbs Killed and Disappeared in the War</h2> 

Witnesses claim that <strong>Ismet Bajramovic Celo</strong> and <strong>Kerim Lucarevic</strong> demanded from the then police Minister <strong>Jusuf Pusina</strong> a permission to arrest some people from the police and the official who was responsible for the crime.  Jusuf Pusina and <strong>Jerko Doko</strong> gave promises and official statements on behalf of the Police and the Defense Ministry.  That was all.<P>

"There were a lot of mistakes," says one of the people from "the inner circle".  General Divjak doesn't want to talk about the perpetrators.  "I don't want to, it won't change anything.  I don't know their names, I only know where these people served at the time."<P>

"If it turns out that there was outside pressure to find nonexistent mitigating circumstances in the case, that could have been tolerated at the time.  However, if that is true, the case should be reopened now.  And many others as well," says Mirko Pejanovic.<P>

The question of 2,000 disappeared and killed Serbs is a public secret in Sarajevo.  This figure is given by the representatives of Sarajevo Serbs.<P>

Our sources in the Bosnian Army, who wish to stay anonymous, claim that the figure is even higher: more than three thousand persons.<P>

Representatives of the Serb Civic Council have prepared a report about the suffering of the Serbs in unlawful prisons during 1992 and 1993.<P>

That report was submitted to the international and state institutions.  The goal of the action is to find out the truth.  "Most likely, all the information will come out with the coming of peace.  Families will begin to demand to be told the truth.  The Ristovics are a drastic example of lenient sentencing, under the circumstances in which that sort of behavior was possible.  We do not have enough resources to treat each case individually.  It is questionable whether the authorities have managed to root out that sort of behavior.  We must find who was responsible for every loss of life in this war.  Crimes against civilians do not have a statute of limitations," says Pejanovic.<P>

Divjak and Pejanovic do not agree on everything.  Recently, we have seen in the papers general's objections that the Presidency member hadn't done enough to prevent, and later solve, the cases of vigilante "justice" against the Sarajevo Serbs.<P>

"He is an honorable, good and wonderful man,"  was everything general Divjak was willing to say about Dr. Pejanovic for <em>Slobodna Bosna</em>.  The rest is the description of events, as seen by general Jovan Divjak:<P>

<h2>Case "Hrasnica"</h2>

"Taking into account the fact that he was a member of the Presidency and that he was in possession of a lot of information, my judgment is that he didn't do enough, although we did urge him, individually and together, to be more assertive.  We know that in September 1992 he had a list of missing persons.<P>

"Munir Alibasic, then the chief of state security police in Sarajevo, was surprised that Pejanovic hadn't reacted more forcefully.  He didn't have enough courage.  I've told him many times that in February 1993, when Dr. Gagula and a Serb woman, I think her name was Jovanovic, were killed, Miro Lazovic [Croat member of the presidency] reacted and "our people" didn't.  When told this, Pejanovic responds that it was better for us that Lazovic reacted.  It seems to me that there was not enough assertiveness and clarity regarding those who stayed in Sarajevo."<P>

Mirko Pejanovic says that he found out about every single case of murdered and disappeared Serbs.  He didn't get the information from the police but from the relatives.  First information leaked from the prison in hotel "Zagreb".  He could write a book about everything.  Hundreds and hundreds of citizens waited in lines even in front of his house in order to see him and tell him about their problems.<P>

According to the data of the Serb Civic Council, there is no documentation regarding the majority of 2,000 disappeared and killed persons.  Nobody has a "reliable" list of names, because people were simply taken away from their homes and workplaces.  In most cases there is no information about the people who took them away nor where they were buried.  Some of the cases were explained during the trial of Musan Topalovic Caco.  After that, some families demanded to move the corpses of their loved ones from a mass graves on the "Lion" cemetery; bodies of the people who had been executed in Bistrik were buried there.<P>

Pejanovic refers to his efforts in prevention and solving of cases of this sort as "numerous initiatives."  Laws which regulate police and courts have been enacted, disobedient commanders of some units have been replaced or arrested and the illegal prisons for Serbs disbanded.  During 1992 and 1993 there were prisons in Alipasino Polje, Otoka, Dobrinja, in restaurant "Sunce", Hrasnica, Kosevo and the tunnel along the exit towards Pale.  According to the reliable sources, all of these prisons have been disbanded except for the illegal jail in Hrasnica; there are indications that this jail is still operating.  Serb Civic Council representatives have visited Hrasnica several times.  On two occasions they were told that the jail had been disbanded.  However, according to SCC informations,  there is still a jail for Serbs in Hrasnica, operating under the "auspices" of the Fourth Brigade of the First Corps, .<P>

According to the same source, 20 Serbs died in this place as members of single-nation forced labor platoons.<P>

<h2>A Tooth for A Tooth</h2>

The murder of Dr. <strong>Najdanovic</strong>, a professor at the Medical faculty, hasn't been solved until this day.  He was a member of the Bosnian parliament and the Serb Democratic Party before the war.  He was taken from his house to a questioning by people wearing police uniforms.  He was found later at the Kosevo stadium with a bullet in the back of his head.  His wife tried to open an investigation, but the case has never been solved.<P>

Mirko Pejanovic says the following about the circumstances in which all this was happening:<P>

"Uncontrolled groups were in power at the time.  The authorities haven't yet been consolidated.  Local warlords, Caco, Juka and other self-proclaimed warriors, took upon themselves to dispense justice in the situation of total hopelessness and incessant bombardment.  In their own way they avenged the bombardment victims by killing some families in Sarajevo.  We fought against that by consolidating legal authorities and establishing the Council for the Protection of Constitutional Order.  Consequently, by the end of 1993, we have managed to get rid of that mode of living in Sarajevo.  Once we got rid of self-will, we reached a normal situation in which it was possible to investigate everything."<P>

Jovan Divjak emphasizes that it is impossible to talk about the status of Serbs without consideration of the total situation.  Mistakes were made, there was confusion, some events spun out of control.  In the Ristovic family case, he emphasizes that some extremists took it upon themselves to "punish" people who did not behave according to their standards.  Therefore, the murder of Ristovic family is the consequence of the chaos which ruled at the time.<P>

"Even today I insist that more than 10,000 people were killed in Sarajevo, 1,600 of them children. Bosniaks were the main victims.  I keep repeating that, that must be repeated all the time.  But, I'm against that Serb proverb, a tooth for a tooth.  I know of cases in which local commanders would enter Serb apartments, say that the Serbs were guilty of something and take them to their private jails, as was the case in Dobrinja," says Divjak.<P>

In the Serb Civic Council they say that they could have and should have been more assertive in their condemnations of crimes.  Not only crimes against Serbs but crimes in general.  The problem is how to find a way to issue a statement about a death of one or two persons, after the condemnations of the exodus of 30,000 Srebrenica inhabitants or a murder of several tens of persons at the Sarajevo market.  They admit they were afraid.  All our collocutors started conversation by saying: "The one you've just talked to knows much more about this than I do."  It seems that there is enough knowledge.<P>

Whether that "knowledge" will stay where it is, in filing cabinets and drawers, or whether it will be used in order to solve numerous unsolved cases, is as important as the "consolidation of legal authorities" was at the time.<P>

<h1>Evicted, Then Forgotten</h1>

<em><Strong>by Radmila Karlas (AIM)</strong></em><P>

<h2>Slobodna Bosna, Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina, March 8, 1996</h2>

Two elderly people pause for a moment in front of the orphanage <strong>Radmila Vranjesevic</strong> in Banja Luka.  A man without a leg, in a wheelchair and his wife: <strong>Stjepan Bokan</strong> (63), a Croat, and <strong>Honorata</strong> (72) an ethnic Ukrainian; they had been evicted from their own house in Banja Luka three months ago.  For three months these two elderly people moved from acquaintances' homes to apartments of relatives to finally arrive at the only place which at this time offers some sort of shelter.<P>

We can smell the dampness in the air as we enter the orphanage wing in which the evicted persons live.  In one of the rooms we encounter a young woman with a baby son.  <strong>Munira Dulic</strong> is 34-years-old.  She is crying while she tells us about her case.<P>

<strong>"I lived in an apartment in the township of Mejdan with my mother and a child.  My father has died, I've divorced my husband, one of my brothers is in Norway and another one is retarded and lives in Velika Kladusa.  We started having a lot of problems starting with the <a HREF="/info/students/marko/ref.html">Serb exodus from Krajina in August 1995</a>.  Almost daily, armed people were coming to our apartment and telling us to leave, to go to Jajce or Travnik.  They were mostly policemen from counties which remained under Muslim or Croatian control.  During those 'visits', the policemen took away our certificate of ownership for the apartment and twice beat up my mother Mirsada who is very ill."</strong><P>

<h2>We Don't Want to go to Alija, but to our Homes</h2>

One day, Munira set out towards Gornji Seher in order to throw herself and her child from a bridge to the river Vrbas.  She was saved by a woman who happened to be passing by.   Seven men arrived at the beginning of November.  They told her, her mother and her son, who has a heart ailment and suffers from chronic bronchial asthma,  to get out of the apartment in ten minutes.  The men were from Drvar.<P>

<strong>"They tried to convince us to go to our territory; they said, go to Alija.  What am I going to do there?  I could have left this city so many times, but I was born here and I want to stay here regardless of the consequences.  One of them hit me, then my mother; the child started to scream.  We moved to our relatives' place, but they are very poor, so we had to look for another solution.  They sent us here from the Red Cross.  Unfortunately, even here there is a lack of solidarity.  Some have while some don't.  None of the 'neighbors' asks whether I need something.  As if the people have lost the feeling of solidarity,"</strong> concludes Munira.<P>

<strong>Dzevad</strong>, until recently a soldier in the Army of the republic of Srpska from Sipovo near Jajce, lives in the same room.  His being in the Serb army didn't make his life a lot easier.  Today, he doesn't know the whereabouts of his family, nor does he know what will happen to him.<P>

<strong>"The truth must be told,"</strong> says Stjepan Bokan while entering Munira Dulic's room in his wheelchair.  <strong>"When Jajce fell, a neighbor came to me, gave me the keys and told me to go there, and to leave my house to him.  He gave me two and a half hours to decide.  I stayed put, and than he started shouting that both me and my wife would die, and I realized that he wasn't kidding.  He didn't allow us to take anything, not even our personal papers."</strong><P>

While the media in Banja Luka write about Ukrainian-Serb friendship, Stjepan's wife Honorata, an Ukrainian, is bitter that the man who forced them out of their house was their neighbor, neither a refugee nor in any danger.<P>

<strong>Rahima Lisac</strong> (61) used to live behind the department store <strong><em>Boska</em></strong> in the center of the city.  She was the owner of the apartment in which she lived. She lived in the apartment with her 93-years-old mother who died at the orphanage a few days before.<P>

<h2>Even Police are Powerless</h2>

<strong>"My husband and my mother are buried here.  I was born here and I will stay here,"</strong> she says.<strong>  "I was evicted from my apartment by four armed policemen.  They told us that the bus to Travnik was leaving in ten minutes.  That was in October 1995.  I cried and begged them to at least allow me to change in the bathroom.  They didn't let me and than my neighbor and my best friend, Milica Arezina, came into the apartment.   They threatened her as well, but she said that we would remain friends until we die,"</strong> says Rahima who shares a room with another five women.<P>

In one of the rooms, we find eight men, most of them elderly.<P>

<strong>"I stayed in Banja Luka, although other members of my family went to Sweden.  I was fired from a company in which I had worked from more than 30 years; I've had a work obligation for more than two years,"</strong> relates <strong>Mustafa Hasanagic</strong> (60), who is visibly ill.  Now, he will have to move out of Banja Luka; because of his illness he cannot stay at the orphanage, and some policemen are in his house.  <strong>"I have already given a statement for the ICRC, my family has sent the papers from Sweden, and I'll leave soon.  There, I'll perhaps die from sorrow for Banja Luka."</strong><P>

<strong>Asim Gazic</strong> also had a house in the very center of the city.  In his case, Banja Luka police reacted almost 40 times, and he was consequently left alone for a while.  Until November, when he was evicted although he had taken two Serb policemen into his house.<P>

<strong>"Let us be clear,"</strong> says Asim, <strong>"I don't blame all Serbs.  These evictions and looting of houses and apartments were carried out by armed gangs, majority of whom are not from Banja Luka.  Banja Luka Police Chief himself tried to protect me but in the end, the stronger ones prevailed.  Regardless, I am angry at Banja Luka authorities."</strong><P>

<strong>Rifat Dostovic</strong> (59) is a Muslim, his wife Marija a Croat.  They lived alone (they have no children) in a two room apartment in Ante Jakic township in Banja Luka.  Since the August exodus, they have been through a real calvary.<P>

<strong>"I cannot recall all those who beat me.  I have been beaten up more than ten times.  Only because I am a Muslim.  At the suggestion of Banja Luka police, we took in the family of Radosav Misic from Jajce.  Then some other policemen came and threw out both us and those poor souls from the apartment.  They screamed at them that they cannot move in to an apartment in the center of the city,"</strong> says Rifat.  His wife Marija hasn't fared better.  She has also been beaten up by policemen several times.<P>

<h2>This is a Shame for Banja Luka!</h2>

<strong>"At the moment, there are more than 30 persons at the orphanage <em>Rada Vranjesevic</em>; most of them are Muslims, although there are a few Croats,"</strong> stated at the start of our conversation the director of the orphanage, <strong>Danilo Ponjarac</strong>.  <strong>"All of them had been evicted from their apartments and houses and arrived here four months ago.  The Bokans arrived yesterday and we took them in.  This is a shame for this city.  International Committee of Red Cross interceded in all of this cases since these people, immediately after their evictions, were forced to stay at the stairs in front of the ICRC offices, and that is unacceptable.  Banja Luka mayor, Predrag Radic, asked then for my assistance so we adapted the space here in order to be able to provide accommodation for these people.  At first they were supposed to stay here for two weeks until their cases were resolved, but they are still here and no one is doing anything,"</strong> says Ponjarac.  According to Ponjarac, the orphanage has set aside five rooms, one living room and one kitchen for the homeless.  <strong>"Besides them there are 130 orphans of all ethnic backgrounds in the orphanage.  Since at first we didn't get any assistance for evicted persons who were not Serbs, we fed them together with the children.  We gave out 90 meals every day for four months; recently we have started a public kitchen for the poor and evicted persons at the shelter for the poor, so that the situation is now somewhat better.  But that is hardly a solution.  These people are old and ill.  One old lady probably has tuberculosis and another one died two days ago.  We called the Ambulance, but it didn't arrive.  Then we had to move her to the morgue, so we contacted Banja Luka effendi, but they also couldn't help us, so the old woman had to "spend the night" in a room with six living persons.  Finally, the Islamic Community buried her,"</strong> says Danilo Ponjarac.<P>

According to him, some of the people living at the orphanage have filed cases at the Banja Luka court seeking to return to their apartments.  So far none of those cases has been concluded.<P>

<h1>Private State or the state of Private Citizens</h1>

<strong><em>by Senad Avdic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Slobodna Bosna, Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 3/22 1996</h2>

A day before the Bosnian Presidency president, Mr. Alija Izetbegovic, due to his heart problems, left for the hospital treatment, a member of the Bosnian Presidency, Dr. Ivo Komsic had submitted a resignation to the collective head of the state.  Komsic listed seven reasons for his resignation.  Basically, Komsic questions the general role of the presidency in the decision making process in Bosnia and the conditions for its functioning according to its constitutional rights.  In that context he mentions the lack of any strategy regarding the international policy, the formal role of the Presidency in the decision making process, again brings up the indoctrination of the Army...<P>

<h2>Pressure from Within and Without</h2>


However, there is no doubt that the direct cause and the key reason for Komsic's resignation the founding of the Agency for Informations and Documentation [Bosnian secret service], actually, to be more specific, the speed with which that agency had been established and the planned methods of its future work.  It should be said that, only a month ago, Komsic, together with the other members of the Bosnian Presidency, expressed support for the founding of the Bosnian secret service and appointment of Bakir Alispahic as its director.  However, strong reactions from within and without followed only a few days after the establishment of the agency.  Federation President, Kresimir Zubak, openly stated in his public letter to the Presidency that he considered that the founding of the AID was against the Federal constitution and a violation of all agreements from Washington to Dayton.  He called on the presidency to re-examine its decision and to disband the AID the same way it had been founded.<P>

A second wave of attacks came from abroad; it was further intensified after the case in Dusina.  American administration was embittered with Mr. Alispahic's (AID director) claims that there were no foreign citizens in Bosnia which he had given only a few days before the IFOR soldiers raided the training center in Dusina [near Fojnica].  Although there was not too much evidence that the training center in Dusina was linked to the AID, the momentum of American criticism picked up not only Alispahic but also the AID.  Consequently the pressure on the Bosnian Presidency was doubled.<P>

At first, the Presidency members did not intend to change their decision.  Dr. Nijaz Durakovic in one TV show said that he had voted for the founding of the AID, justifying his decision by the fact that every sovereign state in this world has an institution which is in charge of its internal security; he added that the establishment of that kind of an Agency is within the constitutional rights of the Presidency.  Dr. Ivo Komsic at that time believed that certain procedural lapses shouldn't bring in question the basic task of the agency.<P>

<h2>Secret Service as a Destiny</h2>

What caused his about-turn?  Why did the Presidency again raise the question of the AID on the last week's session which lasted the whole five days?  Only because of the ever more stronger and frequent attacks?   Those pressures couldn't have been avoided.  However they were not crucial in the marathon session of the Presidency.<P>

The sources consulted by <em>Slobodna Bosna</em> testify that the Presidency members, prodded by the Komsic's resignation, asked themselves what their rights actually were and whether the Presidency would be able to control the Agency's work.  Specifically, if the Presidency is the formal founder of the Agency and has appointed its director, is that the end of its influence on this company?  Why wasn't the Presidency consulted about the systematization of other positions in the AID?  Certain Presidency members have only heard in the corridors that almost 1,500 people were supposed to be employed by the agency.  In order to illustrate the size of that kind of a service, let us mention that the pre-war [communist] Bosnian secret service (roughly corresponding to the AID) employed approximately 600 persons.  Or,  when the Croatian president Tudman demanded to be told the number of employees in the [communist] Croatian secret service, he was shocked to find out that there were only 800 of them.<P>

The presidency members were also denied the information about the financing of the AID and its future relation with the Bosnian police.  There are reliable informations that only a few hours before the new federal Minister of Internal Affairs, Avdo Hebib started work at his new office, his predecessor had transferred the bulk of money, equipment, vehicles and all other "trifles" to the AID.  This was one of the reasons because of which Hebib and Alispahic refused to communicate and why the government had to form a commission whose task was to establish which part of Bosnian police property belonged to whom.  Presidency members also demanded equal access to all information obtained by the AID.  They think that the members of the Presidency are not treated equally: while some of them regularly receive all, even top secret, informations from the AID, the others have to be satisfied with the informations they can read in the papers.<P>

<h2>Christopher Cannot Forgive</h2>

When we mention the "Presidency members" we are referring to the remaining five members, besides the president and his deputy.  That means that Durakovic, Ljuic, Kljuic and Pejanovic, absolutely agreed with the reasons with which Komsic had justified his resignation.  In president's absence his deputy, Dr. Ejup Ganic, responded to their accusations, claims and warnings.  As we already mentioned, the Presidency was in session, chaired by Ganic, for several days and the discussion was "heated and rough at times".  On Wednesday, March 13, the media recorded that the president received the presidency members at the Sarajevo clinical center and that the members were inquiring about the president's health.  However, as we found out from reliable sources, all five members (all except for Ganic) demanded from president Izetbegovic to concur with the replacement of Bakir Alispahic from the position of the AID director.  The same source says that president Izetbegovic refused and that he was quite firm in that.  It was agreed that this problem should be discussed at a new session which was supposed to take place on March 16 and be chaired by Izetbegovic.  However, on Friday afternoon, March 15, a Presidency meeting was called.  At that meeting the Presidency issued a statement in which it said that Alispahic was replaced by Kemal Ademovic, until then the commander of the Bosnian special police forces.<P>

It is not a secret that, in the meantime (between the hospital visit and Alispahic's dismissal), the American pressure on the Presidency has significantly increased.  State Department spokesperson, Nicholas Burns, stated in connection with Alispahic's dismissal that the American ambassador in Bosnia, John Menzes was the last one to demand that from the Bosnian leadership (Republican presidential candidate, Bob Dole also demanded the same previously, in his letter!).<P>  

It could be said that intense pressure from the American administration which demanded Alispahic's dismissal and the actions of the five Presidency members with the same goal corresponded both in time and content; however their motives are not the same.  The American establishment couldn't easily brush off Alispahic's attempt to deceive American state secretary Warren Christopher during his visit to Sarajevo, when Alispahic claimed that there were no more armed foreign citizens in Bosnia (Christopher stated on that occasion the following :"Mr. President, ours and your informations are not the same." In diplomatic relations this portents a concrete counterstrike).  The five presidency members tried with their atypical activism regarding the AID to save what is left to save in their constitutional position and personal and collective dignity.  Although it is hard to believe that a personnel change at the top of the secret service could change the transformation of this institution into what it was, it seems,  supposed to be from the start: a party secret police given a degree of legal and constitutional legitimacy by the Bosnian Presidency, that activism testifies that the Presidency members did not surrender without a "fired bullet" to the SDA [Party of Democratic action, the largest Bosnian Muslim party and the ruling party in Bosnia-Hercegovina] intentions to use the collective head of the state as its own legal alibi.<P>

<h2>The Presidency and the Private Initiative</h2>

Demonstration of the daring and "civic disobedience" of the five Presidency members who are not the members of the SDA during the last 15 days has brought about a change in the "action methods" of the SDA and its president [Izetbegovic] in the collective Bosnian head of the state.  They have adopted a new tactic in which a small number of decisions which, during the last four years, have had to be formally adopted through the discussion in the Bosnian presidency are now more and more verified somewhere else or by the president himself.  Izetbegovic's "private" letter to the TV Bosnia-Hercegovina [in which he criticized the New Year celebration in Sarajevo], then another "private" letter to the Mostar inhabitants regarding the division of this city which was agreed in Rome, than another "very private letter" to Minister [of Internal Affairs] Hebib in which Izetbegovic demands that he stop looting of Ilidza and other newly liberated Sarajevo suburbs, then resignations of the mayors from the two most important Federation cities, Sarajevo and Mostar, which were also addressed to the private president, demonstrate that the strongest stronghold of the private ownership is in the state leadership.  Since, for example, if the Bosnian presidency had protested because of looting in Sarajevo suburbs, there is no doubt that the reply from the police minister and prime minister would have been even more insolent than their reply to the well meaning UN spokesperson, Aleksander Ivanko.  However, after president Izetbegovic's private criticism, not only was it admitted that there had been looting, maltreatment and bullying but all of that was, within a short time, prevented and punished!<P>

Of course, limited space doesn't allow us to discuss and analyze the behavior of the Presidency members during the war (the "non-SDA" members); it mostly followed that de Cubertain's joke "it is important to participate and not to make decisions".  Maybe there is no need for that, since the general tendencies in the Bosnian society can hardly be discerned from the behavior of those who don't make decisions.  Their behavior is, after all, the consequence, not a cause, of more than obvious Bosnian political charge towards the authoritarian and undemocratic society...<P>

<h1>Presidency and Army Command Sacrificed Srebrenica</h1>

<h2>Slobodna Bosna, Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 7/14/96</h2>

<em>Ibran Mustafic, representative in Bosnian and Federal Parliaments, founder of SDA in Srebrenica and the captive of the Serb Army after the fall of this town, talks about the events about which he had unsuccessfully tried to speak in the Bosnian Parliament.</em><P>

<strong>Who are the people you accuse and the people you don't trust?</strong><P>

Scenario for the betrayal of Srebrenica was consciously prepared.  Unfortunately, the Bosnian presidency and the Army command were involved in this business;  if you want the names, figure it out yourself.  I understood the situation in Srebrenica and, you can trust me on this, had I not been prevented by a group of criminals, many more inhabitants of Srebrenica would be alive today.  Had I received an order to attack the Serb army from the demilitarized zone, I would have rejected to carry out that order without thinking and would have asked the person who had issued that order to bring his family to Srebrenica so that I can give him a gun and let him stage attacks from the demilitarized zone.  I knew that such shameful, calculated moves were leading my people to a catastrophe.  The orders came from Sarajevo and Kakanj.<P>

<strong>What were the consequences of the attacks staged from the demilitarized zone for the inhabitants of Srebrenica?</strong><P>

That was a conscious giving of a pretext to the Serb forces to attack the demilitarized zone.<P>

<strong>Who in Srebrenica accepted to carry out those orders?</strong><P>

Those individuals who, in the Summer of 1995, without a scratch left Srebrenica (...).  It is well known that that team managed to get out and take with along the elderly, children and horses.  I can only thank God, that a number of honest people and patriots managed to get out with them. (...)  According to our custom when someone finishes the foundations for a house, an animal must be slaughtered on top of them.  It seems that Srebrenica was a sacrificial lamb for the foundation of this state.<P>

<strong>Do you think that the events would have been different had Srebrenica truly be demilitarized?</strong><P>

Had some people then, or later, in 1994 and 1995 accepted to evacuate the people and to concede the territory, that would have represented the public division of Bosnia.  It seems that they want to divide this state in a secret, perfidious way.<P>

<strong>Who are you talking about?</strong><P>

About the official authorities.<p>

<strong>Why wasn't then, as you suggest, Srebrenica surrendered in 1993? What was the goal of such "games" with Srebrenica?</strong><P>

The basic goal of that game was the illusionary freedom of Sarajevo and the Bihac region.  What hurts the most is the attitude towards the survivors from the Drina valley who were in Srebrenica in July 1995.  Present attitude of the authorities towards those people is enough to convince me that the authorities expected that the number of the survivors would be smaller; it seems that the number of survivors is too high for their calculations.  They made me say this: "It seems you are afraid of living Srebrenica inhabitants."<P>

<strong>What makes you say that?</strong><P>

In the Bosnian Parliament, I initiated the formation of a special committee whose task would be to search for the survivors from the enclave (I claim that there are survivors!).  There are certainly quite a few survivors from Srebrenica.  I am convinced that at least someone out of those men who were separated in Potocari, among whom I was, must have survived, if I have survived.  Otherwise, they wouldn't have released me as a witness.  Secondly, when the column which was trying to get out of Srebrenica was cut in half, the privileged team, which I mentioned earlier and which had a permission to get out of the enclave, simply continued and kept throwing fliers behind them; the majority of the people was so confused that they simply surrendered in huge numbers.  I personally believe that the majority surrendered alive.<P>

<strong>Who was throwing fliers, and what was on those fliers?</strong><P>

They left behind them signs saying that the terrain was mined in order to confuse the people who had been following them as much as possible.  The column was cut, people were out of their minds.  I talked to a lot of people who came from Srebrenica without injuries and didn't belong to that team; when they told me about what happened on the way, I was outraged.  I cannot even think about that, let alone speak; these things are horrible.<P>

<strong>Do you think there is no will to find those people?</strong><P>

The fact that in the Bosnian Parliament no one has asked me about that is enough to demonstrate that no one cares about that.<P>

<strong>You suggested something else in the Parliament.</strong><P>

I suggested that a special fund be formed in order to assist the people who have survived that catastrophe.  Unfortunately, when I spoke about that, prime minister Muratovic had left the hall, as if he had had a premonition that he shouldn't hear that.  I think that a lot of money has been collected for Srebrenica and is flowing into the Federal, cantonal and other budgets.  I believe that the authorities, from cantonal over Federal to republican, have benefited much more from those funds than the people for whose use the funds had been supposedly earmarked.  I've heard that the Srebrenica authorities had received more that DM 2 million a few months ago.  How are they using those funds, I don't know.<P>

<strong>Therefore, this state hasn't fulfilled its obligations towards the refugees from Srebrenica?</strong><P>

After all, taking into account the local situation, we have to ask ourselves whether this is a state after all.  Take Srebrenica for example.  No one from Srebrenica has been arrested in this state.  And I claim that a good number of people from Srebrenica should have been arrested by now.  They are still showing off, though.<P>

<strong>What kind of crimes are you talking about?</strong><P>

The authorities in Srebrenica were not set up in accordance with the Constitution; it was private matter of a group of individuals.  One could write pages and pages about looting, murders, terror, pressures, maltreatment and other events in Srebrenica.(...)  In Srebrenica, it was always possible to buy at the market anything one might have wanted.  Hardly anything was lacking.  Still the only source of goods was humanitarian aid.  Since not one commercial convoy had ever reached Srebrenica.  Some people established contacts across the frontline, but as soon as the official authorities heard about that, that someone had managed to buy something at a lower price, they would intervene immediately, since they wanted to be the only source for supplies and hold a monopoly in Srebrenica.<P>

<strong>You were the victim of two assassination attempts.</strong><P>

Yes, I was.  The first attempt on my life was made on may 25, 1993, when someone fired a mortar shell from 20 meters away at a room in which I slept at the time.  That shell destroyed the room, but I, thank God, wasn't hurt.  The second attempt occured on May 19 1995.  I was with the former Srebrenica police commander, Hamed Halilovic.  He died in that assassination while I received serious injuries.  A whole frame was fired at me.  When the assassins realized that I was still alive, they fired a bullet in my head from point blank range.  I was severely wounded and consider that to be a double attempt at my life.<P>

<strong>Who were the attackers?</strong><P>

The Srebrenica police commander at the time, Hakija Mehuljic, should know.  I can say that the people from the top of Srebrenica authorities were involved in that assassination(...).  That team which was in Srebrenica gathered around it only uneducated people.  They killed "brains" to get rid of potential competition.  As an example, I'll mention the case of Nurif Rizvanovic.  He came from Tuzla to Konjevic Polje in the summer of 1992 with 450 soldiers; the soldiers were in uniforms, armed and well trained.  Rizvanovic, only because he was potential competition to someone, was shamefully executed in the fall of 1992.  That is the reflection of everything that happened in Srebrenica and around it.<P>

<strong>At the beginning of our interview you mentioned that your goal is to reveal the truth about Srebrenica.</strong><P>

Let me again mention that session of the Bosnian parliament.  At that session it was clear who was hiding the truth about Srebrenica.  My foremost task is to stay safe and secure in this state.  If something happens to me, the authorities will be responsible.(...)<P>

<strong>How do you see the present situation and the solution for the people from Srebrenica?</strong><P>

We are in this state 10th class citizens, left to fend for ourselves.  I hope that this people will recognize current political situation and I think that their situation can only improve after the elections.  The elections should bring some new people who can appreciate people and human values.  The complete ruling team has failed at that test.<P>

<strong>The Drina valley inhabitants are in the news because of another problem - moving into Serb houses in the suburbs of Sarajevo.  What does the Dayton Agreement bring to them, in view of those events?  Can we hope for a return?</strong><P>

The official policy is consciously working for the division of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  I will repeat my words from the Parliament: I'm convinced that the Serbs would have signed the Dayton Agreement in 1991 or 1992, without a single bullet.  I don't think that people should be forced against their will to live together (..).  The only possibility for the survival of the Muslim-Bosniak people is to return to the Drina.  If we accept this persecution, I am convinced that my sons, who I hope to have one day, will have to go farther.  As far as moving into other people's homes is concerned, Srebrenica people hadn't left tents behind them.  We need accommodations.  Let them return our property and we will return to Srebrenica.  And we also want to be told what happened with our missing men.<P>

<strong>Are there any new developments regarding that?</strong><P>

Taking into account that a lot of lies are circulating in this state, one can not trust anyone.  I found out through some people who are close to the Croatian secret service who in their turn have contacts with Serb secret service, that some 5,600 Srebrenica inhabitants are still alive and held in different locations.  Recently, Ms. Merhunisa Komarica has told me that she had received some data from the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights which mention 4,500 people.  I am ready to go anywhere and negotiate with anyone in order to win the release of a single person from Srebrenica.  I prefer two living Srebrenica inhabitants to dead Radovan Karadzic.  Finally, I would publicly state that some men are still alive.  The fact that the precise number of missing is still not known, demonstrates how much the state cares about those people.<P>

<strong>Do you wish to add something at the end of our conversation></strong><P>

I read the latest issue of Ljiljan last night.  I buy that magazine in order to check what the current official policy is.  Anyway, I read that Mr. Silajdzic [leader of the Party for Bosnia-Hercegovina, former Bosnian prime minister] is gathering around himself corrupt officials.  Among others, I found my name.  My greatest sin, as far as Ljiljan is concerned, is that I got out of the Serb prisons alive.  I should have died.  They don't appreciate living people.  They only appreciate the dead because they cannot talk.  They should consider two assassination attempts I survived in Srebrenica.  If they are true believers and if their religion is not a mask (...).  I am a Muslim and a believer.  With my faith, I joined the people who do not spread fear in this state, do not support looting, who support truth, who do not advocate violence and support the rule of law.  I haven't heard of a Muslim country in the world in which Islam stands for something bad.  Only their [SDA] version of Islam advocates crime, murders, lies, looting etc.  If they want to advocate that sort of Islam, let them go and present it somewhere else, not to this people who doesn't deserve to soil its faith.<P>

<h1>Scapegoats</h1>

<strong><em>by Sinan Alic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Front Slobode, Tuzla, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 3/22 1996</h2>

<h2>73.</h2>

At first Bosnian authorities stated in their announcement for the public, in connection with the IFOR action near Fojnica, that the discovered center was used for police training and that, as Mr. Alija Izetbegovic [Bosnian president] explained in front of TV cameras, Bosnia has several centers of that kind.  Maybe it does but, the Americans were persistent, in this one there were foreign citizens, the Iranians.<P>

Our guys, were not "budging", and tried to con the Americans: the foreigners happened to be there by chance.  Imagine, men with diplomatic passports got lost in the Bosnian sticks, probably while trying to analyze the influence of the Dayton agreement on bears. Some explosive devices in shape of children toys were also found when the center was searched.<P>

American pressure didn't let up.  They demanded that the Bosnian authorities send home all mercenaries, especially those from Iran, and the promised training and equipment for the Bosnian Army were conditioned by this.  A scapegoat was found in Bakir Alispahic, the director of the newly formed Agency for Investigation and Documentation.  We were told that the signal for Alispahic's dismissal came directly from the Izetbegovic's [Bosnian president] hospital bed.<P>

There was no other way out, especially after the American ambassador in Sarajevo gave the Bosnian prime minister, Hasan Muratovic, a file which contained conclusive proof that the Bosnian government hadn't fulfilled the obligation from the Dayton Agreement regarding the departure of foreign mercenaries from Bosnia-Hercegovina.<P>

The naivete with which our authorities tried to outsmart the American intelligence machinery is more than ridiculous.  Mojahedeen will, after all, have to leave Bosnia but, after all that, it is hard to believe that Alispahic did all that stuff on his own initiative and without Izetbegovic's knowledge and approval.<P>

<h2>74.</h2>

With few honorable exceptions, we are a lazy people.  In that laziness we even feel good.  Lately, I've been walking a lot around Tuzla and regularly return home covered with mud as if I have been walking through a village instead of a city.<P>

Piles of rubbish lie between the apartment buildings.  Numerous buses and trucks are parked in front of our concrete houses.  If airplane taxis were legal they would land on our heads.<P>

Someone would say it's the city services' fault; it's Selim' [Beslagic, Tuzla's mayor] fault; he likes to travel around the world and drives through the city; it's the refugees' fault...  It's their fault as much as it is ours, since the stench under our own windows doesn't seem to bother us: we are waiting for someone else to clean up in front of our doorsteps.<P>

IFOR members are not stupid; they are not even thinking about repeating what the Scandinavian "blue helmets" did when they drove away rubbish from our streets and sidewalks cheered on by an applause from the Tuzla balconies.<P>

It is a pity that in Dayton they did not agree on an annex to the peace agreement which would ensure the formation of the multinational forces whose purpose would be to thoroughly disinfect our laziness.<P>

<h1> Excerpts from the Speech by Kresimir Zubak delivered at the 16th session of the parliament of the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna</h1><p>

 
<h2><i>  Hrvatski List, 5/5/95, Mostar/Siroki Brijeg, HR Herceg-Bosna (Bosnia and Herzegovina)</i></h2><p>

<i>Hrvatski List</i> was founded and is partly financed by the government of the Croatian Republic (HR) of Herzeg-Bosna <p>
<hr>

-Different concepts of internal organization of Bosnia and Herzegovina were the fundamental cause of the fighting between the Muslims and us in 1993.  The Washington agreement was a turning point, as far as the armed clashes are concerned.  We accepted together the federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its confederation with the republic of Croatia.  We accepted the principle of absolute equality, without majority rule and discrimination of any kind.  We treat the federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a lasting model of the organization of the relationship with the Muslims, and not as a temporary solution.  However, more than a year after signing of the Washington agreement there are still no visible results in implementation of the Constitution [of the federation of  Bosnia and Herzegovina].  Still strong within the muslim leadership is a faction which wants a multiethnic and multicultural state, which is simply a phrase hiding a wish for domination.  Situation in the field is the best proof of that.  The Croats are still leaving the territory under the control of the Army of  Bosnia and Herzegovina.  We are not interested in  Bosnia and Herzegovina as such nor is our goal secession.  Herzeg-Bosna is not a counterpart of the so-called republic Srpska since we have never stepped out of our national [ethnic] space.  We simply want our freedom.  We will never be a minority and we do not need a cultural autonomy but a constitutive nation status and absolute equality.<p>

-Both us and the Muslims showed our hands and clearly stated our opinions about each other.  There must not remain a single point of contention which could return us to the beginning.  We should support those muslim politicians who have European orientation and who sincerely support equality and correctly interpret the Constitution of the federation of  Bosnia and Herzegovina.  In any case, our cooperation with the republic of Croatia should not bother the Muslims.  We were artificially separated, it is known when and by whom, and therefore we say <b>YES</b> to the federation but only along with the compulsory <b>YES</b> to the confederation with the republic of Croatia.  We won't accept any other associations [i.e. links with the federal republic of Yugoslavia].<p>

<h1>In Focus</h1>

<strong><em>by Nenad Novakovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Glas Srpski, Banja Luka, Srpska, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 11/5 1995</h2>

In Dayton the Americans are filling in and changing their history on the Serb account. During these five war years we have got unaccustomed to expecting anything good from them.  Pressure, blackmail, slanders, airplanes, bombs, tomahawks, threats, borders, constitutions, new leadership... and what not, and everything against the Serbs.  Why should we now believe that the same people want to help us?<P>

Based on the concept of the former demolished Yugoslavia, unimaginative Americans, after all those victims and fighting, again want those same peoples to forget what happened yesterday and again live in a united state.  Bosnian Serbs didn't want to leave Yugoslavia in 1991, but those who did want to leave wanted to take others with them.<P>

What do Serbs want?  Nothing more than what the others are given.  Even less.  They want to be able to elect their own representatives in their own state and not in that American cosmetic and imposed state, founded for a second time in fifty years, and which has so far existed only during the quiet periods between the wars.  American politicians and world policemen sometimes forget themselves in their rage and say things which serious diplomats shouldn't say.  Without trial and due process of law, American State secretary said that the president of the Srpska Republic, a state which the Americans had recognized within the framework of the Union of Bosnia-Hercegovina, and the commander in chief of that entity's army, which will remain as a legal army of the Republic of Srpska, was a war criminal.<P>

A democratic state usually waits for the due process of law before passing a judgment on someone.  Here, without a trial and defense, Mr. Christopher passes judgment and blackmails, replaces and tries to name new presidents and military commanders in the RS.  Maybe these are his wishes but, out of diplomatic tact, he could have kept them for the end of maltreatment, pressures and blackmail to which the negotiation team from FR Yugoslavia and the RS was exposed.<P>

This way, he has explicitly stated the American goal: to replace the political and military leadership in the RS, to impose constitutional and territorial solutions in such a way that the RS legally exists in order to give concessions to the Republic of Croatia and the government in Sarajevo, and then quietly disappears.  Why else the support for, as they said, "democrats", just and democratic elections when at their start it is determined who can and who cannot be elected in those elections?  Elections are not free if even one man is not allowed to vote, despite his legal rights.  This way, the two key personalities in the RS, at least during these five war years, won't now, despite the will of the people be allowed to run for office, because of the "democratic world policeman's" diktat.<P>  

The elections in the RS will show the people's choice.  This can be done without suggestions, whispering and imposition of certain solutions from the outside.  Experience from the Republic Srpska Krajina is still fresh, and too painful to permit us to toy with imposed leaders and people without grass root support.<P>

The details of the Dayton negotiations which have been leaked to the public, clearly show that there is a firm will to establish peace in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, but not a just and lasting peace.  It is clear that all of us have had more than enough of this war but even a peace has an alternative if it doesn't bring anything better than war.  Certain uncertainty and the loss of statehood, uncertain survival of the nation, perpetual fear and hopelessness in the offered peace are worse than war which at least offers a hope for better tomorrow.  I'm not supporting a war option; on the contrary, I'm simply reacting to the irritating motto which says that "<strong>Peace Has No Alternative</strong>".  Those who say so, it seems, haven't prepared well for serious negotiations, since they surrender in advance by offering peace at any price.<P>

Peace at any price, even in these difficult times, is not the best solution for the Serbs.  It is necessary to achieve that the RS has, nothing more, but simply the same rights and obligations as the Croatian-Muslim alliance.  In that case, the Union has a chance to, as a temporary solution, offer peace.  The peace is needed in this moment, but a just peace without blackmail, lies and malice.  There was more than enough of that in this war.  The same can be said for certain streets and markets in Sarajevo.  Hopefully there won't be any more of that after Dayton.  Let the Americans have glory, let them direct history and throw spectacles.  We need peace.  Anyway, the Americans don't have their own history and can do with a bit of ours and, the Serbs, it is well known, suffer from a surplus of historical facts, personalities and events.<P>

<h1>"WE HAVEN'T SIGNED ANYTHING!"</h1>

<h2>Mr. Momcilo Krajisnik for the SRNA (Bosnian Serbs' Information Agency)</h2>

<h2><i> by Mirjana Kusmuk</i>, Glas Srpski [Serbian Voice], Banja Luka, 11/22/95</h2>
	

Shortly before the signing of the peace agreement, Momcilo 
Krajisnik, the President of National Assembly of the Serbian Republic, 
and a member of the negotiation team from the Serbian Republic, had this 
interview by phone from Dayton, OH, with SRNA's editor Mirjana Kusmuk.<P>

 <strong> SRNA: <em>Today, the agreement in Dayton was reached. Could you tell 
us about the details?</em></strong><P>

  Mr. Krajisnik: At the meeting our group attended, an agreement has 
been reached between the part of negotiation team from FR Yugoslavia 
[Serbia & Montenegro], the two mediators, and other two sides in this 
conflict [Muslims and Croats] on the subject of the plan; it must 
be said that the plan doesn't accomodate neither our basic interests nor 
requirements the Assembly of the Serbian Republic set out for before these negotiations. We 
have warned the President Milosevic and others from his team that no one 
has a right to sign such an agreement nor endorse those maps by which one 
loses more than one gets in return. This being said, I want to stress 
that OUR group has not accepted the agreement; we have not signed it and 
we will not accept the suggested maps. Right now, we don't know how 
things will turn out. As we speak, the ceremony of signing, that our 
group declined to attend, is taking place. We are unanimous in our 
decision, and determined to inform the Assembly and the people of the 
Serbian Republic about everything. There is no need for panic. The maps 
are so bad, so uncompromising and servile, that we can only regret not 
having more strength and patience to reach a better solution. Our primary 
objection is that we were not allowed to see the maps until 10 minutes 
before the signing. Thus, having taken no part in creating the maps, we 
could not have offered any suggestions about possible corrections.<P>

 <strong> SRNA:<em> According to what Bill Clinton said, Sarajevo will become a 
unified city. Who will be controlling it? The news from Dayton so far have 
been contradictory.</em></strong><P>

  Mr.K: A big mistake has been comitted. The plan makes room for a 
corridor to Gorazde, while, for the most part, the Serbian part of 
Sarajevo is handed over to the muslim entity. We did not accept that, and 
we made it clear that no one had a right to accept it. I am saddened to 
see anyone make deals on behalf of others. However, this is just an 
outline of the final agreement that is to be signed in Paris. There is 
still enough time until that signing, and our people will be informed in 
the meantime. No one has a right to give away the territories our people 
defended in blood. Before the negotiations, we have made a map along with 
President Milosevic, which, in our 49% of the territory includes Krupa na 
Uni, Sanski Most, Drvar, Petrovac, Mrkonjic, Kljuc, Sipovo and a part of 
Jajce, in the west. In the Sava valley, we opted for a corridor 20 
kilometers wide. According to that map, Gorazde remained under Muslim 
rule, and for the sake of Serbian Sarajevo, exits to the sea were given 
to the Moslem side. Thus, all major principles were satisfied. However, 
we have not been able to take part in negotiations in Dayton , and 
everything seems to have taken place on relations unknown to us. We kept 
being given this explanation: that the maps were not ready yet, and that 
the Americans will submit them for our approval once they are drafted. 
Well, the maps have been submitted to us now, 10-15 minutes before the 
ceremony, so we clearly said we could not accept that.<P>

<strong>  SRNA:<em> So, the group from the Serbian Republic was kept on the margin of things?</em></strong><P>

  Mr. K.:No, we were not marginalized. We participated in negotiations including those regarding many 
annexes. We did most on the constitutional draft, with the exception of 
the part pertaining to the military. As for the remaining eight to nine 
annexes, we held, for the most part, to the same stance, and the group 
was completely unanimous.<P>
 
<strong>  SRNA:<em> It has been voted to send NATO to Bosnia. What was our group's opinion on that point?</em></strong><P>

  Mr. K.: Our Assembly had given its opinion on that very point. To the
negotiators, we have presented the fact that only our Assembly has the
legal power to allow entrance of foreign troops on the soil of the Serbian
Republic, and that only for the troops from the countries outside NATO.
There was, actually, a great division on that subject. Our part of the
group, prof. Buha, prof. Koljevic and myself, voted against the deployment
of NATO troops in Serbian Republic, while the part of the group from
Yugoslavia voted affirmatively on the subject. We (our part of the group)
have not questioned that, since such a move entails certain procedures. 
But now, having seen the maps, and realizing that we are worse off with 
them than we really are, we refused to sign any of the peace documents.<P>

<strong> SRNA:<em> Can it be said that President Milosevic abused the Patriarch's endorsement?</em></strong><P>

  Mr. K.: I will not comment on that, nor will I rush into conclusions, 
because it is not a time for conclusions. I want our people, our Assembly and the 
governement of the Serbian Republic to take a stand on this issue. At any 
rate, we, the members of this group have our own opinions that will be 
presented once we come back.<P>
 
<strong>  SRNA:<em>What is happening in Dayton right now?</em></strong><P>

  Mr. K.: The ceremony is on, but our group is absent. That is an awkward 
situation, but we made it clear to the mediators that we have not signed, 
nor accepted the plan. At any rate, I appeal to our people not to panic. 
We have had far more difficult points in this war; we weathered the 
Owen-Stoltenberg plan and the Vance-Owen plan, and Contact Group plan. We 
want peace, we want a solution, but we emphasize yet again that no one 
has the right, neither we not those that lead this state and its people 
to sign the agreement. That right belongs either to the people (on a 
referendum) or, perhaps, the Assembly. <P>

<strong>  SRNA: <em>White House Press Secretary, Nicholas Burns, claims that 
Milosevic was given power to decide on the fate of Bosnian Serbs, and 
that his decisions may not be questioned by the Assembly of Serbian Republic?</em></strong><P>

  Mr.K.: That is not true. That is a fallacy, aimed at undermining the 
agreement we have reached through mediation of the Patriarch Pavle. 
President Milosevic is a member of the joint delegation, in which all 
delegates are equal. Only when there is a tie, President Milosevic's 
vote can be decisive. But even President Milosevic has to abide by certain 
rules that both we [Bosnian Serbs] and the Yugoslav part of the 
delegation have agreed upon. According to these, Kozara and Grmec regions 
must be retrieved; a Corridor has to be established; there are also other 
goals I cannot name now. Therefore, that document by itself is not the 
only part - we can consider it only in conjunction with the second one. 
However, this is just an agreement n general; there is still enough time 
until signing in Paris to mend all the unacceptable terms. Our people 
should not worry. We must defend our freedom. Had there been more wisdom 
and perseverance, a better solution would have been reached, since 
the Muslims had no chance of taking a single piece of our 
territory. Actually, they had to return some territory to us. We regained, however, 
only that territory controlled by the Croatian Military Defense (HVO), in 
return for which the Croats of Herzeg-Bosnia received a part of Sava 
Valley; that is unconceivable. No one has a right to sign such a map. I 
am sorry that we diverged among ourselves, but it simply is impossible 
that for myself or anyone else to sign this agreement. I have already 
talked to the President Karadzic. Only he can make a decision about the signing of this 
agreement. It is clear, then, that this general acceptance has no weight 
unles the agreement in Paris is signed by the legitimate representatives 
of the Serbian Republic. And it shall not be signed until our minimums 
are met. That was the principle we reached in Belgrade, upon agreeing to 
form a combined negotiating team, under the auspices of His Holiness, 
Patriarch Pavle.<P>

<h1>In Focus</h1>

<strong><em>by Andelko Anusic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Glas Srpski, Banja Luka, Srpska, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 11/26 1995</h2>

After the conclusion of the peace negotiations in Dayton, the UN Security Council has passed a resolution on the suspension of economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the gradual suspension of arms import embargo which had been imposed on all republics of the former Yugoslavia.  This decision has surprised even the most pretentious observers in the Western political and diplomatic circles;  some assessed that this decision violates the peace agreement in Dayton.<P>

Indeed, if due to, above all, American efforts the civil and religious war in the former Bosnia-Hercegovina has ended, why was the arms embargo suspended at this time?  It is clear that the arms will be needed for the new killing and new battles.  Anyway, there is more than enough arms in the former Yugoslav republics (Bosnia-Hercegovina, Croatia, Slovenia).  Actually, the embargo on arms imports to these republics, in which the secession and the war had been started, has never existed.  Warmongers in Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina (and earlier in Slovenia) have imported (and still do) enormous amounts of destructive murder weapons.  The former East German war reserves have been emptied without "mercy" and transported to Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina;  these weapons were paid by the huge amounts of money and economic concessions.<P>

Muslims and Croats are armed to their teeth, as was obvious during the four year war in Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia.  Well armed military formations were built from a handful of terrorists; that is why the world diplomatic and political circles are even more surprised that the Security Council swallowed another American bait.<P>

This decision of the UN Security Council can only be taken as a new threat to the Serbs, Serbia and FR Yugoslavia.  Cynics say that the USA wants to allow the Serbs to arm themselves in this way.<P>

If we consider that the peace in the former Bosnia-Hercegovina will be secured by as many as 60,000 NATO soldiers, one can only imagine the amount of weapons which will be present in the territories of the former (and present) Yugoslavia which were, until yesterday, engulfed in a war.<P>

For example, according to the foreign military publications, Muslim-Croat alliance has 265,000 soldiers, with the ability to mobilize another 280,000 soldiers.  Republic of Croatia, the HVO and the Muslim part of Bosnia-Hercegovina are included in this estimate.<P>

The mentioned alliance has 650 tanks, 400 armored vehicles, 1,300 artillery pieces, and 50 airplanes and helicopters.  Croatia also has 50,000 active police and 40,000 reserve police troops.  Therefore, all together, the Croatian-Muslim alliance has more than 600,000 soldiers!<P>

All that is still less than the military potential of FR Yugoslavia, but certainly cannot be underestimated.  On the contrary!  Foreign journal "Military Balance" which is, by the way, the leader among the publications which register  the amounts of means for destruction around the world, in one of its analyses claims that the gradual suspension of the arms embargo against the former Yugoslav republics can only be interpreted as an American attempt to discipline the Serbs.  In the same journal, we can find that, allegedly, the suspension of economic sanctions against FR Yugoslavia was conditioned by the suspension of the arms embargo against Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina.<P>

How is that future and, supposedly, united Bosnia-Hercegovina, going to realize its right to import weapons and whether a part of that hellish cake will fall on the Serb side, we don't know.<P>

If it turns out that only the Muslim-Croatian side will be  able to import weapons, it doesn't bide well for the Serb people under the common Bosnian roof.<P>

Besides all those means for destruction, it is even hard to imagine what will the peace which was achieved in Dayton look like.<P>

		<h1>Absurdity of Unified Sarajevo</h1>

<h2><i>by Zeljko Grujic</i>, Glas Srpski, Banja Luka, Srpska Republic, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 12/4/1995</h2>

	Objective political analysts and observers warn almost daily that
Dayton Agreement, according to which the Serb-held part of Sarajevo is to
come under the rule of muslim-Croat coalition, threatens to bring about
ethnic cleansing and/or exodus of 120,000 Serbs.It is emphasized that the
implementation of this Agreement makes the international community a direct
accomplice in the expulsion of the Sarajevo Serbs who have inhabited that
area since the ninth century A.D., and who privately own a major part of
the land there.<P>
	It is also noted that a general layout of Dayton Agreement
indicates an intention to seclude the Serbs and render the Serb Republic 
[Serb-controlled part of Bosnia-Hercegovina] almost impossible to defend. 
Furthermore, mentioned are the "gaps" in Dayton Agreement, addressed by the 
French president Jacques Chirac, by which the Agreement fails to provide 
any guarantees of safety to the Sarajevo Serbs.<P>
	In the meantime, the muslim-controlled media and lobbies, have
sharply criticized the informal statement from general Basle, the
commander-in-chief of UN forces in Sarajevo, who observed that, in his
opinion, Dayton Agreement represents hardly more than President Clinton's
attempt to gain electoral votes.<P> 
	General Basle fears that it is logical to expect the exodus of
Serbs from Sarajevo, for they are denied safety guarantees, and thus left 
to the whims of muslim police.<P>
	Following already established scenario for prompt removal of 
"uncooperative" UNPROFOR commanders (i.e. generals McKennzey, Rose),  the 
muslim leaders and media [instigated] a campaign against gen. Basle, 
while Izetbegovic sent a letter to the French president Chirac, stating 
that he, Izetbegovic, is the best guarantor of Sarajevo Serbs' safety.<P>
	Thus Izetbegovic appears as a sole multiculturalist and defender
of Serbs, at a time when even Turkey - overt ally of Bosnian Moslems -
winces at his islamic clericalism. Official sources in Ankara note that
"Turkey is becoming worried about Izetbegovic's behavior in the future, 
since he, in his 'Islamic Declaration', had renounced Turkish secularism and 
its first promoter, Mustapha Kemal Ataturk."<P>
	Yet, in a letter to Mr. Chirac, Izetbegovic calls upon his 
feigned effort to preserve multiculturalist character of Bosnia, although 
he himself, in 1991, joined in the secessionist wave that shattered 
multicultural character of ex-Yugoslavia. It seems sensible to ask, then, 
how can anyone who destroyed such multiculturalism be truly in favor of 
multicultural Bosnia, or even multicultural Sarajevo.<P>
	In his letter, Izetbegovic maintains that he managed to preserve 
diversity of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina in the areas under muslim control, 
although it is common knowledge that in northwestern and central parts 
of Bosnia, Serbs exist only in muslim camps, prisons, or under close 
surveillance.<P>
	Izetbegovic, of course, does not write that, were the
multicultural prison of muslim-controlled Sarajevo to be opened, all the 
Serbs would rush to the Serb-controlled part of the city. He fails to 
write that in the Moslem part of the city, 15,000 Serbs have vanished, 
and that 12,500 Serbs died in the Serbian part of the city from Moslem 
grenades and snipers.<P>

Izetbegovic further mentions the population census from 1991, which has been rejected by the Serbs as a forgery and as such is not legitimate.  He claims that the municipalities of Ilijas, Ilidza, Vogosca and Hadzici are not Serb.  He lists numbers giving participation of Serbs in the total population, while failing to quote those figures for muslims, let alone Croats, Jews and Yugoslavs.<P>

It is striking that Izetbegovic fails to inform the French president about that; also, it doesn't occur to him to present to Shirac the structure of land ownership in the Sarajevo area.<P>

According to the last and the only legitimate census, from 1981, 450,000 inhabitants lived in six municipalities within the central part of Sarajevo, Stari Grad, Centar, Novo Sarajevo, Novi Grad, Vogosca and Ilidza, which cover 45 square kilometers and 68 settlements.  Serbs were more than 50 percent of population in 39 settlements, covering 47.2 percent of the territory, Muslims were the absolute majority in 13 settlements, covering 16.5 percent of the region.  Territory wise, in the central part of Sarajevo, the ratio between Serbs and muslims was 3 to 1.[the author considers the land within municipal borders of a settlement in which Serbs are absolute majority to be owned by Serbs.  This is sort of legitimate, since in the former Yugoslavia, public resources were "owned by the society", i.e. the people living in a certain area, and private ownership was an exception.  After a bit of mental gymnastics, one could conclude that, by extension, public resources actually belong to a largest ethnic group in a town.]<P>
In Ilidza municipality Serbs were in relative majority with 38.9 percent of population, living in settlements covering 58.5 percent of the area.  Muslims were 32.7 percent of the population being in majority on 27.5 percent of land, Croats 12 percent of population on 7.5 percent of land; Yugoslavs were 13.3 percent of the population in the municipality.<P>

In Ilijas Serbs owned more than a half of the land and were 42.7 percent of the population, actually less than according to Alija's census from 1991, because in 1981 many of the Ilijas Serbs declared themselves as Yugoslavs.<P>

Izetbegovic claims that Vogosca also wasn't a Serb municipality although 50.8 percent of land on its territory belonged to Serbs and only 37.2 percent to muslims.  According to the census in 1981, Serbs were 38 percent of inhabitants on the territory of Vogosca municipality; 9.8 percent of Yugoslavs should also be added to this number.<P>

A large number of Serbs gravitated to the territory of Hadzici municipality during the war; they were victims of muslim ethnic cleansing, people who were expelled from central Bosnia and the neighboring Hercegovina municipalities of Konjic and Jablanica.  Naturally, Izetbagovic also fails to mention the case of Mostar from which all Serbs were expelled, although they constituted 18.4 percent of population and owned 22.2 percent of the land in private ownership.<P>

For 120,000 of the Sarajevo Serbs, Izetbegovic is a man who in April of 1992 committed a crime against peace and humanity and they will never accept his rule.  General Basle realized this on the spot; his fears regarding the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement are an expression of the realistic feeling for the situation.  Because it is absurd to divide the former Bosnia-Hercegovina into two entities, Srpska Republic and the muslim-croatian federation, while denying the existence of two cities: one Serb and the other one muslim.<P>

It is absurd also to impose united Sarajevo under muslim control, when it is known that such intentions haven't worked in the case of Mostar which, in spite of almost two years of pressure by the international community, remains divided by the Neretva river into two cities controlled by the federal allies: Croats and muslims.<P>

<h1>Protectorate on Croatian Air Waves</h1>

<strong><em>by Boris Raseta</em></strong><P>

<h2>ARKzin , Zagreb, Croatia, February 16 1996</h2>

The case of Labin radio L.A.E. (Radio Labin Art Express) will become,
it seems, a new bone of contention in the relations between Croatia
and the European Union or, more precisely, the Council of Europe.  
And a significant one at that!  Labin radio has managed until recently
to transmit 16 hours of program daily, with only about 20 collaborators.
Most of the time they have broadcasted music and entertainment programs, but 
recently they have started to carry  BBC and Radio Deutsche Welle news.
Some claim that that was the fatal mistake; the others add that there
were certainly more mistakes.  Namely, the program touched upon the topic
of human rights, alternative culture and similar topics which cause
panic in the authorities.  With three transmitters,
L.A.E. managed to reach with its program a large part of the Labin and Kvarner regions, and 
also parts of Pula and Rijeka. The radio was extremely 
popular in that region, the listeners regularly called in, wrote letters; 
Radio also gained a good international reputation.  As the space in which
L.A.E. could be heard was relatively small, the station, understandably,
was a non-profit institution.  In other words, they were not able to cover
their expenses through radio commercials.  Because of that, the radio bought
new equipment and paid its collaborators (when it did; the collaborators
claim that that was a rare event) with help of donations from 
European and World organizations such as Open Society Fund (infamous Soros) and
the Council of Europe (infamous Council of Europe).  In such a way, they 
ensured the continuity of the program and bought new technical equipment,
which is today worth DM 300,000.<P>

<h2>Dead Radio Station is the Best Radio Station</h2>

Therefore, Radio L.A.E. was a profitable station in Croatian terms and
(it seemed that way until recently) its future seemed promising if
not spectacular.  The first shock for the station came in the August
of the last year when, against the expectation of everyone at the radio
station, they failed to obtain a concession at the state tender [for
bandwidth allocations]!  The old broadcast permit expired on July 16.
A letter from the Ministry for shipping and traffic stated that L.A.E.
could compete for the concession in the next tender and until then - nothing!
Still, the radio continued to broadcast without a permit.  Curiously,
 the concession for Labin was won by a competitor, FFI-Commerce, i.e. 
Radio Labin; one of the co-founders of FFI-Commerce is Zeljko Paliska,
who had founded that company while he worked for Radio L.A.E.;
in other words, according to the time tested tradition, he was trying to
destroy L.A.E. from inside.  The other co-owner of FFI-Commerce is Mr.
Franjo Sirola, whom well informed persons suspect of being a member
of HDZ and, according to an old passion of the members of that party,
former employee in the Labin Police department (he worked for the passport
service); in the "dark times"  he responded to a name Franco Sirola 
[Italian for Franjo]!<P>

Zeljko Paliska, convinced that because of his dedicated work a part of
L.A.E.'s equipment should belong to him, allegedly hired N.K. from Porec
to brake into the apartment of Dean Zahtila, Rado L.A.E. director, and paid
"an advance of 300 Kunas for that service; he promised to pay another
DM 2,000 after the completion of the break in and the delivery of two 
transmitters owned by Radio L.A.E."  N.K. simply couldn't refuse that
offer.  The goal was to get hold of transmitters!  However, since the 
transmitters were well hidden, N.K. only managed to steal 50 Kunas.
Even more serious argumentation was used in this story: Kresimir Farkas 
was threatened with a beating unless he delivered one of the three
transmitters to Zeljko Paliska.<P>

It seems that Radio Labin does not have enough equipment and, in spite
of the fact that they had won the concession, they still haven't started 
to broadcast!  It is interesting to mention here that the Ministry explained
in its decision regarding the allocation of the frequencies that the concessions
"were given to those groups which submitted the best tenders."  Obviously,
HDZ concluded that the best media were silent and invisible media; in other
words, the best medium is a dead medium!  Unfortunately, the International
Federation of Journalists does not have a lot of understanding for this 
theory; therefore, their surprise was understandable.  They posed a logical 
question: if the competition was between a radio which had been broadcasting
without interruption for 2 and a half years, had all the necessary equipment
and resources and a radio which had none of that - how was it possible
that the latter group made a "better" offer, actually "the best" offer?<P>

Naturally, this was a rhetorical question, and they never received the 
answer.<P>

After all, the new owners of the Labin frequency announced that their radio
would have a commercial orientation.<P>

<h2>Beluzic's no passaran</h2>

In the mid January of this year Radio L.A.E. received an order from the 
Ministry, signed by state inspector Miroslav Beluzic which ordered the
Radio to stop broadcasting and stop using its equipment without a valid
concession.  "I order the aforementioned person to immediately stop 
broadcasting and to store all of his radio stations at one place and inform the
state inspector once this has been accomplished."  Naturally, this   
very literary decree ("all of his radio stations") was to be implemented
immediately.<P>

Kresimir Farkas, Radio L.A.E. editor-in-chief, did took the station off
the air, since there was a danger that all the hard earned equipment
could have been confiscated.  Radio L.A.E. went off the air with the symbolic
sounds of O Bella Ciao [Italian Communist song from WWII] by the Idiots
[a local band from Pula]! International Federation of Journalists, the Council 
of Europe and other institutions immediately sent their protests to Dr.
Franjo Tudman [Croatian president], Zarko Domijan, Ivica Mudrinic and 
Dr. Mate Granic [ministers in the government].  The answer still 
hasn't been given if one ignores Mudrinic's "diplomatic" assurances
that everything would be resolved in the best possible manner.<P>

Radio L.A.E. is still off the air.  "We are waiting for the resolution," says
Farkas.  In its absence, there are several options.  The worst one 
is the illegal broadcasting of program.  The best one is the award
of an official concession, and the in-between solution, which seems to
be very likely, is that Radio L.A.E. be put under the protectorate of 
the Council of Europe; in that case this European organization would try
"to resolve the problem" on several levels.  Farkas stated for our paper
that he was convinced that the Council of Europe would really place
L.A.E. under its protection. <P>

What does that actually mean?  "That is protection or sponsorship,
as we would say in Croatian [a joke]...  In practice that means
that Radio Labin Art Express would be allowed to use the Council
of Europe sign on its logo and publicize that we are under the protection
of the Council of Europe.  They would be our sponsors, in the way
that our dear president sponsors Sinjska Alka [Croatian traditional
festival].  Further that could mean that the Council of Europe, would 
include the case of Radio L.A.E. in its list of the demands which
 Croatia must fulfill in order to be accepted into 
that organization.  So far, the Council has included on its list a 
rather general paragraph about the 'improvement of media freedom
in Croatia.'"

Therefore, Radio L.A.E. would become one of the obstacles on our way to
the Council of Europe.<P>

<h2>Use Satellite to Reach Croats</h2>

The sponsorship of this station would be second case of this kind in Croatia,
but would in practice had the significance of a precedent.  The council 
of Europe has taken a sponsorship over the Democratic Forum from Rijeka
an organization which still hasn't started with its work.<P>

Bojana Humar, the coordinator of the International Federation of Journalists
for the Balkan region, has told us that the Council of Europe really planned 
to establish a protectorate, or "sponsorship" if you like it better that way,
over Labin Radio station, but it was more likely that the Council would
include the whole project Labin Art Express in that protectorate.  According
to Farkas, the procedure for putting L.A.E. under the protection of the Council
of Europe has started, and they had received verbal assurances from the Council
of Europe that the case would be positively resolved.  In his opinion, the
result should be known in less than two weeks.  Unless Eurocrats fail.  If
the radio does not obtain a concession, they will broadcast their program 
over a satellite. Naturally, they would need a lot of time to organize that
(about 6 months based on realistic estimates) and a lot of money which would
be provided by the Council of Europe.  If that happens, the radio will widen
its area of work to the whole Croatia and will try to include the representatives
of other independent media in its work.  If everything else fail, the radio
is prepared to broadcast without a permit, but hasn't yet found a suitable 
frequency.  Until further notice, the radio will stay off the air; between February 1 and 6,
some 6,000 citizens of Labin signed a petition against the
closure of Radio L.A.E., which was an obvious sign of support for the further
work of this station.<P>

<h1> To Have and not to Have</h1><p>

<h2>Milos Stojic, a Case That Goes On</h2><p>

Every journalist, in normal circumstances, if his or hers journalistic feeling is at all alive, would greet the case of 60-year old (disabled) pensioner Milos Stojic with the conclusion:``Terrific story!"  You will recall, the man in question is a mathematics professor from Karlovac who was at the beginning of '92 thrown out of an apartment in which all of his belongings remained; property, mementoes, decades of life; to this day, in spite of appeals, complaints, petitions, knocking on numerous doors - he is still on the street, at mercy of good people and friends who dare to offer from time to time their own bed for a night of peaceful sleep.<p>

Despite all the accidents we write about, anyone still deserving to be called <i>human</i> will find it hard to face Stojic.  Even if one tries to suppress emotions, there remains a <i>real-surreal</i> picture of a man wearing somebody else's coat and somebody else's hat, a man without a house and a home (still, he is not a refugee), who will after having sought even a tiny piece of justice in supposedly democratic Croatia, continuously, while talking about the last three years of his life, keep repeating:``I don't know if in these circumstances, when all this evil is taking place, it is worth mentioning at all."<p> 

<h2> Disabled 180%</h2><p>


Here is his biography in short.  He was seven years old when Germans, in the second world war, killed his parents and his brothers; he survived 17 wounds and even today has six pieces of steel in his body.  After the WWII, a commission concluded that he had a 80% disability; and that is how he started his life.<p>


He supported himself by working throughout his education, graduating from the Teaching Academy and then from the Department of Sciences and Mathematics at the Zagreb University.  With pride, even today, he talks about the generations of pupils in whom he reduced the fear of mathematics and to whom he made the world of numbers more accessible.  In 1977, after a work related traffic accident, he became an invalid of the first degree with a 100% body damage.  Not without bitterness, these days he contradicts his mathematical logic with the sentence:``Although 100% is the maximum, when I add everything up I am disabled 180%."<p>


None of this prevented the authorities to terminate his status as a civilian invalid, starting with 7/1/92; this to a man who is a victim of fascist terror in the WWII.  His appeal has not been considered to this date.  Retired professor Stojic, after the death of his wife in December of 1991, while he was still in a hospital, upon the release from the hospital ( since the WWII he has been taking daily a ``handful of pills") in January of 1992 found out that his <A HREF = "delozacije1.html">apartment had been broken into</A>; a note reading ``Ministry of Internal Affairs of the republic of Croatia" was attached to the door.<p>

Again, Stojic repeats his rhetorical question, ``is there any point", and tells about his journey from door to door, seeking justice, while being looked down upon even by <i>Caritas</i> [Catholic humanitarian organization] and <i>Red Cross</i>; the journey has lasted for more than three years while tenants keep changing in his apartment from which all property, worth 200,000 DEM had been stolen (he had searched for days for his mementos and photographs in rubbish containers around the apartment building); all this with a legal backup from a ``decree about temporary apartment usage" issued by the the Croatian Ministry of Defense's Karlovac Commission for Accommodations.<p>


While he sleeps in parks, parked train cars and while he randomly wonders in his neighborhood where he is accosted by (to this date unidentified) bandits with words :``I fuck your Serbian chetnik mother. We'll slaughter you all", to which he responds by offering his neck while screaming:``Here cut my neck if you think it will do any good", in the meantime, the authorities have been working on his case.<P>

 

<h2>Optimal Injustice</h2><p>


Already mentioned Karlovac Commission for Temporary Accommodations has issued a document with a signature of Mijo Laic, stating that the Commission placed a refugee family into Stojic's apartment.  In the document issued on 6/3/92 it is written:" When, with help of UNPROFOR forces, the implementation of Vance peace plan begins and refugees return to their villages, the cases of the people thrown out of communally owned apartments will be considered.[ in socialist Yugoslavia all apartments were nominally owned by the "society". In practice that meant that the apartment was initially bought by a company, which would confer lifetime right to use the apartment to one of its employees.  The right to use an apartment could also be inherited and the tenant was in general free to exchange or rent the apartment, but could not legally own it.  After the breakup of Yugoslavia, the successor states have given tenants a chance to gain an ownership of their apartments by paying a small fee to the state.  In Croatia, this right has been denied to <A HREF="delozacije1.html">the tenants in apartments controlled by the ex-Yugoslav Peoples Army</A>, who were mostly of Serb nationality.]  Until then, and taking into account your disability, we ask for your understanding and patience."<p>

That same commission for months refused to issue the decree according to which the Stojic's apartment had been allocated for temporary use (unlawfully since it had not been empty or abandoned).  The decree was demanded by the District Court in Karlovac and the Administrative Court of Croatia but the Commission was apparently above all judicial authorities, so that it never delivered the requested documents.<p>

In March of '93 Karlovac county administration, after consideration of the Stojic's case, rejected his appeal and "supported" the decree for temporary use of his apartment which had been given to a refugee from Slunj.  The following justification was given:" Refugee family from Slunj, S.I., moved into the apartment at the address ..., according to the decree issued on 7/21/92, which was in turn based on the information that the apartment had been empty.  Since the previous tenant in the apartment, Milos Stojic, was at the time obviously using different accommodations and, on the other hand, the refugees had no alternative accommodation, the decree about temporary use of the apartment - until the opportunity for return to the temporarily occupied territory - was issued.  Therefore we support this decree as an optimal solution for the problem."<p>

Administrative Court of Croatia annulled that decree despite the fact that even after "two requests", the Karlovac county administration failed to provide the relevant documents.  Otherwise, Stojic would, due to deafness of the competent Karlovac authorities, have to wait forever, as he has been waiting anyway!<p>

A letter sent on December of '92 by an advisor in the President's office [president of Croatia], Vladimir Subat, to the Karlovac county administration, local government president and the above mentioned president of the Commission for Temporary Accommodations, Mijo Laic, demonstrates how this case is viewed by numerous functionaries:" (Although) I sincerely share the resentment of the citizens of Karlovac and the surrounding areas regarding the injustice inflicted on the people of Croatian nationality, since I myself, in the period starting in 1945, actually since the so-called Calvary of the Croatian people in May of '45 and ending with the democratic elections, passed through many dungeons and places of execution and with my own eyes witnessed crimes against Croatian people; nevertheless, I cannot support any discrimination because we, above all, have a duty to ask what kind of person someone is, rather than what their nationality is.  Therefore, even if the mentioned Milan Stojic expressed his support of cursed Yugoslavia, from which we have with the God's help and courage of Croatian heroes forever been freed, I still could not change my opinion.<p>

"Therefore, Mr. president of the Karlovac local government and the Commission for Temporary Accommodations, I sincerely urge you to do two things: return the apartment to Stojic and engage the Croatian police to find the above listed property and see that it is also returned.<p>

Only by doing that can we show and prove to the world community that we are men of the truth and justice and that Croatia is irrevocably dedicated to pursue a just peace which can be achieved only through equality and a true freedom which can only exist if every individual is allowed to enjoy his property and human rights."<p>


<h2> To Be a Man </h2><p>

In spite of the Court's decision, good intentions backed up by personal suffering like Subat's and  courage against cursed past, despite Stojic's words in an old plea:" Premeditated and systematic crime campaign against me will not diminish or erase crimes committed against others, independently of myself, but can only increase and multiply total evil, misfortune and suffering ..", the case still isn't an inch closer to its resolution.<p>

Milos Stojic, who is homeless, sick and tired cannot even withdraw his money deposited in Croatian banks.  All of his saving certificates, together with the rest of his property, were in his apartment.  Behind the tellers of <i>Zagrebacka</i>, <i>Privredna</i> and <i>Karlovacka</i> banks he keeps finding a wall of silence, lack of understanding and lack of will to help.  A man who had everything and who today cannot even get his (own!) money would use that money to  buy decent clothes to replace those which were stolen and to buy a new hat to cover scars and wounds which are the sign of his, officially abolished, disability.  So that he can feel a little like a man, a citizen of Croatia, equal in something at least.<p>

Since he is already a refugee without a refugee status, invalid whose disability officially doesn't exist any more, bearer of the tenancy rights to an apartment occupied by who knows whom, "owner" of a court decision which cannot be implemented, a man whose past has mostly been stolen and whose future is mostly gone.<p>

<h1>Condoms, Koran and AIDS </h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Sinan Alic<br>  Front Slobode, 8/11/95, Tuzla, Bosnia-Hercegovina</i></h2><p>


<hr>

<h3>39.</h3>

I have to admit that I did not blink once while recently watching a program on TV TPK, actually a recording of a lecture which reis-ul-ulema [religious leader of Bosnian muslims], Dr. Mustafa Ceric, delivered to the wider political leadership of SDA [Stranka Demokratske Akcije, Party of Democratic Action, the largest Muslim party in Bosnia and former Yugoslavia], officers of the 2nd Corps......<p>

I also have to admit that intensive staring into the screen wasn't the result of the speaker's engrossing eloquence nor the stories and facts he told.  On the contrary, I could not believe that so much confusion could creep into a public appearance of a man from whom, taking into account his position and education, one would expect exeptional erudition, unique and unequivocal thinking.<P>

Instead, Dr Ceric's speech was confused, touching on Koran and stories about men who, in the past, have bought the Holy Book for their mothers but did not dare tpuch it; on Americans who "copied something from Koran" and declared that to be democracy; on condoms and injections in order to prove that AIDS won't spread among bosnian muslims; on himself and a story about how some people love hik while others don't; on chetniks who are in our heads and should be thrown out; on alcohol, against which he has nothing, the ban is in the Holy Book; pork etc. etc. etc.<p>

No matter how hard I tried to figure out what reis was aiming at, everything was in vain.  Dilemmas remained.  Maybe that was his intention.<P>

I shook my head for a while, in order to find chetniks in it, so that I could throw them out; chetniks "who are as dangerous as the ones shooting at us from the hills."<p>

I shook it, then shook it some more and still nothing happened.<p>

Was that statement an allusion to something?  I shall not try to interpret it, though it could be interpreted in several ways.<p>

Maybe, that was what reis-ul-ulema wanted.<p>

Then, a friend has asked me:"Have you heard that, in his speech at the City Mosque, rais called for juhad?" I said I had not.<p>

Maybe my friend did not understand correctly!?<p>

<h3>40.</h3>

Unbelievable tragedy of Srebrenica's inhabitants reminded me of the stupidities we did in the first months of the war, the consequences of which we experience these days.<P>

It is not an easy job to find acommodations for approximately 30,000 people in a short period.  How much easier that would be today if the hundreds of dwellings in the towns and villages of Simin Han, Caklovici, Kovacevo Selo, Pozarnica, Smoluca, Jesenica and others haven't been destroyed, demolished and in some cases torched.<p>

No-one can argue today that these events were not a consequence of a vengeful euphoria to which the members of the Territorial Defence and then the inhabitants of the neighboring villages had succumbed.<P>

Although those houses and cottages were private property, in fact, the resources of the state of Bosnia-Hercegovina were destroyed and looted.<P>

If that did not happen, the refugees from Srebrenica would have easily been acommodated, not in tents but in livable houses.<P>

Under the roofs of these houses there were furnished rooms, kitchens full of  house appliances, which based on somebody's "amazing" idea showed up as a war loot at the supermarket next to the market in Tuzla.<P>

It happened!  Let us hope it does not happen again!<P>

<FONT SIZE="+1">The role of media in the making of foreign policy has recently received a lot of attention.  Lurid pictures and reports of unspeakable attrocities prod the "experts", public and politicians into action.  Yugoslav conflict is perhaps one of the best examples of the media influence in our global village.  The images and articles appearing all over the world have usually painted a very simplified picture of the conflict.  Throughout the crisis, the opinions coming from the yugoslavs have been filtered and interpreted, thus denying a direct access to the ideas and facts coming from ex-Yugoslav lands.  The purpose of these pages is to try to offer direct access to the (translated) articles from the Croatian, Yugoslav (Serbian and Montenegrin) and Bosnian press.  The articles are linked to additional documents which give backround to some of the stories and events. Although tne goal is to represent an all-inclusive cross-section of the media outlets, due to the limited access and time at my disposal, this page will for prolonged time periods give more representation to some points of view.  Finally, as my goal is to offer information about the XYU media and not to compete with the original providers of information, the articles will be posted with a delay of at least several weeks.<p>

A translated summary of the articles from the recent issues of "independent" ex-Yu press can be found in  <A HREF="http://MediaFilter.org/MFF/MonIdx.html"> Balkan Media & Policy Monitor</a><p>

<h2> <A HREF="http://.eunet.si/yellowpage/0/mediji1/mladina/mladina.html"><IMG ALT="Mladina" SRC="mladina.gif"></a> </h2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">Mladina (youth) is the best known Slovenian weekly.  It has gained a reputation for challenging, investigative and provocative reporting in the fromer Yugoslavia. Its reporters were in the forefront of the Slovenian independence movement.  In the independent Slovenia, Mladina continues to be an irritant for the authorities, some of which, like the former defense minister, Janez jansa, were in the past involved with the weekly.
This is the history of Mladina as seen by its editorial board:<P>

<b>MLADINA</b> magazine was established in 1943, on the liberated theritory of Slovenia, as a paper of the Communist Youth Organization. For the safety reasons, it was printed in different locations between Ljubljana, Bela Krajina and Kocevje region.  After WW2, it remained the official mouth piece of the Socialist Youth Alliance of Slovenia.<p>

For a few decades Mladina covered various topics: from more or less favorite
reporting on pop culture that "obsessed" the youth generation, recruiting the 
young generations for voluntary youth work, praising the "great" Yugoslav leader Tito and defending the basic principles of the Socialist regime.<p>
However, in the early '80s, Mladina turned into a buldozer that started to destroy all the sacred symbols and taboos of the Socialist society. Through Mladina's eyes, once so-praised Tito became a nasty despot. Mladina's journalists began to dig and question the position of the federal army, the Socialist regime, the role of the League of Communists...<p>
To put it bluntly, they were the pain in the ass for the power structure. And the federal presidency itself had to meet to find out what to do with these "anarcho-liberals" and "agents of the Western intelligence agencies." After Mladina severely attacked the privileged status of the army (and especially the defense minister who used the soldiers to build himself a villa on the Adriatic cost), the army repressive apparatus decided to go after the magazine in 1988.<p>
Under the allegations of stealing the military secret, the trial against the editor-in-chief and two journalists, along with one army officer, was set up and performed in a foreign language (Serbo-Croatian) in the middle of Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. This act unified Slovenes and (in a longer run) led to Slovenia's secession from Yugoslavia. Mladina became a symbol of democratic changes for all Slovenes: from left-wing members of social movements, liberal activists, to right-wing nationalists. Those were happy days for Slovenia: fascists and anarchists holding each others' hands and reading Mladina.<p>

But they were happy days for Mladina as well. Whenever an issue of the magazine 
was banned, the next issue was sold out. The circulation reached over 80,000.<p>
The role of Mladina remained controversial till the recent days. It was one of the rare media that assumed cynical distance towards the rush into Slovenia's independency, and when the ten-day war against federal forces started, Mladina's journalists performed an almost impossible task: they were the only Slovenian reporters to cover the conflicts from both sides. The reporters and photoreporters were on the frontlines all over the country, which resulted not only in a in-deep coverage in the magazine, but also in a book <i>Ten Days of War For Slovenia</i>.<p>

When the war spread to the neighboring countries, Mladina's journalists kept following it. They went to the most dangerous places, and the toll they paid was high: two wounded, one dead. <b>Ivo Standeker</b>, the feature editor, was killed by a Serbian shell in Sarajevo.<p>

Focusing on internal affairs, Mladina has remained  a "pain in the ass" also for the new democraticly elected authorities. Whether conservative or liberal, no politician is safe from its authors' sharp pencils. And as someone once said, Mladina is not only a watchdog. It is a watchdog that barks.

<TITLE>Interview with Vojislav Seselj</TITLE>

<FONT SIZE="+1">

<h1>This Time With a Clear Head</h1>

<strong><em>by Nenad Lj. Stefanovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vreme, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 2/3 1996</h2>

Since the Serbian president has become a peace lover and left the political alliance with the Serbian radical party (so-called patriotic alliance), the leader of the Serbian Radical Party, Dr. Vojislav Seselj, has persistently been repeating that Milosevic's demise was "only a matter of time".<P>

Milosevic is still in power as Vojislav Seselj is about to enter a new pre-election campaign with the same story about the overthrow of Milosevic.  A fact that many have predicted the end of Seselj's political career after his split with Milosevic can serve as a consolation for Seselj: he is still politically alive and kicking.<P>

The leader of the Radicals is certainly among the most controversial personalities on the political scene.  For example, he claims that he is "the least spontaneous politician," and that he "calculates everything in advance."  His political opponents, however, claim that as "an impulsive player" he is too spontaneous.  Seselj sees himself as a very rational politician, while his opponents see him as a man who in politics, especially that with the national prefix, has always supported the same line : "whatever it takes".  Seselj also sees himself as "an extremely well informed politician".  The opponents, on the other hand say that "he used to be well informed,"  while he had good connections in the ruling regime and the police.<P>

<strong>Ivica Dacic has recently said that the elections would take place in the Fall of this year.  He also added that the Socialist Party wouldn't have any problems with this sort of opposition...</strong><P>

The Socialists are weaker than ever before.  Dacic shouldn't be trusted about the date for the forthcoming elections.  His statement is only a trial balloon.  We were convinced that the Socialists would call the elections immediately after the signing of the agreement in Dayton.  That seemed as a most rational option.  They, however, had some internal problems and didn't dare call the elections.  The Socialists could try to surprise the opposition by a sudden call for the elections.  But we will be ready.<P>

<strong>Why would the Socialists hurry with the Serbian elections when they can wait for the regular elections date, next year?</strong><P>

Because the negotiations about the Albanian participation in the elections are currently going on.  Milosevic has made some promises in Dayton and he will try to fulfill them.  If the Albanians participate in the elections than they will have to call elections on all levels, republican and federal.  At the same time, Milosevic is trying to complete and adopt the Constitution before the federal elections, in order to run for the federal president as, according to the law, he cannot run for the Serbian president any more.  He is making combinations with the Democratic Socialist Party of Montenegro [DPS] and it seems that they are now under his control.  He is also behind the expulsion of all radical parliamentarians from the Montenegrin parliament.  He has a lot of data he can use against Milo Djukanovic, Bulatovic, Marovic and other leaders of the DPS.  The former Montenegrin secret police chief, Bojovic, has practically defected to Milosevic, probably bringing the data about all kinds of affairs which had occured in Montenegro.  Montenegrin leadership in under Milosevic's thumb.<P>

<strong>Until recently there's been some talk about the united opposition list for the forthcoming elections.  You were the first one to drop out of that plan...</strong><P> 

If the Socialists impose a new election law, with first-past-the-post electoral system, all of us will try to go to the elections with single opposition candidates.  For now, there is no need for that.  If we were, under these circumstances, to go to the elections with a single list, this could turn away a certain number of our voters.  It could turn away a proportion of the SPO and the Democrats supporters.  The consequence might be a loss of opposition votes.  The cooperation of the opposition parties should be much more serious.  The previous attempts at cooperation were disastrous and shouldn't be repeated.<P>

<strong>Then, you are against a single opposition list and a single leader?</strong><P>

The opposition does not need a single leader.  A person who would try to impose himself as an opposition leader would actually break up the opposition forces.  Neither Draskovic [SPO leader] nor Djindjic [Democrats leader] can lead the opposition.  We have never even contemplated that role.  The opposition must cooperate on a sound basis and without passionate embraces.  We must not love each other too much, because we will hate each other later.  The radicals are prepared for the cooperation with these three opposition parties: SPO, DS [Democratic party] and DSS [Democratic party of Serbia].<P>

<strong>What kind of cooperation between the opposition parties is possible?  On what basis?</strong><P>

We intend to offer an agreement which should be signed by these four opposition parties.  With this agreement we would undertake an obligation never to enter a coalition with the Socialists.  Also we would agree not to support any piece of legislation proposed by the Socialists.  And then we'll see if the agreement is going to work.  This has to be done, at least in a form of an unofficial agreement.  If this cannot be agreed on, that means that some of us are making calculations and planning to trade and conspire with the Socialists.  The Radicals have a very negative experience from the January of 1994.  The opposition was united then as well and we could have defeated the socialists.  At least, we could have forced Milosevic to dissolve that parliament and call the new elections.  However, the New Democracy party betrayed the opposition and gave 4 votes to the Socialists.  Now, we are supposed to give them another chance? Never.  There are other examples for the betrayal of the opposition interests.  When I mention this, they tell me "Yes, but what about the time when you were cooperating with Milosevic?"  I did cooperate with Milosevic, but when I did, I did not cooperate with other opposition parties.  I kept my side of the agreement, Milosevic broke it.<P>

<strong>Does it mean that the opposition will contest these elections in "three alliances"?  You would be in one of them, Djindjic and Kostunica [DSS leader] in another one and Draskovic and some smaller opposition parties in a third one?</strong><P>

That also wouldn't be a good solution.  We shouldn't include small political parties without parliamentary representation, because later it will be impossible to form a common government.  If Draskovic puts the New Democracy in the parliament, he cannot count on any kind of future cooperation with us.  The same goes for Veselinov, or that Canak.  We can tolerate Vesna Pesic [the leader of the Civic Alliance], she is already there [cooperating with the SPO]  and we have nothing against it.  But we cannot tolerate Canak, Veselinov, Rasim Ljajic [the leader of one of two factions of the main muslim party in Serbia, SDA], no.  Who is going to form a government with them after the elections, when each on of them counts on some sort of representation.  It is easy to contest the elections together with them, hug them and raise arms together.<P>

<strong>What do you think about the achievements of the parallel parliament?  How can the public find out about the decisions of that parliament in the conditions of a total media isolation?</strong><P>

The achievements of the parallel parliament are great.  The Socialists are extremely worried about it.  We question the legitimacy of their authority.  It doesn't matter what kind of laws we pass in that parliament; what matters is that we do not return to the Serbian and federal parliament until our conditions are fulfilled.<P>

<strong>Recently, you've said that the parallel parliament is not enough and that it would be necessary "to go out on the streets, but with caution."  What do "cautious demonstrations" look like?</strong><P>

In practice that means that we are ready for non-violent extra-parliamentary political struggle.  Even if the police is violent we should not react.  We should take their blows the way we did in Gnjilane this summer.  Draskovic disagrees with that.  He says: "if the police attacks we will respond with force."  Maybe he can achieve everything that way, but we are not ready for that.<P>

<strong>It seems that you are for the Ghandian, non-violent resistance?</strong><P> 

That is correct.  If we can take enough people to the street, we will win by using non-violent methods.  If we cannot take enough people to the streets, that is the best indicator that the situation is not ripe for change.<P>

<strong>This year's elections will be the first ones on which the economy will have the most prominent role.  The formation of the national state is out, as well as "the winning back of the national pride"...</strong><P>

You should take into account that the Socialists have until now won every election as nationalists.  National, economic and social factors will to a certain extent, play an equal role in the forthcoming elections.  Economic and social factors may be slightly more prominent, but those social problems are related to the national question, with the problem of refugees.  As far as the economy is concerned, the Socialists are very week.  They will use the state-controlled TV in this campaign to try to convince the people that the situations is better now, but it isn't.  And it won't improve in the near future since the Socialists won't receive financial assistance from abroad.<P>

<strong>But they can bring back money from Cyprus...</strong><P>

That will be very hard, since most of that money is in private accounts.  They will begin to flee abroad, one by one, in order to try to keep that money.<P>

<strong>You contested the first post-communist elections on a basis of a nationalist program and the demand for a western Serbian border along the line Virovitica-Karlovac-Karlobag [towns in Croatia].  Later, you talked about equal pensions and wages.  What will it be this year?</strong><P>

We never demanded equal salaries.  We demanded that the salaries in the state-owned companies be regulated through a system of different classes.  We still support that idea.  We also want to speed up privatization and will not get involved with the salaries in the private sector.  As a state, we will insist on a minimum wage.  We also support equalization of all pensions based on the work experience.  We don't have a motto for the forthcoming elections yet.  It will have to include national, economic and social factors.<P>

<strong>Many analysts believe that the peace in Bosnia works against the Radicals?</strong><P>

That is not correct.  Did you hear a few days ago, that Alija Izetbegovic stated that he gave the best chances for victory in the Srpska Republic to the Seselj's Chetniks.  That is the Serbian Radical Party.  Another point: there is no lasting peace in Bosnia.<P>

<strong>Since we are talking about the Srpska Republic, what will you do if you win the elections there?  Would you respect the Dayton agreement, or would you try to change something, since you've said that this agreement was the greatest "betrayal" of Serb national interests?</strong><P>

A legal international document must be respected; however we would do our utmost to change it.  I am convinced that we could achieve that.  For example, if the Americans were interested to include us in the partnership for peace, NATO, we would accept that.  But we would demand the control of eastern Slavonija, Baranja, Vinkovci, Osijek, Zupanja, Dubrovnik and Dubrovnik riviera in return, so that those Serbs who were expelled from Croatia could return there.  It is important for us to return at least a part of the lost territories of the Republic Serb Krajina.  We will never give up and will wait for a suitable historical circumstances to achieve that.  Of course, we do not support a war option, but who knows what will happen in the next 10 years in Europe.  France waited for 47 years to recover Alsace and Lorraine which had been captured by Bismarck in the French-Prussian war.  The history is getting faster and faster; we won't have to wait as long as the French did.  We still claim those territories.<P>

<strong>The Germans also waited for their reunification for a long time.  Still they didn't even consider going to war to achieve that...</strong><P>

We won't use force.  That's for sure.  We are not stupid to think that we can wage war against NATO and the whole world...<P>

<strong>Come on, haven't you demanded, throughout this war that the government stay strong before the rest of the world, cut off all links and say "that's enough, no more negotiations"?  Hasn't this policy brought us where we are today? Whatever it takes?</strong><P>

Had the regime done as we demanded it would have achieved much more.  The Americans were shocked by what Milosevic agreed to in Dayton.  Why do American diplomats talk about the "whiskey corridor"?  It is unbelievable to what he agreed in Dayton.  They approached him scientifically; they have in a computer his personality profile and use that to plan how to negotiate with him.  They know that he is a man who at first resists, only to  later give in and accept much more than what had been asked from him at the beginning.  The policy of procrastination has caused the bad situation on all fronts.  In war, one must have a radical goal.  You have to try to achieve the maximum, then see what you can keep.  And we had 37 cease fires in 1991 only.  Why weren't Dubrovnik, Sibenik, Karlovac and Ogulin captured? Why wasn't all Western Slavonia, Osijek, Vinkovci, Zupanja captured...?  If they were captured we would today have a completely different situation...<P>

<strong>So, you are ready to wage a war against the whole world...?</strong><P>

...Besides, the Croatian independence wouldn't have been recognized.  Croatia would have stayed in the federation, and Serb Krajina would remain as its, at least autonomous, part.  The war in Bosnia-Hercegovina wouldn't have broken out, Macedonia wouldn't have declared independence.  We would have had a rump Yugoslavia.<P>

<strong>One could think of different scenarios too.  Radovan Karadzic, a politician after your taste, kept defying the West, didn't step back and, in the end, he's got a ticket for the Hague.</strong><P>

Karadzic made a terrible mistake in the end.  Had he not allowed Milosevic to represent the Srpska Republic, he would have had to represent it himself.  Now that he has allowed Milosevic to represent RS, they can indict him.  He can be totally ignored.  That signature was fatal.<P>

<strong>You claim that Radovan Karadzic isn't guilty of anything.  You accuse Nikola Koljevic for the bombardment of Sarajevo and Predrag Radic for the destruction of mosques in Banja Luka.  Do you have evidence for these allegations?</strong><P>

There is a written order which shows that Koljevic has ordered the bombardment of Sarajevo.  At the beginning of the civil war in Bosnia-Hercegovina, when the leadership of the SDS withdrew to Pale, the Army demanded a written order for the bombardment of Sarajevo.  Karadzic couldn't issue that order because he was only a party leader, nothing else.  Krajisnik was a president of the Bosnian parliament and said that, as a representative of the legislative authorities he wasn't competent to issue that order.  Biljana Plavsic [Bosnian Serb vice=president, a member of the Bosnian presidency before the war] wasn't in Pale at the time.  Koljevic happened to be there.  He was formally the vicepresident of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Izetbegovic's vicepresident and a member of the Bosnian presidency.  So, he signed that order.  As far as Radic is concerned it is well known that throughout the war he refused to follow Karadzic's orders.  it is known that he had a direct line to Belgrade.  He ordered that the mosques in Banja Luka be demolished.  There is a written order which implicates Koljevic, and for Radic there are a lot of facts.  I don't have anything on a paper, but ...<P>

<strong>You were also mentioned as a candidate for an appearance in the Hague.  Especially after you broke up your "patriotic alliance" with the Socialists...</strong><P>

That was between us and Milosevic.  We had no connections with the Socialist Party, but with Milosevic we had concrete agreements.<P>

<strong>After that alliance fell apart, you and your party were accused of a lot of dirty deeds in this war.</strong> <P>

Fabrications.  If they had anything against the SRS they would have used it a long time ago.  They didn't have anything.  They even arrested a lot of our people and then quietly released them later.  I am the only Serbian politician who has been accused of war crimes by foreign journalists and certain foreign politicians.  I am also the only one who stated that he would voluntarily go to the Hague as soon as they invited him.  They do not need an extradition in my case.  I'll pack my bags immediately.  Besides, I've already had contacts with the Hague tribunal and expressed readiness to go there if indicted.  They told me that they did not have anything and that they did not use journalistic fabrications but concrete facts.  At the same time I informed them that I was ready to appear as a defense witness for Karadzic.  Because I have a lot of evidence which proves that neither Karadzic, nor Martic, at any time during this war, commanded the Army of the Srpska Republic and the Republic Serb Krajina, respectively.  The commands came directly from Belgrade, exclusively from Slobodan Milosevic.  Finally, I've met Ratko Mladic several times during this war, always and exclusively in the office of Slobodan Milosevic.<P>

<strong>Recently, you have been attacking Mirjana Markovic [Milosevic's wife], more often that Milosevic.  These attacks are usually very blunt.  Why has she become a more important target for your attacks?</strong><P>

Because she is the key personality of this regime.  Her word is more respected than his.  If his ideas contradict hers, hers are implemented.<P>

<strong>You've accused Milosevic of drinking, of signing agreements in Dayton while drinking whiskey.  If that is true, why does it bother you?  Zirinovski also likes to drink, so what?</strong><P>

Zirinovski doesn't drink.  He has recently spent three days in Belgrade and hasn't had a drop of alcohol.<P>

<strong>Why do they call him a "puppet of vodka fascism", then?</strong><P>

I think that the western media have tried to make a caricature out of him.  Remember, I also had a similar treatment.<P>

<strong>Isn't is true that you share responsibility for that sort of reputation?  Do you remember that parade with a wooden stake in front of the House of Flowers in Dedinje...</strong>[where Yugoslav Communist leader, Josip Broz Tito is buried]<P>

Wait, wasn't that well received by the public...<P>

<strong>Then that story about rusty spoons for Croats...</strong><P>

Rusty spoons were mentioned on "Minimaxovision," a satirical show.  And they weren't reserved for anyone in particular.  It was a reply to a direct question, "you Chetniks are slaughtering people again?"  I said, of course, only we have changed our methods; now, instead of knifes, we use shoe horns [shoe spoons in Serbo-Croatian]. And rusty ones at that, so that it cannot be established whether the victim died because of butchering or from tetanus.  It was clear that I was trying to satirize the whole thing.  Desa Trevisan was the first journalist who abused this in the London <em>Times</em> when she claimed that I had said that we had slaughtered Croats with shoe horns.<P>

<strong>You've also threatened to bomb Rome, Vienna...</strong><P>

This was supposed to happen if the NATO aircraft bombed Serb targets.  What does it mean: they have a right to bomb us and we do not have a right to hit back.  Our army was capable of that.  They could have bombed Zagreb as well, but Milosevic prevented that when he sent Franko Simatovic Frenki, red berets commander, to take charge of the rockets based on Petrova Gora.  If he hadn't done that, if he hadn't guaranteed Tudjman that he wouldn't use those rockets, the Croats would have never attacked Krajina.<P>

<strong>You were one of the politicians who has often classified the people as "patriots" and "traitors".  Do you feel at least partially responsible that a lot of people are ashamed these days to say that they are patriots?  So many criminals and low-life laundered their resumes in this war and crossed over to the "patriots"?</strong><P>

Not at all. There is the real, true patriotism as well as the fake one.  Those who cashed in on their patriotism weren't true patriots.  But, no one can accuse us of cashing in on our ideals. We haven't dirtied our hands by making money from somebody else's suffering.  All those who became rich are close to the regime.<P>

Economically, we are classical liberals.  We support liberal  capitalism and the complete privatisation of everything that can be privatised and not endanger the normal functioning of a state. Almost Thatcherism.  We differ from others because we insist on a method of privatisation which excludes stealing.  We believe that privatisation has to be implemented through selling instead of on paper.  Everything has to be sold for money on a public auction.<P>

<h1>Years of Living Dangerously: Interview with Dr. Nikola Poplasen, president of the Serb Radical Party for the Republic of Srpska</h1>

<strong><em>by Miodrag Nikolic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Velika Srbija [Greater Serbia], Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 3/20-4/5 1996</h2>

It is not necessary to introduce Dr. Nikola Poplasen, president of the Serb Radical Party for the Republic of Srpska and a professor at the law faculty in Banja Luka, to those who follow political and other events in the former Yugoslavia.  We had a chance to see his face on TV screens of "their" TV stations as well.<P>

However, since the interest for the Serb Radicals and their leaders is growing, we will list a few details from Dr. Poplasen's biography.  By origin a Serb form Knin Krajina [in Croatia], Dr. Poplasen was born in 1951 in Stanisic near Sombor [in Vojvodina, northern Serbia]; probably because of that Slobodan Milosevic's regime does not allow him to cross over the Drina river.  Until the beginning of the war, Dr. Poplasen worked as a professor at the Sarajevo faculty of Political sciences; in 1992, as the majority of Serb patriots, he put on an uniform and joined the defenders of Serbdom.  After first war experiences in the Niksic brigade, in agreement with <a HREF="/info/students/marko/vreme/vreme10.html">Dr. Vojislav Seselj</a> he took over the organization of the Serb Radical Party in Srpska.  In March 1993, at the Serb Radicals congress in Banja Luka, he was elected the president of the party.  Muslim offensive from Bihac in the fall of 1994 started while he was in Belgrade.  He dropped the party business and quickly returned to Srpska and went to the Bihac front together with his students.  He commanded soldiers in the first lines of combat.  Even today he saves a rifle broken by a fragment of a green [Muslim] grenade; for courage in combat and successful command he won the title of the Chetnik vojvoda.<P>

After the collapse of the Muslim offensive he returned to political activities with the goal of turning Serb Radicals into a significant political party in Srpska.<P>

<strong>A lot has changed in Serb lands since your last interview for "Greater Serbia" (issue 18, June 1994).  Where do you see the causes for Serb defeats starting with the fall of Western Slavonia, all the way to the "Dayton peace"?</strong><P>

There are a lot of causes.  It is known that we today live at the time when the USA uses different methods in order to control independent states; especially smaller states which lie in the American path towards the total control of the East.  We do not have significant influence on that.  Another group of causes is connected with the unsuitable behavior of the Serb side in the recent events, especially during the last two years.  It turned out that the regime in Serbia, led by Slobodan Milosevic and him in turn led by his wife Mira Markovic, has again conducted practical experiments on Serbs living west from the Drina and Danube.  All of us witnessed the initial patriotic orientation of the Serb Socialist Party and its support for the national cause.  That kind of policy is behind successful resistance in Knin and the whole of Serb Krajina; without it,  Serb struggle in the former Bosnia-Hercegovina wouldn't have been relatively successful.  However, at the beginning of 1993, there was an obvious about-turn.  Pressure on the leadership of Srpska to accept the capitulation and the Vance-Owen plan illustrates that.  Why did Milosevic switch to a path of treason? Has his bolshevik ideology finally won over, has he become psychologically unstable, was it his wife's influence, fear of world powers, or maybe all of that combined?  It doesn't really matter at this time.<P>

In any case he is a man who doesn't have a privilege to behave like that and make decisions which endanger the existence of the whole nation.  How did he do that?  At first, Solbodan Milosevic, criminalized the Republic Srpska Krajina as a state.  He systematically stifled any expression of independence in Serb Krajina.  He rigged the elections and ensured the leading role for former criminals like Borislav Mikelic and people like him.  All that demoralized population, even produced disgust among the people of Krajina, broke their unity and blunted their will to fight.<P>

With constant concessions to the pressure from the West, intentional weakening of the army of Srpska Krajina and direct work of the people from the Yugoslav army intelligence service, it was ensured that Western Slavonia would fall without resistance.  Of course that attack wouldn't have been successful had not Milosevic guaranteed to Tudman that what happened would happen.  You may recall that on May 1, the day the Croatian attack on Western Slavonia started, state-controlled [Serbian] TV reported that something was happening in western Slavonia only 28 minutes after the beginning of the attack.  Before that they had reports about the celebration of May 1, and good wishes from plum pickers and cabbage harvesters to the Belgrade leaders for May the 1st holiday.  All that was a rehearsal for the total disaster in Serb Dalmatia, Banija, Lika and Kordun, which followed a few months later.  There was no end to the bloodletting.  These events were ignored by the world and the media in Serbia and Yugoslavia.<P>

All that was repeated in Srpska.  Demands for ceasefires and peace process were rejected until a third of Srpska fell in a short time.  After that, those who had bombarded Srpska, killed innocent victims and destroyed civilian and other targets, took the Serb representatives to a closed military base.  Supposedly, there they came to an agreement in order to avoid further bloodletting.  However, the truth is different.<P>

<strong>We will return to that later.  Do you think that it was possible to avoid the defeat?</strong><P> 

In any case, that was not a military defeat.  It was an pre-arranged scenario whose main participants and planners, both from abroad and among the Serbs, are known.  However, the mechanisms and details of the game are still murky.  Nevertheless, in the near future, Serb people will find out about all those who participated in that game and they will get what they deserve.<P>

<strong>How do you assess the role of Srpska leadership in these events?</strong><P>

Our views regarding that are well known.  We are convinced that in 1992, or 1993 or 1994 at the latest, despite strong pressure from Belgrade, we should have proclaimed union of Republics of Serb Krajina and Srpska.  A terrible mistake, with terrible consequences, has been made.  It doesn't help that the state officials from Krajina and Srpska now say that the unification was blocked by Belgrade.  We should have been defiant and implemented that decision on our own despite a certain risk.  I am convinced that the formation of the western Serb state would have produced a state which would have enjoyed respect in Serbia, Yugoslavia and the whole world.  In any case the powers with interests in the Balkans would have realized that a new state had been formed and that its formation is an expression of the will of the people who lives in that state.  All that would have strengthened patriotism and national consciousness in Yugoslavia and speeded up expected and desirable political changes.<P>

Besides that, it was necessary to pay the officers in the armies of Krajina and Srpska from our budget (instead of the Yugoslav army budget) and tie them to the local environment with war assignments, family life and total living perspective...  Also, we shouldn't have moved our military industry to Serbia and tied our logistics to unreliable surroundings.<P>

(...)<P>

<strong>Some claim that Slobodan Milosevic has saved Banja Luka?</strong><P>

You can hear that here and there.  It mostly comes from Milosevic's people who have a task to hide the committed treason and turn the thinking to the opposite direction.  Here in Srpska, almost everyone understands that almost all officers serving in the Srpska army (there were a few exceptions) also had assignments in the Yugoslav army, were paid by the Yugoslav army and could have been blackmailed in different ways because of that.  Besides, a large number of them hails from mixed marriages, has relatives (even immediate families) and summer houses in Croatia and has been indoctrinated with a thick layer of brotherhood and unity which can easily be controlled from the offices of JUL [reformed Yugoslav communists], and intelligence services.  I mention this because, according to my informations, the whole [Bosnian] Krajina and Posavina, all the way to Brcko were supposed to fall within two weeks, like Serb Krajina in Croatia.  The area around Banja Luka and the city itself remained in Serb hands thanks to disobedience of several commanders from Prijedor-Sana area who had deserted their positions and brought some units back to defend their birth places.  All that prolonged the capture of [Bosnian] Krajina, slowed down and changed the American plans and the Serbian authorities' willingness to go along with those plans.  Instead the previous [Contact group] plan was only modified at our expense thanks to already mentioned Milosevic's characteristics.  A number of reporters from Dayton and participants in the negotiations testify that Milosevic was extremely generous.  A day and a half before the end of negotiations, when Izetbegovic was ready to offer the division of Sarajevo, Milosevic refused that offer and gave the whole Sarajevo to the Muslim side (a published map of the Muslim offer shows that Izetbegovic envisaged the whole city as a common district under international control).  In addition to that Milosevic refused to trade parts of Sarajevo for the town of Gorazde, because he assessed that a great concentration of Serbs in Gorazde, those disobedient western Serbs, would make new problems for cooperative Serbia.  You can imagine the situation in which some 30,000 Muslims receive a 20-30km wide corridor and 800,000 Serbs living west from Brcko get only a 4km wide corridor.  That is Slobodan Milosevic's policy in Dayton, the one he called a victory of peace and human tolerance.<P>

(...)<P>

<strong>So far, we have been talking about the past.  The war has been replaced by "Dayton peace".  What do the Serb Radicals think about that "peace"?</strong><P>

The Dayton peace, as every other peace, is an interlude between two wars.  A true peace would have been achieved a long time ago in these territories, actually there wouldn't have been a war, had it not been produced in Western European and American kitchens with initial approval from Moscow and later from Belgrade.  Therefore, everything achieved in Dayton is an extension of the imperial policy of the greatest world power, its subjugation of independent areas on the globe.  Dayton papers have certain characteristics which will in the future be studied as a historic curiosity.  Above all, in a lot of ways they cannot be implemented.  The jurisdiction of Bosnia-Hercegovina overlaps those given to the entities and vice versa.  Then, it will be impossible to organize the elections unless basic human and voting rights are openly violated.  Dayton papers also ensure total military dominance of the NATO troops, while the civilian affairs are mostly controlled by the representatives and institutions from the EU.  Therefore, Dayton papers have a built-in potential clash between Europe and America.  We can see that this is so from the opposing statements given by the European Union representatives  and people from the American administration.  Dayton papers are based on the concept of Muslim-Croatian federation in opposition to the Serb entity.  this is an attempt to form a untied state which keeps falling further apart with every new day.  While the Serbs are preoccupied with the historic need to establish their own state as a safeguard against genocide to which they have been exposed in history,  muslims and Croats hate each other and that determines their relations and behavior.  Americans and Germans will really need a lot of force, pressure and skill in order to maintain a situation without killing and military clashes.<P>

<strong>Is the Dayton agreement favorable for Serbs or not?</strong><P>

I would just like to state several facts without trying to assess any of them.  I've already mentioned that the Serbs were decimated from the air and brought into a situation when they had to sign something.  Prior to that, all Serb attempts to seek a peaceful solution had been blocked, until the total genocide in Serb Krajina had been arranged, and a third of Srpska fallen.  Only after that, our representatives were taken to a military base of the power behind these events to supposedly "negotiate".  See, the title of the Dayton agreement is "peace agreement about Bosnia-Hercegovina," and in that sense it should be a document which outlines certain positive and negative sanctions and norms.  Instead, it is more of a political than a legal document, since in its key elements, it allows the possibility for arbitration, i.e. political decisions.  Another characteristic of the Dayton paper is that it puts Bosnia-Hercegovina under foreign rule.  Foreign rule is visible not only from the presence of the IFOR troops and international police forces, but also in various institutions, commissions etc.  Every commission envisioned by the Dayton paper is chaired by a foreigner who can side with the representatives of either nation and provide majority necessary to pass a so-called legal decision.  However, in some of the most important factors, national equality is totally ignored.  For example, Mr. Bildt, according to the Dayton papers is supposed to appoint to the common Civilian commission people whom he finds cooperative.  Foreigners decide who can take part in elections, who cannot, whether a political party should be banned, whether some individual can run for an office and all other aspects of the elections.<P>

As far as we are concerned, it is important that we didn't sign the Dayton agreement, and if we had a choice, we wouldn't have.  Nevertheless, the Serb Radical Party recognizes current authorities in Srpska; we consider that the Serb Democratic party won the majority in democratic elections and is entitled to make decisions.  Our authorities empowered Milosevic to sign the agreement and he not only prepared a tragedy for us but also for the whole of Yugoslavia and Serbia.  However, in view of current situation, we believe that we should make sure that Srpska keeps all the attributes of statehood given to the entities in the agreement and to gain more if possible; that the border between two entities should become as much as possible like an international border so that in the future in a more propitious moment when Serbia and Yugoslavia find their patriotic conscience and Russia finds its soul we can join the motherland.  We are convinced that in that historical context neither Knin nor Gracac nor Okucani were irrevocably lost.  But in the present situation it would be suicidal, unnecessary and unproductive to keep fighting.  I think that it is necessary to switch to political means for struggle and to use arguments of another kind:  truth, diplomatic skill, reason etc.  Also one should keep in mind that our defeat wasn't a military defeat but the result of outside intervention and bargaining.  It should not be forgotten that the main goal of the NATO bombardment was to totally demoralize Serb army and destroy its organizational unity.  However, we haven't lost all hope; with a lot of firmness and more patriotism I think that we shall see a better future.<P>

(...)<P>

<strong>According to the Dayton peace agreement, the former Bosnia-Hercegovina is supposed to function as a union between the Muslim-Croat federation and the Republic of Srpska.  It there a precedent for this arrangement in the political practice?</strong><P>

No, such a political system does not exist anywhere, neither in theory nor in practice.  Both entities, "the republic of Srpska" and "the Muslim-Croat federation" have some elements of statehood.  Nevertheless, only our propaganda treats them as states.  Bosnia-Hercegovina was recognized as a state, but on the other hand the Dayton agreement stipulates that each entity has its own army and police and that the army and police of one entity can not cross into the territory of the other entity without its permission.  The next article states that the military force is supposed to preserve territorial integrity of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  These two "solutions" absolutely exclude each other.  Simply, the Dayton agreement is an unrealizable document which strives to preserve a confusing and chaotic situation.  The document is an expression of the world power's intentions and it does not fulfill the needs of the local population.  From the beginning, the Serb Radicals have been striving for the lasting peace in the Balkans and they are convinced that the lasting peace is only possible with a firm border towards our un-brothers, Croats and muslims.  There had been no problems nor bloodshed between Serbs and Croats until they started living in a common state.  It is not a problem if someone from Prijedor or Banja Luka wants to go to Zagreb, even five times a day.  But he  has to do it with a passport and, in case there is a problem, our citizen can contact his embassy or a consulate and resolve the problem.  At French-German border you have to speed up in order not to disturb the flow of traffic.  But if there is a dispute between France and Germany, not even a bird will be able to cross that border.  I don't understand why some people suggest that we will remain in a conflict laden situation and that a cooperation would not be possible after the establishment of a border.  We will cooperate according to mutual interests.  Serbs will have to decide what is in their interest and where to cooperate.  The same is true for Croats.  If they find mutual interests then a "soft" border will be acceptable.<P>

The world destroyed Yugoslavia as a multiethnic state and quickly recognized some of the successor states and now insists on Bosnia-Hercegovina as a multiethnic state.  This only sets the scene for another bloodshed in the future.  We really do not want bloodshed, but a peaceful and civilized life in the future, and that is only possible with a firmly established border.  Because of that we insist on treating the inter-entity border as an international border and intervene in all cases where the inter-entity border is treated as unnecessary and porous;  above all, we insist that the Serbs be treated as an equal partner.  One can not speak about the return of some [refugees] and not others.  Consider the example from the <a HREF="/home/marko/public_html/otoci.html">trial of that Ustasha soldier</a> who had butchered an old woman and was acquitted at the trial with the justification that the woman had reached under her apron.  He said that she might have wanted to pull out a gun to kill him and because of that he butchered a seventy-years-old woman.  In that sort of environment not one of the Serbs from Serb Krajina can return to his hearth.  At the same time there are pressures to allow the return of Croats and muslims to their homes.  I simply insist on equal treatment, as was stipulated in the Dayton agreement.<P>

(...)<P>    
  

<strong>It seems there is no hope for a Serb state west of the Drina river.  Do you see a chance for getting out of the Dayton mouse trap?</strong><P>

There is hope and there is a chance.(...)  We must realize that our national demise (as a state, economic, political and biological self-destruction) will be total and irreversible if the leftist parties win in the coming elections.  Leftist forces do not stand a chance in a fair contest.  However, pressure and blackmail are horrible.  JUL [reformed Yugoslav Communist party] and SPS [Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist Party] members are visiting directors and businessmen, in order to blackmail and threaten them.  They combine money and fear.  Exactly what they did with some officers during the war.  But they don't have grass roots support.  Banja Luka TV viewers had a chance to see a UN spokesperson speaking at the promotional rally for the United Left [UL] about the future links between nations to the audience of thirty boys with average age of 75 - true remnants of the past.<P>

(...)<P>

<strong>The Dayton agreement envisages the return of all displaced persons.  The majority of Serbs does not have an intention of returning to the territory under Croat or muslim rule.  How will that influence election results if, for example IFOR, escorts a group of muslims or Croats?</strong><P>

As far as I know, the problem of active and passive voting rights in the forthcoming elections hasn't yet been solved.  I'm not saying that that problem cannot be solved, but the present approach makes it unsolvable.  For example, if those  registered to vote at a particular place in 1991 have a right to vote at the same place in this elections, 98% of Drvar inhabitants will vote for a patriotic option and reach a decision to join Drvar, and many other towns, to Srpska.  Gentlemen say that that is possible in theory, but than the Dayton paper doesn't apply any more.  If the Dayton paper was a given solution which we were forced to accept and do accept in order to prevent bloodshed, than the problem of voting rights has to be solved within the framework of that solution.  There is also the problem of people who live in Serbia, those scattered from Chicago and Europe to Sidney in Australia.  It is not a simple undertaking to inform people, organize voting, count the votes and do all of that correctly.  (...)  Further, a large number of Serb  from the territories of the former republic of Croatia and the republic of Serb Krajina has been living in Srpska for years.  They have been here for several years and now someone is going to (it seems that has been done already) take their voting rights away, while someone who has decided to stay in Chicago will have that right.(...)  The solution for this problem should be based on the present situation: all those citizens who live in Srpska and have appropriate documentation should vote where they are now.  Persons who feel connection to Bosnia-Hercegovina but live in Yugoslavia and other states, should vote if they wish and should be able to do so.<P>

See how far this cynicism goes.  Srpska leadership has been accused for the exodus from Sarajevo.  At the same time, a few days ago, federal police entered Ilijas in which about ten elderly Serbs remained and killed all of them.  It seems that Srpska leadership should have forced the remaining Serbs to stay in Ilijas and be slaughtered as well.  Really, there is no end to that irony.  those who had to leave Ilijas  are supposed to vote for the local authorities and can not even get close to the town.  That has nothing to do with basic democratic principles (...)<P>

(...)<P>

Listen, if you are asking if muslims should return to Prijedor, let me ask you whether Serbs should return to Knin?  Why should I, although that is demanded from me, speak against my own nation?!  Again that old syndrome: I can only be a humanist if I spit on my nation and work against its interests; otherwise I'm a nationalist.  I have to say that I don't belong to leftist currents who used to pride themselves on their empty internationalism and humanism...  I do accept that all people are the same: two arms, a head, two legs, a right to live; in that sense we are all equal.  We are also human beings but besides that we should remember that we live in this area and that our culture is Serb, not Japanese.  It could be that two individuals are drinking Coca-Cola, but each one of them drinks it in his own way in his own territory.  I can not accept unequal approach, to discuss return of some while the others are set aside.(...)<P>

Repatriation is a natural process.  I understand that some persons want to die at the same place they were born, but the return has to be organized and to apply to everyone.  I do not support Milosevic's motto: "all Serbs in one state," Serbia from Belgrade to Kragujevac [city in central Serbia].<P>

<strong>What do you think about the Hague war crimes tribunal and extradition according to its criteria?  The latest indictment is against Mr. Milan Martic?!</strong><P>

The purpose of the Hague tribunal is obvious.  Mr. Martic is a great patriot and I have a lot of respect for him.(...)  I absolutely support his statement regarding the Hague tribunal indictment.<P>

"Hague tribunal" is a theater, not a court.  remember that the prosecutor general, Mr. Goldstone was a high official of the South African republic at the time when that state occupied a part of the neighboring state and that several hundred persons were killed during that occupation.(...)   Another detail: from its start, the tribunal has been braking its own rules.<P>

People are being arrested in order to testify.  Complete farce.  Goldstone reminds me of a character in the novel "Fortress" by great Serb writer Mesa Selimovic.  That character tries to convince his collocutor that the whole people should be arrested and only those who can prove that they are not guilty of anything released.<P>

(...)<P>

<strong>What are the views of the Serb Radical Party regarding the media?</strong><P>

Public opinion is one of the most important factors in the democratic society.  In that context media should be highly professional.  Professionalism also means that the media should have in mind in which state they work.  I don't understand some media in Serbia who spit on Serbs and Serb people more than the media in Rome, Vienna, Berlin and Washington, and all that is followed with large donations from abroad without any control.  I also have to mention that the present media situation in Srpska is unsatisfactory.  Coverage and links between radio and TV stations as well as the attitude of relevant authorities are totally unsatisfactory.(...)<P>

<strong>Serbs have been lost in the war both in the media field and in diplomacy, while Croats have found powerful and rich allies.  Is that Serb failure, perhaps, the reason for the Serb defeat?</strong><P>


These is a lot of truth in that.  Croatian television has several thousand employees; it is led by the fanatics of the neo-Ustashe state; it has unlimited financial resources in the west, especially Germany.  They have been spending and keep spending as much as they need (...).  However, it is sad that for a long time Serbian TV has been working together, almost in sync, with the Croatian TV.<P>

As far as the Croatian allies are concerned situation is somewhat different.  Croats found themselves on a gigantic wave of the American-German empire surging towards the East.  Because of that, it seems that Tudman has surpassed with his success both Starcevic and Pavelic.  The price for that is the total loss of independence. (...)  Croatia will become a German colony and will rapidly sink into poverty at the level of poor African and Latin American countries.  Several percent of the population, rich servants of the West will rule a huge poor majority which will work for miserly wages or be unemployed.  All that is the result of "thousand years long" search of Croats for a master.(...)  Serbs would make a fatal error to re-establish any sort of a common state with them.<P>

<strong>Last year, you published a book under title "Radical nature of western Serbs."  One of the chapters of that book is entitled: we are for the society of rich Serbs.</strong><P>

I think that that is possible.  Srpska has satisfactory agricultural potential and relatively satisfactory industrial potential and infrastructure.  But society of rich Serbs should be also a spiritually rich society.  We should cultivate our rich spiritual and cultural tradition which will be a strong support for our individual and national life in the future.(...)  During the communist dictatorship a Serb was proud if he didn't know anything about his own culture while he hurried to congratulate his neighbors on Catholic Christmas or Muslim Bayram.  Actually that was a policy of anationalization under the mask of internationalism which was advertised to Serbs as a higher value with respect to their traditional culture and respect of own national and cultural customs.<P>

Serb radicals are convinced that a strong reliance on tradition is a jumping stone into a modern, civilized society (...).  Traditional Serb culture can proudly stand shoulder to shoulder with English, French, German culture...(...)<P>

<h1>Martin to Zagreb, Martin from Zagreb</h1>

<strong><em>by Ognjen Mihajlovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Velika Srbija [Greater Serbia], Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 3/20-4/5 1996</h2>

Serbian media should urgently be taken out of the jurisdiction of the Serbian Ministry for Information and the Serbian Parliament and be put under the care of the Ministry for environment.  Or even better, the care for the media should be the duty of the Health Ministry.  Radio-TV spectrum above Serbia is so polluted, that the dangerous outbreak of different psycho-somatic diseases can be expected any day.  A large number of viewers have already had the first symptoms; the most frequent indications for the disease are sickness and vomiting (followed by a huge amount of obscenities).  People suffering from ulcers are in the greatest danger.<P>

How can one stay healthy, both psychologically and physically, after a spate of all kinds of fraternizing with the murderers?  We had a hard time pulling through "United brothers", and already, we are being served a comedy entitled "Normalization of relations between FR Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia."  The author of this serial (most likely a woman, a comrade) probably had in mind that plain stupidity is a sure-fire way to induce laughter in the audience.  However, the project has failed because it has deeply hurt the feelings of the population.  It would have been ridiculous if it wasn't morbid.<P>

<h2>Trial as a Provocation</h2>

The strongest and most terrifying proof that the "normalization" is simply a communist-ustashe crime against the Serbs, is the "coincidence" that on the same day when comrade Minister of Foreign Relations, Milutinovic, arrived on a visit to Croatian Foreign Minister, Mate Granic, Croatian authorities started the <a HREF="/info/students/marko/vreme/vreme9.html">trial against a group of 18 Serbs</a> (two of whom are sill at large) accused for spying against "their beautiful country."  Taking into account that in Croatia trials to Serbs are not news but simply filth, this wasn't surprising.  Also it was clear why the beginning of the trial was scheduled for Monday, March 11.  Exactly like when cannibals dance around a fire on which they roast their victims.  This way, ustashe are not only sadistically torturing the Serbs in a courtroom, but also laughing in the face of the whole Serbdom and Serbia.  That's how much they care for a Serbian minister.  However, only Croats think that that Minister is Serbian; here, people know who is in power.  It is true that the majority of Croats believes that they have defeated Serbs in this war, but they don't understand that in that war Serbia was ruled by the Communists.  Of course Milutinovic knows well who is the boss, and he doesn't give a damn for trials and other offenses at the expense of the Serb people.  Because of that he did not feel, nor react to this "provocation".  In Serb language there is a much better word for this.<P>

<h2>It's Snowing and Heads are Falling</h2>

Well known Croatian cynicism was dominant throughout the negotiations.  For example, they, the Croatian side were, of course "worried that they hadn't received a clear answer about the fate of the missing persons and those individuals incarcerated in the Yugoslav territory."  Unlike Croats, Serbs know the fate of our missing and imprisoned persons in Croatia.  The Minister didn't find it appropriate to react to all that with a single word.  If he didn't express outrage and leave such cynical negotiations, he should have at least demanded that Croats provide data about the missing and incarcerated Serbs in Croatia going several centuries to the past.  Instead he went to meet with some unrepresentative representatives of the Serbs in Croatia.  Let us not mention Milutinovic's small talk with Tudman about the weather and snowfall on that day (this could be clearly heard during their meeting, while the cameras were on).  It didn't matter that at the same time Serb heads were rolling in a Zagreb courtroom; it was important to solve the problem of snowed in cities, since they had both, in their own way, solved the "Serb question".<P>

<h2>Diplomat's ABC</h2>

You are wrong if you think that diplomats sometimes have to discuss even weather.  Any normal country would have refused to negotiate until the trial was adjourned and accused released.  Or, it would have used this judicial farce as an excuse to cancel the visit, for which the responsibility would lie on the other side, in this case Croatia.  That way they would have remained clean in the eyes of the world and their own people, actually their voters since they don't recognize the existence of the Serb people.  But no, it was necessary to play the role of poltroons all the way, and ignore everything in order to please the Americans and ustashe.  In this case, it is indeed brutal to talk to Poglavnik [Ustashe leader in WWII; Ustashe are a Croatian fascist movement] about snow while the Serb heads are rolling: he could have at least tried to show respect for the relatives of the slain, tortured and tried victims.  If only Milutinovic managed to get something!  No!  Reply to all his appeals was the same: "It is feasible in theory, but..."  The only palpable result was the announcement of the forthcoming Granic's visit to Belgrade.  "Sometimes in April."  And if by chance, that visit falls on April 10, the anniversary of NDH [NDH, or Independent State of Croatia was a German puppet state in Croatia during WWII, ruled by Ustashe]...  Serbs will celebrate that day by working, eating grass.  That is the way we are treated by pro-ustashe communist regime in Serbia.<P>

<h2>Ustashe-Communist Alliance</h2>

This is old news: ustashe and communists ("leftists") have been collaborating forever.  Just recall that when ustashe, before World War II, organized a so-called "Lika uprising", led by Mile Budak, a horrible criminal and cannibal, this uprising was supported by the Communists ("leftists").  During World War II, communists hushed up news about Jasenovac [Ustashe run concentration camp in which somewhere between 8,000 (Croatian president Tudman), 50,000-60,000 (scientific estimate) and 1,000,000 (Serb nationalists) Serbs were murdered by during WWII] and never even tried to liberate prisoners from the camp, although Ustashe defense of this area was very weak.  After the war, their beloved tito (deliberately not in capitals), never demanded extradition of pavelic (same as the name of the already mentioned croat).  That monster died from wounds which were the result of an assassination by the Draza Mihajlovic's Chetniks.  Finally, Milutinovic shook an ustasha hand while only a few hundred meters away 16 Serbs were fighting for their lives.  There is not enough newsprint in Serbia to print all the evidence for the alliance of the ustase and communists.<P>

<h2>Degen and his Namesakes</h2>

To compound the shame, 18 accused Serbs are defended by a Zagreb lawyer Silvije Degen, who has stated that the trial was not fair.  His Belgrade namesakes [degen = degenerate] haven't reacted so far.  As far as that trial is concerned.<P>

Belgrade journalists had better things to do in Zagreb [Croatian capital].  They scattered all over the city making reports about the life in the capital of NDH.  Reporters from all Belgrade TV stations, state-controlled, private and confiscated, simply tried to outdo each other while trying to describe atmosphere on "Jelacic square" and other Zagreb "landmarks".  They liked Zagreb so much that they should have entered one of the Catholic churches and converted to Catholicism [Croats are Catholics while Serbs are Eastern Orthodox; by converting to Catholicism, a Serb becomes a Croat].  Of course later, in editing, they used simplest tools: almost all reports were based on surveys.  The easiest thing for a journalist: push a microphone to faces of several passerbys, pick out the suitable statements and your minutes are already there.(...)  If they are really journalists how come they haven't been to the frontlines in Serb Krajina and Srpska?  Belgrade journalists who crossed the Drina river in the moments crucial for the Serb people can be counted with fingers of one hand.  Those who made it to Pale don't count, since  Pale was nothing but a center for smuggling:  real war was in Grbavica.  No, it was much safer and financially conducive to sit in offices and regurgitate agency news reports.  And to conduct surveys.<P>

<h2>Journalists who aren't that</h2>

Interviews from Zagreb couldn't hide the fact that Croats cannot stand Serbs, and neither the communists. Simply, there were not enough suitable answers.  The papers were the same as Television.  The following day, Belgrade papers were full of titles "One day in Zagreb" from the hands of those same uneducated and third rate writers.  The only quality of the new "journalistic elite" working for numerous TV stations are their pretty faces (and even that is questionable: god knows what they look like without make up)?!<P>

(...)<P>

<h2>The End of Journalism</h2>

Empty headed fools ran around in Zagreb and sit in offices of <em>Politika</em>, <em>Vecernje Novosti</em> and other state-controlled papers.  They have to sweat for hours in order to produce half a column about weather.<P>

Latest "pens of the Belgrade journalism" have no education, talent nor ideas.  They are simply pretty faces with party membership.  Because of that it is not surprising that they did not offer support when the authorities assailed <a HREF="/home/marko/public_html/studioB.html"><em>Studio B</em></a>.<P>

There are no journalists left in Belgrade and Serbia.  Still, the reports and visit to Zagreb reveal something very important.  Ustashe have deceived communists, used their alliance with the leftists in order to keep persecuting Serbs on their own, pushing them all the way to Zemun [Belgrade suburb] and Terazije [square in the center of Belgrade].  Nevertheless, Zagreb inhabitants gave us some hope: judging from the interviews, Croats will save us from a new JUL's [Yugoslav refounded Communists] Yugoslavia!<P>

<h1> Serbs in Serbia bother him</h1>

<H2>by M.Antic, <em>Evropske Novosti, (European edition of Vecernje Novosti, Belgrade, FRY), 8/14/95</em></h2><P>

<hr>

Shiptar [Albanian name for themselves; used here to differentiate between the Albanians from Albania (i.e. "real" Albanians) and those who live in Serbia and Makedonia (i.e. Shiptars)] secessionists raised their voice at Kosmet [Kosovo and Metohija, Serbian name corresponding to Albanian Kosova] against the arrival and accommodation of refugees at Kosovo and Metohija, even before a single expelled Serb from Serb Krajina arrived in this southernmost part of Serbia.  While only minor shiptar political parties were speaking out against the arrival of the Serb refugees to Kosovo, no-one was paying attention.<P>

However, yesterday, first the vice-president of the Democratic Union of Kosovo, Hidayet Hiseni, and later the president Ibrahim Rugova announced their opinions regarding this subject.  Without a blink, they stated that the announced arrival of refugees to Kosovo was "nothing else but ethnic cleansing of Shiptars from Kosovo and its colonization by Serbs, a kind of serbization";  therefore they recommended that the refugees avoid Kosovo since they were, supposedly, " a great danger for peace at the south of the Balkans"!<P>

<h2>Pathological Hate</h2>

Shiptar secessionist leaders until now haven't with a single word condemned Croatian aggression on Krajina and the genocide which Franjo Tudman's bojovnici conducted against Serb people; on the contrary, they have been gloating in their pronouncements for the foreign public;  they couldn't hide their pleasure that "Serbia isn't ," as they said, "the strongest military power on the Balkans."  Encouraged [with the Croatian victory] they proclaimed to, not only the Serbian and Yugoslav public, but also the world public that they wouldn't accepts Serb refugees at Kosovo, since these wretches would supposedly cause disturbances in Kosovo and light the fuse of war.  The refugees would do this by occupying, as comments in Shiptar press stated, "shiptar plots, houses, apartments and jobs."  They were especially frightened that a "massive arrival" of refugees, although Kosovo at the moment cannot receive more than 20,000 expelled persons from Krajina, would disturb the ethnic composition of the population of Kosovo and endanger their secessionist appetites.<P>

Secessionists, of course, have a right on their fears; they have finally understood after everything that has happened in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, that they didn't have a slightest right on secession from Serbia and Yugoslavia.  Still, they are unable to hide their pathological hatred towards those with whom and in whose state they have been living for centuries.  They go as far as trying to frighten Kosmet Serbs into not receiving their brothers from Krajina in the moment of their greatest misfortune.

<h2>Anonymous Benefactors</h2>

The majority of shiptar population on Kosmet still lives under strict control of their secessionists, who hold the population firmly in their claws.  The majority of shipter population, neither has a chance nor are in a situation to rebel against such inhuman behavior of the shiptar secessionists, although they actually deeply disagree with them.  Nevertheless, recently, when the Serbs from Kosmet stood up to collect assistance and secure accommodations for their brothers from the other side of the Drina river,  a number of shiptars from Pristina, Strbac, Prizren, Pec, Gnjilane and a few other towns joined this humanitarian action initiated by their Serb neighbors and donated money and goods.  It is true that their number was small; however, the new trend was that besides individuals, private merchants, entrepreneurs and directors of larger companies appeared for the first time.  All of them, and those people contacted our Pristina office asking where they can anonymously offer assistance, invariably requested to stay anonymous.  Their fears should be understood, since the secessionists don't choose means or ways for revenge "for treason."<P>

As far as the arrival of the Serb refugees from Krajina is concerned, local Serbs demand and are ready to receive as many as possible.  They know what an exodus is and what it is like to be forced to flee your home under pressure.  It is known that during the rule of shiptar secessionists [1974-1987], close to 500,000 Serbs were expelled from Kosovo.  Shiptar secessionists, although they know about this fact, are now bothered by the arrival of a couple of thousands of refugees; in their sick secessionist imagination even a single Serb is a great danger.<P>

Well, that's their problem.  Serbian people from Kosmet, all of their political forces, as well as relevant state authorities are ready, more than ever, and united  in their generous acceptance of their brothers from Krajina;  they want to offer [the refugees] a roof over their heads and the secure safe and peaceful living.  Besides that, they point out that the statements of the shiptar secessionists are simply their attempt to frighten the Serbs.  In Kosovo and in Serbia those statements are the secessionist's only "guns".<P>

<h1><a NAME="bela"> He is celebrating somebody else's sorrow</a></h1>

<H2>by M. Mitric, <em>Evropske Novosti, (European edition of Vecernje Novosti, Belgrade, FRY), 8/14/95</em></h2><P>

<hr>

Bela Tonkovic, the president of the democratic union of Croats in Vojvodina asked, according to the Croatian Radio, Croatian authorities to hold on to the Serb Krajina soldiers whom they had imprisoned, until the FRY agrees to guarantee the total protection of the Croatian population in Vojvodina.<P>

Tonkovic wrote to Nikica Valentic, the Croatian prime minister, that since a few days ago, members of Krajina units who had escaped to Vojvodina have been terrorizing Vojvodina Croats with guns.<P>

It is true that in some villages in Srem anger has clouded the reasoning of a small number of exiles; carried away in their misfortune and pain they tried to solve their problems illegally.  Their actions can be understood, but cannot be justified. <P>

Unfortunately, Bela Tonkovic and other leaders of his party are doing everything to cause a clash in Subotica.  He, together with his followers, publicly celebrated in this city the fall of Knin; also, he is politicizing the traditional harvest festival which is celebrated today.  Posters for the harvest festival in the township of Mala Bosna display a picture of Ban Jelacic and sahovnica [Croatian coat of arms];  Tonkovic has recently sent members of his youth organization, "Croatian youth", all the way to Split to personally congratulate on the victory of bojovniks [pejrative for Croatian soldiers].  The expenses for this excursion were covered by certain sponsors from Subotica.<P>

While certain political parties and individuals demanded that the todays harvest festival, "Duzijanca", be postponed for better times, Tonkovic refused and instead invited "clerks" from Zagreb and charge d' affairs from some 15 embassies in Belgrade.<P>

While last night, a refugee convoy passed through Subotica on its way to Palic, a "festa" [celebration, fiesta] was taking place in the center of the city on a specially for this occasion built stage.<P>

With actions like these, isn't Bela Tonkovic asking for trouble?

<h1> <a NAME="magda">Luxury in Prison</a></h1>

<h2> by V. Zalac, Evropske Novosti, FR Yugoslavia, 10/25/95</h2>

Marinko Magda, a Yugoslav citizen born in Subotica, will spend the rest of his life in a well guarded and lavishly equipped prison cell in Hungary, provided this country's Supreme Court doesn't change the verdict of Dr. Zoltan Varga, the president of the three member council of the District Court in Budapest.<P>

Until the final verdict is pronounced, and the date for that hasn't been  officially announced yet, Magda will stay in a special cell, with modern equipment, in the Budapest Investigative Prison.<P>

This cell looks more like a room in one of the capital's hotels on the famous and well guarded Marko Street; more then 2 million of Forints have been spent for its adaptation, furniture and a color TV with a remote control.<P>

The prison is connected  via special corridors and elevators to the Palace of Justice, where Magda, the former officer in the French Foreign Legion, was sentenced three months ago to the life in prison;  this punishment, the harshest in the Hungarian law, has been in the Hungarian constitution since 1990.<P>

<h2>Possible Surprises</h2>

It is persistently reported that the Supreme Court verdict in this case will also be proclaimed in the beautiful hall of the District Court in Budapest.<P>

As we have unofficially been told, this is the safest option for the Hungarian police, since the whole action of transportation of the prisoner who has received  the largest amount of media attention in the recent history of Hungarian Justice, would be out of reach of the street crowd and therefore avoid the risk of potential unpleasant surprises.<P>

"I don't intend to appeal nor to state anything.  A 9mm bullet will speak on my behalf one day," repeated Magda on his way out of the courtroom after the pronouncement of the verdict; he also said to the gathered journalists that in the following two decades many pleasant and unpleasant surprises may occur.<P>

The Hungarian newspaper justice columns, although not on the front pages any more, are still consumed with descriptions of the most spectacular and controversial trial in the Hungarian courtrooms; recently, some new and interesting details have been revealed.<P>

Readers of the Hungarian daily newspapers have been told that the final verdict probably won't even for an inch reduce the verdict proclaimed on 10/6/95 on behalf of the three member Court Council by the correct and patient judge, Dr. Zoltan Varga.<P>

Most commentators are criticizing the police and judicial authorities; they suggest that Marinko Magda "should have been sent to his homeland, where he would probably hang for the crimes described in the Yugoslav indictment."<P>

"This way," continues the commentator for the high circulation capital paper, <em>Pest Report</em>, "Magda remains in our jail and unfortunately in care of our increasingly poor state."<P>

According to one calculation, Hungarian authorities spend 2,000 Forints  per prisoner every day; Magda's day is however, according to the well informed sources, much more expensive.  The already mentioned 2,000 Forints spent on regular prisoners include, besides food, rent, heating, electricity, warm water and finally monthly salaries of the prison guards.<P>

The expenses for the former officer in the French Foreign Legion are much higher since Magda, as is emphasized here, is a high risk prisoner.  Magda is treated significantly better than other prisoners and that includes a cozy and well guarded cell, color TV with a remote control, newspapers, writing and drawing supplies, since this prisoner has equally developed inclination for painting and literary work, and finally specially trained guards.<P>

Police publicly stated that Magda will, provided he stays in Hungarian prisons for 25 years, cost the state more than 18 million Forints.<P>

This amount, say police officials, will be significantly exceeded, since it is expected that after the pronouncement of the final verdict, Magda will temporarily be moved to the most famous jails in Hungary.<P>

<h2>Occasional Relocations</h2>

It is already known that this prisoner, for whom both journalists and readers say that their country would be better off without him, will be moved after the pronouncement of the final verdict to a special cell of the famous prison in Sator Uyhely, close to the border with Ukraine and Slovakia.<P>

The adaptation of a number of cells which are already being used for holding of criminals sentenced to long jail terms has recently been finished in that Hungarian "Alcatraz", and in several other prisons in Hungary.<P>

The equipment for only one of these cells costs close to 3 million Forints.  The unconfirmed information that Magda might remain, even after the pronouncement of the final verdict, in the cell of the Investigation Prison in Budapest, which is according to the officials the most secure place from which it is almost impossible to escape, has been leaked from the police headquarters.<P>

Also, opinions of citizens from different walks of life have been published; they were united in saying that Hungary doesn't need this kind of a prisoner.  As they said, the portion of their salaries and pensions would be used for the accommodation and upkeep of the most expensive prisoner in Hungary.<P>

According to them, an average citizen of Hungary cannot earn in a lifetime the amount that will be spent on upkeep of the prisoner with a Yugoslav passport.<P>

<h1> <a NAME="kasagic">The Man For a New Direction</a></h1>

<h2> by Sl. Pesevic, Evropske Novosti, FR Yugoslavia, 10/25/95</h2>


Rajko Kasagic, until recently the president of the District government in Banja Luka, is the fourth prime minister since the founding of the Republic of Srpska.  In the past, this duty was performed by Dr. Baranko Deric, Dr. Vladimir Lukic and Dusan Kozic.<P>

<h2>Fighter From the First Day of the War</h2>

Who is Rajko Kasagic?  He is a lawyer, a man who spent most of his working years on positions of responsibility in the former state company "Jelsingrad", mostly working on legal matters.  He was, that should not be hidden, a member of the Communist League for more than 20 years, with prominent social engagements in local sport teams, the boxing team "Slavija" for example.<P>

His liking of martial arts perhaps compelled him to join the veteran fighters of the Serb Democratic Party (SDS), whose member he has been since the founding.  After the convincing victory of the parties with "the national prefix" [in the first post-communist elections in 1990] in Bosnia, he became the president of the District government in Banja Luka, where he remained (survived?) for almost five years.  His leadership style in this political body was authoritative, the meetings were short and productive; he will probably bring this leadership style to his new office as the prime minister of the Republic of Srpska.<P>

Some foreign media have already stated that the new prime minister is a member of the hawkish wing of SDS, a man who is too loyal, both personally and politically, to the president of RS, Dr. Radovan Karadzic.<P>

Kasagic stated a while ago, at the Parliament session in Bijeljina, that he wouldn't make changes in the government, but that "in the near future, with help of SDS, will evaluate the present government members and make changes where appropriate."  He, therefore, won't hurry with changes of ministers; the respect of "SDS's opinion" clearly shows that Kasagic is a disciplined party member.  The trust implied in his appointment to the highest office in the government is the best indicator of his personal loyalty to Karadzic.<P>

During his first radio address to the public, broadcasted on the waves of Radio Banja Luka, Mr. Kasagic dedicated the bulk of the speech to the increased accountability on all levels "because the former regime has almost put us to sleep".<P>

<h2>Responsibility</h2>

"It is hard to build a new system, but we have to do it," said Kasagic.  "For example, the District government in Banja Luka, demonstrated that it is possible to replace officials in state owned companies whose performance is not satisfactory.  I will fight against resistance to dismissals, if the authorities establish that a civilian is culpable, regardless what he might be responsible for.  We'll have to appoint people who can work better.  We'll have to build the system of accountability.  Mr. Pacanac phoned me this morning to congratulate me on my appointment to the new office.  I asked from him only one thing:  his greatest contribution to this state would be to keep the criminals in the jail."<P>

With this words, the new prime minister announced the changes in the leadership and the fight against all kinds of criminal activity.  Once the peace takes hold Kasagic will work for stronger links with the mother Serbia and Yugoslavia; he will also demand from the military authorities to demobilize the older soldiers, who can then immediately take part in the process of the economic renewal of RS.  He believes that, in peace, one quarter of the present number of mobilized soldiers will be sufficient to defend the borders!<P>

<h1> Lack of Medical Personnel</h1>

<h2> by V.P., Evropske Novosti, FR Yugoslavia, 1/3/96</h2>

Five hundred and eighty exiles and 14 wounded persons have found refuge in the camp for the accommodation of sick refugees in Krnjaca.  Among them are 16 children with more and less serious psychological problems.  They were recently visited by the representatives from the Institute for Cerebral Paralysis who surprised the children with fruit, sweets and school supplies.<P>

Despite these small tokens of attention the conditions, in which the refugees from the latest war live, are difficult.  Medical personnel which should take care of the ill refugees is not available, as well as the food: a daily portion of meat has been reduced to only 50 grams.<P>

"We should be better organized; the children from the collection center in Krnjaca above all lack medical attention," said Dr. Andelka Petrovic, herself a refugee from Tuzla [in Bosnia-Hercegovina] and the only physician in the camp in attendance 24 hours a day.  "Some of the children in the camp, like 13 year old Sanjin Majstorovic who suffers from cerebral paralysis and epilepsy, are very intelligent; unfortunately, being forgotten by the society, they are wasting away.  Sanjin and other children could be assisted by generous people who would pay for their education.  Medical staff is another problem.  According to the accepted standards, we should have here about 40 nurses, but the actual number of nurses [working here] is negligible."  The Ministry for Labour, Health, Veteran and Social Affairs has expressed readiness to help the camp.  According to the advisor with the Ministry for Labour, Health, Veteran and Social Affairs, Danica Todorovic, there is an agreement for cooperation with the institution for mentally retarded children in Shakespeare Street in Belgrade.  The children from the camp in Krnjaca, regularly go there and spend the whole day in rehabilitation and interaction with similar children.  As far as the nutrition is concerned, the collection center in Krnjaca is negotiating with the Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations in order to provide a varied diet for the exiled brothers and wounded fighters.<P>

<h1><a NAME="colonel">Campaign</a> Against the Colonel</h1>

<h2>by Milenko Predragovic, Evropske Novosti, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia</h2>

The New year hasn't started too well in Croatia, at least as far as the international politics and its view and evaluation of the Croatian political situation is concerned.  American colonel Gregory Fonteno, IFOR commander in Bosnian Posavina, has recently raised the temperature in Zagreb.<P>

Colonel Fonteno, after his first encounter with the cruel Balkan reality, with the direct and unequivocal language of a soldier, said for "The Wall Street Journal" (in the New Years day issue) that "the Croats are racists"!  Ignoring casual Karl Bildt and his limited achievements in the international politics, this is the first time that the Croatian policy has faced an evaluation which can hardly be questioned.  American Croatians after receiving a signal from Zagreb, have already sent a letter to the American president Bill Clinton, demanding that the "impudent colonel" be recalled; however, the real target of this campaign is the Croatian public.<P>

<h2>Going Back to the Roots</h2>

Although soldiers are not supposed to determine a policy but to support and implement it when necessary, the statement of the American colonel for "The Wall Street Journal" was interpreted in the European media as the Croatia's return to its roots: neo-fascism;  the world obviously won't tolerate that, even though Croatia is a small and, globally looking, irrelevant country.  However, the manner in which Croatia treated 700,000 Serbs puts it on the list of racist states: at first it was demanded from the Serbs to be loyal to the new authorities, then  the majority of Serbs lost their jobs, then they were forced to fight against other Serbs and finally exposed to mass executions, as in <a HREF="/info/students/marko/gospic1.html">Gospic</a> and in many other places.  At the same time, memorials from the antifascist struggle were demolished and memorials to Ustashe butchers erected; even a memorial to the killed Hitler's soldiers was built near Zagreb!  Mile Budak, Ante Pavelic's deputy, who during the WWII signed the law about the racial purity of Croats, after which many Serbs, Jews and Gypsies were killed is today in Croatia a celebrated and well respected person.  Ivo Rojnica, whose crimes were described in the film by Lordan Zafranovic, "Occupation in 26 Images", received a high Croatian decoration from the hands of the Croatian president, who [the president] on the other hand, in his books, but also with respect to the Bosnian Muslims, has expressed a dose of racism; because of that, the Israeli government, the only one with any criteria,  refuses to establish diplomatic relations with Croatia.<P>

<h2>Muslim Fascism</h2>

<a HREF="/info/students/marko/globus1.html"><em>Vecernji List</em></a> views the pogrom of the Serbs from western Slavonia and Krajina, in the context of the American colonel's statement, as "an expression of the Serbian political will", and the consequence of their refusal to live in "independent Croatia" [neovisna Hrvatska], and "recognize its Constitution and laws."  They don't mention that the forementioned Constitution is racist with respect to the Serbs!  And it is, it is racist: it turned 18,2% of Croatian population [Croatian Serbs] into a minority!  Besides, how can someone recognize laws which persecute Serbs, confiscate their property, destroy them like pests!<P>

<em>Vecernji List</em> commentator (who is a member of the Tudman's presidential council, so that it can be concluded that the article is an expression of the official policy!), Nenad Ivankovic, is probably payed well to lie to his readers, but he forgets the existence of history (and also of historic episodes [!?]): soon, before the end of this month, Croatia will have to make a decision about the return of expelled Serbs and the return of their property.<P>

The attempt to use the refugees from Sarajevo for balance, because between 50,000 and 100,000 Serbs will flee Sarajevo, is an attempt to hide the same roots : Muslim neo-fascism.  People leave their homes only in fear from evil: after the end of war in Krajina, Croatian authorities mistreated the Serbs who believed the word of the Croatian president and stayed in Krajina.  That means that those who fled had good reasons which are certainly not an expression of their "political will", but simply a struggle to survive! To accuse Serbs that they have committed crimes and therefore are fleeing (similarly in Sarajevo!) is a sign of simpleminded chauvinism and its blackest slime, which distorts thinking and produces prejudice and frustrations.  To claim that Serbs share a collective guilt because they resisted the Croatian secession (and they used to be an equal nation in Croatia!) indicates the lack of critical consciousness and recklessness with respect to one's own nation.<P>

<h1><a NAME="mrkonj1">A Difficult Return</a></h1>

<strong><em>by Boro Maric</em></strong><P>

<h2>Evropske Novosti, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 2/7 1996</h2>

<a HREF="http://www.acs.supernet.net/maps/068.htm">Mrkonjic Grad</a> and <a HREF="http://www.acs.supernet.net/maps/068.htm">Sipovo</a> are, after a several months long occupation by the HVO [Bosnian Croat militia] and the Croatian Army, former towns: not even a single house in them stays untouched.  The houses have been looted, all factories and commercial spaces looted and demolished.<P>

Where are then more than 32,000 Serbs who, according to the last prewar census from 1991, lived in these two municipalities supposed to return?<P>

The Croats, probably won't return.  If they had an intention of living here, they wouldn't, although until the capture of Mrkonjic Grad and Sipovo its Croat inhabitants had lived peacefully in the Republic Srpska, left their houses and followed the Croatian troops to Herceg-Bosna.<P>

The HVO and the Croatian Army have probably with the destruction of these places, also closed the door of return to their federal partners, muslims.<P>

In view of these developments, the guarantee of return for all refugees and expelled individuals to their homes in the Dayton agreement, seems meaningless.  Will the international community, besides the good will, show the readiness to financially aid the rebuilding of not only Mrkonjic Grad and Sipovo, but also of Grahovo, Mostar, Derventa, Sarajevo and other in this war destroyed places in the former Bosnia-Hercegovina?<P>

Or, will the world, as when the Croatian troops destroyed and burned Mrkonjic Grad and Sipovo, only stand on the sidelines and observe the events while stating that the behavior of the Croatian soldiers cannot be justified.<P>

If that is the case, than the return of the refugees and the expelled people will be a slow and difficult process which will never be completely finished.  Since, the rebuilding of Bosnia-Hercegovina requires, according to the official estimates of the government in Sarajevo, $15 billion.<P>

The economy of Bosnia-Hercegovina, even if it were capable of tomorrow returning to the prewar level, couldn't produce that amount of money even by the end of the first half of the next century.  A good part of the homeless will not be among the living by then.<P>

The living, probably, won't care about the return.  The international community would practically condone ethnic cleansing, for which it has reserved the strongest condemnation, besides war crimes, during the Bosnian bloodbath.<P>

As far as Mrkonjic Grad and Sipovo are concerned, the fire in which the fruits of labor of generations of their inhabitants had been destroyed had been started in peace, after the signing of the peace agreement in Dayton.  No one has ever warmed himself on that sort of fire.<P>

<hr>

<h1><a NAME="mrkonj2">Ghoulish Ruins</a></h1>

<strong><em>by D.Veljkovic, S.Pesevic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Evropske Novosti, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 2/7 1996</h2>

Although Mrkonjic Grad and Sipovo as well as the villages in these two municipalities had been systematically looted, demolished, burned and/or vandalized and made unsuitable for living for at least several coming months, a small number of the refugees from these places has regardless, returned to their homes.<P>

The war destruction of these places during the first ten days of September, 1995, was horrible.  This can be seen from the fact that over 4,000 high caliber grenades were fired on Mrkonjic Grad during one day.  The damage inflicted in such a way still hasn't discouraged the inhabitants of Mrkonjic Grad and Sipovo, who on Sunday morning, flooded back to see their destroyed homes.  Their emotional reactions were reserved for that portion of damage which had been inflicted, prior to their withdrawal, by the soldiers from the HVO and the regular Croatian Army; at the time when they controlled this area, after the Dayton peace agreement had already been signed.<P>

We'll use a story from Sipovo to illustrate the extent of destruction:  It is Sunday, about 3p.m.; it is raining and we are standing at the Freedom Square in front of building number 5.  It hasn't been burned down.  A man is looking at us from the second floor, probably surprised to see journalists out here.  We ask, "What is is like up there?" "Come and see for yourself," responds the stranger.<P>

We approach the entrance in spite of warnings that it is dangerous to enter buildings because of mines.  The house is flooded: the water comes almost to our knees.  Carefully, we climb the stairs, which are covered with piles of plaster.  The walls look as if someone tried to "dig" through them with a hoe or something like that.<P>

Ostoja Antic, 36 years old officer of the VRS [Bosnian Serb Army], dressed in civilian clothing (uniforms and arms are banned in the separation zones) waits for us on the second floor; before the war Mr. Antic was a mechanical engineer; he is a father of two small children, who had fled with their mother, a physics teacher, to Serbia.<P>

Ostoja helplessly surveys his apartment.  The tiles in a narrow corridor had been pulled out; the only piece of furniture in the corridor is a small side cupboard.  In a room on the left side, there is no furniture, only a huge pile of plaster in the middle.  The windows had been pulled out, the walls are damp.  In the other room, the parquet floor has risen so high because of the dampness  that it is impossible to step over it to the other half of the room!  In a corner of one of the rooms there are a few pieces of a chair and that is all that's left.<P>

The bathtub is full of plaster.  The kitchen is empty, the windows had been taken from there as well.  We enter the last room: a couch had been ripped apart.  Parquet floor has risen because of the dampness.  On a small table, next to the "window" we find an empty photo album. "Did you take the photographs?" we ask.  "No, not even a single one.  They took everything and deliberately left the empty photo album.  That's their message," Ostoja says quietly.<P>

We are standing, there's nowhere to sit.  Ostoja admits that he feels hopeless and humiliated, "it is my misery to have eyes and be forced to look at all this."<P>

What are his expectations now?  "I don't know," he says, "there's not a single square foot of livable space here..."<P>

This Sunday, a lot of "Ostojas" from Mrkonjic Grad and Sipovo stared at the remnants of their hard earned property.  A small number decided to stay and a substantial return cannot be expected before the Spring and the time to start the farm work.  As far as the towns are concerned, the return can be expected when the hospital, the post office and other institutions receive the most basic equipment...<P>

At this time, window panes, windows and doors are the most sought item.<P>

At least to stop the draft for those who had returned.<P>

<h1><a NAME="borba">ELIZABETH REHN AGAIN DENIES PRESS WRITINGS</a></h1>
<h2>Borba, March 9-10, 1996</h2>
     In the Center for Human Rights in the Geneva Palace of Nations, there are
categorical denials that the UN special envoy for human rights in former
Yugoslavia Elizabeth Rehn has given any statements for the press regarding the
conditions for recognition of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, during her
visit to Vienna early last week. Quoting the Austrian new agency APA, several
media in Western Europe have broadcasted the news that Rehn was striving for
the international community not to recognize the FR of Yugoslavia before it
offers guarantees for the respect of human rights in Serbia and Montenegro,
and "in the regions in Bosnia under Serbian influence". This is not the first
misunderstanding of the Rehn envoy with the media which were broadcasting only
what they liked, and were silent about things that were not suitable for them.
Thus, for example, from the first report by Elizabeth Rehn, they have kept
silent about the flagrant examples of violation of human rights in Croatia,
and were underlining only the part about the human rights in Yugoslavia to
which Rehn had devoted much less space. The same thing has occurred also after
her visit to Srebrenica when she stated that she did not find mass graves
while the distinguished western media were saying something quite different.<P>

<h1><a NAME="venov">MUSLIM POLICEMEN BEATEN IN MOSTAR</a></h1>
<h2>Vecernje novosti, March 12, 1996</h2>

     Center for the security services of the eastern part of Mostar has warned that
the killing of a Muslim women two days ago in the Croat part of town is yet
another premeditated crime, intended to intimidate the remaining Muslims and
force them to move from the western part of the city. This was reported by the
Muslim Radio Mostar. It is recalled that this is the eighteenth Muslim person
killed in the Croat part of town since the signing of the Washington Agreement
two year ago, when the Muslim-Croat Federation was established. Over the last
seven days three Muslim policemen from the ranks of mixed patrol units were
beaten, which according to Radio Mostar, "is an obvious attempt to intimidate
Muslim policemen and force them to abandon joint patrols of the city".<P>

<h1><a NAME="politika">IN CROATIA EVEN DEAD SERBS ARE VICTIMS</a></h1>
<h2>Politika, March 12, 1996</h2>
     In the article by a special reporter of "The Washington Post" from
Jasenovac, on the occasion of the plan of the Croat President Tudjman to
transform Jasenovac into a mass memorial not only for Serbs and Jews but also
for their Croat persecutors during World War Two, the following is written:
"Exhumation of earthly remains of Croat Fascists from other places and their
burial in Jasenovac will make this plateau the only place in Europe where
victims of the concentration camps are resting side by side with the soldiers
who were persecuting and killing them". Except for mentioning a false figure
of 80,000 Jasenovac victims, the reporter convincingly proves that Tudjman's
government by its moves is violating human rights both of the dead and living
Serbs. One of  the western diplomats stationed in Zagreb, said with bitterness
to the "Washington Post" reporter: "Tudjman has transformed Croatia into
another Paraguay, a small Latin American country with a quasi-capitalist
system". <P>

<TITLE>Interview with Rajko Kasagic, dismissed prime minister of Srpska</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<FONT SIZE="+1">

<h1>Cooperation - My Deadly Sin!</h1>

<strong><em>by Novosti team</em></strong><P>

<h2>Evropske Novosti, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 5/18/96</h2>

<em>If the parliament of the Republic of Srpska doesn't appoint for a 
new prime minister a man, like myself, who will work on the opening of
the Republic Srpska borders and the thorough implementation of 
the Dayton Agreement, we will be totally isolated.  The people will try
to emigrate; they already realize that this is not the system they have 
fought for.</em><P>

These words were said by Rajko Kasagic, the dismissed prime minister of 
the Republic of Srpska during his interview with  the team from 
<em>Novosti</em>, yesterday in Banja Luka.  Kasagic is sought by local and
foreign journalists; during our conversation, Mr. Kasagic was receiving
phone calls of support from many officials and "civilians".<P>

<strong>What is your assessment of your achievements as a prime 
minister?</strong><P>

<h2>Deadly Danger</h2>

I made a mistake by not following Slobodan Milosevic's advice;
I should have gone to Brussels, to the second conference of the countries pledging
funds for the reconstruction of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  Milosevic offered to 
provide a plane for the trip to Brussels, but I was afraid that they
would call me a traitor at home.  I realize that we have lost a lot
through boycott of the Brussels conference, because some countries
do want to help us.  I think that everything else I did contributed
to the development of the Republic of Srpska, its opening towards the
world and the freer flow of people and money.<P>

<strong>Apparently, your statements to domestic and foreign journalists
were the reason for your dismissal.  What were you talking about?</strong><P>

I asked president Karadzic whether he had any complaints regarding the 
decisions made by my government and he responded that he did not.  I 
asked whether he had complaints regarding my work on the implementation
of the Dayton Agreement and again he said that he did not.  I received
the same reply to my question whether he was satisfied with my attitude
towards him as the head of the state in conversations with foreigners.
I asked whether he had complaints concerning my integrity and honesty.
He said that he did not, that everyone had told him that I was a very 
honest man.  The only "problem" are my statements to the journalists.
For example, I stated for Paris "Le Monde" that the government of Srpska
has no conditions for work in Pale and that the capital should be moved
to Banja Luka because of the political-communal infrastructure.  
My collaborators had warned me to stop raising the question of the capital
city, but I did not.<P>

<strong>It seems that the core of the clash is somewhere else, not in your
interviews.  What are the real reasons for this split in Srpska?</strong><P>

I am the fourth prime minister of Srpska, but the first one who demanded
that the government functions in accordance with the constitution and laws.
To the Ministers, I said that they were dealing with a prime minister, not 
a trader.  I prevented those individuals who, according to the constitution 
and laws, were not supposed to take part in the work of the government to influence the government.
That was also the problem regarding the capital of Srpska: only when Banja Luka
becomes the center of our state, we will secure the territories around Brcko.<P>

<strong>You had planned the reconstruction of the government on the eve of 
your dismissal?</strong><P>

28 parliament members demanded a reconstruction of the government from me;
I told them that I would seek the opinion of Karadzic and Krajisnik, the 
president of the Parliament, as law prescribes in this case.  I intended to
dismiss those ministers who supported the isolation of Srpska and those who 
blocked the work of the government.  Out of 17 ministers, I intended to 
replace Milan Ninkovic (defense), Aleksa Buha (foreign affairs) and three
vicepresidents, Miroslav Vjestica, Velibor Ostojic and Milorad Draganic.<P>

<strong>The Pale leadership is often described as "war profiteers". You said
that Karadzic had no complaints regarding your honesty as a Prime minister.
Have you, during your six months tenure as the prime minister managed to 
track down some of the profiteers?</strong><P>

I cannot talk about that, because it is deadly dangerous to name
the criminals.  I can only say that I insisted that all institutions of the 
system function properly.<P>

<strong>Director of the Directorate for Trade was appointed during your visit
to Greece.</strong><P>

That was done without my knowledge and approval.<P>

<strong>You revealed that DM 28 million had recently been taken from the 
National Bank of Srpska...</strong><P>

<h2>A Lot of Disinformations</h2>

That was illegal.  The money was taken through the director of the 
State financial service who claimed that he was following the orders of
the National Bank of Yugoslavia and that the money was going there.  We were
informed that the money ended up in Zvornik Bank [town in eastern Bosnia] and was earmarked for the building of the hangars for the storage of the machinery which had been
pulled out of Sarajevo [suburbs].<P>

<strong>You've been receiving support from FR Yugoslavia, the international
community, High Representative Carl Bildt, Banja Luka county president,
Predrag Radic, part of the police and army; we've heard of petition drives
in your support....  Has Karadzic invited you for a consultation after 
that?</strong><P>

Momcilo Krajisnik's secretary informed my wife two nights ago that a conference
of the SDS parliamentarians had been scheduled for yesterday as well as the
General Council of SDS [Serbian Democratic Party, the ruling party in Srpska].  The agenda is "secret".  President Radic was invited
last night so that he couldn't make it on time.<P>

<strong>Minister Aleksa Buha stated that they had wanted to dismiss you during
the previous session of the parliament.</strong><P>

They wanted to but they did not succeed.  They had support of only one 
representative.  It is ridiculous to discuss a political system in which
a minister demands the dismissal of the prime minister; everywhere in the world
we have the opposite situation; a prime minister is the one who dismisses
ministers.<P>

<strong>Why didn't you try to explain to the representatives what was going on
and fight the dismissal?</strong><P>

That would be absurd.  They released a lot of disinformations; that is dishonest;
I can only thank them after all the support I gave Karadzic in every conversation I had 
with the representatives of the international community.<P>

<strong>Could the representatives from Krajina prevent a no confidence vote
in the parliament?</strong><P>

There are enough of them.  Unfortunately they have never been united; that
is why some harmful decisions have found their way through the parliament.<P>

<strong>Are you planning to leave SDS, start your own political party, or completely
 withdraw from politics?</strong><P>

I won't start my own party.  Earlier I planned to withdraw from politics
after the elections.  I am considering that now.<P>
<hr><P>

<strong>Once, I said to the journalists from Pale, that they had nothing to 
loose (they work although they haven't been paid) if they wrote about the 
events during the war which cost this people a lot of money.  I see that 
the freedom of speech is being stifled in our country.</strong><P>
<hr><P>
<h2>Reaction of the Serbian Government: Against the Interests of
The Republic of Srpska</h2>

The government of the Republic of Serbia yesterday said that the legally
elected prime minister of Srpska, Rajko Kasagic, was illegally and 
unlawfully replaced. "This is only one of many decisions which are 
going directly against the interests of Srpska and its citizens; these 
decisions compromise the development of democratic processes and the 
results achieved in the economic recovery of Srpska."<P>

"The decision about the dismissal was not preceded by a debate in the
parliament, which should have included a no confidence vote.  Because of 
that Serbian government considers this decision null and void and demands that
the parliament be convened in order to protect the interests of the citizens
of Srpska from the willful decisions of this kind."<P>

<h1>Two Cities, Two Worlds</h1>

<strong><em>by Milena Markovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Evropske Novosti, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 6/11/96</h2>

In the late afternoon, there are no buses from Zenica for Mrkonjic Grad,
where we are going.  The evening is getting closer.  Hours are passing by like minutes.<P>

"Why don't you try from Vitez?" they advise us in Zenica.<P> 

In Vitez, the same situation.  All roads towards Travnik, Vakuf and Jajce
are open only during the daytime.  By the way, one drives very fast on these 
roads.  All depends on number plates.  Croats, who had been expelled from Travnik,
drive through this city as fast as an arrow.  Muslims do the same when they 
drive through Vitez or Jajce.<P>

Night catches us in Vitez.  We walk around looking for a place to sleep.
At the reception of a pretty hotel "Vitez", they ask for our personal
documents.<P>

"Are ID's OK?" we ask.<P>

"What kind?"<P>

"Well, these, from Belgrade," we say.<P>

"In that case, it would be better if you gave me your passports,
if you have them," the receptionist responds, seemingly unperturbed.
He's curious to find out how we ended up in Vitez.<P>

<strong>"Since the beginning of the war, no one from Belgrade, nor from Serbia,
has spent a night here,"</strong> he says.<P>

<h2>Everything for Deutsch Marks</h2>

We hand over our passports.  While we are taking our luggage to our
rooms, we cannot stop thinking about what the receptionist has just told us.

Later, in a restaurant, a waiter dispels out suspicion.  He greets us with
the words: "<strong>It is good to see you</strong>".  He introduces himself:
"<strong>Slavko Jeftic, a Serb from Zenica</strong>".  He is temporarily
employed in Hotel "Vitez".  "Have the roads finally been open?", he asks.<P>

Obviously glad to see us, at the edge of tears, he treats us with Karlovacko
beer.  He proposes to take us on a tour of the city.  If it weren't for this
chance meeting, I wonder if we would have dared to walk around the city, in which
we found ourselves by accident and where we don't know anyone.<P>  

In the city center we find restaurants at almost every step.  Terraces are 
crowded.  Young, happy people.  It is obvious that they are spending a lot
of money.  All prices are in Deutsch Marks.  Restaurants are open until late
in the night.<P>

The day was Sunday, about 10p.m., but the shops were still open.  The goods
arrive from Split and Zagreb.  We enter one of the shops.  We buy some candy
and a box of cigarettes.  Surprisingly expensive.  That same day, we had bought  cigarettes in Zenica.  In Vitez, everything costs at least twice as much
as in Zenica.  Rovinj "Ronhil" [cigarettes] - 2.5 DM.  Two cities, only 15 kilometers apart,
seem like two different worlds.  In Zenica, desolation and poverty.  Here, in
Vitez, affluence and wealth.  In Zenica, "Lilies" [Bosnian symbol].  In Vitez, "Checkerboard" [Croatian symbol, Croatian coat of arms]. In
Zenica Bosnian Dinar, in Vitez - Kuna [Croatian currency].  Still, to tell the truth, Deutsch Marks
are the currency of choice in both cities.<P>

<h2>Isolated muslims</h2>

In the shop we have entered, a merchant asks: "<strong>Where are you from?</strong>
When he heard that we were from Belgrade, he closed the shop and joined us.
He wants to treat us and find out what is going on in Belgrade.  He wants to know:
<strong>" When will Zagreb and Beograd finally agree to divide the whole Bosnia,
so that there is only a Croat and a Serb part?</strong>"  He laughs and says that  
he is a Croat nationalist.  He says his name is Dragan Vrkic.  We inquire about
the local Serbs...<P>

The merchant says: "There are about 35,000 inhabitants in Vitez, of whom
at least 5 percent are Serbs."  He points out a well equipped household: "that
is the household of Vasa the Serb. That is his bakery.  This cafe is also 
run by a Serb.  Those people sitting over there, they are also Serbs, 
the Sesun family.  You'll only find Croats and Serbs here.  No others; I mean
there are no muslims.  We don't even mention them...  There's a village out
there but we've managed to isolate it."<P>

In cafe "Monaco" we meet a group of Serbs.  One of them is the co-owner of the 
cafe.  His name is Mirko.  They are all glad to see us.  The conversation 
begins: about Croats who had fought with the Serbs against muslims in this war;
 about the Lasva valley, which they had defended and saved together;  about
 casualties, young widows, salaries. About the Muslim-Croat federation.<P>

 "<strong>We thought that here in Bosnia, we were all friends.  But it won't
 work.  Not even hundred Washingtons could unite us Croats with muslims.
 We are more oriented towards Serbs, isn't that true Mirko?"</strong>, 
 says Dragan.<P>

<strong>Muslims can pass through Vitez only during the daylight hours and
very fast!</strong>, our collocutors openly say.  They say that, in Vitez,
people cannot forgive Muslims for all those Croat families which had been
expelled from Travnik and Zenica.<P>

<strong>"Muslims say that you killed everyone in the village of Ahmici,
here in the Lasva valley,</strong>", we say.<P>

"They were looking for trouble."  And the conversation goes on: who started
the whole thing.<P>

<strong>"They attacked first,"</strong> says Stipe, waiter in the cafe. 
"<strong> First, they expelled our families, then confiscated property
and everything else.  Were we supposed to do nothing?</strong>"<P>

<h2>Milan Sesun's story</h2>

Later, we drop by the Sesun family.  The oldest one of them, Milan,
at the start of 1992 crossed over to Ilidza [Serb controlled Sarajevo suburb during the war, now in Muslim hands].  He has recently returned
to Vitez.<P>

"<strong>My neighbors, Croats, saved my house,</strong>" says Sesun.
"<strong>I respect that.  I also respect Herceg Bosna.  And Croatia as well because she assists these people.  And I cry for Serbia.</strong>"<P>

Finally, they are giving us a lift to our hotel, in a "Mercedes".  They
say: "<strong>We were looking for boss Vasa, so that he can tell you about
his life here.  He had gone to Budva, on a vacation.</strong>"<P>

Tomorrow morning, polite receptionist wishes us a pleasant journey.  
At the bus station, while we are waiting for a bus to Jajce, we are talking
to local policemen.  Federal police in Vitez doesn't wear green, muslim,
but blue, Croatian, uniforms.  They say that the federal police is actually
muslim police and if we were to meet them somewhere (of course, not in Vitez)
they would greet us with "merhaba" (hallo) ["Muslim" greeting], instead of "Bog stari" [Croatian greeting].
One of the policemen is showing us his ID. On it, there is a huge badge with 
a checkerboard.<P>

<strong>"Of course, we are the federal police,"</strong> they laugh.  "<strong>
Only, we earn for one month the annual salary of a Habib's (muslim) policeman.
This is Herceg-Bosna, and that is a Croat state.  We don't need Europe.  No one.
We'll go alone if necessary."</strong><P>

They claim to know everything about the situation in Serbia.  They watch Zagreb
and Belgrade television.  Most houses in Vitez have a satellite antenna.<P>

"<strong> How come you don't watch Sarajevo TV?"</strong>, we ask.<P>

"<strong>How could we, when at the end of the program they say "lahka noc"...[lahka in Bosnian corresponds to laka in Serbo-Croatian and Croatian]
After that, I cannot sleep until the dawn.</strong>"<P>

Soon, the bus arrives to the station.  We get on...  In Travnik, a few kilometers
from Vitez, we spot federal policemen in green uniforms.<P>

<h1>War Crimes: Karadzic Issued a Warrant for Izetbegovic</h1>

<h3>by Momir Ilic and Marica Lalovic, Intervju, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 2/13/96</h3>

As early as last fall, The Hague Tribunal for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia indicated that Izetbegovic's mane might be added to the list of war criminals.   Soon after that, Goldstone's close collaborators let it be known, discretely but without a doubt,  that they would like to open an investigation against Alija Izetbegovic [Bosnian president].  After such a public announcement of a new target for the Goldstone's team, the Serb side, with all its customary deficiencies, got down to work.  As before, the first to do something concrete were non-governmental organizations, above all The Association of Camp Inmates 1991.  The message traveled across the Drina river, and recently Dr. Radovan Karadzic stated that the Pale authorities have material evidence of Izetbegovic's guilt.<P>

<h2>Directors of a Massacre</h2>

It is too early to talk about the quality of Serb evidence that will be presented to the Hague tribunal and which might be accepted by the tribunal as a basis for an indictment.  Nevertheless, it is almost certain that the main arguments against Izetbegovic will be the suffering of Serbs in central Bosnia, specifically in camps in Konjic, Celebic and Tarcin.  It seems that the crimes in Bradina might also be included.  We've also heard that the Serb side will try to use the favorable attitude of the tribunal to present to the whole world the definite proof that the two Sarajevo massacres, in Vase Miskina Street and on Merkale Market, were planned and executed with knowledge of the top officials in the Muslim government.<P>

The testimony of Slavko Jovicic, a.k.a. Slavuj, leaves no room for doubt that Alija Izetbegovic knew about the camps in which mostly Serb civilians were detained, tortured and killed; it also shows that Izetbegovic used to visit those camps; Slavko Jovicic spent 1334 days, between 5/26/92 and 1/19/96 in the Tarcin camp.  He was a police inspector, and before his arrest, the chief of security for the Serb parliamentarians and ministers in the then multiethnic parliament and government of Bosnia-Hercegovina.<P>

"I saw Alija Izetbegovic on several occasions during my incarceration in the Tarcin camp.  His first visit was in April, 1994.  He left Sarajevo through the tunnel, and then, he was taken in a car to the helidrom in Tarcin; the helidrom had been built by us, camp inmates.  From there he flew in a helicopter to Split.<P>

"During Izetbegovic's visits to Tarcin, we were removed to a safe distance from him.  But, even from 30 to 50 meters away from him, which was the distance between the silo in which we were incarcerated and the helidrom and the camp headquarters building, we were able to recognize him.  I always found it easy to recognize him, since I had known both him and his escorts personally.  Izetbegovic knew about me, he even knew my nickname, Slavuj."<P>

<h2>Live Shield for Muslims</h2>

Slavko Jovicic continues: "It is true that I never personally met Izetbegovic in the camp, but I was visited by two of his escorts on one occasion.  After that I started hoping that I would be released.  My visitors were Fadil Pekic and Akir Sisic, both my former colleagues from the police.  They were a part of  Izetbegovic's escort during his stay in the building in which both military and camp headquarters for this area were located.  When they entered my cell, I asked about the reason for their visit to Tarcin.  'We are here with the president', they said.  I don't think that they could have walked away without Izetbegovic's approval; he must have known where they went.  As I already said, the headquarters building was not further than 30 meters from the silo.  Pekic and Sisic were well armed, dressed in camouflage police uniforms. They greeted me and one of them gave me two 'Marlboro' cigarettes, saying that they had come to the silo to see me.  We talked for about 10 minutes."  Serbs will try to convince the Hague tribunal that the Serb prisoners in Tarcin were not prisoners of war, but civilians who had been abducted from their houses as hostages or to be used as live shields during Muslim attacks on Serb trenches.  The second part of Jovicic's statement confirms that:<P>

"An event which occured in 1994 shows that Izetbegovic knew what was going on at the camp.  At the beginning of that year, actually on 1/25, one of the top officers from Izetbegovic's closest circle, Nedzad Ajnadzic, who was then a security chief in the Muslim Army and is now the commander of the first Sarajevo Corps and brigadier general, came to the silo on instructions of general Rasim Delic [Bosnian Army commander].  On entering our cell he said: 'Gentlemen, I could kill you all right now.  However, I won't do it since you are supposed to be exchanged for 187 Muslims from Hadzici [Sarajevo suburb].  Besides, I don't give a damn about you chetniks.' Then he asked:' Which one of you is Slavko Jovicic?'  I replied and than he said:' Karadzic cannot help you here.  You won't get out of here alive." He came back a month later.<P>

"When we thought that the worst was behind us, at the beginning of July, 1995, thirty Serbs were taken from the silo to Sarajevo [during the Muslim attempt to break out of Sarajevo].  They thought that they would be exchanged; instead they were used as live shields and work force to dig trenches and passes from Muslim to Serb positions.  Those poor souls really went through hell.  Imagine what they did to them: they would usually tie them with a 20 meter long rope and put explosives in their hands.  Then the prisoners would be forced to walk towards Serb positions, through a previously dug trench, and throw the explosive in the Serb trench.  Once they realized what the Muslims were doing to our people, Serb soldiers didn't want to shoot at them.  They would even withdraw and leave food and weapons.  After the Muslims captured first and endangered second defensive lines in Sarajevo, the Serbs had to respond with fire.  A few of our people lost their legs in that fashion and a camp inmate, Dane Cica, died from a Serb bullet.  It was so horrible that even Muslim guards were crying and saying:' We are really sorry, but if you don't do this Alija will kill us.'"<P>

<h2>A Witness From Konjic</h2>

The testimony of S.L., a doctor from Konjic, will certainly become a part of the evidence against Alija Izetbegovic.  Once she reached freedom, she wrote the following statement in front of the Serb investigators:<P>

"... Alija Izetbegovic was a frequent visitor in Konjic.  The commotion in the police security affected my place of work every time Alija came to Konjic.  Even I, although a Serb, knew that Alija Izetbegovic was visiting Zajnel Delalic's headquarters located in a house below the hotel.  In 1992 and 1993, Alija Izetbegovic was coming to Konjic almost every 10 days.  He was there two days after the fall of the village of Bradina; I heard that he had ordered to burn down all Serb houses which hadn't been burned during the capture of this village...  B.S., a Muslim, said in front of me that he had heard Alija Izetbegovic say that he had visited camps for Serbs in Celebici and Konjic and that he [Izetbegovic] personally ordered the camp staff to show no mercy toward Serbs.  Guards from those two camps were frequent visitors in the building in which I worked and they mentioned Alija's name in their conversations a lot."
The story of this Serb woman, who is a possible witness for the Hague tribunal, is confirmed by the Croatian intelligence, whose informations will be sent to the Hague; by chance or design the incriminating report also fell into Serb hands (we translated the report from the Croatian newspeak).  Unexpected Croatian help and assistance is not that hard to understand if one knows that the Croats have stopped competing with the Muslims over who should get more credit for the decline of Serb population in the Konjic municipality from 18 percent to 0.5 percent.<P>

<h2>A Secret Croatian Report</h2>

"Alija Izetbegovic's first visit to the Konjic municipality occured immediately after the fall of Bradina, on May 29-30, 1992.  He stayed in Zejnel Delalic's house, which is located under the hotel in Konjic.  After stopping in Zejnel Delalic's house, Alija Izetbegovic went to a meeting in a primary school "Zvonimir Berisa" on Musala, and from there to the Municipal Hall..."<P>

The following sentence illustrates how closely the Croats followed every Izetbegovic's step:" Alija Izetbegovic arrived to Konjic from the direction of Dusina, specifically Klic."<P>

The rest of the Croatian report is even more interesting:" At the end of his stay in Konjic, Izetbegovic went to Bradina.  He was escorted by Jasmin Guska, Sefko Niksic, Rele Mujanovic, a certain Duracic and Fadil Spiljak...  After that Jasmin Guska ordered that Serb houses in Bradina be burned down...  Izetbegovic visited Konjic for a second time in mid June, 1992, after the village of Bradina had been totally destroyed.  On this occasion, he allegedly stayed at 'Igman' factory, in the hills above Konjic; the transfer of the factory to Zenica began at about the same time.  Izetbegovic stayed there for whole 15 days in a special residence in that military object, which had been built for the Yugoslav Army General Staff...  During this visit he also went to Celebici camp..."  There is no doubt that the Croats were well informed about the events in camps Celebici and Musala in Konjic.  After all, their man, Zdravko Mucic Pavo, was in command of one of these killing fields.  The report says the following about that:" ...  In July, 1992, camp commander, Zdravko Mucic Pavo, cancelled all visits to the Serb inmates in the camp because president Alija Izetbegovic was supposed to visit Celebici camp on that day...  From conversations with camp inmates we found out that Alija Izetbegovic had visited this camp at least twice: once in the summer of 1992 and the second time in the Fall of the same year.  Ammunition which was later sent to Visoko was loaded during one of these visits.  On that occasion, Alija Izetbegovic also visited tunnel number 9 in which a number of inmates, most of whom went abroad after the release, were kept.  These people said that President Izetbegovic was with the group of prisoners who had loaded the ammunition..."<P>

At the end of the report it says:" ...<a HREF="/info/students/marko/oslob/oslob8.html">Jovan Divjak</a>, a high rank military official in the Bosnian Army, often visited the camp in Celebici..."<P>

<h2>Witnesses from Vase Miskina Street</h2>

International criminal law experts point out that the Serbs would make a big mistake if they don't try to prove their innocence in the tragedy in Vase Miskina Street.  Unfortunately, as far as this event is concerned, it is not known who among those who collect evidence about crimes against Serbs has testimonies and other evidence about the massacre, nor how convincing this evidence is.  The following testimony is kept in one of the centers in which the documents linked with this event are stored:<P>

"...I witnessed the massacre in Vase Miskina Street in Sarajevo.  Muslim soldiers had barred the entrance to this street from the Muslim part of the city for 40 minutes prior to the explosion, while they allowed access from the other parts.  They had also prepared an ambulance and a TV van.  I watched all this from my window because I had noticed that the soldiers closed off the access from one part of the city.  A TV van was parked next to the market.  They started broadcasting as soon as the explosion was heard.  Bread and ice cream had been brought earlier that day to the street.  I had known some of the people who died in that alleged artillery attack.  I only heard an explosion; there was no sound of a flying grenade.  Stretchers and an ambulance van had been prepared in advance; some of them were parked in front of my house..."<P>

Another witness, whose statement is coded as 806/95-2 , gives a more detailed description of this crime.  He wrote is his statement the following:<P>

"... on May 28, 1992, a little after 9 o'clock, I was in Vase Miskina Street.  I was walking from the direction on Vecna Vatra toward Bascarsija; on the opposite side of the (Vase Miskina) street, in front of the building on the left side, I saw TV cameras on tripods.  The street was full of people and in front of a 'Upi-Klas' shop there was a long line of people who had been waiting to buy bread.  In that moment I was greeted by Haris Avdic, who is the owner of a cafe 'Hacijenda' located at the 'Zeleznicar' soccer stadium and was a special forces soldier in Juka Prazina's unit at the time.  He asked me where I was going and what I was doing there.  I said that I was going to the market and he replied: 'Hurry up, we have some business here.'  At the same moment I noticed the arrival of a red car;  Adnan Sokolovic, a commander of Juka Prazina's unit, came out of the car.  Sokolovic and Haris shook hands and went into the basement of 'Bosna Sport'.  I hurried up past the bread line and turned around the corner behind Merkale market toward  Marshal Tito Street.  When I was about 30 to 40 meters away from the bread line, I heard two gun shots from the direction of the Economics faculty and then a strong explosion from Vase Miskina Street.<P>

<h2>Doctored TV Film</h2>

"Without thinking, I ran back around the market and looked toward Vase Miskina Street.  At the place where I had turned towards Marshal Tito Street I saw a large number of prostrate bodies, a commotion, a lot of half crazed people who shouted and screamed, smoke, dust and broken shop windows.  I didn't stay there for a long time; I ran toward the police building, where I worked at the time.  I was at most 300 meters from the building and I got there in less then 5 minutes.<P>

"At the entrance of the building I met Mehmed Hadzimesic who was on duty.  He immediately asked:' Do you know what happened?', and then added:' A massacre in Vase Miskina Street.'  He told me that an investigation team led by Emir Kreko, a murder inspector in Sarajevo police,  had left.  Hadzimesic's words surprised me.  Because of that I asked him when the team had left and he said that they had left five minutes ago.  This was confusing, and without making any additional comments, I concluded that this team must have left the building before the explosion.  Maybe a minute after my arrival to the building, Hadzimesic turned on a TV; scenes from the massacre were already being broadcasted.  I concluded that they were recorded by the cameras which I had seen earlier in front of the post office.<P>

"I remained in the police building.  20 to 30 minutes later, Mirza Jamakovic, head of the anti-terrorist squad and a well-known explosives expert, arrived.  He didn't say anything.  He seemed nervous and left soon afterwards.  After that event, he avoided the building for days.<P>

<h2>The signal for the explosion</h2>

"The same evening I saw a TV Sarajevo report from the spot; in that report, among others, the remnants of the grenades which had exploded in Vase Miskina Street were shown.  It was a large caliber grenade with pretty wide fins on its tail.  I remember that a few days later I saw photographs of the grenade at the police operative center; it was a small caliber grenade and with dense fins.  Therefore I concluded that the TV report was re-edited.<P>


"Later, I was imprisoned in 'Viktor Bubanj' camp; several members of <a HREF="/info/students/marko/oslob/oslob8.html#paramil">Ramiz Delalic's , a.k.a. Celo, and Musan Topalovic's, a.k.a. Caco</a>, groups were also detained at the camp.  They would often try to communicate by shouting and would loudly protest their arrests.  The other prisoners, myself included, could hear 
this.  On one occasion I heard Hasan Kreko from Topalovic's group: 'F... them, where are Ganic [Bosnian vicepresident] and Mahmutcehajic now?  When they needed us, we killed our own people.  Where are they now to help us?'<P>

"Haris Kreko shared a cell with L.;  L. later told me that Haris had told him that the group under command of Musan Topalovic Caco, whose member Haris had been, had been ordered by Mahmutcehajic and Ejup Ganic to set up an explosion in Vase Miskina Street; the signal for an explosion was given by two sniper shots fired from the Economic faculty building; the grenades were fired from a location near Kazan, on a left side of the Miljacka river."<P>

<h2>Clinton knew about it</h2>

Let us remind about the events at the village of Bradina; Muslims and Croats first surrounded and that burned down the village; its male inhabitants were massacred, and the rest of the population, mostly women, children and elderly kept in a tunnel for a while.  This massacre was noticed by the world public.  Unfortunately, the enmity against the Serbs was so strong that the news about Serb suffering were lost in the noise which followed the announcement of the sanctions.  The best illustration of that is the article which was published on June 4, 1992, in 'The New York Times', less then a week after the crime in Bradina, under title "Victims and Criminals on All Sides".  Journalist John Burns had talked with the victims of the massacre:[the original text will be substituted as soon as I obtain a copy of the article]<P>

"The report given today by the Serbs from Bradina, a village located 25 miles southwest from Sarajevo, seems to confirm that some groups of Muslims and Croats, which are united in the fighting against the Serb forces, are using the tactic of ethnic cleansing of Serbs in other contested parts of this republic..."<P>

Burns concludes his report by saying that:<P>

"The members of the United Nations Security Council today expressed concern and a degree of uneasiness because of the information that Serbs had been victims of the crimes committed by the Muslims and Croats near Bradina...  The Security Council members have received the report about this crimes two days after they had introduced sanctions in order to force Belgrade to stop the war.  The report was submitted on Monday by Secretary General, Boutros Boutros Ghali.  The Security Council imposed the sanctions against Belgrade on Saturday.  French ambassador, Jean Bernard Merime stated that:' I am certain that we would have prefered to have received the information (about Bradina - Momir Ilic's remark) before we had considered the draft resolution'."<P>

Understanding how wrong they were in their belief that the truth [about the conflict in Bosnia] will on its own spread through the world, San Francisco Serbs have recently taken a thick file of documents with evidence about the crimes of Alija Izetbegovic to the White House, and gave it to president Bill Clinton.<P>

<h1> Who am I, What am I, and what I did in the war</h1>

<strong><em>by Momcilo Petrovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Intervju , Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, March 29 1996</h2>

I've found out about the indictment from the papers.  No one has officially
informed me about it...  I don't have time to watch television, but someone
has told me that TV station "Karic" has had the news about some sort of a trial 
or round table or something like that...  it is supposed to begin on the twentieth.<P>

None of friends and colleagues received this news with pity; instead they received the news with
uneasiness as an offence and humiliation, not only for myself but also
for all those people who were there, at the front, because all of them know me,
know who I am, what I do and how I feel.  I'm not a butcher, some beast or
I don't know what, but an ordinary man who likes all that is beautiful.  And above 
all I love my people and my homeland, for which I fought, so that the families and
children of those like me could live here.<P>

(...)I worked close to [former] Minister of Defense, General Kadijevic, whom I 
admire and respected as my superior and the Minister for Defense and tried
to fulfil all tasks connected with my position.  I would behave in such a way with
respect to anyone and the only task that I have ever refused to carry out was
in connection with Stipe Mesic who was elected the president [of the Presidency]
of Yugoslavia.<P>

We were supposed to greet him at the White Court [official residence] and I
refused to do so and organize security for him...  I was criticized because of
that but that is not important after all.<P>

It was a humiliation for myself, to obey and carry out orders of a man who had
said before he was elected: "I want to destroy Yugoslavia, it cannot exist,
I don't fight for Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia as it is cannot exist any more..."
And I was in love with Yugoslavia.  I've always felt as a Yugoslav, I've never
mentioned Montenegro, only Yugoslavia [Sljivicanin was born and raised in 
Montenegro]...(...)<P>

<h2>Vukovar, My Story</h2>

That happened in September 1991.  Every unit had some sort of a task, which were
probably given by the officials at the time.  We looked at those events in Croatia
as everyone else, we watched television, listened to the radio and were aware
that the people were suffering, running away and dying, that there was a war,
that the YPA and those who loved Yugoslavia had suffered the most casualties
together with the Serb people.(...)<P>

Following the orders of the High Command we went to Vukavar, because at that time
barracks in Vukovar and Vinkovci were in the most difficult situation.<P>

The barracks in Vukovar was surrounded and under constant fire of Ustashe 
soldiers.  Barracks in Osijek and Vinkovci as well...  My brigade 
received orders to come to their aid.<P>

Colonel Mile Mrksic was the commander of the brigade...  Our task was to help the
YPA units in that region, liberate barracks and establish conditions for a normal
life; therefore, not to simply capture the barracks and allow them to shoot at
you, but to disarm all those who can in any way endanger our soldiers in the barracks.<P>

We were at the time the legal armed forces of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
country which had been recognized by the whole world.  Therefore, we were supposed
to protect the population in our own country, to protect our fatherland.  Briefly,
we were supposed to ensure respect of the constitutional order, peace, freedom, equality,
and rights to free movement.(...)<P>

Besides, how could one hide that, keep it inside, when one could see someone
destroying a barracks and killing young soldiers in your own country?!  Let alone people,
women and children...  For example, an officer had lived and worked for fifty years
there in Slovenia, but had been born, for example in Cacak [Serbia] or Niksic
[Montenegro] or somewhere else; he married a Slovenian woman and suddenly everything
he had had, his family, his property was gone; and he was not supposed to care?!<P>

So, we set off towards Vukovar.  Frankly, I believed that it was enough
for the Army to show up and to say: easy people...  I was talking with those Ustashe:
"we are strong, you can't touch us, let us not shoot and kill each other for nothing."
I didn't say that in order to build some sort of an image but because I believed 
in that.  "That's stupid," I told them. Their commander was some lieutenant colonel 
, Mile Dedakovic Jastreb, who had been through the same military schools as
myself; so I called him and said: "please colleague, we went to the same schools
, gave oath to the same flag and same laws, let's get together and make sure that
the people can leave the city without trouble.(...)<P>

However, they would always respond by cursing, for example "you are chetniks", which I 
found extremely offensive.  For example, I am not a chetnik.  I was then a member
of the Yugoslav Peoples Army.  I was an officer of the legal army of that state.<P>

<h2> No one wanted to send their son to the war</h2>

Then they cursed our mothers, called us "bandits" and so on...  Now imagine what 
it's like to lead young men, 18-19 years of age to a war, an undeclared war.
That wasn't really a war, I didn't feel that way.  If it were a war, then the
whole country would have been involved.  Here you were simply forced to save
whatever could have been saved; otherwise, you could have let those Ustashe soldiers
to go wherever they wanted and kill whomever they like.  If we hadn't then captured 
Vukovar and defeated those Ustashe soldiers, they would have crossed Danube into 
Serbia and continued...  Some sort of apathy was present in the people, it seemed 
that everything was going badly, starting with Slovenia.  Everyone was somehow
helpless, there was no will to fight; people were asking, where is our YPA, what 
are they doing...  On the other hand no one wanted to send a son to the Army,
as if someone else would wage a war for them.<P>

How can I explain.  All of us were feeling bad because a group of hooligans could go
around and disarm soldiers and shoot.  Why disarm?  Because those soldiers and
officers had not been taught to shoot at their own people.  We thought of Croats
as of our own people!  I swear on my honor.  We were not bloodthirsty with
respect to them, the way they were towards us; they wanted to slaughter and kill
young conscripts.<P>

For example, in our unit there were a lot of Croat soldiers.  None of them refused
to carry out orders but instead they insisted to fight together with their
comrades.  Those young men were not influenced by nationalism as much as those
who led that policy in Croatia.<P>

For example, one of our first casualties was a soldier from Zagreb, a Croat.
I remember that, he died from a mortar shell.  As soon as we arrived and tried
to set up a camp, they attacked us with mortars.  We lost some soldiers and officers
there...<P>

<h2>War Has Nothing to Do with What One Learns in Schools</h2>

(...)There were a lot of volunteers and territorial defense units in that region at 
the time. We took over the command around September 30.  The worst thing is when an
army has not discipline, no command.  You can have thousands of soldiers and nothing.
They were disorganized, aimless, in panic...  We tried to put all those units under a
single command but that was difficult to implement.<P>

There were several paramilitary formations and groups.  They would call us officers
communists, this and that, atheists and so on...  All of that produced confusion
in command and mobilization.<P>

(...)  I think that Arkan is a very capable man, very strong, also brave,
a born soldier.  Without YPA he couldn't have done anything, because YPA
had tanks, artillery, hospitals, logistics etc.; still,  Arkan always tried
to assist YPA members.  I never really talked to him about politics.
we never discussed politics at the front - our goal was to liberate the city
and establish the conditions under which anyone could live where he or she
wanted to.  We wanted to stop fighting in the city.  Our enemies were Ustashe.
We had to defend ourselves.(...)  Serb and Montenegrin peoples have never in
their history been involved in an expansionist war.  They were simply forced
to defend their territory, their humanity and the humanity of others and to assist
those who were persecuted.  We did not go to Vukovar to conquer somebody else's
land or to steal.  Today one can hear all kinds of stuff: war profiteers etc.
That is a shame; those kinds of comments defame the graves of those who died...
(...) These accusations are made by those who have never got even close to the 
front, sat in safety, and now think that one could do whatever at the front.
Rubbish!<P>

(...) I wanted then, and want now to talk publicly with all those who were coming
from all sides [to Vukovar], those "peacenics".  They were trying to give us advise
on what to do, but I was convinced that all of them were Ustashe in disguise:
those who emigrated in 1941 or in 1945 and now have foreign passports.  They
live abroad and then come here and set some conditions...  I received them several 
times.  I proposed to talk to them publicly, in front of journalists, but they
refused.  Only secretly, they said.  Why?  We were not doing anything against 
the law.  We were working, sacrificing our lives and lives of our soldiers in 
order to save our fatherland.  We had nothing to hide.(...)<P>

<h2>One Life in More Important than Hundreds of Buildings</h2>

I was strict with the volunteers and demanded that they behave like real soldiers.
I did the same with the members of the territorial defense and co-operated closely
with their units.  Those units which were under our control did not cause
problems.  True, some of the units refused to fight, to go to the front.  They 
were caught up in party politics and fought among themselves.  Still I am convinced:
had we not captured the city of Vukovar, not captured, liberated it from the
hordes of Ustashe criminals, that would have given a tremendous boost to their
morale; they would have crossed the Danube and caused disturbances in Vojvodina [northern Serbia];
our people was apathetic; they were ready to flee.  It is easy to be a general 
after the battle and analyse the situation.  Many are asking today: why was
the city razed to the ground?  How many grenades, rockets were fired at it?
Please, one human life is more important than hundreds of buildings!<P>

If Ustashe were prepared to respect the laws of the country in which they lived,
that was the policy then, I am convinced that all of them would have been alive today;
exactly like those two or three thousands of prisoners whom we took to Sremska
Mitrovica and later released;  all of them are free, at their homes, no one's
been hurt...  If only they listened, didn't shoot at our soldiers, our barracks,
and behaved like ordinary people.(...)<P>

If those people [from Vukovar], who now live in Croatia or abroad cared to testify
and had courage to tell the truth they would say that our soldiers never asked anyone
for their nationality.  Listen, we had cases when Ustashe would raise a white
flag and drive towards our soldiers... our soldiers were young and innocent...
Ustashe would get close to them, pull out hidden machine guns, kill those soldiers,
drop the white flag and drive back to their side!(...)<P>

For example, seven of our soldiers got lost; later the locals showed us in
the courtyard of one building in "Sremskih Vladara" street...  They killed them
and then, instead of burying them like normal people do, they burned their
corpses and left them like that.  We found a man, and taped his confession; 
he admitted that he had killed those soldiers, pulled out their golden teeth,
that he slaughtered a woman, raped a girl...  Still, none of that had any
influence on our soldiers.  I was proud of them...  At Mitnica, there were 
more than 5,000 people; 50 our soldiers approached them and they didn't kill 
anyone, but tried to clear up who those people were and where they should be 
taken.<P>

I'm saying this openly.(...)  I couldn't everywhere at every moment, but everywhere
I went, I've never encountered a man who didn't behave properly, who committed
all these crimes we are accused of committing.<P>

Of course, in a big city like Vukovar, where there was a lot of Serb people,
those people who stayed there to defend their homes, whose houses were destroyed,
whose brothers, sisters, mother, father were killed...  it is easy to criticize that
now, but then, to live with all those devastated people...  If one of them found 
a neighbor who had done what shouldn't have been done - who knows what happened
between the two of them.  It is hard to control that in a civil war.<P>

It would be foolish to make a claim that no one was hurt.  We will never know
with confidence what exactly happened.  Still, whenever the YPA members and
those territorial defense and volunteer units which were under our command went,
they behaved properly.<P>


They say now: you had a list of Ustashe!  Of course.  What kind of an officer
I would have been if I didn't have a list of those who incite the people and 
lead it to crime?  I had a list, that's true.<P>  

I found a lot of people from that list.  If I were a criminal I would have 
killed those people...  I would have ordered my soldiers and officers to
execute them and I wouldn't have brought them [to the jail in Sremska Mitrovica]; like we brought
Vesna Bosanac, Marin Vidic, Njavro, Dmitar Karaula... and so on, I don't remember all the names...
  They all returned to Croatia.  They are the greatest criminals and if someone should have
died, it's them; not the innocent people.


(...)  No one pressured us to liquidate those people.  A lot of Vukovar citizens
demanded from us, officers, to behave properly towards those they knew.  As far as the
children, women and sick were concerned, if someone finds a single person who had
been killed by our soldiers, I will hang myself in the center of Belgrade!
I've read in the papers how those judges say that we drove them in trucks.  
What were we supposed to drive them in!?  We had army trucks, and did all we could 
in order to save those people, women, elderly and sick people...(...)<P>

<h2>Bad Place, Ovcara</h2>

That damned Ovcara; they talk about it all the time...  We had our first casualties there,
while we were pitching tents...  Corporal Paunovic died there; Ustashe had
 come from Dubrava forest, killed him and ran away.  That's some sort of a
farm, 10 to 15 kilometers from Vukovar, next to that forest.  I know very well
where it is, we had a lot of problems there.  Ustashe kept shooting at the farm...
One bad place, I would say.  The most infamous Ustashe [stronghold] was in Mitnica
between Ovcara and Vukovar.(...)  When we captured Mitnica, Ustashe commander,
Dmitar Karaula, he is alive and well in Croatia, said that he would surrender and
prepare a list of his soldiers which we asked for, so that hose who were innocent
can go and those who were guilty could go to jail or be exchanged for our soldiers.
That list still exists in the YPA documentation.  I don't remember the exact
number, but every soldier on that list was treated according to the law as was
agreed with the members of an international organization.  We then took them
from Vukovar to Ovcara because we didn't have enough vehicles to take all
of them together; we wanted to evacuate women, children and elderly first, in
order to make sure they would not be attacked by those set on revenge;  because
of that we returned several times to pick up the prisoners from Ovcara.<P>

<h2>"My prisoners are in Croatia, they are alive, they should confirm that"</h2>

According to that list, there were 182 or 183 of them...  we kept them in Ovcara
 and no one was hurt.  When we managed to get hold of vehicles, we took them to
 Sremska Mitrovica, to the jail.  They were interrogated in the jail, but all of them
 were later released and are now in Croatia.  Let them tell the truth!  Nothing else
 happened in Ovcara.<P>

We kept accurate records, diaries, orders...  all we did.  We are a regular unit and 
everything we wrote and reported and were ordered to do is still in the archive.
(...)  They are talking about some sort of war loot, about horrible things.
Those are all fabrications.(...)<P>

<h2>What Happened Later</h2>

On November 18, I was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel.  This was a regular promotion,
which should have happened on December 22.  I was promoted to a Colonel according
to the regular procedure as well, on December 1, 1995, according to the laws and regulations
of the Yugoslav Army.  I went to Podgorica on October 11 1993 and stayed there until
February 15 1996.<P>

When I heard that I was indicted by the court in the Hague I was in the field
with my soldiers, at the border, providing security because Ustashe were again
staging provocations.  If I remember well, that happened in November 1995.
How can a man feel?  I felt very bad.  War crimes were mentioned for a first
time in W.W.II and I've read about the court in Nuremberg; how is one supposed
to feel when they are comparing him with some SS officer who came from Germany in 
order to kill women and children, destroy and burn all that can be destroyed
and burned and to enslave a nation.  To be called a war criminal is a great offence
for a man.<P>

I was not an aggressor; instead I tried to secure peace for all people and
 instructed my soldiers to protect the lives of those who had tried to impose
evil on the people...  and I am a war criminal!  Then all kinds
of things go through one's head.  People, who have never been to the front
now say: who knows what you did over there?  How is one supposed to react to that?(...)<P>

You ask me whether I'll go to the Hague...<P>

No.  First, I think that that would shame my soldiers, my fellow
officers, all those who were with me, and my people as well.  They say that
everyone will be eventually extradited, but under what circumstances?
If I did anything wrong, I should be tried by the court of my people.  Not
by the court of those who are paid to follow orders of some fascist or someone
who had always hated Yugoslavia.

<h1>Sweet Living in Sarajevo</h1>

<strong><em>by Dragos Kalajic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Duga , Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, December 10 1994</h2>

(...)The realization of a poet's vision proves and demonstrates that it wasn't
a product of imagination but a deep premonition about the
future events.  Far reaching character of Karadzic's intuition, which has seen
the forthcoming tragedy of Sarajevo while the others, a mob, snoozed with
the illusions of "progress" and "brotherhood and unity", is well known 
and recognized.  However, no one has noticed that Dzemaludin Latic [considered to
be the ideologist of the main Bosnian Muslim party, Party for Democratic Action (SDA)]
has also expressed similar ideas.  In the poem <strong>Behar in Sarajevo</strong>,
published in the book <strong>Dom Davudov</strong> in 1989, Latic clearly
sensed the future developments:<P>
"I can't tell if you're more beautiful during the day or at night/
Sarajevo when the blossom covers you./  Suddenly, as if someone waved
a hand/ a wind blows and the flowers disappear.../  Like our lives."<P>

In the poem <strong>Sarajevo, sprzila te munja</strong> [Sarajevo may a
lightning destroy you], Dzemaludin Latic cursed the Sarajevo of "brotherhood 
and unity":<P>

"Cowards swears and curses:/  Sarajevo, may a lightning destroy you,/
and black crows mourn you!"<P>

In the eyes of foreign correspondents from Sarajevo who supply material for the western shapers
of the public opinion, Dzemaludin Latic is some sort of an Islamic Savonarola.
They dislike his condemnation of Western rubbish, drugs, pornography, prostitution
and promiscuity.  Reading those alarmist reports against the signs of Islam that
disturb the illusion about a secular, democratic and multicultural character
of Izetbegovic's authorities, we can easily surmise what sort of "democratic
values" these prophets of mondialism actually talk about.  Latic should be 
given credit for his loyalty to the basic tenets of the Islam which he 
reveals because of his devotion to the truth.  Those condemnations of Latic's
calls to loyalty to Islam demonstrate the final degree of secularisation 
of the Western civilisation whose advocates imagine that it is possible to
be a Muslim, a Christian or a Buddhist without any corresponding content and
obligations.<P>

Defaming Latic, western observers usually state, with outrage, his recognition
of the pathological nature of mixed marriages:  "Mixed marriages between Bosnian
muslims, Serbs and Croats, in itself a symbol of misunderstood common life,
are usually relationships condemned from the start; in them there are a lot of
conflicts and the children are frustrated because of their origin."  A cynic,
while reading aforementioned expressions of outrage because of Islamic condemnation
and intolerance of mixed marriages, like those described by the <em>International 
Herald Tribune</em> correspondent concerned for the future of the "Bosnian
multiethnic society", could laugh in the face of Washington advocates of 
the transformation of Bosnia to Muslimania.  The aforementioned mentors of
Islam should first learn about the basic tenets of Islam.  If they think that
one can be a Muslim and at the same time reject all formational principles
of <em>Koran</em>, they are very wrong.<P>

Latic's ideas are soundly based on <em>Koran</em> and are among the most
basic obligations of Muslims.  It isn't possible, nor imaginable, that Muslims
take from the <em>Koran</em> only those ideas which would agree with the will
of mondialists and reject the rest, above all the obligation for the struggle 
against the most monstrous order in the history of the world which is advocated
by the Washington free masons of European misery.  The inherent nature of 
<em>Qoran's</em> and every other religious message is that it doesn't allow partial
relationship with a believer: if one is a believer, he or she must follow and
respect everything that is in the holly book.  Otherwise, one leaves the religious 
community.  Besides, Latic only warns Muslims about their duty to follow 
<em>Quran</em>.  Those who ignore Latic's warning obviously do not have a right
to call themselves Muslim.<P>

While I'm thinking about Latic, I'm praying in my heart to the Serbian God
to assist his noble struggle on the Allah's way of the rebirth of Muslim
people.  Feelings of personal friendship and political enmity coincide in
my prayer. Before this war, anyone who had a will to see through illusions regarding
the future could have realized that the birth of Muslimania was certain
with only two unknowns: the time and its territory.  Today, we know
that Muslimania has been <em>de facto</em> established and that its territory
will be much smaller than the Islamists have expected.  Serbs have suffered a lot
in the hands of Muslims, but they did receive one good thing for which they
should be grateful: thanks to impatient and imprudent attack of Islamists
on power and the state of Bosnia's size, Serbs woke up from seventy years
of dreaming about "brotherhood and unity".  Some other, more sly Muslims
in power in Sarajevo would have kept Serbs in a semi-conscious state, and made
sure that it was too late for liberation when the Serbs woke up.<P>

It is much better to deal with real Islamists then with hidden and quasi
Muslims.  When the borders between the Republic of Srpska and Muslimania,
between Serbs and muslims, are finally established, then it will be possible
to form future political alliances against common enemies.  One should 
remember that today Islam is the largest and best prepared enemy of "the new 
world order".  The only exception on the map of world Islamic uprising
are the Bosnian muslims who are forced to serve Washington policy.
But that slavery will end with the war and final demarcation of the border.
Classical formula of politics says that the enemy of our enemy is our potential
friend.<P>

<h1> Partnership for Racket</h1>

<strong><em>by Dragos Kalajic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Duga , Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, June 8 1996</h2>

Influential Italian weekly <em>Panorama</em> has been recently honored by the CIA:
<em>Panorama</em> was given rights to be the first to publish in European media space
and in that manner spread supposedly secret results of the futurologist predictions
of the CIA's intellectual <em>task force</em> regarding impending, future and
possible break ups of states.  The document in question is a "draft", some
200 pages long, with numerous annexes, graphs and diagrams; its title
is <em>Report about the disintegration of states</em>.  Italian weekly presented
an abridged version of the <em>Report</em>, adding that the report is the
result of interdisciplinary research which, without availability of
computerized analysis, because of huge amount of collected data from  over
six hundred fields, would require at least ten years of man hours.<P>

The authors of the <em>Report</em> consider four basic reasons for disintegration
of states: ideological-revolutionary and civil wars, ethnic conflicts, genocide
and "politicide", and radical and traumatic changes of ruling structures. The <em>Report</em>
includes a map of world on which all states are placed in one of four basic
categories, according to their future prospects: uncertain, low, medium and high
risk of disintegration.  United States of America, Australia, European Union
and Japan are placed among the low risk countries.  Red color, denoting high risk
covers all formerly Soviet Muslim countries, India, Turkey, large part of African
countries and almost all of South America.  In Europe, the zone of high risk
encompasses Croatia, Muslim-Croatian Federation, Republic Srpska, Albania and 
Macedonia, while FR Yugoslavia, Slovenia and Romania were placed in the medium risk
zone.<P>

The author of the abridged version of the <em>Report</em> informed the readers
that this vision of the immediate future of the world was supposed to remain
secret "not only because of the undesirable use of the <em>Report</em> but also
because of the possible harsh political consequences of such a report."
Thus, gullible among us can conclude that <em>Panorama's</em> envoy managed to
penetrate <em>top secret</em> CIA's safes and irresponsibly revealed a big
secret, thus making possible "undesirable utilization" as well as "harsh
political consequences", all in order to warn the public about impending
catastrophes.  One doesn't have to be extremely intelligent in order to 
conclude that this story is a sham, since anyone with any knowledge about
the main mass media networks in the West knows that there (apart for, for
now, the Internet) such freedom is unimaginable nor possible because of the
dependence of the main news providers on the interests of the plutocratic
system.<P>

Besides, the alleged secrecy of the <em>Report</em> is refuted by the statement
of the CIA research director, Daniel O. Esty, given exactly to the <em>Panorama</em>
journalist.  In that statement, the leader of CIA <em>task force</em> points
out that the <em>task force</em> has "besides traditional socio-political and 
geostrategic factors" discovered "a series of new causes which could have a
decisive role in the development of a crisis or traumatic disintegration of 
governments."<P>

Aware of the consequences of all previous publications of "secrets" from the CIA
secret vaults, we must ask ourselves why that <em>report</em> was
presented to the public of the "mondialist [global] village".  The author of 
this article believes that CIA is trying to psychologically prepare the
public of the "mondialist [global] village" for wars and disintegration of
states which Washington directly and indirectly is currently preparing or 
inciting.  When these predictions come true, the wars and disintegrations will
be accepted as [unavoidable], predicted by the aforementioned information
technology, which has, long time ago, replaced in the consciousness of the 
mondialized mob not only every trust in human intellect but even ancient
God's grace, with which the people of the past explained numerous historical
calamities.<P>

<h2>Far Away From the God and Close to the USA</h2>

Therefore, the aforementioned <em>Report</em> indirectly informs all
true peace-lovers and peace makers to abandon all hope and illusions.  Besides,
this historic reality absolutely refutes all theories of bribed and free
("useful fools", in CIA vocabulary) prophets of the alleged virtues of
the American model for the "multicultural" and "civic society", which is supposedly
naturally inclined towards peace, unlike every kind of nationalism and national 
states which (again supposedly) invariably engage in expansionist wars. 
In reality, history demonstrates that "the leading democracy" and the 
model for all approaches towards "multicultural" and "civic society" as
a state model is by far the largest producer of military interventions and 
wars.<P>

Only in its geopolitical environment, in North, Central and South America,
during the last 100 years the USA has engaged in almost 90 military interventions
and expansionist wars and a huge number of direct and indirect coups.
The USA have used their military power against Mexico (14 times), Cuba (13 times),
Panama (12 times), Nicaragua (10 times), Dominican Republic (9 times), 
Columbia and Honduras (9 times each), Haiti (6 times), Puerto Rico (3 times),
and once against Argentina and Brazil.<P>

Chronic military interventionism of the USA is in the service of corresponding
political, military and economic hegemony which via imposed indebtedness destroys
all economies and produces poverty which forces the masses from the American Third 
World countries to emigrate to the USA.  These unfortunate nations have made up
a proverb which succinctly expresses their fate: "So far away from the God, and
so close to the USA!"<P>

Recently, <em>International Herald Tribune</em> published an article by two gurus
of the Washington mondialism: Jacob Heilbrun and Michael Lind together explained
100 years of military interventionism as wars which led  to the establishment of 
the "first American empire".  According to them, the second empire was conquered
thanks to W.W.II and includes Western Europe, Japan and a number of islands
in the Pacific.  Heilbrun and Lind informed the public that lately we had
witnessed the establishment of the "third American empire" through "American
leadership in the movement of Muslim nations, from the Persian gulf to the
Balkans."  This sequence of events will lead to the resurrection of the Ottoman
empire under American tutelage, with the tendency of spreading of this
"third American empire" into "Eastern Europe (with aid from NATO) and formerly
neutral Yugoslavia".<P>

The real goal of Washington "peace initiatives" has been confirmed
in the statements by Strobe Talbot, under-secretary in the USA government, who
emphasized that NATO wants to engage in and initiate operations which were outside
its formerly defined zone of action, "in Mid-east and elsewhere".  That "elsewhere",
in view of discovery of mondialist ambitions, should be understood as "everywhere".
Foreign policy commentator in Paris <em>Le monde diplomatique</em>, Marion Ajer,
in the essay under the title <em>NATO: in service of which security?</em> provides
answer for the above mentioned question: "This third deployment of military
forces in Europe (after 1917 and 1944) presents (once the wishes of the European
Union members for common defense force are neutralized) the renewal of the
traditional role of the USA in the (Atlantic) alliance and their confirmation
as the most important military force in unipolar world."<P>

<h2>Basic Strategy Against Russia</h2>

NATO alliance is the basic "hard" tool for the establishment and spreading of
the "third American empire", from the Middle East, where the hegemony and
control of the world oil reserves is secured by the military axis Israel-Turkey
(recently made official with an international agreement), through "Islamic
axis" for penetration of Turkey and Muslim immigrants into the European Union,
all the way to the borders of Russia.  The project for the spreading of
NATO influence through the "post-communist" region is a threat to Russia which
will probably materialize provided Russian people liberates itself by overthrowing
its current russofobic, foreign and mondialistic rulers.  NATO strategic maps 
from 1982 already framed the Caucasus region as a future war theater, which
throws different light on the current war in Chechenia and the efforts of its
Washington instigators to spread that conflict on the rest of Russia in
order to provoke its destruction.<P>

This is the interventionist implementation of the anti Russian strategy
which can be found in the National Security Service Directive number 20/1 from
August 18 1948: "We must ensure that even an non-communist and nominally
friendly regime in Russia: a) does not have in the future sizeable military force;
b) that its economy is strongly dependent on the rest of the world; c) does
not have strong control over the minorities; d) cannot establish anything
similar to the 'iron curtain'.  If that regime exhibits unfavorable attitude
towards communists and favorable attitude towards the USA we still must ensure
that these conditions are imposed although not in an offensive and humiliating 
manner.  Still, we must win them over, if not peacefully than by force, 
to protect our own interests."<P>

In light of this strategy and its implementation, we can conclude that NATO
alliance and "Partnership for Peace" are the means for the establishment and
spreading of the "third American empire", as is confirmed by Heilbrun and
Lind: "In the predictable future, the main purpose of the NATO alliance
countries will be to serve as centers for recruitment of soldiers for American
wars in the Balkans, Mediterranean and in the (Persian) Gulf.  The challenge
of the establishment of the new European-Middle Eastern sphere of influence
will require development of new institutions and alliances, similar to the NATO
alliance ("partnership for Peace", D.K. remark) for relations with various
protectorates which the USA has collected since 1990."<P>

Therefore, all propaganda about the alleged security and peacemaking nature of
the NATO alliance and "Partnership for Peace" (waiting room for NATO) simply 
serves for indoctrination of gullible masses and corresponding political
pseudo-elites in the ruins of the post-communist systems.  In such a situation,
peace and security depend mostly on the good or bad will of the "new world order"
strategists from Washington and their plutocratic commanders from New York.
Good example of the total "impotence" of the NATO alliance to establish
lasting peace even among its members are the continuous military provocations
by Turkey, starting with the twenty years long military occupation of the northern
half of Cyprus and ending with recent attacks at the territorial integrity of 
Greece.  It is obvious that Turkey wouldn't have been able to stage these 
provocations without prodding by or at least silent agreement of the Washington
strategists, whose Generals are supreme commanders of the NATO forces.
NATO alliance has failed to control Turkish ambitions for conquest; instead
they have recently decided to send "observers" to the endangered Greek borders.<P>

<h2>Those who seek Freedom Will Get War</h2>

Another proof of the real character and purpose of the NATO alliance as the
"soft" tool for the establishment and enlargement of the "third American
empire" are the political and economic conditions for the acceptance to the 
alliance which have nothing to do with the military and defensive goals.  
Apparently, NATO alliance will only accept "democratic countries", therefore
countries with governments which are trustworthy servants of the American 
interests.<P>

Another crucial condition is the "market economy", actually total lack of 
means for the protection of the domestic economy from the foreign financial,
and manufacturing pirates.  History tells us that most, even the largest wars
(such as those against Imperial Japan, Tsar's Russia and Austro-Hungarian
empire) were initiated by the Western capitalists because of the determination 
of those states to defend their economic independence and wealth, domestic
markets and resources.  The aforementioned CIA <em>Report</em> also raises
this cause for wars by menacingly pointing out that the most endangered
states are those with "low degree of market accessibility".<P>

Another important condition for accession to the NATO alliance is the "readiness
to bear in full all costs necessary to align the domestic military forces
with the NATO  forces".  In other words, readiness to buy weapons <em>made in
the USA</em>, pay expensive advisers for the training on those weapons,
and pay for the upkeep of the American occupation forces.  The necessary investment
is so huge for the economically weak and indebted states from Eastern Europe
that even the makers of these conditions (or extortion) are sensing likely
failure.  On the pages of <em>the Washington Post</em> William Odom openly
admits: "Armies of [Eastern European] countries are not modern enough to
comply with the NATO standards.  The investments necessary to reach
compliance are too large for their economies at the moment."<P>

Among the conditions for acceptance to the NATO alliance we can find one 
that at first seems quite benign and reasonable: "NATO members accept the
principle of peaceful solutions of internal problems and border disputes".
Unfortunately, this condition only seems benign.  Recent experience confirms
that this condition actually implies giving up the sovereignty and 
acknowledging the right of the "international community" (one of USA
pseudonyms) to be the sole arbiter in internal and international disputes
( incited by Washington).<P>

Keen and experienced mind can easily spot in this condition another announcement
of new European and fratricidal wars, based on the ancient formula of political
cynicism: "divide and conquer".  The locations of these future and possible wars 
have already been determined, as is confirmed by numerous American forecasters,
from CIA's <em>task force</em> to already mentioned William Odom: "Large number
of restive Hungarians live in southern Slovakia, Romanian Transilvania and
northern Serbia.  Russia is demanding that Poland cede a corridor leading to
the Kaliningrad enclave (former Eastern Prussia).  There is a Polish minority
in Lithuania, while Estonia and Latvia have sizeable Russian minorities.  Moldavia,
formerly a part of Romania, has an uncertain status.  Enlargement of NATO can 
prevent some of these problems and serve as a warning to those who would try
to use these possible future conflicts."<P>

Reading these texts, a gullible reader might think, with gratitude, that
Washington strategists are sincerely worried about the peace in Eastern Europe
and are trying to protect it by offering the services of the NATO alliance.
The experience from the war in the ruins of Bosnia-Hercegovina is enough to
realize, once for all, that European peace is undesirable for Washington
strategists.  First, they pushed Bosnian Islamists on the road towards secession,
via a referendum on independence, which according to unequivocal Izetbegovic's
admission could have meant only one thing: "declaration of war".  Later, they
sabotaged every peace agreement among the war parties, advising the leader
of Islamists [Izetbegovic] to reject these agreements and wait for promised
greater gains.  Only when they gauged that peace (?) or a cease-fire suited their
current goals, Washington srategists forced the Islamists to sign a peace agreement,
at the same time presenting the Dayton agreement as the result of their skill, 
omnipotence and the proof of European impotence, which is another reason
for American hegemony and presence of NATO occupation forces under American
command [in Europe].<P>

<h2>Fear Leads to NATO</h2>

As Marion Ajer lucidly points out at the pages of <em>Le Monde Diplomatique</em>,
(where, due to the exclusive nature of the publication, one can find a truth
or two now and then), "in order for the NATO alliance to survive it will be necessary
to produce new wars."  Therefore, in order to justify NATO alliance in
the eyes of insufficiently compliant Europeans, Washington strategists will 
have to produce new wars in Europe to keep NATO busy.  The same rule applies to
the Eastern European nations which are offered protection and security under the 
supposedly peaceful wing of the NATO alliance: their peace and security
will consistently be endangered to force them to obediently pay the racket
to the NATO alliance, that is New York plutocrats.<P>

European peace has been based for a long time on Versailles and Trianon pacts, 
but now American interventionism is destroying those foundations.  In a speech
delivered in the American national press club on January 31, 1996, Richard
Holbrooke, Washington administrator of the war in the ruins of Bosnia-Hercegovina, 
announced that the foundations of European peace had been destroyed
because of "unresolved heritage from Versailles and Trianon conferences".
Therefore, all borders within Eastern Europe and between Germany and Eastern
Europe can now be disputed.  This fact, combined with war threats which it
brings is the main reason for the attempts to buy peace by paying the racket
to Washington extortionists.<P>

Yours truly asked recently an influential Bulgarian geopolitician, Sergey
Stanisev, from the Bulgarian <em>Institute for the Balkan and European 
Research</em>, why important political forces in Bulgaria support Bulgaria's
entry to the NATO alliance.  Mr. Stanisev replied:<P>

"Naturally, the real reason is not some putative fear from Russian expansionist
policy, as is usually claimed in public.  Nobody serious and sensible pays
any attention to warnings from Washington that the new Russian state could
in the future start a conquest of the former Soviet and East European territories,
which it had controlled.  Even if it had expansionist ambitions, that new Russia 
simply wouldn't be capable of anything like that.  How can one even imagine that   
the army which is not capable of crashing the Chechen uprising could embark
on a huge conquest?  Fundamental and hidden reason for the desire to join the
NATO alliance is in the fear from the Washington's successful war-mongering policy.
The performance of that policy in the Yugoslav territory has seriously 
affected all Eastern European elites.  Many believe that they will buy peace and
mercy by joining the NATO and paying a ransom to Washington war-mongers."<P>

A good example for the mentioned war psychosis is the race to join NATO between
Hungary and Romania, which is fuelled by the emissaries and extortionists from
Washington, starting with Javier Solana, NATO secretary general.  Mr. Solana
has recently visited capitals of all Eastern European countries willing to pay
NATO's racket, starting with Kiev and ending with Sofia;  to all of them he swore
that the "race is open" and the referee "unbiased".  Still in practice,
although "all are equal" some are "more equal then others" since they execute
"democratic demands" (from the Washington strategists of mondialism) 
with more enthusiasm than others.<P>

Romanian collocutors, including the president, Defense Minister, Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, and the heads of both houses of Parliament, offered many  
humiliating guarantees to Solana that Romania fulfils all conditions to
join NATO.  They even presented the results of a poll which demonstrates
that 95% of Romanians supports Romania's entry into NATO alliance.  Still,
they were left with the impression that Hungary will be accepted to NATO
in the first round while Romania will have to wait outside.<P>

<h2>Illusion Called West</h2>

Their impression was also that Washington deliberately favors some 
"applications" over others in order to cause suspicion between states, 
disputes and finally conflicts.  Romanian Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
Melekasanu, publicly pointed out that "the race for entry into NATO
is causing instability in this part of the world".  According to the
professional opinion of the Romanian Defense Minister, Tinka, if Hungary
joins NATO while Romania remains outside, both countries will "engage in
an arms race".  Of course that race will be run according to the NATO 
standards, to great satisfaction of American military industry and
its investors and international extortionists which will provide credits
to both of these blackmailed and indebted states.<P>

Romanian Defense Minister, Tinka, correctly estimates that the arms race 
between Romania and Hungary will encourage separatism within the 
Hungarian minority in Romania and demands for territorial concessions
by Hungary, based on the Washington declaration of the practical
annulment of Trianon treaty.  Javier Solana did his best to incite
such a Hungarian-Romanian conflict for his paymasters, New York plutocrats,
by expressing to his Romanian hosts, "great dismay about the situation
of national minorities, above all the Hungarian minority, and their rights 
in Romania".<P>

Romanians, themselves excellent students of history, about which testify
magnificent works of Romanian intellectuals, Mircea Eliade, Emil Cioran
and Vintile Horia, can recognize veiled threats but for now do not have
means to defend themselves.  The columnist from the respected magazine 
<em>Adevarul</em>, Dumitru Tinu, also testifies about this impotence: 
"Romania is the victim in a game of interests; she will again feel
betrayed in her great trust in the West."  One should read the message
sent to Romanians and other Orthodox people by Emil Cioran from his
Paris exile via his book <em>History and Utopia</em>
in order to understand all futility of trust in the West.<P>

Let us also give credit to contemporary Chinese political sagacity (wisdom)
which easily sees through all manipulations of the Western power brokers.
This wisdom has been acquired through 6 millennia of culture and history.
This wisdom has been recently addressed in a cowboy manner by the American
Secretary for Defense, William Perry, who aggressively offered some sort of
"Partnership for Peace":  "Through direct contacts with Chinese military
forces we can contribute that the Chinese national security institutions
and strategic thinking, new arms acquisitions and budgetary policy as well
as the general style of action become more open."<P>

Naturally, Chinese wisdom gently but decisively declined Perry's offer, easily
spotting a lie.  Failure of Perry's deception gave material to Henry Kisinger
to find lessons for the future: "As long as military co-operation is presented
as some sort of assistance whose goal is the transformation of Chinese institutions,
the society which has been independent for 6 thousands years must perceive
this as patronizing."<P>

(...)  It is unnecessary to emphasize that Europeans must with all their force
work on the "demise of West (= USA)" and their liberation.  Europeans can offer 
the greatest contribution to this demise by resolutely defending sovereignty
and independence of their states from the aggression of the mondialist, political,
economic, (sub)cultural and military hegemony.  The power of the West will
collapse if it's denied its centuries old prey on which it lives and prospers
like a parasite.  The main condition for the European defense movement is the
recognition of the enemy and his goals.  A good example for this recognition is
the article by Richard Ovinkov which has been published in Russian paper 
<em>Pravda</em>:<P>

"The essence of the American and Western policy (which has been tested on
the Yugoslav territory) is to incite internal ethnic instability and conflicts,
especially in multinational states and to use these conflicts for their own 
goals.  Is seems that the makers of such policy want to use this (Yugoslav) 
precedent of a successful divisions among Slavic peoples in the future as well.
The possibilities for its realization will depend on whether they will succeed
in dividing the Slavs and put them against each others.  Is it possible that
we haven't learned anything yet?"<P>

<h1>An Arrest in Tucepi</h1>

<strong><em> by Milos Vasic, Filip Svarm, Tatijana Tagirov and Boris Raseta</em><p>

Vreme, Beograd, FR Yugoslavia, 10/30 1995</strong><P>

On Tuesday, October 24, 1995, Hotel "Alga" in Tucepi (locally known as "Mercepi") was full: almost three hundred delegates from the yearly congress of the Helsinki Civic Union, which had been held in Tuzla, slept at the hotel after a 24 hour long trip by buses.  As they were getting ready to continue their journey, a strange group of people appeared in the hotel lobby: two uniformed policemen carrying a stretcher on which a man with a beard was lying, two policemen in civilian clothing, two activists from the Helsinki congress and a Belgrade lawyer Nikola Barovic.  It turned out that the Croatian secret police [SZUP, Service for the Protection of the Constitutional Order], had just arrested Radovan Jovic, a delegate at the conference.  That arrest somehow coincided with the Croatian Police statement which said that " a group of 13 Serb spies had been arrested".  Radovan Jovic had fallen ill the previous night and almost couldn't move; this is not surprising at all, since the group with which he traveled needed 62 hours to reach Tuzla by bus and another 24 hours to get from Tuzla to Tucepi; a man suffering from discopathy has a hard time getting through this.  Soon, an ambulance car appeared, Radovan Jovic was placed inside and the car left followed by the police.  Two civilian members from the Croatian secret service refused to show their identity cards but the local police confirmed their status; lawyer Nikola Barovic was worried: that wouldn't be a first disappearance in this war...<P> 

Jovic's fellow travelers - the activists from different organizations for the protection of human rights and people who had had a lot of experience in the cases of this sort - reacted quickly and efficiently: they alerted their organizations by phone, called American ambassador in Zagreb, Peter Galbraight (who had suggested that Jovic be invited to the conference), German ambassador and Croatia based foreign correspondents.  The Croatian police, until then polite and cooperative, suddenly changed its attitude: two buses with conference participants from Yugoslavia and Zagreb were put under police guard.  Until then, a police car with flashing lights drove in front of buses in order to speed up their passage; now the policemen forbade the passengers to leave the buses and tried to get to the border with Hungary as soon as possible; the convoy stopped only twice, far away from inhabited places and a phone.  All participants had valid Croatian transit visas which would expire two days later, but that didn't mean anything: they might have as well been arrested; the Czech owner of the bus transit company joined the police in harassment which almost caused a fight.<P>

<strong>A Peaceful Man From Glina</strong>:  Who is Radovan Jovic?  He was born in 1953, his wife and children have been in Belgrade since 1993, his sister in Zagreb (she was summoned to the police that same morning and interrogated until late that night); he graduated from a law school, passed a bar exam and was elected the county court judge in Glina.  Milorad Pupovac says that he has known Jovic since the beginning of 1993, when he attended the first informal meeting of the Serbs and Croats in Austria:" He supported peace, a political agreement; he was against all kinds of extremism and all kinds of non-democratic activities.  Because of that, and especially because of his participation at the meeting of Croatian and Serb intellectuals in Zagreb, in November 1994 (he was the only representative of the Serb people from Krajina) his house in Glina was blown up.  After that he participated in three UN sponsored conferences about Serbo-Croatian relations."<P>

This tall and peaceful man has a history of clashes with the Martic authorities in Knin: he had been friendly with late Dmitar Obradovic, a president of Vrgin Most municipality who was murdered in 1992 (case unsolved); at the beginning of 1995 he was dismissed from his job; he refused join the Serb army and spent a month in Martic's jail from which he was later taken to the front; after the intervention of the American ambassador, he was released and moved to Belgrade.  In July and August of 1995 he was in the USA as a guest of the American government which caused a hysterical reaction in the Croatian press since Jovic was a member of the delegation which represented the Croatian human rights organizations.  His destiny is similar to that of Veljko Dzakula: they were arrested by both Martic and the Croatian police;  Jovic even visited Dzakula and Dusan Ecimovic in [Serb] jail in 1993.  During his trip to Tuzla he was quiet and stayed away from the rest of the group; he didn't seem at all affected by the arrest: he was lying on the stretcher, smiling and smoking.<P>

<strong>A Spy Conspiracy</strong>: Two hours after Jovic's arrest in Tucepi, at 2 p.m., the assistant to the Police minister, Smiljan Reljic, announced that 15 people had been indicted and accused of spying for RSK [Republic of Serb Krajina].  The operation was called "Zenit", although the Croatian papers kept calling it "Labrador 2"; it probably sounded nicer.  Fourteen people, 12 Serbs and 2 Croats had been arrested and one person still hadn't been apprehended.  Radovan Jovic's name was on the list of the accused.  The suspects were accused of collecting the intelligence in "intelligence centers in Knin, Belgrade and Topusko,"[all on the territory controlled by the rebel Serb forces] within the Yugoslav Army intelligence service, as well as through the intelligence stations located in Trieste [in Italy], Koper [in Slovenia] and Innsbruck [in Austria].  All this was done under the cover of private companies whose owners were Serbs.  The offices and apartments of all arrested had been searched, without significant results, as could be seen from the presented material.  The evidence shown at the press conference consisted of  the details of private correspondence, address books, photographs, a few guns, one Serb flag and two car number plates (VN-2805 and KE-4240, for Vojnic and Korenica).  Since the arrested are mostly the former policemen, it could be expected that they would have some arms; the rest could be found in any house. The press conference took place four days after the explosion in Rijeka [an Islamic terrorist organization, Gamaa al islamijja, later claimed responsibility for that explosion which took place in front of a police station]  and five days before the Croatian elections.  Reljic unequivocally blamed Serbs for the explosion;  a large number of Serbs had been summoned and interrogated by the Police; this was assessed as an additional pressure on already terrified Serbs in Croatia.<P>

There are two possible explanations for Radovan Jovic's arrest.  He entered and left Croatia, without any problems in 1994; this time he entered the country twice and departed once without problems; the list of conference participants from FR Yugoslavia had been sent to the Croatian Ministry of Internal Affairs a month in advance on the trip; check ups of suspicious individuals are carried out on the SZUP computers.  Why was Radovan Jovic arrested half way between Tuzla and Hungary?  It is a fact that two out of seven buses  were kept at the border crossing in Miskolc for nine and a half hours (since Monday night until Tuesday dawn); this was justified by the "slow" visas of the participants from Azerbaijan.  Radovan Jovic had therefore twice entered Croatia (border crossing Barch, from Hungary and Metkovic from Bosnia-Hercegovina) and departed once (Metkovic) and hasn't been stopped although Zagreb had received the data about all passengers (the buses had to wait for hours for a permission to enter Croatia; the excuse was that the policemen were waiting for an approval from Zagreb).  There are two possible explanations: either Jovic was arrested because of somebody's political decision to arrest someone else besides 14 suspects; someone else, a Serb, who had been a supporter of peaceful and political solutions and is still a spy (what are the other Serbs like!), or that SZUP found out about Jovic's "spying activity" during three days between his entry from Hungary and from Bosnia-Hercegovina. This other version is somewhat unlikely, if we are to believe Smiljan Reljic, who said that "the action has been conducted systematically and for a long time."  The conference participants who were present when the arrest took place unreservedly agreed that the arrest was the consequence of a political decision which was a part of the election campaign.  It was necessary to show that no Serb is trustworthy, they said, as well as that those Croats who believe that there are loyal Serbs shouldn't be trusted.<P>

It is the fact that the Croatian authorities captured a lot of documentation from the archives of the former Republic of Serb Krajina during the operation "Storm".  That material can be used to support different kinds of conclusions, but a large number of professionals and a lot of time is necessary for something like that.  The Croatian secret service hasn't had neither resources nor time for that.  Most likely, we have here a pre-election scandal which might in the future turn out to be a blank; but than it won't matter.  Side message is that SZUP knows everything about everyone, or that it can plausibly spread that message.  This is not insignificant during a pre-election campaign.<P>

          *Participant hCa conference Tuzla arrested*</pre>
 
[Thursday, 26-10-1995 -  Split]<P>
 
Radovan Jovic was a participant from Belgrade at the 4th hCa
conference in Tuzla. He had been invited to the conference
personally by Peter Galbraith, the US Embassador. Together
with many others he arrived late at night/ Tuesday morning,
04.15 from Tuzla at the hotel Alga in Tucepi, Croatia where
all the participants were supposed to spend the night before
travelling further either to Zagreb, Prague, Budapest or
Belgrade. The following (Tuesday) morning (approximately
11.00) special police in civil (4 police men from "Service
for the Protection of the Constitutional Order") came to the
hotel to arrest him. As he was not able to walk, because of
a severe pain in the back/ spine which paralysed parts of
his body, the police transported him by ambulance around
12.00 o'clock. They stated they would take him first to a
hospital in Makarska and afterwards to a hospital in Split.
Attempts to locate him there failed.<P>
 
At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon in Zagreb Mr.
Smiljan Reljic, assistant to the Minister of Internal
Affairs (Ivan Jarnjak) stated that on Monday, 23-10-1995,
criminal charges had been filed against 15 persons on
suspicion that they were spies for the intelligence of the
so-called "Serbian Republic of Krajina". They had been
captured in a joint action by the "Service for the
Protection of the Constitutional Order" of the Ministry of
Internal Affairs and the "Office for National Security". The
15th 'spy' had not been captured yet.<P>
 
Radovan Jovic was one of the 14 captured. Radovan Jovic had
been captured 20 minutes before the beginning of the press
conference, stated Mr. Smiljan Reljic.<P>
 
Mr. R. Jovic is currently in custody of the Military Court
of Zagreb.<P>
 
<h3>Additional information about Mr. Jovic</h3>
 
Radovan Jovic (17.04.1951) worked as a judge at the
Municipal Court in Glina in the former so-called "Serbian
Republic of Krajina". After the "Maslenica-action" in
January 1993, during which the Croatian army retook a piece
of territory near Zadar, unofficial talks started between
Croatian government and Krajina Serb authority
representatives in Austria. Three of these meetings were
held in Vienna and Graz (twice). UN representatives were
present there as well. Mr. Jovic was one of the negotiators
from the Krajina Serb side. Mr. Jovic promoted a peaceful
resolution of the conflict between both sides. After one of
these meetings in 1994 the Knin authorities dismissed him as
a judge because of his position in the talks.<P>
 
In 1994 he also attended a conference of intellectuals from
Croatia and Serbia organised by the Croatian magazine
"Erasmus". When he returned he found his house in Glina had
been mined. In March 1995 the Krajina Serb army decided to
mobilise him. He refused to go into the army and then he was
sent to prison. After an intervention of the US Ambassador,
Peter Galbraith and other international organisations the
Knin authorities had to set him free. In May 1995 he went on
a study trip to the US (organised by the US Embassy)
together with three Croatian human rights activists and upon
return he decided to go to Belgrade instead of back to
Glina. In Belgrade he now is a member of the Serbian
Helsinki Committee.<P>
 
(PS Two local human rights activists seem to think he might
be a 'double' spy. No further info about this so far)<P>

Dear friends,<P>
you all know what happened on the way back from Tuzla. Mr.
Radovan  Jovic, one of the participants from Serbia was
arrested, and  moreover, the treatement that all the
participants from Serbia and Montenegro received was harsh
and rude. We are therefore doing everything possible to
protest against this to the Croatian authorities. The
American, the Dutch, the Swedish and the German Embassies in
Zagreb are exercising strong pressure abouth the case.<P>
 
Probably Mient Jan and Gert Weisskirchen are going to Zagreb
soon, to talk to different people and try to visit Mr. Jovic
in prison. It would be very good if you also do something in
your country. Some hCa committees are already organizing
press-conferences and some are mobilizing their governments
to put pressure on the Croation authorities. Attached to
this is the protest letter we sent to Mr. Granic, Minister
of Foreign Affairs of Croatia. You can also use it. If you
want to have more information about the arrests and about
Mr.
Jovic, please contact us as soon as possible.<P>

<h3>LONG JOURNEY FROM TUZLA</h3>
 
Dear friends,<P>
 
This letter is to inform you about experience of the group
of participants of t
he IV Annual  Assembly of the hCa from Serbia and Montenegro
on their way back from Tuzla. As you know, two buses with
almost half of the participants from Serbia and Mon
tenegro stayed in Metkovic for 9 and half hours waiting for
clearance of visas for their fellow-participants from the
former Soviet Union. During that time the group was not let
out of the buses save when the toilet was needed. The food
provided as lunch packages
in Tuzla was not sufficient, nor water was provided during
that time. After 3 a.m., when
 Ms. Mary Kaldor and Mr. Mint Jan Faber came back to
Metkovic, the group was allowed to enter  Croatia.<P>
 
The group reached Tucepi at 4:30 a.m. and had to live the
hotel "Alga" at noon.
 However, sometime between 8:30 and 11:15 a.m. our colleague
and fellow-participant  Mr. Radovan Jovic, an ex-judge from
Glina, was arrested in his room (no. 333) where due to the
blockage of the spine he was lying in the bad. He was
arrested by 4 persons in
civil suits and taken by the ambulance followed by a regular
police car with two uniformed
police officers. Few minutes after, 4 undercover agents from
the room and 2 more left
the parking lot in front of the hotel. We were informed that
he was to be taken to
the hospital for the first medical aid and then to be
interrogated. Our request that our law
yer, Mr. Nikola Barovic, and our physicist, Dr. Dragoslav
Pavlovic, accompany him was denied. Let us add, that police
has checked  Mr. Jovic identity in Metkovic - his passport
was the only one that was returned with the delay and with
request from the police officer to see his face.<P>
 
We have informed Mr. Peter Galbreit immediately, as well as the ambassadors of Spain, Hungary and Germany, the hCa, the Croatian Helsinki Committee, the Anti-War Campaign (Zagreb), Dalmatian Solidarity Committee (Split), attorneys-at-law, Mr. Srdj Jaksic (Dubrovnik, participant at the Assembly) and Mr. Mirko Francheski (Split), media, and Yugoslav Mission in Zagreb.<P>
 
We left Tucepi after two officers form the Public Security Office, as they introduced themselves, spoke to Nikola Barovic and Vladan Vasilijevic about the arrest of Mr. Jovic at 3:30 p.m. They informed Mr. Barovic and Mr. Vasilijevic that they did not know where Mr. Jovic had been taken to nor by whom. Furthermore, they suggested that the arrest might been undertaken by uncontrolled group, though it was obvious to all people present at the hotel that it was done by the police. That gave room for doubting about the life of Mr. Jovic for it wouldn't be the first time that someone simply disappeared.   ( It was only on October 25, that the secretary from the American Embassy informed us that the Ambassador was informed by the Ministry of Interior of Croatia that Mr. Jovic was in prison in Zagreb. We got this information only when we entered Hungry, at 8 a.m.  )<P>
 
This is a starting point of a long and miserable trip we had through Croatia Lunch packages were not provided for all participants. Water was not provided at all. Nevertheless, stops were not made to enable travelers to continue their journey in dignity. Moreover, even necessary stops were made only twice and along the road, in the bushe. The idea of the police was obviously to keep us away from telephone lines and to get us out of Croatia as soon as possible, though our visa was valid until midnight, October 25, 1995. Even participants who had menaged to extend their visas were asked to leave the territory of Croatia.<P>
 
The group was de facto arrested. Even travelers from Split and Zagreb were not let out of the buses without checking of their identity documents. The trip took longer than necessary, for the police controls were changing almost each 20 kilometers, always with the delay and with counting of the passengers as if we had been let of the busses. Moreover, the behavior of the drivers and representatives of the bus company was outrageous. Besides helping the Croatian police in their endeavor, they asked passengers that were left without water, to pay 1 DEM for coffee and requested from the police to continue the trip even when the police was willing to stop so that they can make it faster to Prag.Needless to say that the only support we had was the support from our coordinator Ms Lidija Grebo, and our colleagues from Split and Zagreb, who went through all this misery with us. Therefore, we accepted information on Ms. Grebo resignation with deepest sorrow.<P>
 
All this that happened during the trip through Croatia did not spoil nice memories we have of Tuzla Assembly and Tuzla itself, but puts people on alert with regard to future similar endeavors. Especially the fact that one of the participants was arrested during that trip.<P>
 
With best wishes for the future work of the hCa,<P>
 
Sincerely yours,<P>

Dear Srdjan, thought it was good to send you this message as
well. Any  suggestions for action? Greetings, dave<P>
 
<h2> O T V O R E N E   O C I</h2>
 
Dear readers,<P>
 
Radovan Jovic was a participant from Belgrade at the 4th
Assembly in Tuzla. Together with many others he arrived late at night/
Tuesday morning, 04.00 at the hotel Alga in Tucepi where all the
participants were supposed to spend the night before travelling further either
to Zagreb, Prague, Budapest or Beograd. The following (Tuesday) morning
the pain in his spine, which he had felt for a few days already, got so
bad that he could hardly move. Friends decided to call an ambulance,
which came immediately to pick him up and bring him to the hospital.<P>
 
Exactly what happened in the meantime is not known, but at
15.00, Tuesday afternoon, during the Croatian radio news it was announced
that 14 Serb spies had been arrested. Radovan Jovic was one of them.<P>
 
At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon (24-10-1995) in
Zagreb Mr. Smiljan Reljic, assistant to the Minister of Internal
Affairs (Ivan Jarnjak) stated that on Monday, 23-10-1995, criminal charges
had been filed against 15 persons on suspicion that they were spies
for the intelligence of the so-called "Serbian Republic of Krajina".
One of the persons had not been arrested yet. Radovan Jovic had been
captured 20 minutes before the beginning of the press conference, stated
Mr. Smiljan Reljic.<P>
 
Radovan Jovic (44) worked as a lawyer in Glina in the former
so-called "Serbian Republic of Krajina". He had some problems with the
local authorities and even was in prison for a month there. Now he
has been arrested and is supposed to be in Split in the Military
Barracks.  According to a Split lawyer he was transported away from a
Split hospital at 12.40 Tuesday afternoon.<P>
 
As Mr. Radovan Jovic was a participant at the hCa conference
in Tuzla and was returning from Tuzla with the hCa bus convoy I thought
it was appropriate to inform you immediately about this event. My
suggestion is that you undertake some action, but of course that is up to
you.<P>
 
I will give you the phone number of Mr. Ivan Jarnjak, Minister of Internal Affairs: 385-1-6122129 and of Mr. Smiljan Reljic, Assistent
to the Minister of Internal Affairs: 385-1-6122111<P>
 
Yours sincerely,<br>
Dave Bekkering<br>
(participant of the 4th hCa conference in Tuzla)<br>

<strong>title=bosnia / serbs return</strong><br> 
<strong>byline=doug roberts</strong><P>

<a NAME="VOA">Groups of Serb men</a> stand along the roadside in the heart of this 
market town, chatting and sipping small glasses of potent plum 
brandy.  For the moment there is little else for them to do and 
most readily acknowledge their feelings of depression at the 
devastation all around them.

Croatian forces stormed into Mrkonjic Grad and surrounding areas 
during the final stages of the Bosnian conflict last autumn -- 
and virtually the entire Serb population fled.  But at the Dayton
peace conference in november, it was agreed this region would 
revert to Serb control.

The croats eventually withdrew, handing over to British troops of
the IFOR peace-keeping force -- but  not  before an orgy of 
looting and burning that rivaled, or even surpassed, the 
devastation wrought in the former Serb districts of Sarajevo. 

Mounds of garbage line the streets outside scorched and 
window-less apartment blocks here.  British officers estimate  
more than half the homes in Mrkonjic Grad were partially or 
totally destroyed -- and the returning Serbs have found almost  
none  of the possessions they left behind when they fled the 
area. 

They began to return early last month -- only a handful at first,
to check on their homes and property.  But during the past few 
weeks the pace of the repatriation has steadily accelerated.  
British commanders estimate about 21-thousand Serbs have returned
to this region so far.  Hundreds are now arriving each day and 
many more are expected as soon as the winter snows melt. 

The United Nations refugee agency and private aid groups are 
providing the returnees with some basic supplies:  plastic 
sheeting, stoves and emergency rations.  But there is  no  
evidence yet of any significant reconstruction efforts -- and it 
is clear the civilian recovery program envisaged in the Dayton 
peace plan is lagging behind schedule.

For the time being, the task of restoring essential services in 
Mrkonjic Grad is largely in the hands of British combat 
engineers.  Water and electricity are now back on -- a field 
hospital was provided for the local population and two of the 
town's bakeries are back in operation. 

The British are being assisted by US army civilian affairs 
experts who are combing the region to assess the damage and 
determine what is needed to restore industrial and agricultural 
production to pre-war levels. 

To some, these operations might seem beyond the scope of IFOR's 
main tasks -- to separate the warring factions, provide security 
and ensure freedom of movement and to oversee the clearance of 
the minefields and the unexploded ordnance that litter the 
countryside.

But the British regional commander, brigadier Richard Dannatt, 
believes efforts to help the civilian population are entirely 
consistent with the broader objectives of the dayton agreement --
to ensure a degree of political, economic and social recovery 
that will make a return to war in bosnia unthinkable.

<h2>Homes and jobs vital for lasting peace in Bosnia</h2><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h3>Robert Fox visits communities shattered by war and desperate for the chance to lead normal lives</h3><p>

 THE meagre fare in the market - a few trays of eggs, bottles of slivovitz, a crate or two of beer - is about the only sign of economic activity in Sipovo.<p>
 The Bosnian mountain village, with its predominantly Serb population of 6,000, was  on the line of advance as Croat and Muslim forces stormed through western Bosnia last September.<p>
 The Serbs fled, abandoned by their army, and, in the ensuing chaos, houses, schools, factories and hospitals were looted and burned.<p>
 Under the Dayton peace accord, the highland towns and villages round Sipovo and Mrkonjic Grad are to be handed back to the Serbs from Croat-Muslim control.<p>
 By next Tuesday, all transfers of territory under Dayton, of which this is by far the largest, have to be complete. From next Wednesday, the Bosnian Serbs will be allowed to station a limited number of army units on this area.<p>
 Since the beginning of February,  British troops of Ifor, the Nato-led peace implementation force, have been helping Serbs get back to their homes. Nearly 20,000 have returned out of a population of nearly 60,000 before war began nearly four years ago.<p>
 Most now face the task of turning this devastated wilderness back into something approaching normality.<p>
 "I really believe we will have peace now - I'll stay," said Nedela Kusman running one of the stalls. "The houses are burned and there is no food and no aid but we'll survive somehow." <p>
<p>
<h4>'I would really like to see the factory start up again as much as anything'</h4><p>
<p>
 Piled beside the houses are rotting clothing and broken furniture - items the looters rejected. Roads, power lines, water supply and telephones are destroyed.<p>
 To rebuild the villages round Sipovo could cost hundreds of millions of dollars, a sum unlikely to be forthcoming from the international community.<p>
 "One gets used to anything, I suppose, and we are trying to sort ourselves out here," said Milana Ilic, who worked as an engineer at the Trico clothes factory, which employed 7,500. Now it is stripped of its fittings, from the textile machinery to the doors and window frames.<p>
 "I would really like to see the factory start up again as much as anything," she said.<p>
 "I am going to stop here, and never move again. We want no more war here, and anyone is free to come back as far as we are concerned, provided they don't have blood on their hands.<p>
 "We just want to live in peace and quiet."<p>
 But she is doubtful about whether Dayton will deliver the peace she wants and is particularly worried about the complicated Bosnia-wide elections planned for later this year.<p>
 "Why are you so obsessed with elections? I don't care a damn who runs the municipality as long as we have enough to feed and clothe ourselves. I didn't vote last time because we've always had our leaders imposed on us, no matter who we vote for. It's a game of chess where the king and queen are pieces very far away."<p>
<p>
<h4>We're sleeping in a garage, and we'll stay on for a bit while we decide whether we can make a go of life here</h4><p>
<p>
 Down the road in the village of Jezero, not a house is inhabited. By the crossroads, scene of one of the key battles in the advance of the Muslims and Croats, every building is without roof, windows or doors. What the artillery and tanks did not destroy, the looters did afterwards.<p>
 The only two people in the place are Nejo and Jelena, a waiter and secretary in pre-war life. "We've just been digging for these potatoes, the only food we've had in the past five days," said Nejo.<p>
 "We hitch-hiked here from a refugee camp in Brcko. We fled just before the attack in September. We brought a little bit of food, but that ran out. We're sleeping in a garage, and we'll stay on for a bit while we decide whether we can make a go of life here, or give up and go away for good."<p>
 It is believed that several thousand Serbs who have returned over the past month have left again because of the lack of any means of support.<p>
 "The main point of effort now for Ifor forces must be the political, social and economic reconstruction of the country," said Brigadier Richard Dannett of the 4th British Armoured Brigade.<p>
 Apart from the problems of resettling Serbs, the brigadier senses rising  tension between the Muslims and Croats. Muslims are being shut out of some areas but in the next month the Muslim farmers will want to be back on their land for the spring sowing.<p>
 "This means we have only three weeks at most to get this sorted out, otherwise we could be in for real trouble," said Brig Dannett.<p>

<TITLE>Interview with General Jovan Divjak</TITLE>

<h1>Excerpts from an interview with General Jovan Divjak, the top Serb officer in the Bosnian Army: (Un)suitable son of the people</h1>

<h3>by Rajko Zivkovic, Oslobodenje-Svijet, Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 2/8/96</h3>

<em>General Jovan Divjak joined the Bosnian Territorial Defense at the beginning of the war.  Today he is the deputy Chief of Staff of the Bosnian Army and one of a few Serb officers in the top ranks of the Army.</em><P>

<strong>What do you think about the present situation?</strong><P>

I don't think that this is a peaceful situation.  This behavior was imposed on Bosniacs, Serbs and Croats by the Europe.  On the other hand, it is obvious that certain things are not functioning.  We have had some incidents on the territory controlled by HVO [Bosnian Croat militia].  Still, the bulk of activity reminds one of peace.  The war has been interrupted, although the fighting readiness remains on the highest level.<P>

<strong>Mostar, like Sarajevo, was supposed to be a center for the reintegration of the common life and the multinational nature of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  What are the biggest obstacles?</strong><p>

The majority of those coming to Bosnia come unprepared.  I say this although I have respect for these people.  They accept jobs which are very risky; they even risk their lives.  Just remember the assassination attempt on [the European Union appointed administrator of Mostar] Kocshnick.  Koschnick, as well as some earlier peace moderators in Bosnia-Hercegovina, has received the informations about the situation in Bosnia from the enemies of this country.  For example, [European Union peace moderator Thorwald] Stoltenberg spent some 12 years in Belgrade, and his informations and knowledge about Bosnia came from the people who later attacked Bosnia-Hercegovina.  Koschnick was frequently updated on the situation by the people close to Zagreb, people whose goal is the division of Bosnia.  It is an illusion to talk about the return of Serbs to the Neretva valley if 200,000 Serbs don't return to Krajina at the same time and Bosniacs and Croats do not return to Banja Luka.  The situation is complicated and a foreigner might have a hard time understanding it.  It is an illusion to expect the return of Serbs to Mostar until Bosniacs begin to return to Foca [a town in eastern Bosnia].<P>

<strong>Do you have reliable data about the number of Serbs living in the four Sarajevo municipalities still under the control of Karadzic's forces: in Ilijas, Ilidza, Vogosca and Hadzici?</strong><P>

The Bosnian Army is not concerned with those questions.  Even the government doesn't have reliable data.  Chris Janowski stated that there are approximately 40,000 Serbs in those municipalities.  Out of curiosity, from conversations with foreign journalists who visited Grbavica, I found out that the original inhabitants comprise only 20 percent of total population in those four municipalities.  The others moved in during the war.  I am confident that the majority of those 20 percent want to stay in their homes.<P>

<strong>What do you think about recent Mr. Izetbegovic's statement that all soldiers should leave the suburbs which are scheduled to come under the Federation control and that only civilians should remain?</strong><P>

According to the Dayton agreement, only civilian authorities can remain. Therefore, all soldiers must be demobilized and remain in the suburbs as civilians.  Of course, the [Federation] authorities must not tolerate anyone who took part in the genocide.  For example, current mayors, Perisic and Prstojevic, shouldn't wait for the Federation authorities, since they incited genocide against Bosniacs and Serbs who remained in Sarajevo.  It is probably unnecessary to keep repeating that anyone not guilty of war crimes should stay.  Karadzic and Krajisnik use in their propaganda only the second part of the sentence.  Of course, if that propaganda is successful, it might provoke an exodus of Serbs from those territories, which will probably prod the Serbs from Sarajevo center to leave as well.  This would turn Sarajevo into an ethnically pure city and that is against my ideals.<P>

<strong>As a soldier and a fighter since the first days of the aggression against Bosnia-Hercegovina, do you think that the goals with which you started the struggle have been fulfilled?</strong><P>

In this moment the most important thing is to preserve, through political means , the multiethnic nature of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  The Bosnian government and the Army were unrealistic, although patriotic, in their feeling that Bosnia would almost immediately be constituted in its internationally recognized borders, on the rivers Drina, Sava and Una. Still, the platform of the Bosnian presidency from 1992 gave an impetus for the preservation of the unitary Bosnia.  Our expectation that the world, Europe and the United States would help in the realization of that idea was at the time unrealistic.  However, Karadzic said in the Bosnian parliament that one people would disappear from these territories.  That people [Bosnian Muslims or Bosniacs], however, has survived.  The war has been interrupted.  Nevertheless, the struggle for the territorial unity of Bosnia continues, this time with political means.<P>

In this moment, Bosnia-Hercegovina is still divided into three entities.  If the Palestinians have fought for 45 years for their freedom and autonomy, if Vietnam  fought for 30 years against the greatest world power, than it makes sense that the people with secular and civic orientation will continue their struggle for Bosnia-Hercegovina in its historical borders.<P>
  

<strong>What do you as the Deputy Chief of Staff think about the fact that,  besides you, there are no Serbs in the Army Staff?  The only Serb in the command of the First Corps, Rajko Mihajlovic, has recently been dismissed.</strong><P>

Since the second year of the war, the Bosnian authorities accepted Karadzic's claim that the common life of Bosniacs and Serbs is impossible.  That influenced the treatment of the Serb Army members.  It should probably be mentioned that, for example, in June, 1992, 18 percent of members of the Army Staff were Croats and 12 percent were Serbs. Today in the Bosnian Army there is one percent of Serbs and one percent of Croats.  I discussed that problem with the Chief of Staff, Delic, and president Izetbegovic.  Unfortunately, I must say that their explanation of a small number of non-Bosniacs in the Army was that other soldiers supposedly don't trust Serb soldiers.<P>

I think that that is not true; during all four years of this war there were no problems between Serb, Croat and Bosniac soldiers on the front.  I witnessed their tolerance, and respect for each other.  However, as soon as you go up the chain of command to commanders of platoons and battalions, a different attitude toward Serb and Croat soldiers is noticeable.<P>

Unfortunately, there was a time when Serb soldiers were not allowed to fight.  They worked on trenches and other engineering jobs.  It was feared that they would be killed from behind.  The situation was most difficult during 1993 and 1994.  I know of cases where Serb unit commanders were dismissed; that shows that Karadzic's methods have been accepted by the Bosnian Army.  Practically that is the same as ethnic cleansing.  I would like to remind you that five months ago Mr. Siber and I, based on Mr. Izetbegovic's request, were put on a list for retirement.  In the present situation, as the Deputy Chief of Staff, I have no authority at all.  I have been offered by president Izetbegovic to retire or go to the embassy in Paris, supposedly because of my knowledge of French; alternatively I was to stay in the Army but on the sidelines.<P>

Representatives of the Serb citizens [living under control of the Muslim-Croat Federation] are not taking part in the present round of negotiations about the future of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  I have to remind that in 1993, my participation in various government and military delegations was questioned by the Serb side; they refused to talk to a man who, according to them, had betrayed the Serb people.  For them, I was a war criminal.  At the time, the Chief of Staff and Prime minister, Mr. Silajdzic, were saying that mine and general Siber's participation in the negotiations was unconditional.  Today, unfortunately, all three delegations discussing the future of Bosnia-Hercegovina are completely ethnically pure.<P>

<strong>It has been said that you are a general for show.  Do you really feel that way?</strong><P>

I've been aware for a long time that there is a bit of truth in every message of this kind.  I said once to a foreign journalist that I felt like a flower arrangement.  Of course someone has to be a flower arrangement too.  But if I'm here only for temporary use, than it is shameful.[General Divjak is often used as a proof of the multiethnic character of the Bosnian Army]<P>

The greatest weakness of my Army Staff is that it has never included me in the decision making process.  It's been said in the General Command that I am one of the best educated and most capable soldiers in the Bosnian Army; unfortunately,  the situation is different in practice. They tell me that I'm a "shop window general," as my friend Duro Kozar wrote in <em>Oslobodenje</em>.  I must say that I enjoy working with people and that I like to be able to offer some assistance. Therefore I do try to solve problems with which people come to me.  Things to do with culture, sport, youngsters, children, orphans, shehid [martyr for faith in Islam] families; I've been preoccupied with problems of this kind in the war.<P>

<strong>Why does the Chief of Staff, general Rasim Delic, exclude you from the decision making process in the Army?  How do you feel as a general who doesn't make decisions about military problems?</strong><P>

It is very unpleasant.  I was even directly offended in certain situations.  I think that, based on my education and experience, I can contribute and help find better solutions.  However, since I am an Army member, my opinion is my personal thing.  Hopefully, the Chief of Staff will realize that he has missed an opportunity he shouldn't have.<P>

My opinion is that there is no confidence in me.  Unfortunately, I have a feeling that someone is asking himself:"Why hasn't he gone to the other side?"  My son has been asked that question as well; he was my escort for a while and this happened when he was arrested and sent to dig trenches.  They swore at his mother and wanted to know why his father was in Sarajevo instead of in Pale [Bosnian Serb unofficial capital].  I think that, even today, some people wonder how come Divjak had enough courage to stay here when he could have finished with a bullet in the back of his head.  I don't think that anyone can give me a reasonable justification regarding why I'm not allowed to carry out the duties for the benefit of Bosnia-Hercegovina.<P>

<strong>Your own Army arrested you on one occasion.  You refused to reveal the real reasons for your arrest.  Is now a good time to talk about this?</strong><P>

I said once that I was arrested.  I was supposed to stay in jail for seven days.  Instead I was imprisoned for 27 days.  There is a document which says that I was allegedly arrested because of collaboration with the Cetniks [nationalist Serbs], weapons trade and so on.  It should be emphasized that I was treated extremely well during the first two days in jail; they detained me in order to protect me but, even in jail, some veteran fighters from the Konjic area were threatening me and accusing me of preventing liberation of Glavaticevo and Bjelimici.<P>

In jail, I was on a hunger strike for 4 days but no one payed attention.  I was interrogated for some 5-6 days.  Then, on the seventh day, they told me that I was free to go, but that I couldn't go back to Sarajevo because I was in danger from Juka [Prazina];  allegedly he wanted to abduct me and keep me as a hostage.<P>

What was my most painful experience from that period?  On 12 or 14 December, 1992, president Izetbegovic visited Neretvica, actually the village of Parsovici near Neretvica, where I was detained; I was told to go to the dining room so that the president could see me.  Naturally, I refused.  If the president didn't find it suitable to visit a man who had risked his life, then I wasn't willing to go out to the dining room and see the president.  Let me remind you that I was near Izetbegovic during the decisive moments in Dobrovoljacka [Volunteer] Street at the beginning of the war.<P>

I asked Izetbegovic on one occasion why he  had not wanted to see me in jail.  He said that he had had unflattering information about me at the time.  And then  he said that I was in jail for only three to four days.  Actually, as I said, I was in jail for 27 days.<P>

Although I was the Deputy Chief of Staff at the time, nobody bothered to organize my transport over the airport runway in an UNPROFOR vehicle [before the completion of a tunnel running under the airport runway, the only connection of Sarajevo with the outside world went over the runway, in full view of Serb snipers].  As all other soldiers and civilians I had to run the full length of the runway.  I later asked Halilovic whether he had doubted in me.  He said he hadn't.  I don't know if he was honest with me.  Later, one of the men who had arrested me boasted that he was behind that.  I have his name as well as the name of a man who told me about that.  But, that will have to wait for another time.<P>

<strong>The founding of a first Serb battalion was announced in Tuzla almost a year ago.  It was even announced that Momcilo Duric was supposed to be the commander of that unit.  However, the battalion has never been formed.  According to some informations, general Muslimovic is responsible for that.  Why wasn't the battalion formed?</strong><P>

Momcilo Duric used to be a battery commander; today he is on a lower position in the Tuzla garrison headquarters.  Bosnia-Hercegovina is a multinational state; therefore it should have a multinational army too.  I've been thinking about what would happen if such a unit were to be sent to the front.  Serb soldiers would fight Serb soldiers on the other side.  I think that the common army of all Bosniacs, Serbs and Croats is a much better solution than the formation of separate national units and armies.<P>

<strong>A number of municipalities in western Bosnia have been thoroughly ethnically cleansed.  Was western Bosnia liberated or was it actually occupied?</strong><P>

As eastern Bosnia was occupied by the army of republic srpska and military units from Serbia and Montenegro, in the same way the "liberation" of municipalities in western Bosnia (which have majority Serb population) is actually an occupation if one has in mind that both the Serbs and Bosniacs cannot return to their homes on that territory.  It was simply occupied by another state.  The Dayton agreement deadline for departure of foreign fighters has expired.  However, some volunteers from FR Yugoslavia are still in Karadzic's army and some Croatian army members have been transferred to HVO.<P>

<strong>Today, on the territory of Bosnia-Hercegovina, there are several armies: the Bosnian Army, HVO, republic srpska army, foreign armies, IFOR...  In that context, what is the future of the Bosnian Army?</strong><P>

The documents from Dayton are one thing and what happens in practice is another.  The Dayton agreement accepts the existence of the Federal Army and republic srpska army.  Therefore , first, it is necessary to establish the Federal Army as a common Army of Croats and Bosniacs; it should also be accepted by other nationalities.  The Bosnian presidency is supposed to be in charge of these two armies but, in practice, they are bound to encounter problems.  I don't expect that a common army will be formed in a near future, simply because the western part of the state is closly entwined with Croatia and the eastern one with Serbia.  Therefore, I don't expect to see a unified army for a long time.<P>

<strong>According to you, who are the greatest criminals on the Bosnian territory?</strong><P>

The basic responsibility for the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina lies on the Army Staff of the former Yugoslav Peoples Army.  It tried to influence the transformation of political relations in Yugoslavia.  That shows that there was a military takeover, although the Army stayed in the background.  Milosevic was the main actor in this coup.  It is a fact that the Yugoslav Army put its potential in the service of the idea of greater Serbia on the line Virovitica-Karlovac-Karlobag [towns in Croatia].  Draskovic and Seselj [Serbian nationalist politicians] also supported this line as a western border of greater Serbia.  They are also responsible in front of their own people in spite of Draskovic's about face during the war.  He supported the idea that Bosniacs and Serbs cannot live together.  His novel "Knife" gave a false picture of interethnic relations in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  As far as Croats are concerned, the main culprit is a man who said in Paris that the Muslim nation is a fabrication of the communist system, and that it was used to disrupt Croat-Serb relations.  Individual war criminals are only exponents of a greater Croatian and greater Serbian policies.  The Hague knows about them.  On the Croatian side, there are Blaskic, Kordic and others.  Of course they are also on the Bosniac side.<P>

The most brutal in all this was Mladic; his orders, like the one from May, 1992, "aim at Velusici (Velesici); there aren't many Serbs there," or the one "shoot in their bodies, blow up their brains," show that he is a monster.  Unfortunately, he wasn't the only one.<P>


<strong>Certain paramilitary formation within the Bosnian Army as well as the extremists in HVO also committed crimes.</strong><P>

Regarding HVO, I am certain that everything was politically organized.  In Hercegovina, HVO committed a crime against people and against history.<P>

<a NAME="paramil">Since no</a> one has been sentenced for war crimes yet, I don't want to brand anyone with that accusation.  I did say that the members of the Bosnian army had also committed crimes.  At the beginning of June, 1992, a five member Ristovic family was killed in Sarajevo.  The Chief of Staff said at the time that the culprits would be found within 24 hours.  He knew who was guilty for that crime six hours later but, unfortunately, he didn't react.  I am sorry that he didn't react appropriately.  That would have helped to maintain the multinational nature of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  Paramilitary formations in Sarajevo used to decide on their own, actually individuals in those units, whether someone was an informant for the Serb side.  The Bosnian Army did everything in its power to prevent vengeance among the soldiers who had lost their loved ones.<P>  

<strong>All top people in the Bosnian Army, General Delic and you personally, as well as president Izetbegovic, knew about what Caco, Celo and other commanders of different paramilitary armies did.  What do you think now about that sort of "tolerance"?</strong><P>

First, I should say that Mr. Pejanovic, the president of the Serb Civic Council and the president of the Commission for protection of the constitutional order also knew about that.  Pejanovic had data about the missing and did nothing about it.  The question is why all those responsible for the destiny of Bosnia-Hercegovina failed to react.  Mr. Miro Lazovic was among those who publicly reacted to the murder of four Croats and a Serb woman in Hrasno.  I am not trying to justify Army's nor president's behavior.  On May 27, 1993, I sent a letter to Mr. president and gave him a detailed description of what was going on with Caco.  He called me and we talked for about ten minutes.  He said that he would take steps to rectify the situation.<P>

The conclusion was that, at that moment, Caco and those like him  weren't dangerous for the president and the Bosnian government.  The moment the president and the government felt endangered they reacted.  On the other hand those units were not paramilitary armies, but legal formations and a part of the Bosnian Army.  The responsibility for their actions falls on the Army Staff and the Presidency.<P>

Discussed in this paper is the nulling performance of a single and 
multiple aperture multiple beam antenna (MBA).  A linearly constrained minimum 
power algorithm incorporating both main beam and 
derivative constraints is formulated 
and simulated. The nulling resolution of the 
multiple aperture MBA is shown to be 
superior to that of the single aperture MBA.  In addition, a method for 
illuminating a region in space with constant gain while simultaneously nulling 
interfering signals within a fractional single element beamwidth of this 
constant gain region is illustrated.   A flat gain pattern 
is achieved by spacing derivative constraints over the spatial region where the 
desired signals are known to be transmitting. 
Derivative constraints are particularly 
useful when the precise directions of arrival for the desired signals are not 
available to the beamformer.

<h1> 'War criminal' is reborn as a peace-maker; </h1>

<strong><em> by Steve Crawshaw</em></strong><P>
<h2>The  Independent , October  7, 1995, Saturday</h2> 
    Belgrade - Night after night he pops up on the television news, sitting in  
his armchair like a monarch on his throne. The voice-over pays tribute to his   
achievements. He gazes with seigneurial tranquillity while his visitors look    
smiling or poker-faced. Nowadays, there are more smiles than there used to be.  
Slobodan Milosevic, who used to be seen as a war criminal, is enjoying his      
rebirth as Balkan peace-maker.<P> 
                                                                                                                                     The Serbian president remains an enigma - just as he has always been.  More remarkably, he remains a winner - just as he has always been, even when he had  
no cards left. <P>                                                                                                                                                
    Following this week's announcement of a 60-day ceasefire, the new, peace-   
loving Mr Milosevic has emerged strengthened, yet again...<P>  
    When I met him in 1992, he seemed astonished that he might be regarded as a 
war criminal. He reacted as if he was hearing this extraordinary suggestion for 
the first time. He very much wanted war criminals to be prosecuted, he said; he 
was in favour of peace. When I asked him why Arkan, an infamous "ethnic         
cleanser", could live in Belgrade without being arrested, Mr Milosevic became   
irritable. That line of questioning was closed.<P> 
    His insistence that his hands were clean was an obvious lie even then - and 
is now acknowledged as such. As another leading "cleanser", Vojislav Seselj,    
pointed out in the BBC's recent Death of Yugoslavia series: "Every time, it was 
President Milosevic who personally asked me to send my forces."<P>
    Mr Milosevic has regularly changed his political clothes. He broke with     
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, last year. As one diplomat suggested:
"He was ready to cash in his chips, when he was ahead. He's much more           
intelligent than Karadzic." <P>   
    For the West, the attraction of the new Mr Milosevic is clear. Here is a    
strongman who was able to deliver on his promise of bringing the Bosnian Serbs  
to the negotiating table - and, still better, could negotiate on their behalf.<P>   
    For the Serbs, the attraction is less obvious. A few years ago, as the      
Yugoslav wars began, Mr Milosevic talked of all Serbs living together in one    
country - which was interpreted as the desire in effect for a Greater Serbia.   
Now, four years on, Serbs indeed look likely to end up living in one country -  
but not where they would like to be. Following the expulsions by Croatian forces
from Krajina, there are almost no Serbs left in an area where Serbs have formed 
the majority for generations.<P>   
    Logically, this catastrophe should mean Mr Milosevic is seen as a loser at  
home. But many people no longer seem to care very much about the Bosnian        
Serbs, or even the Serbs from Krajina. In the words of Vesna Pesic, of the      
opposition Civic Alliance: "A lot of lies are told about 'brother Serbs'. The   
solidarity isn't so great." What people in Serbia care about are the UN         
sanctions and the war.<P>   
    The opposition press vividly depicts the misery of the thousands of Serb    
refugees who have flooded into the Bosnian town of Banja Luka with a few bundles
of possessions. But Serbian television, the main source of news for most, is    
keen to look the other way. The official media trumpet an imminent peace and    
hold out the hope that sanctions may be lifted soon as Mr Milosevic's reward for
delivering a deal. As one critic of the government noted bitterly: "Just wait - 
he'll get the Nobel Peace Prize."<P>   
    Meanwhile, the unsolved problems pile up, with the Western powers holding   
different views as to where the mistakes have been made. British officials      
express unhappiness that Washington, in effect, gave the Croats a green light   
for "ethnic cleansing" in Krajina, in recent months. The Americans argue that   
the British reluctance to go along with tough Nato action may have prevented an 
earlier settlement. London and Washington blame the Germans for forcing the pace
on the recognition of  Croatia,  in 1991. The Germans in turn insist recognition
was needed to prevent more Vukovars, referring to the city that was destroyed by
the Yugoslav army in late 1991... <P>

<h1>Sullen Belgrade maps out its losses </h1>                                    <strong><em> by Steve Crawshaw</em></strong><P>
<h2>The  Independent , October  3, 1995</h2>
BELGRADE: An indignant and fascinated little crowd gathers at the bottom of Terazije  
Street, in the heart of Belgrade. The source of interest: a new map, which was  
originally published with triumphal intentions. "Thank God I'm a Serb," says the
proud inscription. Now, the map is a bitter memorial to defeat.                 
    It was intended to show the extent of Serb conquests in recent years.       
Yellow shows "territory under the control of Serb forces". Given what has       
happened in the past four years, much of the map is printed in yellow.  There is
just a forlorn little strip of green down the middle, for the "territories of   
Muslim-Croat Federation". <P>  
    But then came the humiliation. Pink-striped amendments have been drawn on to
the map, marking areas that Croats and Bosnian-government forces have seized    
Serbs recently. Suddenly there is little reason for Serbs to rejoice.<P>  
    It seems odd that people gather to study the map so intently. Surely Serbs  
must know exactly what they have lost? In reality the official media have been  
reticent. The Bosnia deal reached in New York last week is proclaimed a triumph 
for the policies of President Slobodan Milosevic.  The loss of territories where
Serbs have lived for generations and the expulsion of 200,000 refugees are      
ignored. Thus the maps on Terazije Street provide the first opportunity for many
to examine the grim new reality in detail. <P>    
    "All of this was pure Serb," says one man (with a gesture taking in areas   
where Bosnian Muslims were in the majority until "ethnic cleansers" killed them 
or drove them out of their homes). "And now look. We've lost everything. It's   
genocide, pure genocide."<P> 
    That indignation is typical.  Every Serb can give you a lecture about what Serbs suffered 50 or 500 years ago. People talk, too, about Serbian suffering of
recent months. But the Serbian crimes of the past few years do not exist in most
people's minds. One depressing reason why the outspoken Serbian opposition Vreme
magazine can still be published is that it has such a small readership. Few     
Serbs want to read uncomfortable truths. <P> 
    There are, of course, Serbs who do not seek to use the vile experiences of  
history as a justification for unleashing new nightmares. But such heartening   
free spirits are an endangered minority - as rare as sympathisers of Andrei     
Sakharov in Brezhnev's Soviet Union or genuine haters of Nazism in Germany in   
1945.<P>  
    The Serbs' perception of themselves as eternal victims is another reason why
last week's New York deal has been greeted with little enthusiasm on the streets
of Belgrade. The official media emphasised the deal means Mir (peace) in our time, Mir on the horizon, Mir by Christmas, Mir because of the wise Serbian leader.<P> 
    But many ordinary Serbs remain cautious. They believe, in any case, that the
Western powers are the true warmongers.<P>
    "The war will be over when the Americans want it to be over - not a moment  
earlier," was one typical comment as Richard Holbrooke, the US peace envoy,     
arrived in Belgrade last weekend.<P>  
    The nationalist opposition blames Mr Milosevic for allowing the             
Serb-majority Krajina to fall easily into Croat hands. "That wasn't a military  
victory by the Croats . It was a gift from the Serbian leadership " runs a      
popular argument. But Serbs, more exhausted than enraged, do not seem ready to  
pour on to the streets to protest. A nationalist opposition demonstration - in  
other words, those who regard Mr Milosevic as a sell-out - persuaded 10,000     
people on to the streets, but the protests stopped there.<P>  
    In one respect at least, there is a new half-optimism. Many believe that the
New York deal could lead to the lifting of sanctions, which is all that many    
people care about. If sanctions are lifted, then solidarity with brother Serbs  
in  Croatia  and Bosnia could soon be forgotten, and Mr Milosevic's popularity  
could soar once more.<P>   
    For the moment, however, Serbia remains a country of sullen resentment.     
Savo, one of the men gathered around the map-seller on Terazije, argues that    
Serbs are deeply misunderstood, because of a mixture of foreign ignorance and   
malice. But he acknowledges, too, that the information flow in Serbia is not    
all that it might be. "What do we know? We have no information.  We know        
nothing." Why not? Savo shrugs. "That's just how it is."

<h1>Ethnic cleansing is nothing to do with us, say Serb killers and
civilians alike</h1>
<strong><em> by Steve Crawshaw</em></strong><P>
<h2>The  Independent , October  1, 1995 </h2>

The fat man in the maroon beret, wearing ludicrous camouflage sunglasses and
a permanent pearly grin, gave his name as Joker. The plump skinheads on either  
side of him listened reverently, and occasionally stroked their guns...<P>   
    He was quite a philosopher. His first question was: "Why does the world want
to erase all Serbs?" Then, as a follow-up, he noted that the war had nothing to 
do with conflicts between Serbs, Croats and Muslims, but was all about the      
battle between the Deutschmark and the dollar. Joker also noted: "I'm a         
pacifist. I'd like the war to be finished tomorrow." <P>    
    The circumstances of our conversation cast doubt on this commitment to      
pacifism. Outside the cafe were three black mini- buses, decorated with the     
symbol of a fiery tiger - the same tiger Joker and his young skinheads wore on  
their sleeves. The tiger is the symbol of Arkan, one of Serbia's most notorious 
paramilitary leaders. We were at Arkan's headquarters, in the town of Erdut, in 
what used to be eastern  Croatia,  now run by the Serbs. Just a few hundred     
yards up the road is the local UN headquarters.  But the UN tries to ignore the 
presence of Arkan: he is not a man to be trifled with.<P>  
    Joker said: "I want children to be able to go to school without fear of     
bombs." Then he got on to more familiar ground, when he waxed eloquent on the   
dreadfulness of Muslims. He said: "We're fighting for a little piece of land,   
where we can be Serbs." <P>
    At least, I suggested, Serbs no longer faced the problem of living alongside
Muslims, in areas where Arkan's forces had been. After all, Arkan's forces were 
responsible for some of the most outrageous ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.  Joker  
looked mock-astonished at the suggestion that Arkan's Tigers had made life      
difficult for civilians. He said, with a contradict-me-if-you- dare smile:      
"Their own government decided to move them." <P> 
    In Joker's case, this was a lie. He knew the truth and he was happy to deny 
it. The Muslims' fate - expulsion or death - was indeed just a joke.  But the   
Arkans and Jokers of this world cannot survive in isolation. More unsettling is 
the fact that many ordinary Serbs believe they have been the main victims of    
this war.<P> 
    Two hundred thousand Serbs have been driven out of their homes by recent    
Croat advances. The human suffering has been enormous. Not surprisingly, Serbs  
feel angry at what has happened. But if, while emphasising that you share their 
indignation, you ask about the ethnic cleansing the Serbs were responsible for  
in the past few years, you get a blanket denial.  As one young woman insisted:  
"The Croats and Muslims moved out voluntarily." Unlike Joker, this woman was    
neither cynical, nor murderous. But she, too, was determined to believe in the  
myth of Serbian innocence.<P>
    It is a disturbing phenomenon - as much for liberal Serbs as for the foreign
outsider. In the words of Gordana Igric, Serbian editor of the  independent     
<a HREF="/info/students/marko/bumerang1.html">Alternative Information Network</a>: "It's a gap in the head.  If you believe Serbs 
did nothing wrong, that helps you to survive. If you say the most important     
thing was the Second World War - that means you don't want to see what happened 
yesterday. Some people don't know what happened. Maybe it's like the Germans in 
the Second World War. Maybe it will take 10 years or more for them to see the   
truth." <P>    
    Even in the places where you would expect to find  independent  thought, you
can often be disappointed. Underground, by the film-maker Emir Kusturica, has   
been showing to packed houses in Belgrade. The film, which won the Palme d'Or at
Cannes, is visually striking and full of astonishing and powerful scenes. By the
end, though, you could see why Serbian Television felt able to sponsor the film.
The Yugoslav wars are shown as the result of unpredictable madness. <P>  
    The audience appeared to like the film. But few felt that Serbs carry any   
burden of responsibility for what has happened. Mirjana, a 32-year- old         
architect, was not untypical in believing that the blame lay elsewhere: "I think
the war is just a game, that the big countries are playing with us." <P>
    There is little hint (unlike, say, in Hungarian and Polish films during the 
last years of communism) that politicians might bear partial responsibility for 
the madness that has engulfed the country. That, in turn, points to a crucial   
difference between eastern Europe in the 1980s and Serbian society today.       
Television news in communist eastern Europe told brazen lies, just as Belgrade  
TV news does today. But few in eastern Europe truly believed the communists. The
main brake on dissent was simple fear. <P>   
    In Serbia, by contrast, there is little fear. Secret police do not lurk     
round every corner. Mr Milosevic's grip on the media has created a picture far  
removed from reality - but which many accept as if it were reality.  This       
achievement is even more dangerous, perhaps, than fatman Joker, with his killer 
smile. <P>

<h1>East Slavonia braces for the final battle; While diplomats talk of    
peace, local Serbs expect another all-out war with Zagreb.</h1>
<strong><em> by Steve Crawshaw</em></strong><P>
<h2>The  Independent , September 30, 1995 </h2>
 Driving along a quiet road, near the little town of Erdut, in what the old 
maps show to be  Croatia,  and the new Serbian maps show to be almost-Serbia, we
suddenly seem to hit trouble. Two dozen fighters, wearing the maroon berets of  
one of Serbia's most notorious paramilitary forces, are lying half-hidden in    
ditches and crouching behind houses, pointing their guns at us. We appear to    
have strayed on to a front line.                                                    It soon becomes clear no live rounds will be fired today. This is an exercise. But the shooting may soon be for real, if or when the Croats try to recapture the territory the Serbs took four years ago in autumn 1991...<P> 
                   
    Visiting this area now, while politicians acclaim this week's deal in New   
York, gives a sense of deja vu. When I was here in July 1991, there was no      
mistaking the war that was about to explode. I huddled behind a wall as the next
house was destroyed in a battle in which only one Serb and one Croat died. The  
neighbours were terrified of what would soon engulf them...<P>              
         
    The Serbs seized this territory in autumn 1991 and laid it waste. The Croats
were then in the majority. Now there are almost no Croats left.  Vukovar was    
famously destroyed in a brutal siege. But it was not just Vukovar: the entire   
landscape is still haunted by death. Mortar shells lie embedded in the road;    
weeds grow in the gaping ruins; smashed traffic lights stand twisted and        
useless; children build military shelters, and play at Serb-Croat war.<P>       Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian President, appears punch-drunk with his successes in southern and western  Croatia,  where the Croatian army seized the 
entire region. About 200,000 Serbs were driven out. Eastern Slavonia is next on 
his list...<P>      
        
    Already thousands of Serbian refugees have flooded into this area in recent 
weeks, driven from their homes by the Croat offensive. In Erdut alone, 150      
people queue up every lunchtime for a Red Cross bowl of soup.  Many break down  
in tears when contemplating the possibility that they might be overtaken by war 
again. Dara Krtinic travelled for 27 days with her husband by horse and cart    
before reaching Erdut. "The Croats threw us out. We had two houses, pigs,       
everything. How can we now go back? But how can we stay if they come? And where 
else can we go to?"<P>    
    War in eastern Slavonia is not inevitable. But if the West fails to put     
pressure on Zagreb (as it failed to do over the recent expulsions of Serbs      from their homes in Bosnia), a new war will be a fait accompli.  It will seem as
certain as the war of 1991 seemed more than four years ago, when politicians crowed about peace and distraught villagers waited for war. <P>

<h1>Envoy plays down Bosnia peace hope</h1> 
<strong><em> by Steve Crawshaw</em></strong><P>
<h2>The  Independent , October  2, 1995 </h2>                                                                                                                                                                                         
    Richard Holbrooke, the US peace envoy to Yugoslavia, sought yesterday to    
dampen speculation that peace in Bosnia could be around the corner. After talks 
with President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade, he emphasised that the distances 
to be bridged are still "very large"...<P>                                                                                                                          
    Locals are impressed by his energy, if nothing else: the Belgrade weekly Nin
devoted a column to explaining the history of shatl-diplomatia, "an American    
speciality at times of great urgency". Earlier in the weekend, Mr Holbrooke had 
warned against "premature" talk of a ceasefire. He argued: "This isn't an       
express train, and never was."...<P>
 There are, however, good reasons to take Mr Holbrooke's caution at face     
value. Indeed, it may be understated. Vreme concluded: "It's a very different   
matter, how things will work out in practice. It is unclear whether these       
questions keep the Americans awake at night. To paraphrase Churchill: 'They     
won't have to live in Bosnia after the war.' " ...<P>                                                        
    The New York deal envisages a Bosnia consisting of two equal entities - the 
Muslim-Croat federation on the one hand, and the Republika Srpska on the other. 
Within the Muslim-Croat federation, however, the Croats now offer little loyalty
to a Bosnian government and look almost entirely to Zagreb.                     
                                                                                
    The Bosnian Croats have Croat currency, a Croat army, and the Croat flag.   
Mr Tudjman has never hidden his desire to carve up Bosnia; recently he noted    
that Zagreb accepted the federation only "for strategic reasons".  President    
Tudjman has talked too, in an interview with Le Figaro, of the need to          
"Europeanise Bosnian Muslims so that they can be integrated in European         
civilisation" - this from a man who allows  <a NAME="fascists">fascists</a>  to run riot and who has given his blessing to "ethnic cleansing" in recent weeks.  If the Croats do not 
sabotage their federation with the Muslims, it will be a miracle.               
                                                                                
    On the Serbian side, things look equally bleak. The very name of the Serbian
part of Bosnia shows how bizarre things have become. There will be two adjoining
republics: the Republika Srpska, or Serbian Republic (in Bosnia), and the       
Republika Srbija, or Republic of Serbia. Western journalists use the original   
Srpska title for Radovan Karadzic's fiefdom and the English word Serbia for Mr  
Milosevic's country in a desperate attempt to help the reader. But the reality  
is that the two names are separated only by a frightening piece of syntax. It   
seems likely that the adjectival Srpska Republic will in due course seek to     
merge with the big-brother Srbija.                                              
                                                                                
    Vetoes are built into the New York deal to prevent such secession, which    
brings us back to where we were in spring 1992, before the war broke out.  The  
Croat-Muslim majority, unwilling to let Bosnia come under the thumb of Mr       
Milosevic, voted for the independence of a multi-ethnic Bosnia; the well-armed  
Bosnian Serbs wanted to break away, to be with Serbia.                          
                                                                                
    A few years ago, the incongruity of the present deal might not have         
mattered.  "Bosnian" was a real concept for most Yugoslavs - as easy to grasp as
"American", when talking about ethnic Italians, Irish or Poles. Bosnian Serbs                                                                                 were as conscious of their "Bosnian" identity as they were of their Serb        
identity. That is long gone. For the deal to work out, tolerance on all sides is
needed. But the politicians - Messrs Milosevic, Karadzic, Tudjman - have        
destroyed the possibility of tolerance in the past three years.

<h1>Excerpts from: Croatia in the British Media, Part 5</h1>

<strong><em>by  Tom Frankovich</em></strong><P>

<h2> Hrvatski Obzor, Zagreb, Croatia, 10/16 1995</h2>

Chris Gunness is one of the U.N. officials most active in the attacks on Croatia.  Even a superficial observer can spot the significant difference in Gunness' attitude with respect to the operations of the Croatian army and to that of the Bosnian Serbs.  While during the operations "Flash" and "Storm" this U.N. spokesman was very active and harsh in his criticism of the Croatian authorities, during the Serb aggression on Zepa and Srebrenica he was hardly audible, and when he appeared in the media he was extremely mild with respect to the Serbs as can be seen from the following example.  On 7/12, Gunness stated the following for the BBC: "We don't have any reports that some people were taken.  The Serbs simply told us that they would check all captives and take out the suspected Bosnian Army members."  Similar statements by Chris Gunness are totally opposite to what he had said during the Croatian operation "Flash", when he fiercely accused the Croatian authorities of "violating the human rights of the people" by "forcing the military age man to stand in a line during the night," and because those men were later taken to collection centers.  Furthermore, his criticism of the Croatian authorities are often simply slanders, which are never backed up by firm evidence.<P>

The comparison of the TV material shot during the Serb aggression on Srebrenica and Zepa and during the operations of the Croatian Army which led to the liberation of the so-called krajina is interesting and telling.  While during the mass escape of the expelled people from Zepa and Srebrenica, the scenes shown of the TV screens in Britain were biblical scenes of a huge mass of desperate people (there were even a few shots of collection centers taken from a plane), during the escape of the Serbs from the so-called krajina, although the reports kept talking about more than 100,000 of people, the refugees were systematically shown close up, so that one could see about 10 vehicles at most.  The cameras were, of course, aimed mostly at the elderly and the pregnant women or the women with small children.  Never on the armed men which were withdrawing with them. Another interesting fact was that the news about the "fall" of Zepa were carried by the BBC two days before the actual fall of the town, and in spite of the denial by the Bosnian government, while the news about the military successes of the Croats and Bosniaks are broadcast with a delay of a day or two and some totally ignored.  For example, on June 13, a commercial TV station Channel 4, broadcast in its main news programme a report about the Croatian-Bosniak successes in capture of Jajce, Donji Vakuf and Drvar, while the BBC didn't even mention this news.<P>

Certainly, we should mention the series of articles by <a HREF="/info/students/marko/ref2.html#indep1">Robert Fisk</a>, published in <em>the Independent</em>, as weel as the articles of a former central European editor of that paper, now the correspondent from Bonn, <a HREF="/home/marko/public_html/craw.html">Steve Crawshaw</a>.  While Fisk, in a series of anti-Croatian articles regarding the operation "Storm", sent one of his articles, as was stated in the paper, from <a HREF="/home/marko/public_html/fisk1.html">"Lipovac, Serbia",</a> Crashaw called the Croatian liberation of the so-called krajina, "the rampage of Croatian <a HREF="/home/marko/public_html/craw.html#fascists">fascist</a>" and "ethnic cleansing"; he also accused president Tudman of spreading the ethnic hatred.  This is not surprising if one knows that Crawshaw has shown obvious enmity towards the Croatian president and that during the time when he had been the Eastern European editor in <em>the Independent</em> the critics of independent Croatia (Lovric and <a HREF="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/pmc/issue.595/review-1.595.html">Ugresic</a>) received the largest amount of space in that paper, unlike those who did not share that sort of opinion.<P>

In conclusion, let us mention that several recognizable aspects can be discerned in the reporting of the British media about Croatia and Croatians.  These are the political, historical, information-selective, and interpretational-linguistic aspects.<P>

The political aspect comes out of the official position of the British government which at times spills over into the media, either through 
informational briefings of foreign desk editors in the ministries of defense and foreign affairs, or through direct reactions of certain government officials in the press and their appearances on the Radio and TV.  The fundamental characteristics of this aspect are the claims that the main "culprit" in the breakup of Yugoslavia is Croatian secessionism, that the war in the former Yugoslavia is a "civil" war and not an expansionist war, that president Tudman's intention from the beginning of the war was to, in agreement with Milosevic, "divide" Bosnia, and the so-called "neutral" approach to the events in the Balkans.  The last characteristic is especially interesting.  Dating from Carrington's "neutral approach" to the so-called "warring parties", that diplomatic joke has been in the journalistic sphere totally perverted and taken to its absurd conclusion.  In this context, in stead of standing for objective reporting and siding with the truth, "neutrality" was distorted and for the majority of British journalists it stands for , above all, siding with one side for a while and than with the other.<P>

The historical aspect is visible in the invocation of Ustashe movement and the crimes against the Croatian Serbs in the WWII.  In that, British journalists use the data obtained directly from the Serbian propaganda.  For example, they persistently write about hundreds of thousands of victims at Jasenovac, while it is claimed that the checkerboard [Croatian coat of arms, also used by Croatian fascists during the WWII] and the Croatian currency are Ustashe [Croatian fascists] symbols.  The purpose of all this is to justify so called "legitimate fear" of the Serbs and their rebellion against the Croatian authorities.<P>  

The information-selective aspect is determined by the fact that at the beginning of "the yugoslav crisis" almost all correspondents were based in Belgrade.  However, even later, after some of them finally moved to Zagreb, they would continue to very rarely use the statements of the Croatian officials or use the official Croatian media sources.  Those who represent minority opinions (Puhovski, Lovric, Drakulic, Ugresic) and naturally, the representatives of the rebel Serbs, are significantly overrepresented in reporting and articles from Croatia.  In the later phases of the wars, this aspect can be seen in the selection of the reported news.  For example, earlier mentioned Serb claims about the "fall" of Zepa and Srebrenica and the delay or skipping of the news about the military success of the Croatian-Bosniak forces.  Besides, some news are recycled and repeated for a few days (incident in Stupni Dol [where allegedly Ivica Rajic, one of the men indicted by the tribunal in the Hague, led a Croatian militia unit in an attack in which 12 civilians were killed]).<P>

The interpretational-linguistic aspect in the most pronounced in the BBC news but can be also found in other media outlets.  The BBC thus, when Serbs are in question, consistently try to avoid the direct naming of the side responsible for a bombardment or an attack.  For example, they often use formulations of this sort: "Today, the Croatian capital, Zagreb, has been the victim of a rocket attack," or "Three persons died today in the center of Sarajevo as a consequence of an artillery attack," or "There has been fighting today near Velika Kladusa in western Bosnia."  Although in all three cases, the identity of attackers was well known they are deliberately not mentioned.  We mentioned earlier the case of the banishment of Croats from Fojnica, when they became unidentified "people" in a report.  More recently, reporters wrote that "Croatian forces claim that they have captured Jajce."<P>

The word "claim" implies the doubtful nature of a news item.  In parallel, in the same article, we can find that "the Serb report to the UNHCR states that between 45,000 and 50,000 people were evacuated or are fleeing toward Banja Luka.  The word "state" is neutral and does not question the truthfulness of a stated claim.<P>

All these aspects point out that one of the goals of such media approach to the wars in Southeastern Europe is definitely to spread the blame equally between the Serbs and Croats, to remove the distinction between a victim and an aggressor.  Once these distinctions are removed, both the war and with it all the crimes committed by the aggressor become more abstract and, as <em>Times'</em> diplomatic correspondent Eve-Ann Prentice said, "all sides become the victims of the war."  Thus, the goal is to transform the expansionist wars of the Serbs against the other Yugoslav peoples into some sort of a natural catastrophe for which no one is responsible, as if it were a flood or an earthquake.<P>

Without a doubt, that is the forging of history and avoidance of the truth.<P>

<h1> Krajina's survivors stagger back 'home'</h1>                                 <strong><em>by ROBERT FISK</em></strong><P>
<h2> The  Independent,  September  18, 1995, Monday </h2>                                                                                                                                     
    Many of them had to be carried on to the buses, clinging on to their        
crutches, their shawls, their pathetic plastic bags. We quickly lost count of   
the old women among the 1,340 Serbs from Krajina, weeping - most of them - or   
coughing in the near-freezing breeze that swept down from the plains of         
Vojvodina. One mumbled about murder, of a neighbour bayoneted on a tractor, of  
six others gunned down by a Croatian soldier wearing a black headband on a      
mountain road. One old woman, bent almost double, was so confused she could not 
even remember the name of the home village she had left less than two weeks ago.<P>     
    So the last of the Serbs of Krajina - almost the final survivors - came     
''home'' to Serbia this weekend, the Croatian ''cleansing'' of the old frontier 
land accompanied, as usual, by the humanitarian assistance of the United        
Nations. Back in Knin the Croats had demanded that the UN hand over 34 of the   
refugees under their protection as ''war criminals'' and then added another six 
names - including that of a woman -for good measure at the 11th hour. The UN let
them be taken away before the Croats escorted the convoy out of the land in     
which Serbs have lived for generations.<P>                                            
    Some of the Serbs were met by relatives from Novi Sad or Belgrade but many  
of the old had nowhere to go but the bleak ''reception centres'' on the road to 
Hungary. ''They will not live long now they have left their homes,'' a Serb     
nurse said with academic detachment. <P>                                                    
    ''In circumstances like these and without family, old people are finished.  
But what are we going to do with the new refugees that will come from Serbian   
Bosnia? How are we going to house the thousands who have now fled Jajce, Sanski 
Most and Kljuc? What if Banja Luka falls?''<P>                                                                                                                    
    It was not a question that bore much thinking about on the cold road outside
 Lipovac,  where the ''milicija'' arc-lights lit up the swaying, wintry trees   
beside Tito's old ''Highway of Brotherhood and Unity''. If it took five hours to
process just over a thousand refugees from Krajina, how long would it take to   
absorb a quarter of a million or more from Bosnia, far greater even than the    
original Krajina exodus last month? Would a world grown weary of Serb atrocities
find any compassion for the next forced emigration of hungry Serb civilians? <P>              
    The stories of the men and women who had finally left their homes in the    
mountain villages were no less fearful for being familiar. There was 42-year-old
Marija Grujo from Radje, for instance, who did not want to leave her ancestral  
home even after the Croats had conquered the preposterous army of the ''Serb    
Krajina Republic''. <P>                                                                    
    ''We decided to leave on the Sunday after the war,'' she said. ''I was with 
my neighbour and her husband on our tractor, and another neighbour, Bojan Milos,
was the driver. We took bedding and food for the babies and set off with other  
families. Then on a winding hill road, our convoy of tractors was stopped by    
four men, two in Croatian uniform and two armed civilians.''<P>                            
    Marija Grujo was too tired to show emotion as she described what happened   
next: ''One of the soldiers wore a black headband. He looked at Bojan Milos
and attacked him with a bayonet. He pushed it into Bojan's stomach and tore at  
him. Bojan just fell back, groaning. The soldier stole his watch and then       
started shooting at the other people on the tractors. He killed six of them.    
Then they made us get off the tractors and walk. We were handed over to other   
men who took us to Zadar on the Croatian coast ." <P>                                       
    At least 250 other Serbs had been held in Zadar, most of them having        
believed the Croatian President Franjo Tudjman's original claim that they could 
stay in their homes - until Croat troops burned the surrounding villages and    
ordered them out. Jovo and Zorka Obradovic stayed for two weeks in Dabasic after
the arrival of Croat troops. Only when they burned his own home, Jovo Obradovic 
said, did he tell a Croatian officer that ''Tudjman is a liar.'' He was arrested
along with his wife, taken to Zadar and put on the weekend convoy to Serbia.<P>        
    According to UN officials, there were heartrending scenes when the 40       
accused of ''war crimes'' by the Croats were taken from the UN compound in Knin 
- the deal under which the remaining refugees could leave for Serbia. <P>           
    UN officers followed the Croat buses that took the prisoners to Zadar; their
families were allowed to go to Zadar but not to live with them there.  Smilja   
Erakovic, the 35-year-old wife of the local Serb military commander at Svilaj - 
already a prisoner - was handed over to the Croats. Her two young children                                                                                  were, apparently with her permission, put on the UN buses to Serbia, alone.<P>     
    Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy, had solemnly agreed that the Croats   
must level serious criminal charges before the UN handed over their Serbs to    
Croat ''justice'', but the Croats broke the agreement, at one point branding a  
man of 82 and two children as ''war criminals'' along with a woman they had     
wrongly identified as Mr Erakovic's wife.<P>

<h1>Who Slaughters Over There</h1>

<strong><em>by Ada Mandic</em></strong><P>

<h2>ARKzin, Zagreb, Croatia, March 15 1996</h2>

(...)Two years ago, it wasn't pleasant to walk around Germany as a Serb; recently the same fate 
has befallen the rest of us.  How come we are suddenly hearing about
"Croatian nationalists"?  Of course, Croats haven't always been celebrated in
the German media for their democratic behavior, but the main news programs
of the German television, as if they were consulting Croatian television, never made
a mistake of confusing "the victim and the aggressor".  When the "Croatia
at home and abroad" was, with all available means, struggling for the recognition 
of an independent state, it was never said that this was the desire of 
"kroatischen Nationalisten" but of generic "Kroaten"...  Of course, this
formulation was aided by the results of a referendum (in which, by the way,
no one asked Croatian citizens whether they supported war and ethnic cleansing,
but whether they were for Milosevic's Yugoslavia or democratic Croatia in which
all citizens would have equal rights), so why don't we organize a referendum 
in western Mostar and find out who the nationalists are and how many of them are
there.<P>

The fact that dismissals from work, evictions from apartments and other
methods of pressure and so called soft ethnic cleansing in Croatia never
found space in official German news programs during the war and horrible
massacres in Bosnia isn't surprising; however, even the pictures of the Serb
exodus from Krajina were not sufficient to call the gathered Croat citizens
, who were seeing off the refugees with curses and gloating, "nationalists"; the majority of commentators emphasized that, well, the poor Serbs were getting 
back what they had dished out to others, that they were being expelled because 
they had expelled others; the end of the sentence, "it serves them well" could
have been surmised by any viewer.  Croats earned the horrible offense, that they are "nationalists"
(there is no German who can find in that word anything positive) and on top of
that "incited" (by the west Mostar mayor), only after they thoroughly shook up   
Koschnick's [former European Union administrator of Mostar, from Germany] car!
I suppose that that expression among other emphasizes that the hateful faces
of our compatriots shown in close up during the blockade of Koschnick's limousine
and threatening howls do not represent the whole Croatian nation but only those
mischievous "kroatische Nationalisten" who were not really serious because they
had been incited by sly politicians.<P>

<h2>Why I Abducted Koschnick</h2>

I know that I should be grateful to German television for an attempt to differentiate
, but since I've heard these years enough praises from my German friends for
belonging to a small, courageous nation who is tenaciously defending against 
the more numerous and better armed enemy (hmm, where have I heard this before?),
and that that approach was unquestionable regardless of what I said or thought, I am
aware that the Germans, from now on, will blame me for abducting <strong>Koschnick</strong>
the same way they used to congratulate me the signing of the Dayton Agreement.

According to the local criteria, we are not nationalists as long as we are fighting
the Serbs and, regardless of what we do, we can never get sufficient revenge for
all the evil they had inflicted on us (German and Croatian official version
are the same up to this point, although the German version is somewhat convoluted
and interspersed with various warnings against human rights violations which
no one takes seriously anyway).  When we are fighting Muslims, we are "small"
nationalists because we are endangering the federation founded to be a "counterweight
to Serbs", as one of the commentators on the local television clearly explained;
however, only when confront <strong>Koschnick</strong>, that is Germans, we
definitively prove our nationalism.<P>

Of course, those who call <strong>Koschnick's</strong> abductors nationalists are
right, but in this case they are more than late.  Why is it easy to recognize
Croatian nationalism in 1996 but it wasn't visible in 1991 when it was much 
more obvious and louder than today?  Croats, actually "kroatische Nationalisten",
are only consistently continuing the same policy which has been conducted
since the first democratic elections (in which those nationalists gained the right
to represent us other Croats), and that is the formation of an ethnically
cleansed state.  Croats who are shaking Koschnick's limousine and appear through
the revealing eye of an camera as terrible, bloodthirsty butchers, are not any
more civilized nor worse than those who gathered at the start of the nineties
at "mass rallies" of certain Croatian parties at which one could hear the worst
nationalist slogans.  Of course, that national euphoria was shown from "birds eye
view", from which enormous masses of patriots waving flags do appear magnificent;
in close up those masses, unfortunately, did not look any more "lyrical" than
those who assaulted Mostar administrator.  We shall see whether German "late
awakening" (if indeed that is what we are talking about) is better than nothing;
we also need to find out whether the citizens of Mostar were indeed incited or not.
If they were, then we will hear from Germans how "politicians are inciting people"
and how <strong>Koschnick</strong> as recently as yesterday "drank coffee" with
Croats, only to have them try to kill him the next day.<P>

<h1> Are There Any Pressures on Citizens of Serb Nationality?</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Sinan Alic<br>  Front Slobode, 8/15/95, Tuzla, Bosnia-Hercegovina</i></h2><p>


<hr>
<h2)Silence is a Sign of Approval</h2><p>

The words of the Bosnian Army commander, General Rasim Delic, said in the Parliament, were encouraging; he announced an inspection of the troops of the 28th division, which was performed soon after;  he also talked about the Army measures against anarchy in the ranks.  For the uninformed, the troops mentioned in Gen. Delic's speech were the members of the Bosnian army who fought their way through the Bosnian Serb lines after the fall of Srebrenica; they were mostly transferred to the administrative territory of the Tuzla-Podrinje canton.<p>

However, in the period between the inspection, i.e. the total control of the troops which came from the surrounded Srebrenica, we encountered armed groups who roamed through the counties and municipalities in the Tuzla-Podrinje canton, solving their accommodation problem by force of arms.  On the receiving end was mostly the population of Serb nationality.  One person was murdered and frightened people found shelter with their neighbors, Muslims and Croats.<p> 

<h2>Why Silence?</h2><p>

Although we are yet to be given official data or hear a beginning of a discussion of this problem, we must ask a question: wasn't it possible to predict the behavior of the people coming out of a several year long siege?<p>

The silence of all political parties is typical; the cases we encountered in the recent past announce that retribution as a form of deviant behavior is knocking on our door.  If it enters, no-one will be happier than the shepherd from Savnik [Karadzic] and the mad General from Kalinovik [Mladic].<p>

We should raise this topic publicly, not to hide the unbelievable tragedy of Srebrenica, and then of Zepa, but to keep a legal and lawful state organization and avoid a trap: to respond to crimes with equal measure.<p>

<h2>Beaten up and Paralyzed Women</h2><p>

According to the reports - true still not complete - at disposal of the Serb Citizen Council [SGV- Srpsko Gradansko Vijece] of the Tuzla-Podrinje canton, more than 100 cases of violent assaults on the property of the citizens of Serb nationality and the citizens themselves have been registered so far.  besides one murder in the presence of three Policemen from Srebrenik in the village of Jasenica, tens of citizens were beaten up.  A majority of incidents occured on the territory of the Tuzla municipality in the villages of Simin Han, Crno Blato, Srednja Dragunja...<p>

The facts are merciless and we must not close our eyes in front of them: Vidosava Polemis was beaten up, thrown out of her house and the house looted.  Luka Polemis, Mila Pantic, Mirko Lazic, Bozidar Pantic and Drago Rajic shared her destiny, the difference being that their houses were also demolished.  While this happened in Simin Han, the same scenario was repeated in the village of Srednja Dragunja: Bozica and Mico Miljic, Jovo and Mitra Miljic, Mara and Ilija Maksimovic, Gospava, Petra and Vasilije Vasiljevic were beaten up and forcibly expelled from their houses.<p>

Among the families thrown out of their houses is a Croat family.  Out of three beaten women, 2 remain paralyzed; an attempt to set a Serb house on fire has also  been recorded, while a Croat house was torched.<p>

<h2>Who is Alija Konjanik [Horseman]?</h2><p>

The village of Crno Blato is a special story.  Pressures on the local Serb population here date from the beginning of the aggression of Bosnia-Hercegovina and the arrival of first refugees.  The most aggressive of them is a certain Alija, known better as Konjanik [Horseman], a refugee from the village of Sapna, near Zvornik [town in eastern Bosnia].  After the arrival of the latest refugee wave from Srebrenica, eleven forced expulsions and one robbery were recorded in Crno Blato.  One wonders if that would have been the end of it if the police had not intervened on time.<p>

In the middle of July it was especially tense in the territory of the Srebreni county, about 40 km from Tuzla, in boroughs of Jasenica, Tinja and Spionica.  Chaos was spreading progressively.  Refugees who moved to this territory in 1992 and 1993 were guiding the new arrivals, directing them to the Serb farms and houses.  Mistreatment and expulsions from houses were registered in seventeen cases (that many were reported to the Serb Citizen Council).  Terrified by the assault of armed men who were out of control, the inhabitants of these villages found shelter with their friends in the cities of Tuzla, Lukavac and Mramor.<p>

The territory of the Zivinice county also had its share of dangerous events.  In the village of Vrhojevici, ten families were forced out of their houses in the period between 19 and 21 July and eight of them were robbed; the attackers usually demanded money.  Similar events took place in the villages of Dunjevici, Podgajevi and in Zivinice itself, 23 cases in total.<p>

<h2>Culprits in Uniform</h2><p>

It is interesting that, although determined to protect law and order in this country, the mayor of Zivinice did not succeed in that.  He was helpless in his attempts to return people into their homes, only because the culprits were the members of the Bosnian army.  The culprits were the soldiers of the 28th Division whose inspection had been announced and then performed by Army General Rasim Delic.  We should expect that we'll find the culprits in another line-up, in front of the face of justice.  Of course, every generalization is dangerous.  They know that in Zivinice, where they emphasized that there had been no problems with the unit whose commander was Zulfo Pusilovic; however, they openly said that one of the culprits and the leader in forced expulsions of the citizens of Serb nationality was a well known boxer Kabasi, also a member of the Bosnian army.<p>

Because of all that, the inspection of the 28th division is an encouraging event.  Although we were attacked and some of our compatriots were exposed to beastly torture, a law and order must rule in the state of Bosnia-Hercegovina.<p>

Especially in its Army.<p>

<h1>Virtuous Muslim State</h1>

<strong><em>by Adnan Jahic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Front Slobode, Tuzla, Bosnia-Hercegovina, August 23, 1996</h2>

Quite often in contacts with my acquaintances and friends people ask
whether I think that war will end soon.  Since I am not a fortune-teller, 
nor I have extra-sensory powers, I always respond that I don't know.
At first glance, it might seem that this is an ordinary daily political
question.  Is that so?  Let us ask ourselves why an average Tuzlak 
[inhabitant of Tuzla, city in north-eastern Bosnia] asks this question.
Maybe because of his concern and sympathy for our victimized and hungry
brothers in Mostar, Maglaj, Srebrenica, Gorazde and Sarajevo, or because
of his worry that he will go hungry tomorrow, or that the price of
cigarettes will again jump to DM 15 per pack, or because of daily problems
with water and electricity and supplies.  Of course the latter is behind
his question.  Hence, I never fail to add a short appendix to this two
sentence verbal exchange: the essential question for a Tuzlak today is not when
the war will end, but how will we, Bosnian Muslims, act in the political
and moral sense after the war, when we are left alone in our own state.
Besides, compared with the inhabitants of Sarajevo, Mostar, Srebrenica 
and Maglaj, Tuzlak doesn't even have the right to ask when the war will end;
we never had a war, in its classic destructive and murderous dimensions,
 in this region.  Therefore, if we are a nation and if we intend to 
 demonstrate satisfactory degree of national solidarity and concern, let us
 come to our senses and recognize that it is extremely base and morbid,
while our brothers and compatriots in mud and on the hills are defending
our peace and well being, to think about ourselves, our material position,
to whine and point our finger at the fictive problems of internal nationalism,
fundamentalism, strengthening of "anti-alcoholic", "anti-debauchery" and other
anti tendencies, to lament about the alleged de-urbanization of the city etc.,
and all that as a substitute for our own passivity and national inactivity.
It is clear that in this war participation in history, the Truth and Justice
belong only to those who fight for the survival and long term goals of the
Muslim people; everything else, all supranational, quasi-liberal and pseudo-
civilized ephemeral phenomena, from the Bloch's point of view, are simply the
surrogates of the history, uncaring quasi-creatures, unavoidable observers of
the human reality and nothing else.  However, from the political point of view,
the aforementioned "forces" have been significant since the beginning of the war
against Bosnia and its bosnianmuslim people only in their opposition to the total
and consistent nationalization of Muslims and the establishment of the 
bosnianmuslim state territory based on the true Islamic ethical and civilizational 
values.  Ever since the possibility that Muslims could after the war obtain
their own nation state has begun to be mentioned in the public, the supporters
of those forces have had only one ghoulish thought in their heads: that in
that state someone could in the future force them into a mosque, forbid debauchery
and lewdness, ban alcohol, lock up pornography etc.  In their consistent support
of this stomach-libidinous philosophy all secular minds are loudly proclaiming
that they do not want to live in dictatorship, together with "green-minded
fascist regime" (as if they themselves were not servile poltroons and the objects
deprived of any human dignity in the former "red-minded" regime), that they
want freedom, Europe, prosperity etc., etc.  Putting aside the fact that their
liberal-pro-Europe propaganda, even a small child understands that, is only a 
disguised substitute for their philosophy of unrestrained and unsatiable
satisfaction of their urges and appetites, only a make up with which they
hide their shame because they are Muslims, there is something much more 
important and dangerous for us, highly aware Bosnian Muslims.  They are trying
to convince us that there is a state without an ideology, which does not posses
a list of state-national and social priorities and values.<P>

I will try to express the essence of this article through the following points:<P>

<ol>
<li>The territory controlled by the Bosnian Army after the war will be a <strong>
Muslim state</strong>
  <ul>
  <li>This is a desire of the Muslim people and, after all, our leaders: secular 
  leader Alija Izetbegovic and religious leader Mustafa Ceric (the latter one in a 
  private conversation with me confirmed that the old dream of Alija Izetbegovic, 
  member of the organization Young Muslims, has been and remains the establishment
  of the Muslim state in Bosnia-Hercegovina;  finally, his dream is close to realization
  and "he is not terribly upset because of that").
  </ul>
<li> <strong>The Muslim state</strong> will be the national state of Bosniaks,
or Muslims, while all other ethnic groups will have all civic rights which belong to
ethnic minorities according to international conventions.
<li><strong>The Muslim state</strong> will have a <strong>Muslim ideology</strong>,
based on Islam, Islamic religious, legal, ethical and social principles, but
also on the contents of Western origin which do not contradict Islamic principles.
<li> <strong>The Muslim ideology</strong> will be the basis for the complete
state and legal system of the future <strong>Muslim state</strong>, from
the state and national symbols, over the ruling national policy, to educational
system, social and economic institutions, and of course, the Muslim family as 
the unit on which the whole state is based.
<li>All citizens will be guaranteed equality before the law, while 
the level of personal prosperity, besides personal initiative, will especially
depend on the degree to which the individual accepts and applies the principles
and spirit of the <strong>Muslim ideology</strong>
   <ul>
   <li>Every state since the ancient times has supported and promoted those
   individuals, structures and organizations which fully accepted
   and applied ideas and values which that state officially promoted as its own.
   No state has ever assisted its opposition, nor has it deliberately offered
   the possibility for the promotion of the opposing ideas and political interests.
   Muslims in Bosnia-Hercegovina had a chance to observe that during both Yugoslavias.
   The future <strong>Muslim state</strong> must not be different in this respect.
   People who prove to be true Muslims, aware nationalists and good believers,
   will naturally have higher social privilege than those who persist in their
   opposition and promotion of leftist policy.  Good Muslims and nationalists
   will be promoted to presidents and directors and be given preferential
   access to education (scholarships etc. ).
   </ul>
<li>None of the principles of <strong>Muslim ideology</strong> will be imposed
on anyone, as Koran prescribes, but the spirit of the ideology will be systematically
promoted and infuse the society in all possible ways.
   <ul>
   <li>Prime time programs on radio, TV, movie theaters and cultural manifestations
   will have morally educational and nationally useful content;  non-Muslim material
   will be on the margins of production and broadcasting.
   </ul>
<li><strong>Muslim ideology</strong> will aim to gradually abolish the duality
between sacred and secular, religious and political, which has been imposed on
us by the secularized Christian Europe against our will, via secular reforms
of Kemal Pasha Ataturk, Lenin's Bolshevik Russia and, finally, Socialist Federal 
Yugoslavia.
   <ul>
   <li>In its nature, Islam does not recognize the difference of  religious and
   social.  After all, Islam is not a "religion" but a religious-political
   ideology, an all encompassing approach to living.  Islamic principles never
   remain on the surface of individual consciousness and individual religious
   experience.  True Islam always aims to encompass the society in which it exists,
   and with it its political and state structures.
   </ul>
<li>Formal result of the application of the <strong>Muslim ideology</strong>
will be based on the lessons of Plato's political trilogy: "State", "Statesmen",
and "Law".  "Law" will be especially taken into consideration as the book which
promotes firm control of the society, law and order in a state, the book which affirms
human virtues, religion and morality, and also advocates certain overseeing and
political organizations in order to strengthen these values.
<li>Political supremacy of the wisest men, if possible philosophers-politicians 
as advocated by Plato, will be ensured in the state;  all advancement of morally 
degraded, uneducated and unprofessional people will be banned by law.  Basic
knowledge of philosophy, theology, civilisation and history will be required
from all holders of high offices.
<li>The state policy, during the first few decades, should take the middle
of the road course, and strictly insist on the implementation and respect of all enacted 
laws, so that the state could as soon as possible get on its own feet and begin
to respect Muslim ideology.  Wider decentralisation and democratisation of the state
could occur only after that.
</ol><P>

P.S.  The above listed observations are not only the opinion of this author.  
I have heard similar 
thoughts from a lot of individuals, and even some of men who are
influential in the social and political life of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  The presented
version is only an attempt to finally face these complex, controversial, and for us
Muslims vitally important issues and to put them in a preliminary, discussion
ready frame.<P>

<H1>Commemorative Meeting of the City Council of the Serbian Socialist Party: 5 Years Since the Founding</h1>

<h2>Peace and Freedom medal for Slobodan Milosevic</h2>

by D.M. <em>Narodne Novine</em>, Nis , Serbia, FR Yugoslavia, 10/13/95, issue 10034, page 1

<hr>

<strong>Participants in the yesterdays commemorative meeting supported with a strong applause the suggestion that the Nis City Council award the first, newly established, great medal of peace and freedom, "Cegar fires", to the president of Serbia.<P>

Socialist party city organization secretary, Zoran Cvetkovic, talked at the yesterdays meeting about the significant, visible and recognizable results of the 5 year long activities of the SPS in Nis.</strong><P>
<hr>

On the yesterdays celebratory session commemorating 5 years since the founding of the socialist party in Nis, the participants with a loud applause greeted and at the same time verified the Nis city party organization initiative sent to the city council to award the first  newly established, great medal of peace and freedom, "Cegar fires", to the president of Serbia Slobodan Milosevic.<P> 

Explaining why socialists suggested that president Milosevic receive this newly established Nis city medal, Mile Ilic, the president of the city council of the SPS and federal representative, among other, said:" Because he united Serbia, put the Serbian people back on its feet in the struggle for preservation of its dignity and united the Serbian people in the struggle for realization of national and patriotic interests.  Because he ensured that, in spite of sanctions, the world doesn't see Serbia on its knees.  And because he didn't give in under the influence of the world powers and turned Serbia in a ghetto, and Serbian people in a hostage of his interests.  And because he contributed to the realization of just goals of the heroic struggle of the serbian people for the freedom of living and national survival; because he preserved peace of the citizens of Serbia and Yugoslavia and saved his people from the chaos of war, and state from war destruction.  Because he is for the just peace for all people in the region; because from a barrel of powder he is turning the Balkans into a training grounds for peace; because he with a policy of peace makes the lifting of unjust sanctions certain; and because he with his wise policy leads serb people to an oasis of peace..."

<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Plantation of indian hemp discovered near Vrginmost</strong><P>

SISAK - Employees of the Sisak-moslavina Police district, have recently discovered in Slavsko Polje and Cremisica, near Vrginmost, six plots of indian hemp with approximately 1,000 plants of excellent quality;  these plants could yield 170 kilograms of leaves whose market value is about DM 300,000.  This was stated at the press conference by the head of the Police district, Vladimir Milankovic.<P>

Milankovic stated that indian hemp had been planted in the Spring of this year by Serb rebels who had been overseeing that territory; he emphasized that the plots were surrounded by trenches, approaches had been mined and the plots had been constantly guarded.  This led to a conclusion that the occupying serb authorities had themselves organized planting of the hemp, produced drugs and drugged the members of the serb paramilitary formations, emphasized the head of the Sisak-moslavina Police district, Vladimir Milankovic.<P>

<h1><A NAME="plitvice">Plitvice</a> waters are clean</h1>

<H2> Trajko Grkovski, <em> Vjesnik, Zagreb, Croatia, 9/13/95</em></h2><P>

<hr>

<STRONG> Plitvice Lakes after the sixth day of the cleansing action: the lakes are completely safe for visitors;  there are traces of a serious ecocide. </strong><P>

PLITVICKA JEZERA -  A team of experts from different scientific fields is currently at the Plitvice Lakes, together with the special forces of MUP RH [Ministry of Internal Affairs of the republic of Croatia];  they have been visiting Plitvice forests, meadows, Donja and Gornja lakes and the source waters of the national park.  As soon as the special police troops cleanse the soft territory, about 20,000 hectars in area, scientists will begin their work.<P>

We talked to Dr. Bozidar Stilinovic about first findings of the team of experts.  Dr. Bozidar Stilnovic is a biologist and an expert who dedicated over 30 years of his professional life to the Plitvice lakes and their waters and especially to the process of biodynamic formation of scedra and slapiste.  We asked Dr. Stilinovic about first impressions; the Plitvice lakes nature has been a chetnik hostage for four years.<P>

<h2>No signs of a serious ecocide</h2>

"My first impression was, I would say, a wonderful shock when I saw Donja lakes for a first time after four years.  i dedicated more than 30 years of my scientific work to the lakes; i have fought for certain principles and the ecological status of the Plitvice lakes.  My first impression was positive;  first examination of this part of the national park confirmed that there were no signs of a serious ecocide."<P>

To our question about the state of Plitvice waters and the basis for formation of sedra and slapista which is crucial for the survival of the lakes, Dr. Stilinovic replied:

"Water is bacteriologically clean; we obtained first results a few days ago.  several water samples were taken at critical points, namely, Milanovac barrier, Milka Trnina cascades and the source of the river Korana.  I can openly state that in a freely flowing water I couldn't find any bacteria, traces of fecal matter or any other pollutants.  Of course, examination of bacteria in the vegetation will certainly show that some pollution has existed previously.  Above all because of Plitvicki Lijeskovac a town at the lake source."<P>

To our comment that the lakes look neglected and, especially around pedestrian trails and bridges, are overgrown with vegetation, Dr. Stilinovic added:<P>

"Donja lakes are terribly overgrown.  Five years is a relatively long period, yet too short for natural processes, so this can only be a reflection of human influence.  Detailed ecological study must point out the future course of action.  The Plitvice lakes must not become Plitvice swamps."<P>

<h2>Trouts in refrigerators</h2>

Dr. Srecko Bozicevic, a well-known speleologist, and Dr. Duro Huber are among the members of the state commission of the experts and scientists for recording of the state of nature at the Plitvice lakes; Dr. Duro Huber is a well-known explorer of fauna, especially Plitvice bears.  Besides Dr. Huber, the members of the commission are also prof. Branimir Prpic, a forestry expert, and Radenko Dezalic.  They also emphasized that there were no strong signs of an ecocide; prof. Prpic informed us that there had been uncontrolled logging in some parts of the park.  For example in the area of Medak, chetniks logged beach for fire wood, and in the area of Javornik and Visibaba, strictly protected forest areas above Proscansko lake, they logged conifers.  Experts, together with special police troops, found there about 500 cubic meters of fir wood ready for transport to Banja Luka.  In all that Plitvice evil, which was imposed by rebel Serbs and chetniks, there are some signs of ecocide against the Plitvice fauna and especially against the fish resources.  Police divers established that chetniks had killed lake trout with dynamite, as was confirmed by several small craters at the bottom of the lake Kozjak.  Plitvice exiles who returned to the lakes, during cleaning of the townships of Mukinja and Jezerce found in house refrigerators as much as 10 kilograms of plitvice trout.<P>

<h2>Process of sedra formation preserved</h2>

Dr. Silinovic told us that the fundamental process necessary for survival of the Plitvice lakes, the process of sedra formation, had been preserved:

"We know exactly what is bad for sedra; actually we have encountered ideal ecological situation on the Plitvice lakes.  Now we have to start the analysis and establish the conditions for arrival of visitors and tourists."<P>

Scientists have also used vehicles of MUP RH and for several days were able to fly in helicopters over the lakes.  A well-known expert, Srecko Bozicevic, a speleologist, was certainly pleased; he was a guide for the special forces policemen.  Dr Bozicevic informed us that  on 10/8/95 a group of divers had taken samples of water, bottom sediments and plants from the lakes of Kozjak and Milanovac and that until then unknown cave had been found under the water curtain of Milanovac waterfalls.  Dr. Huber, who has for years been observing Plitvice bears, received the report from the special force policemen that during the search of the lakes they had spotted in the wider area of Medvedak deer, martens, wild boars and a she bear with two cubs.  It seems that, while the divers searching the bottom of the lake found a cave behind the Milanovac waterfalls, explosives experts discovered mines on two bridges.<P>

This has been a reality  of the Plitvice lakes for the last four years; the enemy used nature, which he threatened with mines, in the war against Croatia.  We were told by the special forces of MUP RH that the Plitvice lakes, six days after the beginning of the action were absolutely safe for the visitors.  Only now the preparations for the recovery of the economy and the return of the exiles and also visitors can start.<P>

<h1> European Forgeries</h1><p>

 
<h2><em> by Milan Ivkosic</em> <br>  Hrvatski Obzor, 10/9/95, Zagreb, Croatia</i></h2><p>



<hr>

What kind of person should the Croatian president Dr. Franjo Tudman be to satisfy certain media in Great Britain, France, Germany...?  While "satirical" <em>Feral Tribune</em> from Split, portrays him as a pharaoh, <em>Globus</em> from Zagreb as a ban, and while a good part of the Croatian opposition thinks like this - if HDZ led by Tudman wins in this elections with the overwhelming majority, that would be a single party system, totalitarianism and even fascism, and if that doesn't happen that would be a democracy - at the same time some papers in the West cannot think of president Tudman as a democratic president.  The harshest attacks draw parallels between (Tudman's) republic of Croatia and (Pavelic's) NDH.[Nezavisna Drzava Hrvatska, Independent State of Croatia, a Nazi puppet state established in 1941 under leadership of Ante Pavelic on the territory of most of todays Croatia, all of Bosnia-Hercegovina and a small part of Serbia (Srem)]<P>

After Tito's death, especially at the time when with the destruction of the Berlin wall and socialism Yugoslavia also started to fall apart, Croatia needed a strong personality.  The West has by then  somewhat forgotten strong personalities; in Croatia, fortunately, a strong personality became a political heavyweight and the head of the state.  This kind of Tudman was ready for the most fruitful risk - to take Croatia from the traps of the recent past and take it into the world from the historical depths and historical roots.  The recent totalitarian systems - communism and fascism - are the biggest enemies of such an endeavor, because they feed and survive on a moment, temporary coincidences and temporary, expendable alliances.<p>

As expendable systems, both communism and fascism, ideologically exclusive, are ready to expend the people as well.  Those two totalitarian ideologies have, to a large extent, influenced the recent destiny of Croatia; therefore Dr. Tudman found it extremely important to reconcile, not those two ideologies, but the people who, in a this way or that, belonged to them or were close to their main exponents.  Therefore, he chose to apply the historical criteria of non-ideological and extra-ideological national survival to the recent past.  Every testimony, proof, symbol, sign of historical continuity of the Croatian people were in those years, and will be in the future, for Croatia and Tudman, necessary not as a governmental decoration but to rekindle the memories from those centuries and centuries whose traces are visible everywhere in the West which keeps sending us criticisms and grave accusations..<P>


A lot of accusations from the West after the "Storm" - about ethnic cleansing, torching of houses, murders of civilians - accusations against Croatia and especially its president Tudman, therefore should be understood, but not accepted, as a continuation of repression of the picture of the Croatians as a nation; nation which doesn't want to join Europe on a basis of charity of the powerful but on a basis of its strength and history.  How could  Croatia possibly endanger Great Britain, France, U.S.A., Germany...?!  Indeed, with its size and (military) might, in comparison with them we are totally powerless; but we are absolutely powerful as a nation which wants to survive.  That isn't our little, nor our big, but our EVERYTHING.  That is a sort of our "totalitarianism."  In the West, Croatian right for State survival is still regarded as totalitarianism, nationalism, fascism; instead it should be the opposite: the right for a state should be supported as a framework for democracy and not a denial of democracy.<P>

As "a self-management ideal", Yugoslavia looked to a lot of European leftists as a model of solved national and social problems; they couldn't see that communism suffocated the market as the basis of general enrichment and that greater serbian nationalism suffocated nations which could not accept it.<P>


What kind of person should Dr. Tudman be to make a favorable impression on certain Western media?  Obviously, they don't like that he is neither a fascist nor a communist.  The appearance of a Croatian statesman without an ideology, in the surrounding which inherited ideological criteria about judgments and accusations, is one of the most European recent political fenomena, which Europe due to its forgotten tradition can hardly recognize.  Europe is actually, traditionally full of differences; therefore it should accept Croatia without any problems.  However, burdened by being used to communism in the neighborhood (in the socialist block) and fascism as a negative memory and of course burdened by the interests of the imperial interests of the European powers and a contradictory idea of unification, much of Europe cannot accept the personality of president Tudman as it was unable to tolerate and produce  personalities who were to or would determine its national destinies and the future of the continent.  The latest American "excursion" into Europe does not deny but on the contrary confirms Tudman as an European politician who from the start "offered himself " to France and Great Britain, and Germany, and Russia... not as a prostitute but as a statesman.  A part of Europe will easily tolerate Croatian guilt (they will even enlarge it), but it will have difficulty in tolerating Croatian innocence because Europe has excluded it from its calculations a long time ago.<P>

Therefore, as much as a part of Europe sees in Tudman's Croatia parallels with Pavelic's NDH - it sees its bad conscience, dirtied exactly with denial of Croatia and croatianism!  Accept me as a friend and a collaborator, and then judge me as I will judge you.  But do not reject me in advance as if the verdict has already been made!  That European, Christian principle with which Croatia wants to join Europe and with which it is ready to recognize its own mischief and crimes isn't some "catholic narrow-mindedness" but belief in the God who has been despised scorned for a long time in Europe; Europe which accuses us! <P>


The following words, taken from an interview, will be sufficient to convince you that that part of Europe in incurably racist, actually Nazi:<P>

"We had a good friend who was a Serb; he was an anthropologist and discovered interesting data about the origin of Zagorci [people from the region near Zagreb in northern Croatia.  Presidents Tudman was born and grew up in that region].  he claimed that Zagorci came from the very south of the Balkans, that they were actually the Byzantines.  I really like that theory.  Zagorci are actually the Byzantines!  Because whenever Tudman speaks about the Byzantines he always does that with condescension."<P>

These are the words of Dessa Trevisan, a long time correspondent for the London <em>Times</em> from the former Yugoslavia.  That forgery symbolizes animosity which a part of Europe feels toward Tudman and Croatia; actually that part of Europe which received a fake picture of Croatia form "a Serbian friend".  The drawing of parallels with the serbian nazism is actually the real reason behind  the drawing of parallels between todays Croatia and NDH.

<h1> Victory Over Fascism</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Dubravko Horvatic<br>  Hrvatsko Slovo, 5/5/95, Zagreb, Croatia</i></h2><p>


<hr>

The world is celebrating 50 years since the victory over fascism, but Croatia and Croatians, both those living inside the borders of the republic of Croatia and those in Herceg-Bosna, are still forced to wage a war against fascism.<p>

Were fascism and national-socialism really defeated after the deaths of their two founders, after the Duce's execution by a firing squad and the Fuhrer's suicide at the end of April 1945, actually several days later, after the total collapse of the Third Reich, or did they continue their infernal march against everything human?  Historical facts convince us that after the WWII the ghosts (or evil spirits) of the teacher from Emillia-Romagna and a wall painter from Braunau on Inn did not return to the stage; instead the orthodox theology student from the Caucasus appeared on the world scene to, on his own or through his proxies, continue their crimes: Stalin, who perfected Lenin's concentration camps and their  methods of destruction, who divided Poland with Hitler and committed genocide against the Polish people, suddenly became an "antifascist", even a symbol of antifascism.  That antifascism was demonstrated immediately after the end of the WWII, after the surrender of arms [by the defeated fascist units]: massacres all over Europe, among which the one that started in Bleiburg is the largest.  The fascism under red flags with swastikas was substituted by the fascism under red flags with a hammer and sickle. Even those who were defeated as fascists, raised the new flag to continue the same monstrous program, this time under the guise of antifascism.  An example from the former Yugoslavia is the most obvious: fascism of Rankovic and Milosevic [president of Serbia since 1987] is the same as that of Draza Mihailovic [leader of royalist resistance (so called chetniks) in Yugoslavia during the WWII].<p> 

Red fascism of Serbia revealed its real, monstrous face in the fall of 1990 and especially in the spring of 1991: it started an open genocide against the Croatian people, destroying everything Croatian, from the centuries old ancestral buildings to a child in a womb.  When Croatia and Croatians confronted that beast, stopping it with almost bare chests, the red fascism found shelter in some papers printed in the Republic of Croatia, in certain groups which under the guise of antifascism pretend to worry about "pluralism" and democracy.  Thus, struggle against fascism still goes on in Croatian territories, on the front as well as in the media.<p>

When the Croatian police forces liberate Western Slavonia from the Serbian fascism, it responds with rocket attacks on Croatian cities and even the Capital, where its targets are among others, city trams, a theater and even the children's hospital.  In spite of that, the Croatian flag is again flying on the bridge across the Sava river toward Bosanska Gradiska, a Croatian man in Western Slavonia is again free on his own land and now controls and protects the ancestral soil.  Fascism has been defeated on that territory.<p>

<h1> Spiritual Croatia; a Return</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Stjepan Seselj<br>  Hrvatsko Slovo, 5/5/95, Zagreb, Croatia</i></h2><p>


<hr>

Exiled Croatian people begins its return home.  To its burned homes, overgrown farms, destroyed sacred places, plowed-over cemeteries... Who could count all those terrible images of the pan-Serbian anti-croatian war spread all over Croatian territories, images which gather in a wound in our soul, in our memory.  Even though for now we are only talking about liberated Western Slavonian territories, we are convinced that we can claim for everyone: exiled Croatian people returns from the bottom of hope!  At the same time, the terrible time of images from Sarvas, Kijevo, Beli Manastir, Slunj, Konavli, Vrlika, Ilok, Petrinja, Vinkovci, Drnis, Sunja, Dubrovnik and Slano, Ravno, Kostajnica, Capljina, Derventa, Plehani, Podmilacje and Jajce, Kupres returns to our consciousness.  Sisak, Brod, Zupanja, Tovarnik, Sarengrad, Bepska...  While Vukovar incessantly burns, condensing in itself all our ruins, all wounds and all our hopes.  Even these latest, from Zagreb.<p>

While the day of the final return arrives, a day in which the Pokuplje burns returns to my consciousness.  Our little houses in flames, to this day have more significance for me than all the famous historical fires.  Those tears, that death and that universal pain.  I admit, for days I did not believe in forgiveness.  How could have I when those beasts are still day and night attacking everything we hold sacred.  First our language, then our soil, our bodies and our soul.  They intended to desecrate us, humiliate, exterminate, wipe out for ever from the face of the earth, from humanity and especially from the political map of Europe and the world.  How could one think in the middle of that fire about forgiveness?  Even when through the bloody flames, that very same day, got through to us a gentle word of his excellency, the archbishop of Zagreb and a cardinal, a voice of the Church, the voice of the faith:<em> if my neighbor sets my house on fire I will not set his on fire!  If my neighbor kills my father, my brother ... I will not return with the same measure!</em>  Terribly, through the flames, echoed those gentle words, and although said in my mother tongue, they seemed foreign, unintelligible, distant.  That evening, on a crowded city square, in a crowd of desperate and bitter people, a good friend a [isusovac (believer or jesuit?)], was shocked by those words.  I understood him, because everything around us burned with that Pokupski flame, so that it was hard to comprehend gentle words, even a word of God.<p> 

Today, even as I write this text, they are trying to push us into that Pokupsko state.  They intend to do it in their always the same way - by killing! <em> With Sows</em>.  A supreme symbol of their pig raising herd.  With Sows on Zagreb: on the Cathedral, on the Croatian Academy of Arts and Sciences, on the Croatian National Theater, on the Artistic pavilion, on the Mimara Museum, on the Botanical Garden, on the State Archive, on the Children's Hospital...  As if this white city will turn into a pigsty because of their burrowing?!  As they couldn't do it in other Croatian regions.  Especially in Vukovar and Pakrac...  Of course, those to whom a sow is an ideal will never understand our essence, our fundamental values; therefore all their future sows will lack a real target.<p>

Six sows fell on Zagreb today as well.  Non stop news bulletins on the radio.  From Zagreb hospitals details about the condition of the wounded.  From one of the hospitals we heard the Croatian Minister for Culture accompanied by a famous Croatian General.  Just before Serbian bombs started grunting through Zagreb, the two of them had been discussing the return of orthodox icons, saved by the members of HVO [ Bosnian Croat Army] in Bosnia.  In parallel, yesterdays picture of the Croatian policemen entering liberated Western Slavonian lands.  Undamaged Orthodox church.  Untouched monument, symbol of the serbocommunist failed regime.  Houses .. of those who stayed as well as those who left, regardless, <A HREF="ref.html">will not experience the fate of thousands and thousands Croatian houses.</a><p>

If the Croatian cardinal's home were hit yesterday or, God forbid, today, the gentle godly voice which cautions us from the Pokupski flames, would remain.  The voice which cautions us from the centuries old layers of our faith and kindness.  The voice which cautions us in a dignified manner, after years in exile, after being brought to the end of hope and returns us to our houses, burned homes, overgrown farms, destroyed sacred places, plowed-over cemeteries...<p>

<h1>Nebojsa from "Globus" in Knin</h1>

<h3> Hrvatski Obzor, Zagreb, Croatia, 2/26/96</h3>

Ninoslav Pavic used to be the most fierce persecutor of Croatian patriotism and Croatian "nationalists" on the pages of <em>Vjesnik</em> [Once the most respected Croatian daily.  During the communists, and again today, under the state control].  He was copiously and too often quoted and used in the Belgrade [former Yugoslav capital; Serbian capital as well] press.  Had he then, some seven-eight years ago, sent journalist Nebojsa Taraba to write a news report about Knin, the readership would have "enjoyed" in a parade of brotherhood and unity which would in the near future express itself as the worst Chetnik ideology.[Note: brotherhood and unity was an official policy in the former, "communist", Yugoslavia under which all expressions of nationalist or patriotic feeling were deemed dangerous and frequently prosecuted.  The policy of brotherhood and unity also tried, half-heartedly, to develop a feeling of common Yugoslav patriotism].<P>

The times have changed. What about the people? Once the public informer for greater Serbianism on the pages of <em>Vjesnik</em>, Ninoslav Pavic, was a man who would in the (these days rather faded) media memory be remembered as the most reckless public informer, whose texts could have been literally copied by the communist prosecutors in their persecution of "nationalists". He is today the majority shareholder and the ideologist of a "national weekly", loudly and professionally advertised <em>Globus</em>.  Ninoslav Pavic is a man who has made a fortune from the Croatian suffering and the lies about the Croatian suffering.<P>

Today, in a former <em>Vjesnik's</em> building, top officials from all newly established and "transformed" [i.e. privatized] companies regularly come to kowtow to Pavic.  They say that a certain Zagreb prophet foretold a horrible suicide for him...  But forget about prophets.<P>

Let us instead read what Pavic's journalist, Nebojsa Taraba, wrote in the last issue of <em>Globus</em> about Knin [the former capital of the so-called Serbian Krajina; it was liberated and thoroughly looted in the August of 1995.  Since most of its Serb population fled in front of the liberators, the town remains mostly deserted]: "Almost six months after the liberation, Croatian royal city of Knin, as the politicians and a few journalists often used to call it, neither with its image nor contents cannot justify such an elevated ephitet."<P>

Obviously, for Taraba, a historical fact, that is the royal Knin, is such because certain "politicians and a few journalists" say so!  Once he is done with cynicism and historical lies in the introduction, Taraba proceeds to turn the liberation of Knin into a looting expedition;  he finds the evidence for this in the piles of old furniture which had been thrown out on the streets by the people who had broken into somebody else's apartments and had brought in the stolen furniture from other apartments.  To the worst possible picture of the conditions in Knin, Taraba adds bizarre details which show that "those who today live in Knin have never lived in larger towns." For example, <em>Globus'</em> reporters in Knin, the town which, according to them, had been populated by highly urbanized Serbs, in telephone booths found   "prepaid telephone cards with plenty of impulses left on them."  Taraba concludes: "It seems that even the most banal things like a phone, are an unbelievable novelty to these people."  In short: Croatian barbarians had thrown out civilized Serbs out of Knin.  The same civilized Serbs who ,only a few yards away from those telephone booths, in their hospital-prison cellars, mutilated and killed Croatian prisoners.  They did this in criminal fits powered by impulses which they had known to orderly utilize the same way as the telephone impulses in telephone booths.<P>

Those criminal urges were for years strengthened by the former <em>Vjesnik</em> executor and the current owner of the "national weekly", Ninoslav Pavic and other communist <em>nebojsas</em> [a Serb name].<P>

<h1>Excerpts from: Bihac, a Bulwark of Croatian Glory and Suffering</h1>

<strong><em>by Antun Abramovic</em></strong><P>

<h3> Hrvatsko Slovo, Zagreb, Croatia, 9/8/95</h3>

[During Ottoman rule in the <a HREF="http://www.acs.supernet.net/maps/035.htm">Bihac</a> region] many peasants and Croatian noblemen, exposed to incessant invasions, in total poverty and with a lot of reluctance, converted to Islam and joined the Turkish army.  A brother attacked a brother, families were divided by hate.  Thousands of people were killed , thousands taken to Turkey as slaves.  The Ottomans populated the places deserted by the enslaved Croats with Orthodox Vlachs from the Balkans who would later, in the 19th and 20th century, under the influence of the Serbian Orthodox Church, turn into Serbs.  They, as a people without a religion and law, committed the most horrible crimes - abducted and sold children, raped women, slaughtered the old and infirm, burned houses and served as Ottoman spies.  Knightly Islamic Croats despised the Vlachs, but still found a use for them in their scorched earth tactics... <P>

in 1791, after <strong>Svistovski Peace</strong>, Bihac remained under Turkish control, but now as a border town in the Ottoman empire.  Those warrior Islamic Bihac knights resisted the Turkish reforms which were supposed to modernize the empire.  They rebelled, and infamous <strong>Omer Pasha Latas</strong>, a Serb convert to Islam from Lika [the area around the towns of Gospic, Gracac, Otocac, partly in the so-called Krajina],  hanged and expelled them without mercy.  Yet again a Serb judged a Croat, although this time both of them were converts to Islam!<P>

Turkey lost <strong>Bosnia-Hercegovina</strong> in negotiations which took place in Berlin in 1878.  Instead the <strong>Austro-Hungarian Empire</strong>, based on the Croatian sovereign rights, gained the right to occupy this, westernmost, Turkish border province.  However, fierce, freedom loving Islamic knights, gave strong resistance to the Austrian troops in which there were a lot of Croats.  Between September 7 and 19, 1878, 72nd infantry Austrian brigade, in which there were a lot of Croats, tried to capture Bihac; the city was defended by about 4,000 Islamic Croats and 900 Turkish soldiers.  Because of fierce resistance the 72nd brigade was reinforced by two other infantry regiments and then the resistance was broken.  Austria treated well the Muslims from the Bihac region trying to win them over to its side; it was successful in this during the 19th century.  Bihac developed both economically and culturally and became the center of, above all, Muslim and Catholic culture.<P>

At the beginning of the 20th century, some Serb traders and Vlach cattle breeders settled in Bihac and soon, under the influence of the Serbian Orthodox Church, became fierce supporters of the greater serbian ideology.  Their plans for the founding of greater Serbia became realistic after the arrival of the Serbian army to Bihac in 1918 and the founding of the common state of Slovenians, Croats and Serbs.  Greater Serbian, Chetnik ideology as well as the appearance of communism among the Croats and Muslims would deeply divide the population of the Bihac region.<P>

After the founding of the Independent State of Croatia [NDH, pro-fascist Croatian state, existed between 1941 and 1945], many Croats and Muslims joined the <a HREF="http://cypress.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~eesrdan/ndh/ndh-INDEX.html">Ustashe</a> and Domobrani units of the army of NDH; they reacted to the immediate founding of chetnik-communist units in forests [Chetniks were nationalist Serb resistance fighters, while the Partisans were a multinational communist resistance army; they fought each other and both Ustashe and Domobrani; in the last stages of the war some Chetnik units in Bosnia fought with the Ustashe and German troops against the Partisans; however both fought against the NDH and the majority of their troops were ethnic Serbs; because of that modern Croatian historiography has merged them into Bolsevik-Chetnik hordes], which again, following the example of their Vlach ancestors, began to exterminate the Croat and Muslim population of the Bihac region in horrible and <a HREF="http://www.VisionInc.com/YU/Rat/atlas/atlas-index.html">mercyless massacres</a>.  Many Croats and Muslims tried to reach safety by joining partisan-communist guerrilla units, in their naive faith that it would be possible to live together with sensible Serbs.  Bihac was a strong fortification and an obstacle to the realization of Bolsevik-Chetnik plans.  Communist and Chetnik units attacked Bihac on 11/2 , 1942.  The town was defended  by several Ustashe and Domobrani units together with small groups of German soldiers.  Both sides suffered great losses in fierce fighting.  After <a HREF="/info/students/marko/feral/feral2.html"> a heroic defense, the Army of NDH</a> was forced to evacuate Bihac on 11/4, 1942.  The communists held "The first AVNOJ conference" at the territory under their control, in "Tito's state" or "Bihac Republic"; this conference was an attempt to define a fake democratic parliament of "New Yugoslavia".<P>

In a fierce counter-attack, Croatian and German units recaptured Bihac on 5/29 , 1943; after that, until 1945 the Partisans failed to get even close to the strong Bihac fortress. Unfortunately, the demise of the NDH was unavoidable because of the deep ideological divisions among the Croats.  Between March 22 and 28, 1945, after difficult fighting, communist and partisan units again entered Croatian Bihac, which had been evacuated by its defenders who started on a road of no return, all the way to the Bleiburg killing field  [Croatian, Slovenian and Serb quisling troops surrendered in Bleiburg, just across the Austrian border, to the British troops.  They were put on trains and sent back over the border to the Partisans.  Most of them, men and women, were later executed by the Partisans] .<P>

Since that day, until 1990 and the demise of the world communism, all Croatian and Islamic was suppressed and banned in the ancient Croatian city.  Bihac hardly survived as a provincial town in Bosnia-Hercegovina which wasn't allowed to be connected with its natural Croatian hinterland.  Ancient monuments to the tempestuous Croatian past were systematically ignored and destroyed.  Only "Bihac Republic" and "AVNOJ" could be mentioned, while the bones of ancient Croatian knights, buried next to the famous Fetija mosque, were scattered by dogs...<P>

Yugoslavia, the old one as well as the new one, couldn't survive.  It was only a cover for the development of a framework for the greater Serbia.  Bihac was supposed to be a part of that historically impossible monster and his Croat and Muslim inhabitants exterminated.  Since 1992, until today, Bihac survived the most horrible of all sieges, which lasted exactly 1201 day.  Heroic Bihac inhabitants, the descendants of ancient Croat and Islamic knights, survived hunger, a river of grenades and all fierce chetnik attacks.  Fierce attack of the Croatian army, a part of the operation "Storm", liberated the ancient Croatian town of Bihac - now and forever.<P>

Peace returned to the mysterious silver green <a HREF="http://www.acs.supernet.net/maps/033.jpg">Una</a> river, the main Croatian river ...  Peace to its heroes!<P>

<h1> Goebbels' From Our Neighborhood</h1><br>
       <h2> Interview with Edo Murtic</h2>

 

 
<h2><i> by Heni Erceg <p>
  Feral Tribune, 2/6/95, Split, Croatia<p></i></h2>


Edo Murtic is a Croatian painter, whose one thousand paintings are exhibited in all the best galleries around the world.  The recipient of numerous domestic and foreign prizes, Murtic also possesses am enviable collection of decorations among which he points out: President of Italy's Golden Plaque Faenze, AVNOJ Prize ``Vladimir Nazor", Pope Paul VI Silver Medal and Legion d'Honeur. Although it may not seem so, due to the sporadic reporting in the domestic media, Murtic still works and exhibits without a pause.  His latest exhibition in Italy, almost totally ignored at home, was named ``Why the War?"<p>

<b> Q: Indeed, why then the war?</b><p>

- That is my question, and question of all of us, which unfortunately does not have an answer.  I only documented with that exhibition the state I am in, the absolute unacceptability of crime; and a war is a crime.  That is something I can not comprehend; only primitive nations or tribes solve their problems in such a way.  A war is the fastest and easiest way to crime. <p>

<b> Q: Many claim today that it was obvious that the war was inevitable , because we lived in an ``unnatural community." Could you sense that enormous hatered ?</b><p>

- Never, not even in a dream.<p> 

<b> Q: Let us return to the beginning. Why do Croatian media ignore you? What have you done wrong?</b><p>

- I do not know, I do not understand.  I work as before, exhibit at home and abroad.  I have had a whole series of exhibitions abroad during the last few years, from Amsterdam to Indonesia, and that is why I do not understand the domestic media silence. Anyway, you should ask them.<p>

<b> Q: Could this be a case of political ostracism of those refusing to follow the regime's line?</b><p>

- Listen, an official in the ministry of culture, Mrs. Dasa Bradicic, stated in a function, in front of twenty or so of my younger colleagues, that Murtic was favored by the communist authorities. Therefore, she reasoned, it was normal that I was today hampered in my work. That could be the answer to your question.  By the way, this person was highly regarded in the previous system as a ``politically suitable" comrade and official.<p>

<hr>
<h2><b> SERBS IN QUICKLIME </b></h2><p>


<b> Q: Do you think that it would have been natural for president Tudjman to go and bow to the victims of Jasenovac [largest concentration camp in Croatia during the WWII], instead of manipulating the numbers of those who died in that camp?  This has encouraged those who would rehabilitate Independent State of Croatia (ISC) [ISC (Nezavisna Drzave Hrvatska(NDH) in Croatian) was a Nazi puppet state from 1941 to 1945; it was run by Croatian fascist movement - Ustashe in Croatian], and lead to ``soft" interviews, like the one with the commander of Jasenovac, which has recently been published.</b><p>

- That only shows the state of spirit and politics which can cost us dearly.  When somebody today claims that the number of people murdered in Jasenovac was 25,000 rather than 700,000, that does not diminish the magnitude of the crime.  It is not the numbers but the act that matters.  I shall tell you how I experienced the first days of ISC. As a young man, I went with my late mother to the countryside to buy potatoes.  Our train left Zagreb early in the morning and in the blue expanse of that morning I suddenly noticed a patch, similar to the tennis court, which was absolutely white.  And then I saw an arm protruding from that whiteness, and than a head, hair ... It was a scene of slaughter. Ustashe killed the Serbs from the village of Gutovac, threw them in a pit and poured over quicklime.  Therefore whiteness.  It was the first shock I experienced in ``our" independent state and since, you know, the fear from that state has always been present.  I am terrified by what might happen. Fortunately, we are today under the magnifying glass, but I tell you, if we were not, that horror could happen again today.<p>

<b> Q: It seems that even the regime is no longer capable of controlling its radical members?</b><p>

- That is the problem.  I have recently had a conversation with one of the leading members of the Croatian Democratic Union (CDU), incidentally an ex-Partisan from the province of Kosovo [part of Serbia], who totally dismayed said: "Do you see what is going on, and those Ustashe ...?!" I told him: "Excuse me but I did not bring them back to life, and besides you will be the first one to go tomorrow. I might be left alone since I am only a painter".<p>

<b> Q: So, were you favored by the previous regime?</b><p>

- I was and I stayed a free artist; my political views must not be used against my work or the work of any other artist.<p>

<h2>Franco's Lesson</h2><p>

<b> Q: How do you see the Croatian culture today, and do you think that the so called patriotic art is the only one currently in favor?</b><p>

- It is hard to call that art, since it is above all an elementary primitivism and affected naivete.  I would like to mention a text by Danilo Kis about folk art, in which he says that when folk art, not in a traditional value sense, turns into a myth, that is when the fascism appears. What is created today in Croatia is valued not according to its quality, but according to the amount of nationalistic ardor it contains, regardless of how primitive it may be.<p>

<b> Q: How do you react to incessant attacks on the most illustrious Croatian Cultural Institutions and their leading members?</b><p>

- Every normal country is proud of its artists and scientists, and those institutions form the backbone of Croatia, since everything else will pass anyway.  For example, you may not agree with Vlado Gotovac's political views, but you cannot question the artistic value of his work.  Take Franco's Spain as an example; Picasso refused to return to Spain as long as fascists were in power; however, Franco copiously used Picasso in all exhibitions of the Spanish art throughout the world.  Therefore, in spite of Picasso being a staunch opponent of Franco's regime, Fanco never tried to deny him a place in the ouvre of the Spanish art.<p>

<b> Q: Do you think that the authorities are afraid of the people who mean something in arts, culture, society?</b><p>

- That is absolutely correct.  I personally find it very suspicious, that today's regime promotes Vinko Nikolic, a fascist and believer in Pavelic's [Ante Pavelic, leader of Croatian fascists and ISC during the WWII] ideology.  Until recently, he was writing odes to the Poglavnik [Croatian fascist term corresponding to German Fuhrer, ie. leader], and today is supposed to be our idol. This man maintains that we were in darkness from 1945 till 1990, and that nothing significant occurred in Croatian culture. These are untrue and foolish statements.<p>

<b> Q: ``Reevaluation of history" is currently fashionable, Mile Budak is glorified while Krleza is questioned; so much that the minister for culture declares that Krleza should be excluded from school texts. Do you have a comment?</b><p>

- You know, my generation grew up with Krleza's values. We wanted social justice, artistic freedom and freedom in general; those were Krleza's messages. He is a giant and irreplaceable in our culture. That is why it is simply idiotic for the minister for culture to argue for the reevaluation of Krleza's works. But above all, I do not understand how the president of the Republic can appoint these people, especially since he considers himself to be a scholar on Krleza. Difference in literary value between writing of Krleza and Mile Budak is so large that it is pointless to even discuss it. The fact that Mile Budak, who was  our Goebbels is today turned into a saint is a dangerous stupidity of the political leadership.  Croatia cannot be built in that tradition.  It is sad that we discuss and talk about that at all.<p>

<h2>Squares of Shame</h2><p>

<b> Q: You were a member of the Cultural Workers Congress in Topusko [town in Croatia] more that 50 years ago.  Do you think that such congress could take place today?</b><p>

- The situation today is significantly different.  Topusko was a message of antifascism, a cry for the free world and artistic freedom.  It was a message from an oppressed people fighting for their freedom together with other nations of the world.  Therefore, the situation then was clear and unequivocal.  Today, we live in a situation in which we do not know who or where we are, due to the encouragement of fascism, against which we fought then, believing that it would never come back.  We can witness how some people proudly proclaim that their fathers were Ustashe and that they think todays Croatia should be a continuation of Pavelic's ISC.  I find this unbelievable and also think that any serious artist cannot accept it.<p>

<b> Q: How did you react to the change of the Zagreb's Victims of Fascism Square's name?</b><p>

- I think that was one of president Tudjman's greatest mistakes.  The question of antifascism is crucial for Croatia, which had to build its future on a basis of its participation in the antifascist coalition.  The stripping of the Victims of Fascism Square's name is a disgrace.  It was the symbol of a time and a nation.  It spits in the face of all antifascists who gave their lives for the freedom of my nation and the world.<p>

<b> Q: A whole string of such vulgar moves by the authorities has taken place: from changing the names of streets and squares to decorating the Ustashe henchmen?</b><p>

- You know, I asked my friends in Germany if it would be possible to name a street or a square after Goring or Goebbels in that country.  They replied that it was crazy even as an idea. And here I see units of Croatian Army bear names of war criminals: Maks Luburic, Rafael Boban and Jure Francetic.  I have even seen tanks with pictures of Ante Pavelic.  I could not believe my eyes.  Anyway, what can one think after watching a TV program in which the president of CDU of Herzeg-Bosna [Croatian self proclaimed state in Bosnia-Hercegovina] is greeted with the fascist raised arm salute at the meeting of Croatian Army in Hercegovina?  These are unimaginable things something our president should certainly think about for his own sake.  I knew him as an antifascist.  How can he allow that something like that happens in his country?<p>

<b> Q: Why do you think Tudjman allows that?</b><p>

- I do not know, although I have often thought about it.<p>

<b> Q: Maybe he really believes in ``reconciliation" between Ustashe [Croatian fascists during the WWII] and Partisans [Yugoslav communist led resistance movement during the WWII]?</b><p>

- These two ideologies cannot be reconciled; they are total opposites, like oil and water.<p>

<b> Q: Maybe he is trying to satisfy the ``other side"?</b><p>

- Which other side?  If a group of fascists is that other side, I do not want to be anywhere close to it.<p>

<b> Q: For decades you have been a close friend of citizen Franjo Tudjman.  Are in you in contact with the president today?</b><p>

- Hardly. I only heard and saw on TV that my paintings were removed from the walls of the President's Residence.<p>

<h2>Tito and Nostalgia</h2><p>

<b> Q: A 50th anniversary of the Auschwitz liberation has recently been commemorated. Some 30 statesmen, Nobel Prize winners etc., traveled to Poland. Do you think the President of Croatia should have been there as well?</b><p>

- If he had wanted, he would have gone there. But to send Mihanovic and Kujundzic, please ...?!<p>

<b> Q: Do you think that division on right and left in politics is useless today?</b><p>

-Top intellectuals, in America and elsewhere, are leftist [liberals] and have a total freedom of speech and are not afraid of being prosecuted for their opinions.  That for me is the left [liberalism].  It is not a political, but a life philosophy. I think that the left is the future everywhere in the world; the world could not progress without such system of beliefs, which  are banned or negated here. Anyway, has not the social justice been the product of the left?  I remember a statement by Mate Granic [Croatian Minister of Foreign Affairs] about how his father, a shepard with a flock of 30 sheep in Makarska area, put seven of his sons through school.  I ask you, in which other country could a shepard  afford to educate so many of his children?<p>

<b> Q: how do you see today that ``period of darkness" and how did you perceive Tito? As a dictator only?</b><p>

- No, totally differently, and people who claim [that Tito was only a dictator] do not want to admit that when Tito broke with Stalin [in 1948], we demonstrated to the whole world that socialism can be totally different, more humane society [then in the Soviet Union]. It is true that the fear of disintegration of Yugoslavia engendered restrictive and police measures, but for the last twenty years we were quickly forging ahead. Some reply that the other countries progressed as well. They did, but it is forgotten that at the end of WWII we had maybe 20km [12m] of asphalt around Zagreb; we had nothing and built everything during the last 20-30 years. Besides, look at what is being destroyed in Bosnia - new buildings, same as anywhere in the world. These are not hovels and shanty towns.<p>

<b> Q: Are you not afraid of being  accused of Yugo nostalgia?</b><p>

- You know, I feel constrained by any space, but I have never been afraid to state, as is written in my [exhibition] catalogues, that I am a Croatian painter. I have never hidden from it and have never been afraid of stating that, but it is a fact that I was  a member of the Yugoslav community, whatever it was. That community had the world's respect. What does Yugo nostalgia mean?    People can be nostalgic for their youth, loves, not for a political situation.<p>

<h2> A Myth Made of Bones</h2><p>

<b> Q: Do you believe in a renewed communication of people from the ex-Yugoslav space?</b><p>

- In spite of everything, sooner or later we shall have to correspond again.  People will have to find each other, regardless of whether we love each other or not. We cannot put Croatia in a helicopter and drop it somewhere in the southern seas and make an island of her. We will have to take into account spiritual, linguistic and cultural links.<p>

<b> Q: You were a student in Belgrade; are you still in contact with your old <br>friends?</b><p>

- There are a number of people whom I love and admire, and who remain the same; people to whom every kind of nationalism is foreign and who were not infected by  this madness in Serbia.  Therefore, I do not have that feeling of break up, because I think they, my friends in Serbia, are disabled like us.<p>

<b> Q: Poets used to be your friends, from Jure Kastelan and Oskar Davico to  Ivan Goran Kovacic and Vlado Gotovac, whose poetry book you recently illustrated. You also illustrated Goran's poem ``Jama"[``Ravine"]; How do you react to all those politically charged excavations of mass graves?</b><p>

- Nobody in his clear mind would try to gain political capital from that. If we really want to do that, then let us do it scientifically, instead of trying to use the bones to write new myths. Things would look totally different from the way in which they are presented today.<p>

<b> Q: What is your reaction to the behavior of your colleagues with respect to the topics of our conversation; why are the ones who would have something to say silent?</b><p>

- It is hard to generalize; I have been terribly disappointed in some of them and some, of whom I expected it the least, proved to be brave.  Still, do not forget that the fear here is palpable and real and that not exactly benign things happen, especially in small towns and in the hinterland.<p>

<hr>
<h2> THE KING AND CROATIANS</h2><p>


<b> Q: What could and how wake up the Croatian public?</b><p>

- It is hard to talk about the Croatian public, so I shall again relate some of my experiences. I was fourteen when King Alexander [ king of Yugoslavia between the WWI and WWII. A Serb. Assassinated by the Croatian fascists in France ] was murdered. The inhabitants of Zagreb came out in their thousands to meet the train which took the King's coffin to Belgrade, from the Sava bridge to Dubrave. They kneeled next to the railroad tracks and cried, a group of [Catholic] nuns next to me wept for their King. The Germans came and we greeted them with flowers. The partisans came.  Zagreb was on her feet, elated.  Tito died.  The whole Zagreb cried, hundreds of thousands were singing ``for every good word" and these are the facts. And that is a picture of us, Croatians.<p>

<h1>Democracy is not a Diktat to the Judicial System of an 
Independent State</h1>

<strong><em>by Zeljko Olujic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Hrvatsko Slovo, Zagreb, Croatia, March 8 1996</h2>

...........<P>

We list the reasons because of which the Hague Tribunal does not
have the right to try Croatian soldiers and officers:<P>

<ol>
<li> No one has punished those criminals against all humanitarian
values who committed crimes against defeated peoples and civilians in
World War II.
<li> No one has punished those statesmen and other criminals who
committed crimes against Croats and prevented independent decision
of Croats about their state freedom and independence.
<li> United Nations were practically founded in 1941 as an organization
whose goal was to maintain the status quo, that is imperialism.
<li> United Nations and other international factors hindered Croatia
and Croatians in Herceg-Bosna in their self-defense against Serb aggression.
With that they broke the international war-time law, which emphatically
speaks against the initiator of the expansionist war as the first
and worst culprit.  From that position, they do not have the right to and
cannot pass unbiased judgment.
<li> International war-time and humanitarian law does not prescribe
punishment nor the degree of seriousness of certain crimes.
<li> None of the existing international conventions prescribes where
and when the punishments will be carried out.  This is not an abstract
matter.  Some countries have capital punishment, others do not.  Some
countries cut off hands of criminals and flog them.  Others send them to 
mental institutions.  The British do all of this to their enemies, but
forgive everything to their [friends, compatriots].  How and which law
should be applied?
<li>  The Hague Tribunal does not have means to conduct its own 
investigations and, what is most important in an investigation,
to collect evidence.  Who is supposed to conduct an investigation?
CIA maybe?  CIA is a state agency of the United States, financed by
and responsible to the U.S.A. government.  It will continue to fabricate
and destroy evidence, but not according to the orders coming from
an unbiased Court, not even the UN, but according to the orders of
the U.S.A. government.<P>

The Tribunal was founded ad hoc.  Therefore, it is not a permanent body
of permanent organizations with permanent laws.  This automatically reduces 
its independence and makes it into a tool of politics and interests of
great world powers.  If it is not a permanent Court, and it is obvious
that it isn't, then, as a political court, it can only conduct political
trials.  It is obvious that this is the case from the fact that both
judges and politicians admit this!  Prosecutor Goldstone himself says
that there will be pressures; the Americans also confirm that.  Therefore,
politics will be the force behind the Court and the Court will blackmail
for politics!  True justice!
<li> All judges and officials are paid by the U.N.  United Nations failed
to protect Croatia and thus helped the aggressors.  Therefore, the function of 
this Court is to exonerate U.N.  That means that such a Court must find such
evidence and interpret available evidence in such a way to paint the victims
as at least as guilty as the aggressors in order to justify U.N.'s inaction.
<li>  Who is paying the Hague Tribunal?  This Court's "fuel" are dollars. 
Money equals results!  Therefore, if the Court wastes time and effort on 
matters which are not important to its financiers, it will automatically
loose funding and will have to disband!
<li> British soldiers and officers passively watched, as well as others
from the U.N. protection force, massacres against Croats and muslims in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.  Therefore they are the accomplices in those war crimes.
But they are not on trial.
<li>  U.N. and its men disarmed the defenders of Srebrenica before the massacre.
They did not defend them, despite the obligation and guarantees; thus they
handed them over to the butchers!  How can that organization try anyone,
when it directly helped with slaughter?
<li> According to the Geneva Convention, from August 12 1949, as well as 
that about the civilians in a war, it is clear that the signatories of the
convention have a duty to follow the Convention only if facing another
signatory or if the other side  follows the Convention as well.
</ol><P>

In conclusion, we condemn every war crime.  The closer it is to us, the 
more dangerous it is.  Happiness cannot be built on suffering, justice
cannot be built on crime.<P>

The crime has been committed for more than a century against the Croatian
people.  This planned trial in the Hague is a part of propaganda and 
the continuation, i.e. justification, of that crime. There is no state
independence without judicial independence.  In the same way as they,
until recently, didn't allow us to use Kuna, now they want to prevent
our judicial independence.<P>

<h1>Arson, Mistreatment and a Lie</h1>

<strong><em>by Dubravko Horvatic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Hrvatsko Slovo, Zagreb, Croatia, 3/15 1996</h2>

Those who have, since August 1995 and the operation "Storm",  maligned the Croatian Army without a break, slandering it as a gang of out-of-control arsonists, have been finally proven wrong; and in Bosnia of all places: leaving those territories which won't belong to their "entity", the Serbs, in full view of the IFOR members and in front of cameras, <a HREF="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/et/access?ac=118660711541&pg=/96/3/11/wbosna11.html">burned</a> every piece non-movable property that could be burned, as they had done in Croatia, on the eve of their escape (because of their crimes) in front of the Croatian Army.  Various Cicaks [Ivan Zvonimir Cicak, the president of the <a HREF="/home/marko/public_html/hho.html">Croatian Helsinki Committee</a>] and Serb leaders in Croatia, who accused Croatia of "ethnic cleansing" when she was liberating her occupied territories, cannot now, after all, say that the Croatian Army is setting Ilidza on fire, since it is known that the Muslims didn't let Croatian policemen from Kiseljak to enter that Sarajevo suburb; they also did not allow them to enter Hadzici.  At the same time the world is discovering Serb crimes in Visegrad and is amazed by the scale of the genocide, as if someone after Borovo Selo, Celije and Banovina in the summer of 1991 can be amazed by anything coming from the Serbs!  Nevertheless, the Muslims, who have established themselves as a separate ethnic group in this war, are applying in some places the methods of those who had attacked them in 1992; but instead of applying them on the Serbs they are applying them on the Croats; in that way they are mocking the agreements from Washington and Dayton: we have already mentioned that the Muslims <a HREF="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/et/access?ac=118660711541&pg=/96/3/7/wbosna07.html">did not allow the Croatian policemen</a> to work together with the Muslim and Serb policemen on the territory of the Bosnian Federation; the Muslims also blocked the return of Croats to Sarajevo, formed a single nation muslim canton in Sarajevo, banned the movement of the HVO [Bosnian Croat militia] vehicles through Bugojno and expelled the Croats from Bugojno; it seems that this partial list of Croatian suffering in the hands of Muslims will in the future grow longer.<P>

Instead of concentrating on these burning problems, a large part of the Croatian media and intellectuals are drawing the public attention away from these topics and confusing our present with the demonization of the past.  For example, in a vulgar article ("Don't babble"), published a few days ago in <a HREF="/info/students/marko/cropat.html#vjesnik"><em>Vjesnik</em></a>, certain <a HREF="/info/students/marko/feral/feral20.html#lukavin">Luka Vincetic</a>, who had, in Babic's <em>Oko</em>  celebrated with his ridiculous poems the October Bolsevik Revolution and AVNOJ 1943 [WWII conference which laid foundations of a post-war federal Yugoslav state], actually Yugoslavia, attacked Vinko Nikolic [a former Ustashe (Croatian fascists in WWII) ideologist, today a prominent Croatian patriot; he was <a HREF="http://www.sabor.hr/sabor/zupandom/odbori/znanost.html">appointed to the upper house of the Croatian parliament</a> by the Croatian president], lecturing him and the readers about the NDH [Independent State of Croatia, a fascist puppet Croatian state during the WWII].  It doesn't matter that yugobolsevik Vincetic (who is, to tell the truth, to the shame of the Holy Mother Church and Djakovo bishopric, a Catholic priest) thinks that "the Ustashe regime was ... dark, evil and bloodthirsty"; what matters is what he is, seemingly unintentionally, saying about the contemporary Croatia.  Addressing Nikolic, Vincetic says:"...those who are attacking you today are in some ways in a similar situation to that in which you used to be in the past - they hardly get a chance to say anything..."  Such a lie can only be written by a die-hard yugobolsevik, who cooperates with all quasi-communist publications and who hurried to that obscure gathering in "Mimara" [museum] in order to bow to the ideologists of Croatocide [murder of Croats?].  At the end of his long article, comrade priest says that "in todays Croatia, the reason will prevail, sooner or later..."  I agree that there is no sense when, instead of the healthy criticism, lies and slanders in the attacks on the authorities, like those in Vincetic's article, are allowed to consciously divert attention from real problems.<P>

A version of the above mentioned article by Luka Vincetic was published in the Split weekly <em>Feral Tibune</em>: <a HREF="/info/students/marko/feral/feral20.html#lukavin">Fasnicki Fascism</a>.<P>

<h1>Kama and Tomorrow</h1>

<strong><em>by Viktor Ivancic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, 3/11 1996</h2>

Certain historical and political circumstances, especially in these territories, could have taught us that it is much easier to turn a man into a pig, than to turn a pig into a man; we also could have learned to what extent it was possible to establish a <em>culture of killing</em> as a religion.  There are always those who are willing to kill, but they don't always have appropriate ideals to justify that killing.  On the other hand, there are men who write, publish and recommend materials for the nightmares of potential killers; they know how to draw a halo of higher ideals over a potential crime.<P>

Most frequently, men kill in the name of a leader, state and nation, in the name of <em>sacral etatisme</em> whose sunday tolling calls from time to time for a <em>ritual killing</em>, turning seemingly meek people into devil's children.  Only a few realized the fatal significance of those first announcements, a few who understood that a publicly recommended crime would certainly be committed, in five, ten or fifty years.<P>

Bozo Jelic, an Ustasha from Siroki Brijeg, was a member of the so-called Devil's Division in WWII, and a Wehrmacht soldier on the Eastern front; he was decorated with an Iron Cross of the first and second order and greeted the German capitulation in action: in <a HREF="http://sunset.backbone.olemiss.edu/~mirjana/rat/jasenovac/jasenovac-INDEX.html">Jasenovac</a>.  Today, this 77-year-old sturdy man is photographed for the Croatian papers (<em>Nacional</em>, 3/1/96) in front of a wall on which his war souvenir, a Kama [Ustashe knife, used for butchering of people], is displayed.  A rusty Kama under the picture of Poglavnik.  This Kama looks as if it has been used, maybe in Jasenovac, maybe frequently.<P>

<IMG SRC="/info/students/marko/pictures/kama.gif" WIDTH=295 HIGHT=281 ALT="Picture from nacional">Nacional, 3/1 1996.<P>

A crooked blade of Kama as a political message, was brought to its final conclusion in the paper published and edited by Pavelic's son in law, <a HREF="/info/students/marko/globus2.html">Srecko Psenicnik</a> (<em>Nezavisna Drzava Hrvatska</em>), whose publication has recently begun in Zagreb.  Under a photograph of ten or so stiff dead bodies we can see a printed warning: "This is how the enemies of the Croatian people will end up!".  As far as the message is concerned it doesn't really matter whether their throats had been cut by Bozo Jelic or some other trustworthy Croat.<P>

Nevertheless, if in todays Croatia it is possible to perform the coarsest possible apology of crimes, then we should prepare for the future consequences of those "democratic customs".  How can we know whether Bozo Jelic or some other trustworthy Croat, with a trophy Kama in his hand, will submit a protest because of somebody's insufficient patriotism?  Will he be hailed as a hero because of that?  Since, according to the Kama blade, used  "in the name of the people and the state" and, therefore, led by that huge and communal "us", the "real" Croats do not butcher because of vices but because of highest ideals.<P>

<IMG SRC="/info/students/marko/pictures/enemies.gif"  WIDTH=387 HIGHT=312 ALT="Picture from NDH">Nezavisna Drzava Hrvatska, March 1996.<P>

Of course, these are the extremes; but behind them we can find an ideological foundation which is almost the same as the official ideology, which includes a clear list of "democratic" priorities.  How many among the top moralists in the ranks of the patriotic Croatian nationalists are today ready to say that the mentioned "values" are not such that one should not, under any circumstances, kill for them?<P>

Before we turn our noses away from the latest photographic messages and head for the Croatian democratic chaos, it is worth mentioning that Bozo Jelic and <em>Nezavisna Drzava Hrvatska</em> have not appeared out of nowhere in our contemporary reality.  They are simply the most vulgar, totally unsophisticated pilgrims of the culture of killing which is today and here cultivated as the <em>state religion</em> (or the <em>religion of the state</em>, whichever you prefer).  Its connotations are such that they can always (actually whenever necessary!) turn up like blood on the ground.  Because all "ideals" with which a crime has been justified or recommended are in front of us; they are offered accompanied by a beautiful tolling of the bells as the highest virtues of the cult:  there is the Croatian people, there is the Croatian state and their ever more numerous enemies.

<h1><a NAME="lukavin">Fasnicki Fascism</a></h1>

<strong><em>by Luka Vincetic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, 3/11 1996</h2>


Those who publicize the "objectivization" of Pavelic's Ustashe and the <A HREF="http://cypress.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~eesrdan/ndh/ndh-inWW2.html">Independent State of Croatia </a>[Nezavisna Drzava Hrvatska, NDH] between 1941 and 1945 are doing that in several ways: one of their methods is to "polish" the defunct Croatian state by claiming that, for example, it was an important art center.  They forget to ask the following question: how can we discuss flourishing of the national art while at the same time people were massacred (for example, Jewish artists from Croatia) according to the racist laws in Ustashe concentration camps?  It would be the same as if I, as a Catholic priest, accepted a "statement"(and we can see those around these days) that during Pavelic's state the Catholic faith lived and developed as never before, although in parallel with its "life" Serbian Churches and Jewish Synagogues were demolished.<P>

In the current "rehabilitation" of the Ustashe (by this I refer to the leadership which was in power since the founding of NDH on April 10 1941 until its demise in May 1945) it is not (even) a problem that some are trying to correct the past, although that carries a lot of emotional load; the evil is in the following: Ustashe "love for Croatia", in which everyone was allowed to do as he wished, is recommended as <em>a model and practice for the todays Croatia</em> where there is no sin of crime as long as one "loves the Croatian people."<P>

One of the propagandists of this sort is Mr. <strong>Vinko Nikolic</strong>, without a doubt a strong personality on the Croatian cultural scene, a writer, a former Ustasha with duties in NDH and a member of the upper house of the Croatian parliament, appointed by the Croatian president.  Nikolic has lately been reveling himself as an Ustashe apologist, as for example in a recent interview for <em>Nedjeljni Vjesnik</em> under the title "All our 'sins' came out of our love for Croatia."<P>

<h2>False Mary Magdalene</h2>

There are two reasons for my discussion of Mr. Nikolic's statements: one is that I belong to a camp opposed to Mr. Nikolic and his sympathizers and that I have written about my beliefs a lot in the past.  The other is that Mr. Vinko Nikolic has always emphasized his Catholic faith and that his reduction of a God-hating regime to "mistakes", instead of an assessment based on its monstrous practice which was against all principles of our faith, is nothing but  blasphemy coming out of a Christian mouth.<P>

From that point of view, the discussion of whether the Ustashe regime was, or was not, fascist and pro-nazifascist is irrelevant.  That regime was dark, evil and bloodthirsty and there is no "polish" which can present it as anything else.  Therefore, I think that toying with Pavelic is a spiritual death (especially in view of contemporary Christian education) for every Christian in todays Croatia, and at the same time the betrayal of the Croatian national interests: our country is trying to return to the not quite ideal community of European states.<P>

I will start, Mr. Nikolic, with the conclusion of your interview in <em>Nedeljni Vjesnik</em>.  Very skillfully you silence your critics and those who disagree with the idyllic picture of NDH by saying: "Judge all of us in that way, and let the one without a sin be the one to throw the first stone."  Mr. Nikolic, you are not any more in the same position as <strong>Mary Magdalene</strong> whose impotence was attacked by a system, as was the case with you while you were in emigration.  When I read your book ,"In front of the Homeland's door," in Germany, almost immediately after it was published, I was on your side, since your basic human rights were denied.  There is no man who did not sympathize with those sufferers who had been after WWII sentenced by the vengeful communist authorities, supposedly "in the name of the people"; instead, their human rights and freedoms were violated; honest people disappeared together with those who should have been tried for their crimes; all this was done according to different rules and by different people.  Today, you are a well respected man in Croatia and a member of the Croatian parliament (although your good intentions and the good intentions of the man who had appointed you remain doubtful).  On the other hand, those who are "attacking" you are in the situation you used to be in: they can hardly be heard.  Your "side" is much louder and your opponents are publicly compromised as the "enemies of the people".<P>

<h2>Swastika Switch</h2>

You were chosen as the "man of the year" at the end of 1995 by the Council of the Croatian Academic Association; the full title was "the man for reconciliation and dialogue"; in its New Years eve issue <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em> published an article written by its collaborator <strong>Dr. Branimir Luksic</strong> who, in chosen words, justified that honor, emphasizing that the Croatian Academic Association by bestowing that honor on you "wanted to emphasize the importance of reconciliation as opposed to party politics, uncompromising attitude and intolerance."<P>

Therefore, take my criticism (since that is the kind of man you are) as a sort of a dialogue; not as a hammer with which I'm trying to destroy everything around me, but as a well argued approach and a desire to confront your "peaceful conscience" which you haughtily mention a lot in your interview in <em>Vjesnik</em>.  Even the latest Church document written by the pope John Paul II, "Ut unum sint", from the last year, states that "the ecumenical dialogue is characterized by a common search for the truth, especially in the Church."  Those who selected you as the "Man of the year 1995" should have known that.  Actually, we seek truth through dialogue, together, in order to mature for reconciliation and unity.<P>

Are you a truthful man?<P>

You say that "Ustashe creed was not an ideology."  I agree with you; it wasn't an ideology because Pavelic and his bandits were not intelligent enough to develop an ideology;  Ustashe creed was something much worse than ideology: it was the means for the <em>Balkanization of the Crotian politics</em>.  Ustashe accepted and, unfortunately, developed all methods of the political violence which have made the Balkans "famous" since the Turkish times and the Serbian uprisings at the beginning of the last century.  Your former collaborator in Ustashe press, <strong>Dr. Jure Jareb</strong>, who has come to his senses, claims the same: "even during the war," he says," I had an impression that Pavelic must have studied the formation of the Serbian state at the beginning of the 19th century, especially the politics and the rule of Karadorde and Milan Obrenovic.  It seems to me that Karadorde and Milos Obrenovic and their ruling methods were an inspiration and a model for Pavelic.  That Serb political school was completed with the Italian political practice, primarily by fascism..."<P>

Because of that, it is ridiculous and childish, Mr. Nikolic, to, as semi-illiterate Croatian drunks, "interpret" Ustashe creed as "older that both Nazism and Fascism and unrelated to either of them." Although this is an imputation, since I'm talking about <em>Pavelic's Ustashe creed</em>, let us think about what would happen to a neonazi in Germany if he used the same logic and concluded that no one should be offended by his <em>Hackenkreutz</em> since it is actually a swastika, a symbol much older than Hitler and the Nazi symbols?!<P>

<h2>Let us Be Fanatics!</h2>

You defend yourself by saying that you were neither an "Ustashe ideologist" nor a powerful man in NDH.  I will quote the beginning and the end of your article which was published in <em>Ustashe Youth</em> (Ustaska Mladez, issue number 9, 9/28 1941), a youth supplement to <em>Ustasha</em>, the publication of the Ustashe liberation movement, published by the "Ustashe Staff".  In that article, under the title "We are believers" you play an Ustashe "apostle" and exclaim: "Our faith is NDH!  We are the followers of our glorious faith!  We want that all Croats become the followers of that faith! (...)  All of us must understand, that we were all sentenced to death, and that either us, or them will defeat the death! <em>We live with Croatia; without it we die a terrible, horrendous death.  With her, our wonderful state, we stand; without her, we fall.  That is why we have to build Croatian fanaticism, the faith in Poglavnik.  Ustashe Croatia must become our religion.  All of us deaf, all of us without our thoughts, without our feelings, without private concerns, without greed, office, groups when the State is concerned.  Carry out orders, work, obey.  Persevere, believe and wait!</em> (emphasis Vinko Nikolic, author's remark)  We have to cultivate and strengthen Croatian fanaticism!"<P>

Anyone in the least bit familiar with the ideological propaganda, after reading these lines, will give you an appropriate title without a second thought: the leader of the Ustashe hunt on souls!  I've trembled every time I've read these lines, as I couldn't believe that any man could make such an about-turn and celebrate a state in which all Biblical values had been turned upside down: Rights, People, Politics...  Even if that man was young, pretentious, unexperienced and professionally ambitious!<P>

You want to present yourself to the <em>Vjesnik</em> readers as a "public, mostly cultural, worker."  Therefore, you were ideologically neutral during Pavelic's rule like the majority of Croatian artists who worked during those years without a pause.  I need to ask you this:  prove that to me, by a single act with which, as a poet, publicist and manager of several cultural institutions during the Ustashe regime you used your signature in protection of, for example, a Jewish artist whom the Ustashe had taken to a concentration camp or had intended to extradite to the Germans?  As for example did during NDH, Jakov Gotovac, Boris Papandopulo, Vladislav Kusan, Marijana Radev, Josip Gostic and many others.  Please, don't babble about Krleza, Nazor and Goran Kovacic: they only for a moment, at the politically suitable time, took part in the Ustashe "strategy" of the Croatian ubermensch.  And that was all.<P>

Therefore, you, Mr. Nikolic, remained the same man you were in 1938, 1941, 1945, 1970... and you support those who want to repeat those times in todays Croatia since 1990 until today.<P>

<h2>The End of Reason</h2>

As a conclusion, I would like to talk to you as a Catholic to a Catholic.  By criticizing the "idolatry of our century," christian thinker <strong>Jacques Maritain</strong> described a certain type of thinkers who had deserted "the natural principles of reason and can be compared to an animal which has lost its instincts, for example to a bee which is unable to produce honey or a penguin which doesn't know how to build a nest."  Then he warned: " The reason is the human instinct.  The Church used this instinct to spread its message; she strengthened its laws.  Today we are deserting intellect.  The crisis of truth is the crisis for intellect and reason;  at the same time it is the crisis of the Church."<P>

By pronouncing my judgment of you, I haven't lost my ability to judge other events, on the contrary: not only were some mistakes made in the Pavelic's state, as you claim, but that state was in itself a <em>sin</em>.  You don't understand, or refuse to understand, one simple thing:  Pavelic's state abolished "common sense" and the todays Croatia, the republic, is making a mistake by relying on you.  Even in your position of a political emigrant, which more and more reminds me of a recent humiliation by many church celibate priests, now married "lay priests", who according to their own reasoning made a carnal compromise with the world.  And us, who stayed and home, tried to find a modus vivendi with you.<P>

In that way we exchanged "different paths" with those who claim to be the "only choice [for Croatia]".  In todays Croatia, the reason will prevail sooner or later, and you will be remembered as an unreformed preacher of the "love" for Croatia, who never wanted to face the truth.  Although you wear a monumental head of white hair.<P>

<h1>GEOPOLITICAL GAMES: Serbian Secret Plans for Prevlaka</h1>

<strong><em>by Mladen Klemencic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Hrvatski Obzor, Zagreb , Croatia, 4/1 1996</h2>


The question of Prevlaka, or more precisely the peninsula and
point of Ostra, is one of the most persistent territorial
questions to arise from the break-up of the former Yugoslav
federation. It is characteristic that since the autumn of
1991, when it first became a topic of interest, practically no
development towards an agreement has been made. For Croatia
this question no longer exists since it is "de iure" perfectly
clear and "de facto" we are close to a final solution. The
other side, however, consistently attempts to keep the
question open from which we may logically conclude that it is
of particular importance to them. To mention the "other side"
means to address not one but at least three actors. One is
Montenegro and Podgorica (Montenegro's capital), which borders
with Croatia in that region. The second is Serbia, i.e.
Belgrade, which, thanks to the Serbo-Montenegrin Federation,
represents the federation on the international field. Finally,
there is the "Serbian republic", i.e. the Serbian unit in
Bosnia-Herzegovina which has recently acquired a certain
international legitimacy and which has been included in the
"games" concerning Prevlaka since the beginning.<P>

There are several standard "arguments" on the basis of which
the three Yugoslav sides are seeking Prevlaka. They are of a
different nature but their common feature is that all are
equally unconvincing. Montenegro's most often mentioned
argument is the alleged threat to the security of the bay
which would be jeopardised by Croatian presence on one of the
promontories which close the entrance to the bay. Allegedly,
the security of entering and leaving the bay by ship would be
jeopardised. To this argument is added the principle of
"geographic unity of the bay", according to which the entire
bay should belong to Montenegro, i.e. to "Yugoslavia". Not one
of these arguments has a valid basis. International law, which
has a very well worked out system of rules and instructions,
in particular in the area of maritime borders, does not
mention the above principle at all. For the political division
of a bay between two or more states, the decisive point is the
one on which the land border emerges onto the sea coast. If
this point is within the bay area, as is the case with the Bay
of Kotor, then there is no principle according to which a
coastal state could be denied participation over the expanse
of sea in the bay regardless of the configuration of the land.
In the same way, international maritime law does not recognise
the military-strategic reasons which would give one coastal
state the right to "throw out" another coastal state from the
bay. Above all, even if the entrance of the bay itself were
divided into two territorial seas, the Montenegrin, i.e. the
"Yugoslav" side would have half an entrance which is still
wide and deep enough for normal use.<P>

<h2>"Three-way exchange"</h2>

If Croatia were to give up Prevlaka i.e. should Zagreb accept
a border change, this would be very significant to the other
side in terms of prestige. It would serve, namely, as proof to
the domestic and foreign public of Croatia's "guilt" and it
would justify the aggression of 1991. Montenegrins who follow
the Greater Serbia idea would also welcome it. In 1991, the
Montenegrins participated in quite large numbers in the
aggression on the Dubrovnik area and disgraced themselves to
boot; the receipt of Prevlaka would justify this obviously
thoughtless act. For similar reasons Belgrade could use some
good propaganda, however, since Belgrade needs an excuse for
an aggression of somewhat greater proportions, the question is
how convincing the Prevlaka story would be, particularly among
the Serbian public.<P>

The most frequent and so far most detailed combination has
been  the so-called "three-way exchange" whereby Croatia would
give  up Prevlaka and gain the Dubrovnik hinterland. This last
combination was topical, hopefully for the last time,
immediately after the Dayton Agreement. This combination is
the most complex but also the most revealing as far as the
real intentions of the other side are concerned. In order to
realise this combination Croatia would have to give up not
only Prevlaka but also a part of the Konavle area. On several
occasions, the entire Konavle area east of Cilipi was
mentioned. (The "Serbian republic" simply would not be able to
emerge directly onto Prevlaka without at least a part of the
Konavle area because of the configuration of the terrain and
the formation of a border line.)<P>

Croatia, of course, has no valid reason for accepting such a
transaction. Moral and fundamental reasons, as well as
international law, all speak in favour of Croatia remaining on
Prevlaka. There is no reason for accepting "Yugoslavia's"
proposal, particularly now that the internal borders of Bosnia-
Herzegovina have been drawn as determined in Dayton and
according to which a part of the Dubrovnik hinterland within B-
H borders has fallen under B-H Federation rule. It is
necessary to observe, however, the obstinacy of Belgrade and
its refusal to let go of the "three-way" exchange which is
"three-way" only because of Belgrade's interests. Montenegro,
namely, gains nothing since territorial gains are meant for
the "Serbian republic".<P>

This obstinacy is somewhat incomprehensible because there is
no logical necessity for the "Serbian republic" to have access
to the sea.  Its needs for the sea, which objectively speaking
are not much, may be satisfied by transit through its federal
neighbour Montenegro. Not only this, but the coast south-east
of Cavtat is anything but suitable for the construction of a
sea port. If we were to add to this the construction of roads
and railway lines, it is clear that the "Serbian republic"
could not possibly find sufficient financial means in the near
future for such a venture.<p>

<h2>The significance for Montenegro</h2>

At the end of the review of the existing arguments it is
necessary to mention the fact that the current situation on
Prevlaka and around it is actually perfectly acceptable for
all sides. Prevlaka is formally Croatian, however, UN
observers are present on the peninsula itself. Their presence
does not bother Croatia since in the nearest Konavle village
of Vitaljina, everyday life is in no way limited by the
observers. All the while, the Montenegrin, that is the
Yugoslav side, is enjoying unrestricted blackmarketeering.
Since Croatian border posts are not on Prevlaka itself they
cannot obstruct Italian and "Yugoslav" blackmarketeers in
their important business, and neither do the observers. The
current situation is also satisfying to the international
community since a small and therefore cheap observer team
(approx. 25 people) maintains complete peace thereby
fulfilling its task in at least one location.<P>

The analysis so far has shown that real reasons for
controversy do not really exist. However, the obstinacy of the
Yugoslav side seems to point in another direction, and this
means that apart from the already mentioned arguments there
must be other less public ones for Prevlaka to be important.
We may understand these reasons if we look at the entire story
from a somewhat broader context and from a different angle as
far as space, idea and strategy are concerned. If it is all
considered within the context of permanent plans for the
formation of Greater Serbia, then the Prevlaka story gains a
new dimension, with the issue being less on the amputation of
Croatian territory (although this remains a part of the plan)
and more on the pacification of their insufficiently reliable
federal partner - Montenegro. How Montenegro is vital to
Belgrade was testified to by the recent BBC Television
documentary series "Death Of Yugoslavia". We must remember
Jovic's comments on the situation in the autumn of 1991 when
the Montenegrin president Bulatovic for a short time accepted
the Carrington plan, in other words turned his back on
Belgrade. Jovic called this the "deepest crisis among our
leadership". From Zagreb's perspective, Bulatovic's infidelity
seems far less serious.<P>

<h2>Two "Montenegrin flanks"</h2>

In the scenario of the final pacification of the federal
partner the key point is the main polygon of the "Yugoslav
Army" for which the Pester Plateau was chosen. The plateau is
bordered to the north by Mount Golija and to the south, more-
or-less, by the Serbo-Montenegrin border. In recent times, all
the more important military exercises are carried out there.
The polygon, as well as the entire territory of Montenegro,
according to the current division on military districts falls
under the zone of responsibility of the 2nd army with its
headquarters in Podgorica and the Pester polygon is the main
concentration point of the entire area. With its position, the
plateau cuts through the historic area of Novi Pazar's
Sandzak, distancing the eastern (mostly Muslim) part not only
from the western (mostly Serbian) part but also from the B-H
border which is even more important. The second direction of
activity, in case of need, is towards Kosovo as an added
support to the pacification forces already deployed in this
once autonomous province. The main observation target,
however, is Montenegro. From this point, namely, two flanks
are to run which would completely separate Montenegro from
Croatia on one side and from Albania on the other. In this
way, the Montenegrin core would be completely within Serbia's
"embrace" and a final blow could be given to any remnants of
the "greens", i.e. believers in Montenegro's independence. The
left flank of this "final embrace" would cross the "orthodox"
"Serbian Republic" and emerge on the coast over current
Croatian territory in Konavle, including Prevlaka. For this
reason, Belgrade needs access to the sea for the "Serbian
Republic" even more than it needs Prevlaka because it is this
tampon which will completely cut off Montenegro from Croatia.
In a sub-variation of this scenario, Montenegro may formally
annex the Prevlaka Peninsula but on the condition that the
"Serbian Republic" has access to the sea to the west of it.
It is clear that this scenario to Croatia means amputation of
not only Prevlaka but also the greater part of the Konavle
area.<P>

The second flank of the "embrace" has as its aim the
Serbianisation of the border land between Montenegro and
Albania. It is a well-known fact that this part of Montenegro
is inhabited by ethnic Albanians. Since they are an unreliable
element, it is necessary to change the demographic structure
in an artificial way. This is to be accomplished by building a
new naval base in Valdanosa near Ulcinj; in fact, the removal
of the "Yugoslav" navy from Boka to Valdanosa has already
started.  When the new base is ready, it will become a navy
stronghold. When all the departments are transferred, along
with the military personnel and accompanying services,
including their families of course, this will be a completely
new element, loyal to Belgrade, which will carry out
pacification and stop any possible anti-Serb connection
between Montenegro and Albania. Apart from this we also have
Podgorica, where a significant mass of those loyal to Belgrade
has been created around the army headquarters. From the Pester
polygon, though, a decisive blow is always possible in order
to break any Montenegrin resistance by "silent smothering".<P>

<h2>Croatia is not the main aim</h2>

The described scenario explains Belgrade's interest in
Prevlaka and the importance of Prevlaka in a new dimension is
shown in its entirety. Since Belgrade is truly interested in
the pacification of Montenegro, pressure on Croatia concerning
Prevlaka will continue. The intensity of the pressure will
also show the validity of the described scenario. It is only
if Belgrade withdraws from its rationally inexplicable support
of access to the sea for the "Serbian Republic", if it
withdraws its request for a revision into the border at
Prevlaka, and if it recognises Croatia within its
internationally recognised borders, will it convince us that
it has truly given up on its Greater Serbia policy. Until that
happens, the described scenario is a probability and should be
borne in mind. Of course, Croatia is not the main aim, i.e. it
is no longer the main aim as it has been until now, so there
is no reason for alarm. In the past several years Belgrade has
surely provided us with enough proof that it cannot be
trusted, in particular after several symbolic and not too
convincing peace measures and words. What is much more
worrying is the naivet  among international mediators who are
prepared to forgive Belgrade everything even before they are
truly convinced in its real intentions, i.e. the uncertainty
of the real situation in Montenegro and the readiness and will
of the Montenegrins to disclose the Belgrade scenario on time.<P>

<TITLE> Serbs and Croatian Elections</TITLE>

<h1>  Which Year is This?</h1><p>

 
<h2><em> by Maja Freundlich</em> <br>  Hrvatski Obzor, 10/9/95, Zagreb, Croatia</i></h2><p>



<hr>

The race has begun.  Croatian political parties are already pretty excited;  their pre-election competition, after initial wandering, has already indicated the basic tone and shape of the election campaign.  It is already possible to get an idea about what certain parties will criticize, what they will claim as their achievement and how they will behave.<P>

Still, there is a party, which belongs to the croatian state and the croatian political corpus, but its pre-election approach is full of unintelligible borrowing, full of aggression which belongs to a different time, different relations and the past.  Serbian Peoples Party (SPP) has approached relations with the Croatian government and state with repeatedly expressed crudeness, trying to challenge the authorities and provoke a clash through use of lies; clash which would according to their wishes grow into a scandal and finally absolutely cast a shadow on the elections, deleting their real purpose.<p>

Let us remember two public appearances of the party representatives  which occured in the last few days.  First, SPP sent a letter to Krunoslav Olujic, the president of the State election commission, in which it puts forward twenty questions.  SPP asked for data about the number of voters of serbian nationality.  Recall what this was called less than a year ago.  Even a mention of a certain "number of Serbs" here and there was called "counting" and could have put you in one of those serb hotels with a foul odor of torture.<P>

<h2> "Too Few Candidates" for Serbs</h2>

Then SPP asked the Election Commission what would the political and voting rights of serb voters be as well as whether they would be guaranteed secrecy of their ballots.  What will their rights be?  Well, the same as those of all the other citizens of the state of Croatia.  What should their rights be?  Greater?  In which year are we today?  1975 or 1995?  Giving a justification for its question, SPP stated that Serbs voting rights have been limited by  the <strong>order of obligatory instructions number III.</strong>  According to the order,  three representatives of the serb ethnic community or minority will be elected and voters can circle only one name on the ballot.  Well, how many names wold the serb voters like to circle?  How many votes would each of them like?  Even Croats in Croatia can on their ballots circle the name of only one candidate.  Should a Serb in Croatia again be worth as much as two and somewhere as three Croats?<P>

Further, SPP with authority asked about the <A HREF="ref.html">number of Serbs in Croatia</a>.  "Exactly how many citizens of serb nationality are there?  On which state or international indicators is this number based on?"  SPP also asked "whether the Serbs will be denied a right to have their party list" based on nationality.  Where in the world are there democratic elections based on the nationality of the citizens.  Croatia is an absolute exception in this and allows for that possibility only because the Croatian government doesn't miss any opportunity to show its generosity and open arms towards Serbs, who pillaged Croatia for seventy years and then <a HREF="ref.html"> slaughtered and burned it</a> for another five.  In Croatia even Croats cannot use their nationality for participation in politics, but their membership in a political party.  SPP is a lawful and registered party in the republic of Croatia.  Who is preventing it to submit its own state election list?  Well, if in Croatia there are indeed more Serbs then the Croatian government claims, if the numbers were, as the SPP insinuated, falsified, then it is obvious that with such a state election list SPP would have to obtain more than enough votes for a triumphant entry into the parliament.<P>

<h2>What are they afraid of?</h2>

SPP then claimed that the national identification at voting booths in front of the election commission would affect secrecy of the ballot.  Well, how would they like to vote for a separate serb list?  How to protect both sheep and money?  If they don't want to express themselves as Serbs, why demand special rights?  What are they afraid of?  Their bad conscience?  Well, if they have it, why do they want to vote in a Croatian election?  If they don't, why are they afraid to be counted as Serbs?<P>

Finally, Dukic and his lot, asked "how will in the elections participate croatian citizens of serb nationality who will at the time of the election be situated in internationally unrecognized states in which Croatia has a Representative Office?"  There is only one such state, Serbia.  Croatian citizens of serbian nationality who "happen to be" there during the war have either already made their choice or have committed many crimes end fled in front of the Storm. Maybe, Dukic would like to quickly obtain domovnice [a document, proof of Croatian citizenship] for serb fugitives and then, using the elections as an excuse, bring them back quickly and without an investigation.<P>

This is not far from the truth, since Dukic several days after the letter held a press conference on which he "again, after numerous previous attempts," asked " Croatia to solve the problem of the citizenship of the Serb refugees."  Which problem?  Problem for whom?  They, with the escape clearly showed what they thought about their citizenship.  Before that, they with logs, drunken howling, wooden skewers, arson, abductions, torture, beatings, killings, slaughter, rape, looting, bombs, lunas, orkans [middle range missiles, which were launched on Zagreb by the Serbs], snipers, mortars, aircraft - showed where their patriotism was and what they thought about the Croatian state.  They spit on and desecrated the croatian coat of arms and the flag and thus clearly showed what they thought about the patriotism and croatian statehood.  Finally, they fled, looting everything and taking with them conscience black as coals and with that proved what they think about their citizenship.<P> 

At the end of the press conference Veselin Pejnovic informed saddened Croatian public that "In the FR Yugoslavia they are mostly thinking about how to return the Serb refugees to their homes in Croatia."  We never doubted that.  Of course Milosevic wants to get rid of them, of course that he wants to return his conquering fifth column to Croatia.  We are wandering why Veselin Pejnovic even cares about that?  Certainly, he doesn't have doubts about his patriotism, loyalty and his personal position regarding Milosevic's "musings".<P>

A new adaptive filtering algorithm which minimizes the variance of the 
squared error subject to a constraint on the mean squared error (MSE) 
is proposed and studied.  For the adaptive linear combiner signal processing 
configuration, this algorithm, called the LVCMS algorithm for the least 
variance subject to a constraint on the mean squared error, has a gradient 
that is a weighted linear combination of the least mean squares (LMS) and 
least mean fourth (LMF) algorithm gradients.  Theoretical expressions are 
derived for the LVCMS algorithm convergence factor and misadjustment, and 
comparisons are made with the LMS and LMF adaptive rules for Gaussian, 
Laplacian and uniform plant noise driving term distributions.  Simulation 
studies reveal that the theoretical values are quite close to experimental 
results.  Performance comparisons of the LVCMF, LMS, LMF algorithms based 
upon Monte Carlo simulation studies indicate that the LVCMS adaptation rule 
not only can yield a small variance of the squared error, but it also produces 
very favorable values of the mean squared error and the mean squared 
coefficient error.

<h1>Our Existence is a Crime</h1>

<strong><em>by Dubravko Horvatic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Hrvatsko Slovo, Zagreb, Croatia, March 22 1996</h2>

What kind of evil have the Croats inflicted on Muslims (who in the Kallay
manner are calling themselves Bosniaks, as if that regional name did not
belong to the whole population of Bosnia, equally to Croats, Serbs, Jews
and others), what kind of evil have they inflicted on Muslims when the 
Muslims, not only bar Croats from those territories which have been
taken over from the Serbs, but are also expelling them from those areas from
where neither Muslims nor Serbs had managed earlier to dislodge the Croatian
population.  A part of Croatian opposition "knew" as early as 1993 
what was going on there and wrote about it in an "Open letter to the 
president of Croatia, Dr. Franjo Tudman," which was initially published in
the "European weekly edition" of the Sarajevo daily <em>Oslobodenje</em>.
The letter was signed by six insignificant personalities, who think of themselves
highly, so much so that they called on the president of the state, a man who
had been elected by the majority of the people, to resign.  Briefly, they
claimed that the president "with his long term orientation towards the  
division of Bosnia-Hercegovina," enabled ," the tragic split of this 
thousands year old, multicultural and desirable state."  Next, they 
accused "Hercegovina oligarchy," (which is according to the six authors
of the letter "supervised" by Dr. Tudman) of "pushing us in a war against the
Muslims."  None of the six authors (and as far as I know, four of them 
were loyal sons of the [Communist] Party!) remembered at the time slimy statements by 
Alija Izetbegovic about the assistance he expected from the Yugoslav Peoples
Army, after the experience from Vukovar and Ravno [place in Hercegovina where,
according to the Croats "the Serb aggression on Bosnia-Hercegovina" begun], 
none of them remembered Izetbegovic's rejection of Croatian military assistance, nor his statements
made in Turkey during Summer 1993, that Serbs and Croats were exterminating
"the Bosniak nation"; above all, all those who accused Croats for the aggression
against Muslims forgot about the "Islamic Declaration" by a former Serb
Alija Izetbegovic and his group, from 1974; there, among other, one can find
these words: "There can be no peace and coexistence between the Islamic faith
and non-Islamic social and political institutions."  In accordance with these
words, Izetbegovic's regime attacked in 1993, in the operation "Tito", Croatian
settlements in central Bosnia and carried out a genocide against Croats; today
those same authorities print anti-Croat textbooks, publish historical 
forgeries in <em>Ljiljan</em> in addition to political programs according to
which Sarajevo (were Croats were 35% of population in 1910) would become
the European center for 15 million of European Muslims; further the Muslim
authorities continue to harass Croats in every possible way; they even send
out those international robbers, the Mojahedeen, to attack Croats.  It is obvious
what is the Croat crime: Croats live on their ancestral land and their very
existence is a crime.  Obviously, they are an obstacle to realization of an
old dream of Izetbegovic and his [former wife] Melika Salihbegovic (today
she calls herself Melika Salihbeg Bosnawi) who in the early 70's wrote to
ayatollah Homeini that she couldn't wait for the formation of the state
"which will spread from Teheran to Slavonski Brod [town on Croatian-Bosnian
border]."  Let us not forget those words, nor the "Islamic Declaration" 
because they are not only behind the persecution of Croats in Bosnia, but 
also behind the demands for a free trade zone in Ploce [Croatian port;
before the war major conduit for transport of Bosnian goods; Bosnian government
has been negotiating with Croatia in order to secure independent access to
the port facilities].

<h1><a NAME="disinfection"> Disinfection</a></h1>

<strong><em>by Maja Freundlich</em></strong><P>

<h2>Hrvatsko Slovo, Zagreb, Croatia, March 22, 1996</h2>

When a lie with its sharp teeth jumps you trying to get you by the throat,
at first you are helpless.  You are confused because you did not expect the
lie.  You couldn't have expected it nor anticipated that it would jump you.
Because a lie is not based on anything real.  In it, there are no facts
from your life, or at least not in that ratio and shape.  In a lie, there
is nothing that can be related to you; therefore it is obvious that you cannot
in advance predict what kind of fabrication, out of thousands which are
not related to you, someone could throw at your neck.  In order to cut
your throat.<P>

From the first day of the renewed Croatian life, lies have been spinning
around our state.  Serbs, who are the fiercest fighters against Croatia
and its survival, are most frequently the source of those lies.  Still,
there are many other sources, and there are a lot of hungry dogs who spread
bits and pieces of such a lie.  Because of that, pollution is greater and
wider, garbage is being spread, rotting on the road; as lies get more rotten
they stink more; the older they are, the more false they become.  Although the 
throwers of lies hope that the pile of thrown lies will eventually become
as convincing as the truth, that can never happen.  A lie cannot become
the truth, but the people may become polluted by stench which had spread 
around them and may decide to move to another block in which garbage 
doesn't stink.<P>

Let us at least try to count some of the lies which have been thrown 
on Croatia.  First, that Croatia is essentially a fascist country and
Croats a fascist people.  Then, in accordance with that, that all
symbols of Croatian history and statehood are also fascist.  Third, 
that Croats killed in Jasenovac - how many millions of Serbs?  Then,
that even waving of a Croatian flag is a genocidal crime against Serbs.
Fifth, that Tudman is a fascist and is rehabilitating fascism in Croatia.
Sixth, that that is actually fascism, but at the same time also communism 
and an imitation of the Central Committee.  Seventh, that Croatia with her
waving of flags caused this war.  Eight, that Croatia is a country of 
thieves, ruled by thieves, who had robbed the Croatian people.  Ninth
that Hercegovci have robbed other Croats, are uncivilized and have 
occupied Croatia.  Therefore, we have to throw them out.  Tenth, Croats
hate and persecute Jews more than anyone else in the world.  Eleventh,
there isn't such a thing as Croatian history and culture.  Twelfth,
HDZ members are bolsheviks, they have taken money from the retirees;
therefore, we have to get rid of the "party of dangerous intentions."<P>

Could anyone list everything in so little space? Who could even try to 
list all the lies which would confirm the theses that I've just mentioned?
Who could list the reasons because of which former UDBA [former Yugoslav
secret service] agents founded more than 30 newspapers?  That wave of new
papers in Croatia reached such proportions that one day we will study it
as a strategic phenomenon in the war against Croatia.  KOS [former Yugoslav
counter-intelligence service] or UDBA or MI5 or MI6 or BND, who knows who
is involved in all that.  Whoever was involved, they decided that Croatia
should be attacked from inside, because newly independent countries do not
have well formed protection mechanisms, which by the way, exist in all countries
in the world.  The plan was based on two ideas.  On the continuous blackmail
from the European Council based on the fabricated violations of human rights
and press freedom in Croatia, and on the other hand, while Croatia's hands
are tied with the blackmail, on the copious inflow of money and continuous
launching of new publications.<P>

All those publications are the same, their design is the same, even their 
primitive tastelessness is so identical that even from up close one can not guess
which weekly is which.  Garbage which is published in them, lies which make every
honest man squirm, curses and vulgarities which disgust every 
normal man, huge titles in which lies pile up in identical sentences, in the 
same rhythm, they pour on you from newspaper kiosks with such force that you wish
to run away from those tasteless and primitive howls and stop reading newspapers.
Recently, I have been surprised when I found out the possible source of the 
"design" ideas for the journalistic garbage published in Croatia.  Serb <em>
Telegraf</em> looks exactly the same.  Probably the "publishing house" behind 
them is also the same.<P>

Putting aside graphic design, we should point out that the goal of tastelessness, 
although it is in the nature of those fat editors, was to draw attention.  They 
wanted to be noticed, because the only real goal of those KOS "editors" was to
spread lies for five years.  Lie, another lie, then another and yet another.  Then
you blackmail someone and he, in order to get out of that, hands over the first 
state secret.  And that other person, who is already your man, but infiltrated into
the highest levels of Croatian government, will sell you another secret for a lot
of money.  Thus, through illegal means you obtain several true secrets and on them
build a tower of lies.<P>

At the beginning of the war, Serbs were boasting that they had <em>their people</em>
everywhere in the Croatian society.  If we observe <em>newly composed</em> papers
, some thirty of them, we would have to agree with that statement.  The strategy
of those <em>their people</em> was very simple from the first day.  They were
in charge of mud slinging.<P>

The duties of the fighters were determined in advance.  It is well known who among
them produces shit, who collects it, who adds stench to it, who shapes shit 
with his hands, and who finally throws the shit.  The best shit throwers get
a lot of praise, and besides that receive international protection.  Because,
the international institutions for protection of human rights mostly worry
about the freedom for cursing and slandering, unfettered freedom for lies and 
mud slinging over the Croatian public life.<P>

We are faced with an ecological threat.  Even more serious: an ecological 
catastrophe.  Around us, there is so much garbage and stench that we have to 
think about how we can  clean our quarter, because we will not achieve anything
by running away from it.  Shit can be cleaned with water and lies disinfected
by the truth.<P>

<h1> United Left or The Revolution That Goes On</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Miroslav Markovic<br>  Argument, 4/7/95, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia</i></h2><p>


<hr>

If it wasn't for the recent founding of the United Yugoslav Left (JUL) in Belgrade, I wouldn't have known that so many political parties still existed in Serbia; it was said that more than 20 parties and organizations had formed  JUL<p>

Of course, I wouldn't have known that the fierce revolutionary from '68, Ljubisa Ristic, a [theatre] director with a bug in an ear [ one of the plays Lj. R. has directed], remained even today in the revolutionary waters.  And that the revolution in question is the revolution that goes on.  As I also wouldn't have known that the revolutionary with a bug in an ear has a "higher standing" than an academician and a professor, Dr. Mira Markovic [ one of the founders of the refounded Yugoslav Communist Party - Movement for Yugoslavia and the wife of Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia](no relation of mine, by the way).<p> 

<h2> Serbs Have Endured</h2><p>


Unfortunately, I have known that the Yugoslav idea has always been a Serb thing.  I also know that the Serbs will endure JUL.  Besides, Serbs can endure more than other nations can even imagine.<p>

Serbs can also endure a proposal by <em>Vreme</em>, my favorite and also an "independent" magazine, whose motto is "everything Serbian is alien to us".  <em>Vreme</em> proposes and I forcefully second their proposal, that it is necessary, almost cathartic, for Serbia to build a monument to an "unknown deserter".  The <em>Vreme's</em> commentator says:" In that sense, the monument to an unknown deserter would be an important contribution to democracy.  As a reminder of the levity with which the local [Serbian] regime rushed into the war.  As a reminder of the shameful patriotic madness."<p>


In the sense of the contribution to democracy and <em>Vreme's</em> proposal I dare to go even further.  Why only a monument?  Why not decorations as well?  For example, we could establish an Order of a Deserter with a Ribbon and Clean Underwear, an Order of a Deserter with an Earring and a Pony-tail, and then an Order of an Escape of a First Degree;  then, what about an Order of an Expressed and Proven Unpatriotic Behavior; a climax could, for example, be an Order of a Treason with Diamonds (this one could be, in a formal ceremony, given to the editorial board of the forementioned magazine).  Then, how about medals!  For example: Medal for the Fastest Deserter, then Medal for the Most Cowardly Deserter, Cry Baby Medal ...  And so on.  Besides, as far as I am concerned, "deserters of all lands unite!";  <em>Vreme</em> is waiting for you.<p>


<h2>Who Mingles With the "Independent" Folk...</h2><p>


What mingling with the so-called "independents" looks like, can be gathered from a recent Serbian Writers Union press release.  The Union admitted that it had supported and itself taken part in the struggle for an "independent" and "objective" news reporting and that in the course of the struggle it several times "defended  <em><A HREF="yuindpress.html">Nasa Borba</A></em>, <em>Studio B</em> and <em>Radio B-92</em>. [an independent daily newspaper, a TV station and a radio station, all located in Belgrade]<p>

"Unfortunately, <em>Nasa Borba</em>, <em>B-92</em> and <em>Vreme</em> have recently published a large number of malicious reports ( while they were a few in number it was tolerable?) about the participation of some of our members in literary events in the Republic Srpska [Bosnian Serb state] and the Republic of Serbian Krajina [Croatian Serb state].<p>

"We reserve the strongest condemnation for the dirty, inaccurate insinuations regarding our most prominent member, Dobrica Cosic."<p>

Of course, the writers' problem was that they hadn't earlier understood, according to which and especially according to <strong>whose principles</strong> the so-called "independents" work;  but at least now they understand.  Some never will!<p>


<h2> Serb Hunting Season Always Open </h2><p>

Nevertheless, we shouldn't be surprised by the "independents" or <i>Vreme</i>.  What else could they do but follow the current "international" and "democratic"  trends.  And judging by the so-called international courts, the fashion of the moment is the hunt for Serbs! When, if not now!<p>

Italian newspapers have recently published the following news:" The Secretary General of the Permanent Court of the Nations, which is currently in session in Trento (Italy), Gianni Tognioni, has issued a statement which was publicized as a first-rate sensation by all Italian newspapers: the latest fashion in Italy is a new kind of tourism - travel to Bosnia to kill Serbs!<p>

"The "party" begins on a Friday morning when the "tourists", seeking amusement, are taken in a private airplane to Bosnia from one of the smaller European airports.  Upon reaching their destination, they are offered to put on the fatigues and can head for one of the fronts or try out all kinds of existing armaments.  They can shoot at the enemy (Serbs, of course) from the machine-guns, cannons or bazookas, or even sniper rifles."<p>

The statement further says that the "tourist" sharp shooters rate most highly women carrying buckets with water and children!<p>

Deserter magazine <em><a href="yuindpress.html">Vreme</a></em> totally ignores the news like these.  To the Serb children killed in a "touristic" way they do not offer a grave, let alone a monument.  But why would the Serb children need a monument?<p>

Another, according to some, even more antiserb and pro-deserter paper, <em>Nasa Borba</em>, goes even further.  Reporting from the "Serbian Court" this "independent" paper not only doesn't mention the Serbs as the targets of the merry "tourists" but doesn't mention them (I mean the Serbs) at all!  On the contrary, the "liberated" reporter of this Soros owned paper, confuses the reader by suggesting that the Serbs themselves organize this "Safary"!<p>

<h2>The Truth is in New York Times</h2><p>

Anyway, what can we expect from <em>Nasa [our] (i.e. "Their") Borba</em>, which puts more trust in "its" New York Times (NYT) than even in UNPROFOR [U.N. protection force]!  "Their" NYT wrote that "Yugoslavia has recently sent to the Serb controlled Croatian territories at least 900 soldiers, tanks and other armaments, with help from the Russian forces serving with UNPROFOR."  Roy Gutman writes for and is a pride of <em>Nasa ("Their") Borba</em>.  It doesn't matter that the official UNPROFOR's spokesperson denied these allegations.  It doesn't matter that he revealed that the Russian troops are not stationed at the location where, according to the "independent" reporter from NYT, the "crossing" of the Yugoslav soldiers and tanks had taken place.  None of that matters.  Nor does anyone care about the truth.  What matters is that <em>Nasa Borba</em> carries the information on a predetermined day and a predetermined spot.  As ordered.<p>

<h2> "I'm Gonna Sue You All..."</h2>

That the fear for the threatened personal well-being and the possibility that the real intentions are revealed is stronger than the publicly proclaimed struggle for the "real", "true" and therefore "western democracy", which, at least according to the earliest fighters for that "democracy", is sorely needed in "undemocratic" Serbia, was obvious at the very loudly publicized press conference in the hotel "Metropol" (everything has its price and a high democratic level) by the Soros foundation representatives in Yugoslavia.<p>

On publicly and, I guess, democratically asked questions about the functioning and the goals of the foundation in Yugoslavia, his official representatives and mercenaries, until this press conference, replied only occasionally and usually with ferocious personal attacks on those who dare to ask any unpleasant questions.  However, when they realized that the "witch hunt", as they had called it, wouldn't stop that easily and that those "uncivil" and "ungrateful" Serbs still have questions and that the questions were becoming more and more unpleasant, the Soros' mercenary gentlemen decided to counter-attack.<p>

Rightly judging that the outcome of an open meeting with the journalists would be bad for them, despite the fact that some of the journalists would have been "our people", the organizers have, just in (a democratic) case brought to the event the selected beneficiaries from the Soros' moneys and also the candidate beneficiaries (if they behave) as well as the "sympathizers" of the movement.  In the end, according to a predetermined scenario, the journalists were allowed into the hall.<p>

Well, the fact  that a few journalists were allowed to attend the press conference did not mean that they would be allowed to ask questions.  Anyway why should the journalists ask any questions?  If they were "Soros' people", they already knew they were supposed to listen [also means obey].  If they weren't, what were they doing there?<p>

So, what happened?<p>

After a paean to Soros from the mouth of Ms. Sonja Licht and a "discussion" in which only Soros' "beneficiaries" took part and which brought tears to eyes of those who still hadn't had a chance to put their fingers into Mr. Soros' wallet, came the climax of the gathering: all those who had until then asked any unpleasant questions regarding the business practices of the great "humanist" and their master Soros, would be sued!<p>

Any more questions?<P>

None!<p>

"Democracy" is really a miracle! Amazing![also means invisible in Serbo-Croatian]<p>

<P>
        In Ilidza, Near Sarajevo: Bombs, Murders, Robberies
<P>
        I HAVE TOLD MY OLD WOMAN ...
<P>
        AIM Sarajevo, 31 October, 1996
<P>
        Stana Luledzija, a seventy-year old self-supporting
woman from Ilidza, lay killed in her house until the fact that
she had not showed up for two days caused suspicion among her
neighbours. That same day, a bomb exploded in front of the
house in which association called the Democratic Initiative of
Sarajevo Serbs (DISS) has its seat. Not even an hour passed
before another bomb exploded in front of the house of
Kristofer Jokic, a lawyer who is a member of the Association.
The following evening, power went off for a short while in
Ilidza. In that period, a robbery occurred of a house which
belonged to family Berak who are activists of the DISS, which
is, unfortunately, nothing unusual in the circumstances
prevailing here. However, it sounds as a record out of
Ripley's book that within this darkness which lasted hardly
half an hour, robbers of Berak house, who should have also
been caught unprepared (have they!?) by the blackout, managed
to pull out 36 plugs, take away all the radiators, pipeline
and the whole central heating installation, and other
"trifles" which could not have been taken away without a truck
and an organized operation. The very next day, unknown people
moved into the ravaged house. The following morning, the house
of Bozica Stanisic (step-mother of Miodrag Stanisic, President
of the DISS) was burnt, while she was beaten up while trying
to resist to unknown attackers...
<P>
        All this was happening last week, in popularly called
reintegrated parts of Sarajevo which in the end of March were
transferred from Republica Srpska into the competence of B&H
Federation. In Sarajevo media, which have lately been full of
comments on impossibility of return of refugees (Chairman of
the Presidency of B&H, Alija Izetbegovic, in a conversation
with the commander of FOR, Lopez, criticized the phenomenon
of burning down houses whose owners wished to return and
preventing implementation of Annex 7 of the Peace Agreement),
none of the listed cases from reintegrated regions were even
mentioned. After the journalistic and international stampede
which swept over Sarajevo suburbs during the transfer of power
in Ilidza, Blazuj, Hadzici or Grbavica, these parts of the
city are not discussed at all. Why?
<P>
        "We are afraid that after six months since
reintegration and almost a year after Peace accords were
signed, the process of return of people not only has not even
started yet, but ethnic engineering, let us call it that,
continues", claims Maksim Stanisic, President of the
Democratic Initiative of Sarajevo Serbs. "Numerous promises we
were given immediately after transfer of power, about the
right to education and health services, Sarajevo as a
multiethnic city, came to nothing, and the worst thing is the
current situation in which there is no safety", Stanisic
concludes.
<P>
        After reintegration of Sarajevo suburbs, according to
the assessments of DISS, between 8.5 and 10 thousand Serbs
have remained in the region, and the number of those
interested in return imcreases every day. Into about 10
thousand empty houses of the domicile population, in fact, of
the Serbs who had decided to wait for the entrance of the
authorities of the Federation on the territory of the Serb
entity, mostly refugees from Podrinje were colonized. Banished
persons, the worst cases of refugees from eastern Bosnia, who
had been in one of the camps in the vicinity of Tuzla,
Zivinice or war-devastated Vozuca when the Dayton accords were
signed, became the new inhabitants of Sarajevo. Along with
banished and homeless persons - like after all wars - groups
of semi-mobsters also came to Ilidza, Vogosca, Blazuj or
Hadzici, and manipulating with, for example, Bosniac Golgotha
of Srebrenica, raided and plundered, taking away with them
everything but the bare walls of houses. Words like
"Srebrenica" or "jihad warrior's families", instead of the
true meaning they had during the war, became synonyms for
plunder and criminal acts.
<P>
        "They are not real refugees", says Desanka B. from
Blazuj, pointing at the house across the road. "Who knows how
many have lived in turns over there, and every one of them
took something they liked with them. And over there, in that
house, a real refugee from Srebrenica lives. His father was
killed in his presence. He is our best neighbour now. He does
not even cross the threshold of our house before he calls and
tells us he would come. Seeing his grief, I become speechless.
I know what was happening in Srebrenica. But, those who pass
by here, plunder and burn, they are the ones to be feared of.
They are the ones who would like to get rid of us, not the
people who have suffered Golgotha", says this perturbed woman
whose house, as she says, was plundered five times since the
reintegration.
<P>
        Almost all the natives stress that the federal police
regularly answers all the calls and records, together with the
IPTF, everything that is happening in reintegrated regions.
But, the issue at stake here is to what extent they can really
control safety in reintegrated territories when not a single
B&H official has ever paid the slightest attention to
developments over here. Despite the repeated proclaimed
acceptance of the Dayton accords, especially of Annex 7 on
return of refugees, the Government in Sarajevo has not
condemned with a single word of rebuke crimes on reintegrated
territories, and for Bosnian Minister of the interior, Avdo
Hebib, this part of Sarajevo has ceased to be interesting the
moment he put up new, shining, green signs of the Federation.
Is marginalization of reintegrated territories actually a sign
of approval of crime aimed at further intimidation of the
remaining citizens of Serb nationality and their departure
from Sarajevo is a question unwillingly discussed by
everybody:
<P>
        "I do not believe that criminals who are raiding this
part of Sarajevo feel such an increased dose of national
intolerance towards the Serbs and that this is the sole reason
they have picked them as the target group. No, in the heads of
such profiteers, it is not nationalism that determines their
actions, but exclusively profit they will make by stealing and
plundering. But, the fact that the ruling structures of the
Federation have not reacted and do not condemn such action,
gives them the right to continue to do what they have been
doing. In fact, I think that such people know only too well
that they do not ill-treat the native Serbs only because they
are Serbs, but because they know that hardly anybody will try
to protect these people and that it is easiest to rob and
banish them and take their houses", claims Goran Kapor, one of
the fifteen councillors of Serb nationality in the Council of
Ilidza municipality.
<P>
        Dusan Sehovac, also a councillor and Vice-President of
the DISS, believes that this stance of B&H officials might
imply silent agreement and a kind of extra-institutional
pressure to force the Sarajevo Serbs to leave this territory:
<P>
        "Unfortunately, this was not the first murder which
happened after transfer of power. Several months ago, a
thirty-seven year old woman was killed, and perpetrators of
this crime have not been revealed yet. This, and the latest
developments, unfortunately, introduce additional fear and
force people to leave their homes and sell them for mere
trifles. It is no secret that not far from here, there is a
real estate agency called Praxis where after such cases, the
number of those who wish to leave Sarajevo suddenly increases.
<P>
        Following this and the information that in the past
two months only in Luzani about fifteen houses were sold, in
the very centre of this part of Ilidza I come across the
"Praxis" agency whose sign says that it is a specialized
institution for "offering intellectual services". I enter the
agency and ask about the possibility of buying a house in
Ilidza. I get the answer that, of course, it is possible to
buy a house, and a few counter-questions about what type of
house I am interested in (with business premises or without
them, with a garage or without it, with only the ground floor,
or with a few floors, in what part of Ilidza and similar) and
then finally the question: how much money I am ready to set
aside for such a house. After the mentioned sum of about 30
thousand German marks, which is allegedly the price of houses
around here according to the ads, the owner of the agency
(later I learn that he himself is a Serb) raises his voice:
"Oh, no, nobody will buy Serb houses dirt-cheap any more.
There is nothing below 150 thousand marks. And you don't look
like somebody who wishes to settle down here. You must be a
journalist. I won't talk to you!" After that, the statement
follows that all the data I wish to know are "business
secret", and I am shown out of the agency.
<P>
        Sixty-year old Rajko M. is the next-door neighbour of
the killed Stana Luledziija. Interrupting his story that the
old woman was found after two days on the floor in a pool of
blood, I ask him if he is scared and if he is thinking of
leaving Sarajevo:
<P>
        "You know, son, the first day I told my old woman to
start packing immediately. I felt so terribly pressured, I
said maybe the next day they would come to our house. And then
I see how many policemen stirred up around here, both ours and
those foreigners, and then I started thinking, oh well, maybe
they will stop now. Maybe they have gone too far with this
murder and will quiet down now. Since the police is making
such an effort to investigate, maybe they will finally get
scared", explains Rajko his logic for having stayed in his
home.
<P>
        "This is a matter of creating or not creating a
political ambience and conditions where all civil rights will
be exercised correctly", these are the words of Beriz Belkic,
one of the deputies of the President of Ilidza municipality.
"On the one hand we have made progress together with
representatives of the High Commissioner's Office. We have
formed joint municipal agencies, together with native
citizens, and as we say, colonized persons mostly from
Podrinje. Unfortunately, despite these official results,
things which cause concern are still happening. These criminal
acts demand a serious political approach, or a political
analysis of everything that is happening, as well as of
everything in the background. Is it the result of a lack of an
explanation that revanchism, if this is a case of revanchism
at all, cannot resolve anything and that there are legal
agencies and laws which can resolve things, or is it the
result of a feeling that crime will not be punished. In the
first days of reintegration existence of a misunderstanding
was almost logical, as well as incidents or verbal insults,
but nowadays, seven months later, everything is acquiring the
forms of classical crime", says Belkic.
<P>
        Walking around Ilidza, I come across a clinic
established during the war while this Sarajevo suburb was
controlled by Republica Srpska. Nowadays, there are no
physicians of Serb nationality who have remained in Ilidza
working in the clinic, although after reintegration, all
medical, teaching and other personnel were guaranteed to
remain at their jobs. In the crowded waiting room, I run
across a medical technician, Jasmin Kunovac:
<P>
        "I don't really know what happened. I have known these
physicians before the war, we worked together in the Ilidza
Medical Centre. Believe me, there is no problem among us. We
receive all patients regardless of nationality, because our
profession orders us to do so. Physicians of Serb nationality
come in the afternoons to the clinic and help the citizens as
a form of humanitarian aid. And the fact that they have no
right to have a stamp, to write prescriptions and to send
patients to hospitals if necessary, is the result of the fact
that they were not given the jobs after reintegration. Why
this is so, people in the public institution which controls
Medical Centres in Sarajevo should know, because they are our
superiors.
<P>
        Unfortunately, it was impossible to find any
responsible person in the administration of the Medical
Centres, and the kind secretary explained to me, after she had
heard what I wanted to talk about with the director, that
"both the director and his deputy were on a business trip".
<P>
        Are the President and the Vice-President of the
Federation, members of the Presidency, Minister of police,
Federal Prime Minister, Governor of the Sarajevo Canton and
other B&H officials also on a business trip, I did not
investigate. They are probably concerned about personnel
combinations, choice of places where they will meet each
others, physical showdowns inside state security service, and
similar current "high political" problems. Right under their
noses, crimes, robberies, murders and forcing people to leave
their homes going on.  Who will and in what way return people
from Srebrenica, Zepa or Rogatica to their homes? Or perhaps,
nobody is expecting Annex 7 of the Dayton accords to be
implemented any more.

<h1> Interview with Nikola Koljevic, the Bosnian Serb Vice President</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> Interviewed by Andjelko Anusic<br>  Argument, 4/7/95, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia</i></h2><p>


<hr>

<strong>Q: The latest meeting of the Contact Group in London, the purpose of which was to revitalize the peace process in former Bosnia-Hercegovina, apparently didn't produce any positive results.  At least, nothing tangible.  Mr. vice president, what is happening with the international community?  Is it really impotent, or is the problem its ignorance, internal disagreements or maybe in a sabotage?</strong><p>

A: In my opinion, the problem is above all in their different conceptions for the solution of the Bosnian crisis.  These differences are the strongest regarding the necessity for the pressure on the muslim side.  That is obvious: even a report has been sent to Boutros Ghali --which we know of -- which states that the muslim side is responsible for the non-implementation of the ceasefire.  And you know very well that so far no pressure has been put on the muslim side.  It is interesting that just recently and for a first time, Lord Owen found himself in a position to state that muslim offensives were being launched from the so-called safe areas, which are actually military bases, and it is known that according to the Security Council resolutions they were supposed to be demilitarized. .  .  .<p> 

The second reason lies in the significant differences in the positions of the U.S., on one side, and Europe, except of course for Germany, on the other.  This conflict is more than 3,000 miles from the American soil; compare their reaction to the conflict in Grenada, which they stopped after 10 days, and the conflict in Bosnia, which they are trying to prolong; that is the difference between the European, especially French and British, interests and the American interests.<p>

This is happening in the European backyard, not in the American.  In my opinion, these are the basic reasons for the lack of direction and inefficiency in the work of the Contact Group.  The proof of their confusion is their secrecy and the lack of public statements about their work.  That is why I think the EU is working on a different approach, on a different diplomatic initiatives, on different levels, which would simply replace the Contact Group.<p>


<strong>Q: It has been alleged that Russia has its own concept for the solution of the Bosnian conflict.  The content of that peace parcel from Moscow still hasn't been revealed.  Do you know anything about that Russian initiative, and can it be of any use to the Srpska Republic (SR), having in mind the former Russian behavior?</strong><p>


The Russian initiative cannot be of any use to the SR, since it assumes, above all, the recognition of former Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia by the Yugoslav Federal Republic (FRY).  That would be clearly catastrophic for us.  Similarly, it is clear that the rift, which, in a way, now exists between the Republic Srpska Krajina (RSK) and the Srpska Republic (SR) and the FRY, would become worse, since we wouldn't accept such a recognition; consequently, these parts of the Serb people would be put in an even more difficult position.  Besides, what is objectively bad in that plan affects not only us but also a sort of alliance, or at least friendship between the FRY and Russia.  It is obvious how important the ending of sanctions is for the FRY form the importance it [lifting of sanctions] has been given in the media and by the FRY diplomacy. The Russians  are virtually blackmailing the FRY with such conditions, knowing that it is the most important issue for that country.  That could - of course I hope it won't - worsen the relations between the FRY and the Russian Federation.  If that happens, it will be a great trial for the Serbian people, which is almost alone in the Universe.  We now, apart from the Greeks and Russians, have no friends in the world.<p>


That is why I think it is really sad and ugly that the Russian proposal is the way it is.<p>

<strong>Q: Lately, remarks and even accusations have been coming more often   from the eastern bank of the river Drina [FRY];  the Pale authorities are accused, they say, of not wanting peace; it is said that the Contact Group plan is supposedly acceptable to the Serbs, " because it offers a good basis for the just solution of the Serb national problem."  Mr. Koljevic, why isn't the Contact Group plan acceptable to the Serbs?</strong><p>

A:  First, I would like to emphasize that we are not war mangers and there are even proofs for that.  We have fully cooperated with the peace process for more than three years, to the extent that our people had enough of that;  the people were wondering why we were all the time in Geneva and many of them saw in that the Western tactics to keep the leadership of the Srpska Republic away from its people. . .  Those who know anything about the psychology must know that one can not get used to death and suffering. . . Third: it is enough to consider the latest UNPROFOR reports about who initiated offensives since the beginning of the agreement about the cessation of the hostilities;  clearly, we were forced to defend ourselves and we never attacked;  we even had to use an ultimatum in order to protect the people in Serbian Sarajevo (although the anti-sniper agreement had been made);  we threatened to close the UN supply routes for a month for every Serb killed by a sniper.  So that the muslim side should consider what is in their interest.  Therefore instead of replying with the sniper fire, let alone artillery, which wouldn't have been hard for us,  we took a peaceful route and tried to stop an escalation, at least in Sarajevo.  Finally, it is obvious that in total isolation, now even from the FRY, we cannot nonchalantly sit and wait for a defeat.  Time, militarily, isn't working for us; especially when resources are taken into account.  If the muslims, as they are and as can be seen, and as the International Community admits, are now starting the war, then the war should be also finished, because that is in Serbian national interest.<p>

<strong>Q: Muslims have used the safe area of Tuzla for the attacks on the Serb lines of defense, as in Gorazde, on the Mount Igman and around Bihac.  The International Community doesn't seem to be bothered by that, so that the high UNPROFOR officer, in charge of Bosnia-Hercegovina renewed demands for strikes on Serb positions.  What logic, if any, can explain that?</strong><p>


A: Well, it is interesting that for a first time since the beginning of this war the muslims were threatened with air strikes.  The threat came from the International Community, and the muslims were indirectly accused of turning the so-called safe areas into military bases.  I think that this was very significant for us and a small consolation. . . .<p>

<Strong>Q: What are your impressions of Gen. Rose's replacement, Gen. Smith?</strong><p>

A:  Little is known about Smith.  My impression after several meetings is that he is a man who won't allow himself to be manipulated [by others].  He spoke about the pressure from New York in that direction [to take sides in the conflict?], but I think that he has integrity. . . . he is a man with an  exceptional intelligence, very well educated, and one could say - wise.  He clearly saw that his predecessors, from MacKenzie to Rose were manipulated by others.<p>

For example, MacKenzie, who is an honorable man, when the agreement about the airport was made, promised personally to me a communication route along or over the runway between Ilidza and Lukavica.  I remember very well Gen. MacKanzie who is always a welcome guest in SR; he has recently visited SR to make a TV programme; anyway, I remember him and I am certain that he would have kept his promise.  However, he was replaced.  I think that Rupert Smith knows all that very well and that he won't allow something similar to happen.<p>

<strong>Q: Mr. Koljevic, do you after all, feel that the International Community is not interested in ending the war on the territory of the former Bosnia-Hercegovine and former Yugoslavia?  Actually, do you think that the International Community is simply trying to fool the Serbian people living west from the rivers Drina and Danube, with sending the so-called peace mediators and missionaries, while at the same time trying to prolong the war and destroy (the Serbian people) biologically and economically?</strong><p>

A: I will have to surprise you somewhat with my answer.  I know that the majority of Serbs think that is true.  Serbs have a problem, actually a lot of them, but this one is typical.<p>

Serbs are gullible.  That is why rumors spread easily among us; for example when an average Croat reads a text he thinks about the intent of its writer and the reliability of the sources, while an average Serb accepts the text as if it were taken from the Bible!<p>

<strong>Q: He doesn't know how to read and understand all the meanings in the text?</strong><p>

A: Exactly. Because of that gullibility, the Serbs often go to another extreme, I won't use the word paranoia, but they feel cheated, even when they aren't.  However, it seems to me that since six months ago the International Community has been working for peace, not war.  The most influential factors, above all France and England, because everything is taking place in their backyard, and because there is a possibility of an escalation of the war, . . . want peace and that is the reason for their military involvement in the UN mission.<p>


Why is it that the French and the English and other European countries are present in Bosnia but the Americans are not?  That gives the French and the English a chance, taking into account that they are not great world powers like the U.S., to have a greater political influence when the decisions are made about whether there should be peace or war in Bosnia.<p>

I do not think that the European part of the International Community, except for Germany, is for the prolongation of the war.  On the contrary,  I even have a small proof for that.  Toward the end of the last Geneva conference, while Charles Redman and Vitali Churkin were sitting, while we were negotiating, and when everyone thought, including president Milosevic, that we had found a solution, since the constitutional part of the agreement had been finished and the map was almost done - the two present individuals, and that is how they behaved - left the room and I was left alone with the two co-presidents.  Since the muslim side returned soon after that demanding another 14 towns, seven from the Serbs and seven from the Croats - it is obvious who had given them the advice.  At that moment, the co-presidents decided not to allow to be tricked by the muslims any more and their idea was to pull the Americans and Russians in ( Russians play a secondary role, probably not due to their intentions, but due to their powerlessness), thinking that would put stop to the muslim intransigence.  That is why I think they are actually, confused, disoriented and do not know what to do.<p>

<strong>Q: Still, under what conditions would the Contact Group peace plan become acceptable to the SR?</strong><p>

Look, we have several initiatives about which I cannot talk because they are secret, but the public should know that we have been proposing new peace initiatives almost daily.  We want to enable the Contact Group to formulate the infamous sentence in a way which would be acceptable to the other side, the muslim-croat federation.  Finally we have recently had a meeting in Zvornik with the two co-presidents, where we again worked on this problem.<p>

We are not setting any preconditions.  We even do not think that the percentages are crucial; actually we think that the current approach [of setting the percentages of the territory in advance] is ill conceived .  If the fundamental principle is the viability of a state the percentages will come from certain principles which should be adopted.  It seems to us that the best approach would be to start from a few points which are of a strategic importance for a survival of both states, for their existence, and have Serbs, muslims and Croats agree on those principles.<p>

<strong>Q: What are these points?</strong><p>

A: Clearly, the principle number one for us is the corridor; it should be at least 10 miles wide, which is the international standard for the air traffic. Otherwise we would have no conditions for the air traffic.<P>

It is easy to conclude what is the first strategic goal for the majority in the m/h federation -- access to the sea.  Because they want to have an international border, by which they mean a line not bordering Serbs or Croats!<p>

In spite of everything the muslims have been saying and their war cries, it is obvious that nobody wants  war.  They are doing that for the propaganda reasons.    If we could agree about, for example, five strategic points it would be much easier to agree about the problems between these five points. . . based on the fact that, in spite of everything all sides would rather have peace than war.  Although the muslims haven't so far shown a lot of concern for the large number of victims on their side, they will have to think about it in the future, since their losses are mounting day after day.<p>

As far as the further negotiations are concerned, we have only one priority -- not to be cheated if the negotiations fail.  Therefore, we cannot accept the word "acceptance".<p>

<strong>Q: Why?</strong><p>

A: Because there is a real danger, that if the negotiations fail, we shall fall back on the initial Contact Group plan.  To the territorial division which is unacceptable to us and every person in the SR.  By the way, that is another propagandist lie, that apparently the Pale authorities are the only ones who find that plan unacceptable;  we had a referendum, and I don't understand how anyone can say that we are hiding behind the referendum!<p>

Thus, we are only trying to avoid a possible trap of returning to the initial plan and giving the legitimacy to the International Community together with NATO as a regional force to take those territories from us by force and not with "pin prick" air strikes but an air campaign similar to the one in Iraq.<p>

<strong>Q: UNPROFOR's presence in former Yugoslavia, has been extended. However, its future mandate, name and composition of the peace-keeping forces are still uncertain;  Boutros Ghali has one solution, the Americans another and the Security Council yet another.  Who will prevail?  Isn't the end of the U.N. near?</strong><p>

A: The U.N. should be ashamed regarding "the role of peace-keeping forces in the war" in Bosnia-Hercegovina; objectively speaking - and we openly said this to the co-presidents - the peacekeepers have only prolonged the war.<p>

For example, if the Serbs hadn't withdrawn from the Mount Igman, after putting their trust in a peaceful settlement, the war would have been finished by now.  Militarily, as anyone knowing anything about Sarajevo can confirm, muslims were not surrounded, as Gen. MacKenzie wrote in his book, but were in a horseshoe.  With the Mount Igman [in our hands] they would be today surrounded and would have to negotiate.<p>

Unless they wanted to loose that city [Sarajevo] and all the people in it. . . . the U.N. are putting themselves in a more difficult situation with every passing day.  Boutros Ghali will have to make an important decision very soon:  whether he will stay as an honorable man at the helm of the U.N. or whether he will, having in mind the American dictat, be totally humiliated as a Secretary General of an international organization, not an American one. . . I don't think that his new ideas about three possible forms of UNPROFOR will change anything significantly.<p>

<strong>Q: Is it possible that Serbia, i.e. the FRY, will in the near future recognize communist borders of Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina and , if that happens, how would it affect wider political situation?</strong><p>

A:  I think that that will not happen.  But, maybe I am too much of an optimist?  What would happen in that case?  A real and a deep split between parts of the Serbian people would ensue since we couldn't go along with the recognition.<p>

<strong>Q: Russian president Yeltsin invited Alija Izetbegovic [president of Bosnia-Hercegovina] to the commemoration of the 50 years since the victory against fascism, which will take place this May in Moscow.  Your comment?</strong><p>

A:  That is a sad and ugly consequence of giving in to the American dictate.<p>

<h1>Excerpts from the article
SILENT VICTIMS OF A PATHOLOGICAL AGGRESSOR</h1>

<strong><em>by Gordana Rebic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vecernji List, page 6, March 7, 1996</h2>


It is estimated that during the war approximately 4000 men from
Croatia were sexually abused. The problem of sexual abuse of men,
which is often ignored by the public, was the topic of a recent
gathering of medical, legal and other experts. Present at the
gathering were among others, Eric Carslon, the legal counselor of
the Hague Tribunal's team of investigators into sexual abuse and
Patricia Sellers, the legal advisor to the Hague Tribunal for
sexual crimes.<P>

Fearing society's judgments, in which rape and other forms of
sexual torture are looked upon as taboo to discuss, victims were
forced to keep quiet about their adversities, even among
themselves. Like other victims of war, men that were sexually
abused suffer from post-traumatic stress (i.e. difficulty
sleeping, night-sweats, fear, tension, poor concentration,
flashbacks, etc.) and difficulty functioning sexually. They also
have wavering moods: from depression to aggressive assaults. In
one single moment, the victim unconsciously identifies with the
one that sexually abused him.<P>

Every victim is degraded and intimately suffers from his
traumatic experience. Talking about the incident returns his
feeling of self-confidence because the victim feels that he can
contribute to something useful, like finding the criminal, for
example. Likewise, he also frees himself of the feeling of guilt
that perhaps his behavior provoked the pathological conduct of
his enemy, explains Dr. Mladen Loncar, head of the medical center
for men's rights in Zagreb. According to Mr. Loncar, this type of
traumatic experience is something that hasn't been recorded in
history. The systematic mistreatment of thousands of men (rape,
beatings on the genitals, castration...) has left psychological
scars on many.<P>

Scalar and vector Kalman filters are implemented for filtering speech 
contaminated by additive white or colored noise and an iterative signal 
and parameter estimator which can be used for both noise types is 
presented.  Particular emphasis is placed on the removal of colored noise,  
such as helicopter noise, by using state-of-the-art colored noise assumption 
Kalman filters.  The results indicate that the colored noise Kalman filters 
provide a significant gain in the SNR, a visible improvement in the sound  
spectrogram, and an audible improvement in the output speech quality, none 
of which are available with the white noise assumption Kalman and Wiener 
filters.  When the filter is employed as a prefilter for linear predictive 
coding, the coded output speech quality and intelligibility is greatly 
enhanced in comparison to direct coding of the noisy speech.

We propose and study a new technique for estimating the weight of very heavy 
objects.  This new technique is based on measurements made by a device, 
a gravity 
gradiometer, that is capable of measuring subtle changes in the gravitational 
field produced by an object with respect to distance.  
The physical observables, 
known as gravity gradients, depend upon the mass density distribution 
of an object 
and the relative distance between the object and the measurement device.  
We show that for very heavy objects gravity gradient measurements 
can be used to make accurate weight 
estimates.   This technology could be potentially 
important in the eventual implementation 
of arms control agreements or for application in the transportation industry.

<h1>  White Tiger's Trial</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Zoran Daskalovic<br>  Feral Tribune, 1/30/95, Split, Croatia</i></h2><p>

The Karlovac Military Tribunal has recently begun a trial against forty one years old Veljko Drakulic, who is accused of deserting from the unit into which he had been drafted.  He committed a ``crime of voluntary departure against the armed forces of the republic of Croatia".  Drakulic stated in his defense that he obeyed the draft notice, but that he requested on several occasions to be assigned to civilian duties in the unit.  Calling on the objection of conscience he refused to bear arms.  We found out from Drakulic's counsel, lawyer Slobodan Budak, that his client has been through hell; the trial is only the finishing touch.  Drakulic had been, on 6/1/93, sentenced by Karlovac Military tribunal on six months in jail because of the previous desertion. He served the sentence  between 1/10/94 and 6/11/94.  While in jail, he submitted two petitions for civilian military service, but they were both denied.  Drakulic and his petitions for the civilian military service fell in the ``black hole" made by the discrepancy between the Constitutional Order which establishes the possibility of the civilian military service for conscientious objectors and the Defense Law, which limits this right to the recruits and reservists provided they submit a petition within the period prescribed by the Law.   
The Constitutional Court of Croatia begun, in 1994, the examination of the constitutionality of the Defense Law, finding objectionable limitations on the period for submition of petitions by the recruits and reservists as well as the denial of the conscientious objector status to the third category - soldiers.  The decision in the case has not yet been made.<P>

Drakulic has spent forty days in one of the units derogatory named ``White Tigers," after the white boots which most of its members wore.  Several hundreds of citizens of Karlovac have passed through the so called ``work brigades." Most of them were Serbs, though there were also a few ``unsuitable" Croats.  They were unarmed and their uniforms had no insignia.  They performed physical labor.  In the spring of 1993 they were stationed further away from the front, only to be moved to the front line in the fall of the same year. They were all exposed to different kinds of humiliating and degrading behavior. However, the especially ``rigorous" treatment was reserved for conscientious objectors.  Drakulic, with another 24 co-sufferers, went through the hell of one of these units. One member of the unit, a retired officer from the ex-JNA, was killed, several ran away and eventually escaped from Croatia. Two members committed suicide after release from the unit. Veljko Drakulic, talking quietly and reluctantly, with long pauses, told us only a part of his story:<P>

<H2> Death Because of a Complaint</H2>

 - I was born up there in the territory which is nowadays under Serbian rule. I have lived in Karlovac since 1968.  Until recently, I had worked in the store ``Tekstilka."   At the start of this evil I was assigned to the store's Civil Defense unit and had a work duty. I was on duty at the crisis headquarters until 1993. At the beginning of 1993, after receiving a draft notice, I reported to my unit two days after the deadline.  However, I had decided, because of the moral reasons and my conscience not to accept arms.  Naturally, I refused to take arms and the civilian Police came and took me to be interrogated.  Later, they returned me to the same unit, where the commander sent me to spend fifteen days in military prison, which I did.  After that, he ordered me back to the unit, again offering me arms and posting to the front line, which I refused.  He had me kept in the corridor for three days without an explanation.  At the end of the third day he sent me to the Department of Defense local office.  The gentlemen in the office told me to wait for the work notice, if I did not want arms.  In the meantime, military prosecutor started a process against me and in the June I was sentenced to seven months in jail, which I served later.  During  the trial, I submitted a petition for civilian military service.  At the beginning of the trial I received a second draft notice.  I reported again and repeated that I would accept any work but that I refused to bear arms.  And indeed, twenty five of us, conscientious objectors, were sent to Turanj on the front line. It was in September. They were mostly Serbs, among whom were two Croats, an academic painter and  another gentleman.  There on the front, not far from the Serb positions, we dug trenches, put sand in sacks, built fortifications...  All that without helmets, flak jackets and in the open.  All sorts of things happened.  All sorts, but none of it human.  In the end, because of hard labor and mistreatment, two men ran away.  They left Croatia and many of those who stayed behind started bleeding because of the hard work and had to be hospitalized.  In the end, there were seven of us.  I shall not name the individuals who did evil.  I shall only say that they were sick men.<p>

<B> Q: How long did it last?</b><p>

 - Well, about 14 days.  And it would not have finished then if it was not for the killing of a man who had been with us.  A sixty year old retired officer, [named] Radovanovic.<p>

<b> Q: How did he die?</b><p>

- Hmm, how?  While he was carrying sacks across the road, thirty meters from the front line, he was hit by a sniper bullet.  And why did he die?  Maybe also because he had complained about the torture.<p>

<h2> Threats to Manager</h2><p>

<b> Q: What happened afterwards?</b><p>

- When all that passed, after we were demobilized I went to work.  I stopped working as a butcher after 25 years because when I was released from the prison, the gentlemen from the Civil Defense and my unit came to the company I worked in and threatened the manager in order to have me fired.  I was not fired, but they moved me to a position of a transport worker and my job was to move the furniture around.  I accepted that in order not to offend and was given a minimum wage.  It was that way until I was fired.  I worked for the company until I left to serve my sentence.  I went to the prison in Karlovac.<p>

<b> Q: How were you treated there?</b><p>

- Excellently.  I cannot complain.  The people in jail were fantastic.  They were professionals and it was good, whereas the military prison was totally different.  After I was released from the prison, I again officially submitted a request for civil military service to the Ministry of Justice.  I found out then that kind of request can only be made to the Ministry of Justice.  It has now been confirmed at the trial and by the Ministry of Justice that they have my petition and that it had been submitted twice.<p>

<b> Q: What happened after your release from the jail?</b><p>

- I received another draft notice.  Thinking naturally that I was called up for the civilian military service and my objection of conscience had been acknowledged, I went to the headquarters, because I was supposed to report to the main commander. I came to him and asked if he knew about my case.  He answered:``I do." ``So, what now?," I asked.  ``Nothing," he said, ``arms and off to your unit."  ``You know my views," I said.  ``Good," he said, ``we will send you back to your work unit."  He sent me to Orlovac.  That is how I again ended up with the people who had mistreated me in the first place.  They started laughing, ridiculing me, asking if I were still alive and so on.  ``So, Drakulic, you still do not want guns?," they asked.  I said,``I came to work, not to shoot."  The four of them were getting ready to drive me.  I felt that I would be at least beaten up, if not worse.  I refused to go with them, but took the bicycle on which I had come and went to work.  The other day, the military police started coming to my home.  I was hiding for a month and a half.  While in hiding, after a conversation with the Croatian Helsinki Committee, the Ministry of Justice was consulted; they called the command and Civil Defense and confirmed that they had my petition and probably to leave me alone.  That is when this persecution stopped.  Finally, the unit commander gave me a certificate to confirm I had spent two months in that unit, from the date on which I received the draft notice until 9/30.  But regardless of that, a military prosecutor started the process against me again, and so I attended a hearing in Karlovac on 2/17.  The trial has been postponed until the documents from the ministry can be obtained and the witnesses from the military are summoned.  I do not know what will happen or how things will develop.<p>

<h2> Singer In front of a Ramp</h2><p>

<b> Q: You refused to take arms when drafted into the ex-JNA?</b><p>

- Yes. I received the draft notice in the September of 1991 from JNA.  I was supposed to report to the barracks.  I refused, went there and told them.  I decided not to shoot at anyone.  I told them so and left.  I was afraid the agents would look for me and went into hiding.  That is when I blocked my floor.  A military person, working for Croatia, lived on the floor.  He was probably killed by the agents.  I was also afraid for myself, so I blocked the elevator door and changed the locks on the staircase doors and distributed the keys only to the tenants.  It went like that for a year.  I unblocked the elevator door when the danger from JNA passed.  On the other hand, then this thing started.  So I am jobless now because I had been hiding.  I do not work, my wife had a nervous breakdown and my kid's hair has turned white.<p>

<b> Q: You were in those ``White Tigers"?</b><p>

 
- Yes, those were the white rubber boots.  Every morning a truck came to pick us up here in Sarac and take us up to Turanj.  We worked there till seven, eight, till the dusk when they would start shooting.  The shooting would already start at six o'clock.  Bombs... <p>

<b> Q: How far were the Serbs?</b><p>

- Twenty, thirty meters.  They watched us non-stop.<p>

<b> Q: Were you mistreated?</b><p>

- Everything was inhuman.<p>

<b> Q: They made you sing Ustashe songs?</b><p>

- All kinds of things happened.  For example, I had to write twenty, thirty times ``I am a Cetnik" and so on.  If you refuse, you know that a beating comes next.  Sometimes I had to run out barefoot on the ramp in front of them, sing those songs, return, then put on the white boots, return to the middle of the road and again sing the songs.  Anyway, that passed too...<p>

<h2> All the Names Were Written Down</h2><p>

<b> Q: Taking into account your situation, with no income, what will you do if they sentence you again?</b><P>

- I believe they will not, they will understand, someone will understand... And if they do sentence me.., well, I shall try to appeal.  We will see what happens.  This is my country, same as for any other citizen here and I do not intend to leave. No way.  Only, God forbid, if I really had nothing to live on,  if I spend all of my savings, nothing changes or if I cannot find work. I would leave only in those circumstances, if I really had nothing to live on. I would have to look for a job.<p>

<b> Q: Even over to the Serb side?</b><P>

- No, I mean abroad, Slovenia or Germany...  I am a butcher, so hopefully there will be work for me somewhere.<P>

<B> Q: Do you know the men who mistreated you?</b><P>

- I wrote down everything and stashed it away.  Names and surnames, what happened and everything.  I told the judge if something happens to me or to my family, I shall release the information abroad in world newspapers. <p>

<h1>  The Secret of Mitigated Crimes</h1><p>

<strong> Mokronoge Case:Two years after a brutal murder of 9 muslim civilians the three men charged with the crimes are finally free</strong><P>

<hr>
The District Court in Zagreb recently released from custody Ivan Bakovic, a.k.a. Ikach, from Tomislavgrad, one of the three persons charged with participating in a murder of 9 people in the Duvno valley village Mokronoge, in the neighboring country Bosnia-Hercegovina.  The crime happened on 8/10/93, around midnight, in a forest not far from the house of the Baslaga family; the members of the Baslaga family (Dika, Subra, Husein, Emira and Emir) and the Tiko family (Ibrahim, Muharem and Mustafa) as well as Simha Duliman were killed from a fire arm.  Their massacred bodies were found the following morning.  The indictment by the District State Prosecutor of the Republic of Croatia (RC) states that the premeditated crime was committed by the soldiers from the HVO (Croatian Defense Council, Bosnian Croat militia) base in helidrom near Mostar, namely forementioned Ivan Bakovic, Albert Tomic, a.k.a. <a HREF="feral1.html"> Poglavnik</a> from Dugo Selo, and Petar Majic from Sisak [eastern Croatia], born in Konjic [central Bosnia-Hercegovina] and without a nickname.  It is also said that another person, so far unidentified, certain Ivan, took part in the crime as a driver (?) of the charged trio.<p>

The indictment says that the murderers, just before midnight, stopped their car, driven by mysterious "Ivan", nearby the Baslagic's house at the edge of the village.  It is claimed that they were armed with a semiautomatic rifle (Bakovic), a machine gun (Tomic) and a Kalasnikov (Majic) and dressed in the HVO military uniforms.  They entered the house and encountered the Baslagics.  They forced, while swearing and threatening to "kill them like rabbits", nine people out of the house and dragged them 1/2 km toward a forest at the end of the village.  They ordered the victims to lie face down on the ground and then shot  them.  None of the victims survived.<p>

Bullet cartriges fired from the Bakovic's and Tomic's weapons were found at the scene of the massacre.  Court experts say that at least 102 bullets were fired at the victims.  Besides bullet wounds they noticed several "cut wounds on dead bodies".  Routine HVO military police patrol also passed through the village that night.  They arrived after a call from a civilian policeman, who heard shots from infantry weapons and a bomb explosion around midnight.  Military policeman Miro Bakovic was in the military patrol; he later became a defense witness and stated that "the military patrol did not notice anything suspicious."<p>

Until now, the most important prosecution witness has been little Amela Baslagic.  It is known how she survived, but no one knows why.  Allegedly her elder sister begged the men in uniform to let Amela go to sleep to a room on an upper floor.  Until now, no one has explained why the murderers spared little Amela.  One can say it was a miracle, but it doesn't prove anything.  Anyway, the girl is alive and, as stated in an investigation document recognized in Bakovic her brother Emir's (he was killed that night) school friend.  "He was in uniform and had a gun, like a machine gun," said Amela.<p>

A warrant was issued a day after the murder by the HVO military police; indictment is based on the data collected by the Ministry of Defense of the RC.  Although both domestic and "foreign" military institutions were involved in a pursuit, the second accused, Albert Tomic, is still on the run and is being tried in absentia, while the rest of the team is defending themselves from freedom: the third accused, Mojic, for example, has been free for more than a year!<P>

<h2> Merciful Indictment</h2><p>

<p>
The release of the accused and their defense from freedom was based on the "quality" of the murders, the category which had been introduced by the Public  Prosecutor's Office [Drzavno Odvjetnistvo].  Namely, the indictment is based on 9 "plain" murders, which legally assumes a series of mitigating circumstances.  When a murder is deemed to be "plain" a release from custody is mandatory.  The accused Bakovic and Majic were released following that logic.  Besides the opportunity for the defense from freedom, the maximum punishment for several "plain" murders is a 15 year jail term.  Between idle counting of the possible years in jail and the actual motive for that decision gapes (ir)responsibility in the administration of justice.  The Deputy State Prosecutor, Radovan Santek, thinks, however, that everything was done properly.  In other words, the Public Prosecutor's Office was simply forced by law to do as it did.  Public still does not know why the Public Prosecutor's Office representative decided for a "plain" murder when he had legal option to call the things with their real name - "qualified" murder; for which there is enough evidence and which is, besides, the only suitable name for the merciless massacre which happened that night. Because the legal term "qualified" denotes "a cruel and perfidious" murder, "a premeditated attempt to endanger safety of another person" and motives of "greed, reckless revenge or other especially low motives."  The elements of a "qualified" murder are numerous in this case - except for "greed".  The horror of what happened that night, certainly exceeds the category of a "plain" murder and deserves a suitable legal treatment, which is in this case absent.<p>

However, besides internal "legal difficulties", the external are also present.  It would not be improbable and for a first time that the Croatian justice system bends backward and "follows orders" in order to hide the real intentions.  Clearly, in a wider context the judicial mishmash was fabricated because of a state or private interests.  That isn't all that important anymore; what is important is that the mishmash was "mixed up" against the interests of the judiciary and justice.<p>

<h2> Vow of Silence</h2><p>

Careful thinking might lead us to the understanding of why the judiciary again allowed itself to be castrated.  If we follow the fact that unlike a "plain" murder, a "qualified" murder encompasses war crimes, we may be on a right path.  This time pressure was applied on the judiciary to avoid the disclosure of a fact that the accused are, regardless of HVO uniforms and their place of birth, citizens of the RC and, until recently, soldiers in the Croatian Army [HV, Hrvatska Vojska], whose soldiers were not supposed to be on the territory of another state, nor were they supposed to commit war crimes.<p>

Apparently, this is the main reason why recently the whole case, after being a public matter for more than a year and being greeted with numerous newspaper articles in its first phase, became a secret affair.  The case proceedings thus became secret and everyone involved, from the judicial council, defense attorney, prosecutor to the judges, is supposed to keep silent about the case, based on the professional code of conduct.  After the Public Prosecutor had turned a massacre into a "plain" crime, the procedure of closing the main hearing to public is legitimate and is based on Article 278 of the criminal code: " The council (judicial, auth. remark) can at any time, officially or at a suggestion of the parties involved, exclude public from the main hearing in order to keep a secret (...) protect morality (...) or <strong>protect other specific interests of a social community</strong> [society, state?] (author's emphasis).<p>

<h2> Justice in Custody</h2><P>

It is surprising that the case was not secret from the start.  Also surprising is a manic eagerness with which the Tomislavgrad military and political nomenclatura [authorities] found the culprits and the heart rending outrage over the crimes as well as generous "guarantees for the safety of the Muslims remaining on that territory."  Those days, an elegiac atmosphere crept into all the Duvno valley hearts.  Zagreb daily, <em>Vecernji List</em>, for example, 2 days after the murders wrote how "a sad news that 9 persons of muslim nationality have been killed, reverberated among the inhabitants of Tomislavgrad."  All that at a time when Smiljko Sagolj was at the top of popularity with his antimuslim hysteria.<p>

So much sincere compassion and heart rending pain in only one day for "some Muslims" (Sagolj), only to make the case secret.  What has changed after an orgy of "filantropic" chanting of "We shall punish the offenders!" (Mijo Tokic, the president of HVO Tomislavgrad) - we can only guess.  That it is possible to act according to the laws and justice in cases like this one, is suggested by , according to the significance, almost identical case on the muslim side;  their extremists killed two Catholic priests in Fojnica [central Bosnia] last year.  The criminals were quickly caught and sentenced.  It is interesting that a judge (a Croat) after a while added a few years to the original sentence.<p>

On the other side, in democratic Croatia, the whole case of reckless slaughter is viewed from all possible vantage points except for the most important one - the judicial point of view.  The way the things are right now, the future resolution of this case will remain a secret for us.<p>

<h1>  Trpimir for an Executioner and a Victim</h1>
      <h2>  Open Letter to Branko Lustig, Producer of a Misunderstanding in Washington</h2><P>

 


<h2><i> by Mirko Mirkovic<p> Feral Tribune, 2/20/95, Split, Croatia</h2><p></i>


I would like to review your speech presented to the Press Club in Washington, D.C. on 11/21/94, which made a great impact recently in Croatia.  It was published in its entirety by Vjesnik and then by Vecernji List [state-owned daily newspapers].  Obviously, it deserved such publicity, since it is full of praise for President Tudjman.  You had an honor of sitting next to him at the premier of the film ``Schindler's List" in cinema ``Europe" [in Zagreb].  You were, in your words,``excited because all of the important functionaries in the Croatian government were present."  I can sympathize that it really must have been exciting. You noticed that the president was personally moved by the film:``after the film finished, he got up, gave me a hug and I could swear that his eyes were full of tears."<p>

If only he could have seen ``Schindler's List" before he published his book ``Wastelands of Historical Reality" [``Bespuca Historijske Zbiljnosti"].  Maybe he would not have quoted a disgusting story about the Jews in Jasenovac [largest concentration camp in Croatia during the WWII], contributed by two antisemites who had been released from the camp.  In any case, why is it that, as a historian, he did not find it necessary to quote testimonies of Jewish inmates who survived the Ustashe [Croatian fascists] Auschwitz by pure luck?  Their testimonies about that inferno were collected in a book published in 1972. It is true that, later, as a president of the republic, he ``expressed sorrow for the suffering of the Croatian Jews in the holocaust."  Commendable. However, the president of Germany, Roman Hertzog went a step further than expressing ``sorrow" when last summer he said in Warsaw:``I beg for forgiveness for what the Germans did to you."<p>

The day after the premiere of ``Schindler's List", you said:``I received a high Croatian decoration, Order of Prince Trpimir...  During the ceremony the president apologized to me and all members of the Jewish community for those who during the Second World War took part in Enforcement of Hitler's racist laws."<P>

In 1941 you were still a child and maybe did not know that in Croatia racist laws were not enacted by Hitler, but by Independent State of Croatia (ISC) [Nezavisna Drzave Hrvatska or NDH was a Nazi puppet state from 1941 to 1945; it was run by Croatian fascist movement - Ustashe in Croatian] and enforced by Ustashe government.  You might not be aware that Vinko Nikolic was an important functionary in that government, a member of the Ustashe High Command.  He was enraptured by the Poglavnik [term corresponding to Fuhrer in Ustashe terminology] Ante Pavelic.  ``Our new intelligentsia," wrote Vinko Nikolic in the Novi List on 7/2/41,``must raise new generations under ustashe [ie. fascist] values and above all, must engender in Croatian youth, from the earliest age, unlimited and devoted loyalty towards the Poglavnik."  He was not only enraptured with the Poglavnik, but also interested in literature, which, according to him would help the Ustashe movement ``to mold a new man," whose main characteristics must be:``nationalistic soul, Ustashe heart, Poglavnik's teaching and Ustashe creed" (Vinko Nikolic, National Goals of Literature, Zagreb, 1944).  He showed his ``loyalty to the Poglavnik" in the emigration to Madrid in 1949, when the Ustashe crimes were already known around the world, by composing an ode to Poglavnik's ISC.<P> 

Why am I mentioning this to you?  Because that gentlemen recently returned to Zagreb, to the government's warm welcome.  President Tudjman, fighter against fascism in the WWII, did not know better then to make this gentlemen (who with his ``Ustashe heart" took part in the machinery of the holocaust) a member of the upper house of the Croatian parliament!   No, that ``educator according to the fascist values" never killed anyone himself.  He sat at his desk and supported criminals with his pen.  Do you know that, mister Lustig ?<P>

<h2>Men for all Times</h2><P>

Do you think that a man who in the third Reich demanded from the youth ``limitless devotion to the Fuhrer," could today, in democratic Germany become a member of Bundestag - German Federal Parliament?  Do you think that the units of the German Army could be named after Nazi war criminals, as some units of the Croatian Army bear names of Ustashe butchers?  Do you think that some SS-Sturmbandfuhrer, who during the third Reich signed a racist order, could get today a high decoration from the president of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG)?  Still, all of this is possible.  But not in todays Germany.  Signatory of the racist Ustashe order in 1941, Ustashe stozernik [military rank] Ivo Rojnica, was decorated by the Poglavnik with the order of merit `` for the zealous service in Ustashe movement."  The very same zealot of Ustashe movement - who declared in ``Slobodna Dalmacija":``everything I did in 1941 I would do again" - has recently received a decoration of the high Order of Prince Trpimir from the hands of president Tudjman personally!  Of course this case is not unique.  Accomplice in the German genocide on the Balkan, Kurt Waldheim also received a high decoration from Pavelic and then, after the war, as a secretary of the UN, another one from Tito!  Some people are truly for all times.  Franjo Tudjman, Tito's general, knows that much.<P>

The grotesque part is that you, Mr. Lustig, an Auschwitz survivor, wear the same decoration as a Ustashe officer who ``zealously worked" to implement the holocaust on the territory of the ISC.  And with great success.  Of approximately 40,000 Jews on the territory of ISC, three quarters were killed.  Survivors were only those who managed to escape to the Italian occupation zone or joined the Partisans [indigenous communist guerilla army under Tito's leadership].  Many were helped by the Croatians.  But while the Croatian citizens, in personal danger, were helping persecuted Jews as much as they could, the government of ISC was killing them whenever possible.<P>

You quoted president Tudjman's message to Melvin Salzberger and Abraham Foxman, in which he distances himself and the Croatian government from the quisling Croatian state [ISC] and the Ustashe regime.  Very good and commendable.  But if you lived here, I believe that as a Jew, you would be worried by the rehabilitation of the Ustashe ISC, which encompasses historiography, newspaper articles, TV talk shows, naming of military units after infamous Ustashe ``knights", all the way to restaurants with names like ``Poglavnik", ``Coffee Bar Ustasha" and similar reminders of the genocide of the Jews in ISC.  Not far from the house in which I live, one can find Poglavnik's picture and a bust in a bar, so that the patrons can get the idea about the owner's political leanings.  I am convinced that you will agree with me that it is unimaginable that in todays Germany restaurants and hotels would be named after the Fuhrer or the SS officers, or that a Fuhrer's picture could be displayed in them.  In Germany, such things are regulated by the law.  We in Croatia apparently have more democracy than Germans.  If it is true, as you said, that it is ``improbable that in Croatia we see the strengthening of fascism," one faces a question: why does not the president and the government protest against the rehabilitation of the criminal ISC?  It is true, as you said, that in Croatia ``there is no antisemitism but there are a few antisemites."  After Auschwitz, antisemitism can hardly be en vogue. The Croatian president and the government on several occasions, have expressed their favorable inclination towards the Jewish community.  Was that because of some special love towards the Jews?  Or in order to score a few good PR points in the USA?  - I leave the answer to you.<P>

It is unthinkable that in democratic Germany an ex-Nazi propaganda boss could appear on TV and discuss the benefits of the third Reich.  On the other hand, one of the Zagreb TV channels showed in 1992 a program with the boss of Ustashe propaganda, Daniel Crljen.  The same one who during the ISC declared:``Croatia has radically solved its Jewish problem."<P>

<H2>Points scored away from the Home field</H2><P>

You said that ``the tendencies described in the press (I suppose foreign !) are marginal and have no support from the president or the government."  Very good.  However, a striking question is why that same president and the government do not publicly and decisively condemn numerous cases of rehabilitation of Ustashe ISC.  Nothing would be easier, since they have a total control over the daily press and the electronic media.<P> 

For the Jewish community, the instances of Ustashe rehabilitation can hardly be ``marginal."  Especially not for those Jews who survived the holocaust and who after returning to their homeland found out that they were left alone in this world, without a mother and a father, without brothers and sisters, without their children.  All of them have disappeared without a trace in Ustashe branch offices of ``the final solution", in Jasenovac, Stara Gradiska, Jadovna, on Pag.
By the way, the last several hundred Jews in Croatia, mostly elderly, were turned turned over to Eichmann, ie. sent straight to the Nazi gas chambers. Cardinal Stepinac tried to save Zagreb Chef Rabbi, Miroslav Freiberger and his family.  He did not succeed.  Eichmann's word had more importance for the Poglavnik than that of Cardinal Stepinac.<P>

Would it therefore be marginal for you, Mr. Lustig, if you were facing today the rehabilitation of racist butchers from Auschwitz?  You also said:``claims that the present government encourages fascism are absolutely false."  If that is true, I would be grateful if you could explain how that squares with the fact  that the approximately 2000 monuments to the fighters against and victims of fascism have been destroyed in Croatia [since 1991] ( by ``unknown" perpetrators); memorials for the people who were cruelly killed simply because they had been born Jews, or Serbs or Gypsies or were Croatian antifascists!  Also, do not you find it perplexing, as an Auschwitz survivor, that president Tudjman was so keen to erase the Victims of Fascism Square name?   I believe that you will agree with me, when I say that those fighters against fascism in Croatia sacrificed their lives in the common struggle of the humanity against the deadly darkness which threatened to turn all of Europe in a continental Auschwitz.  Why have not the Croatian authorities condemned or why have not they decisively confronted that barbarian destruction of the memorials for the victims of fascism?  Or maybe someone thinks that the historical facts can be thrown into a black hole of oblivion, as did the Big Brother's ``Ministry of Truth" in Orwell's 1984?<P>

<H2>Black Hole of Oblivion</H2><P>

In your Washington speech you said:``the number of Jews in Partisans was small." With that claim you unfortunately misinformed your American audience.  Yugoslavia had about 70,000 Jews before the WWII.  About 4,500 of those, or more than 6 percent of the total Jewish population, took part in the national liberation war.  That means that the participation of Jews in the antifascist struggle was proportionally larger than that of any other nation on the territory of ex-Yugoslavia.<P> 

You tried to convince your American audience that Kuna is an appropriate choice for the name of the Croatian currency.  You said:`` I personally do not see that as a connection with the fascist period.". Ustashe ISC was just the first state to name the Croatian currency Kuna.  But what sort of connection could that have with our ``most democratic country in Europe" [a common phrase in the Croatian press, referring to Croatia].<P>

Commemoration of the 50 years since the liberation of Auschwitz has recently taken place in Poland.  Eli Wiesel, Nobel Prize winner, and ,as you said, your friend from the death march in January of 1943 took part in the commemoration. you quoted his words:`` To forget is to kill the victims for the second time. We could not stop their death the first time round.  We must not allow them to be killed again."  Don't you also find intolerable the rehabilitation of Ustashe ISC, which was until the last moment of the third Reich its ally in the most horrendous genocide in history?<P>

	<h1>MUP [Ministry of Interior Affairs] DRAFTS BY FORCE</h1>
			
<h2>VREME, September 4th, 1995</h2>


	A large number of the refugee families from Krajina, whose male
members were captured by the Ministry of Interior Affairs (MIA), and whose
fate is, as of yet, unknown, have appealed to the Helsinki Committee on
Human Rights. The Committee mentioned one of the appellants - a mother of
Djuro Solaja (b.1971) who, together with his pregnant wife, after the
operation "Storm" [Croatian takeover of the Krajina region], found refuge
in Jagodina. Serbian MIA took him away on August 20th, and he has not been
heard from since then. Djuro Solaja's mother tried to find the whereabouts
of her son from the authorities - Serbian Government, Serbian Ministry of
Internal Affairs, and from the Bureau of the Srpska Republic in Belgrade.
The Helsinki Committee has asked all refugees with similar problems to 
contact them.<P>

		<h1>	CINDERS EXPEL THE MOSLEMS </h1>
		<h2>(The authorities helpless against the terrorists)</h2>


<h2>VREME, September 4th, 1995</h2>

	Ten Moslem families have left their homes in the Batkovic 
village, in the Priboj municipality, in fear that their houses might be 
burned down. The president of the municipal seat of the Democratic Party 
in Priboj, Smajo Polimac, said that "all the remaining inhabitants of 
Batkovic village fled after the houses of Sefik Islamagic and Akif 
Dedovic were set on fire, on August 20th and 22nd." He added that the 
fleeing families found refuge in the houses of their relatives in Priboj, 
and that he talked with the president of Priboj municipality, Milic 
Popovic, on this subject. According to Polimac, during the conversation, 
Popovic declared that the authorities of Priboj "were unable to prevent the 
expulsion of Moslems, and protect the citizens of the municipality from 
violence." He added that in  Priboj, as of now, 60 houses and businesses 
owned by Moslems have been burned down, but the authorities have not 
identified the culprits in a single case. <P>

<h1>Prime Minister Marijanovic in a Triple Role</h1>

<strong><em> by Dimitrije Boarov</em><p>

Vreme, Beograd, FR Yugoslavia, 12/4 1995</strong><P>

<em>Vreme</em> turned out to be a bad forecaster when, two weeks ago, we guessed that Mirko Marijanovic, Serbian prime minister, as an owner of a company "Progresgas-trading" is favored to win the competition for the contract for export of 400,000 tons of wheat;  the export of wheat is supposed to finance the import of gas and other fuel from Russia.  It turned out that the favorite was actually Mirko Marjanovic, but as the director of the import-export company "Progress" from Belgrade.<P>

Actually, prime minister Marijanovic will, on December 3, 1995, decide whether to accept his own offer of $140 per ton for 400,000 tons of wheat to be exported via the Danube and paid in advance (stipulated in the competition rules), plus $160 per ton for 500,000 tons of which 30% is to be paid in advance or $165 per ton, provided the payment is made after the completed export.  Those who witnessed the start of the bidding at noon on November 23, say that the atmosphere was indeed extraordinary.  Some 60 people were present, it was noisy, even rowdy when the "Progress'" offer was opened as the 35th out of 36 offers.  Truly, so far unseen scene at a commercial bidding whose result was known in advance.<P>

It should be mentioned that the best offer, of $200 per ton, was made by a company from Novi Sad, "Nafta" Inc. (majority shareholder Ilija Radun); however they proposed to export the wheat via Bar [port in Montenegro] and pay for it in oil (and one could discuss the actual price for oil).  It is interesting that the "Progress'" offer is just by little higher than many other offers, which went as high as $164 per ton, payment after the completed transaction.  The lowest offer , of $71 per ton, was made by "Profi center Panonija" from Novi Sad.  Larger state-owned companies offered between $125 and $135 per ton.  In the end the majority left disappointed, convinced that Marjanovic's "Progress" had already won, since the representative of the state directorate asked for a ten day delay, after which Marjanovic's government was supposed to reach the final decision.  Especially disappointed were those who had been supported by foreign companies, since, as the representative of one of the companies said, a delay "longer than 10 minutes" is always risky.<P>

<strong>No Profit for Farmers</strong>:  Main complaints are based on a suspicion that prime minister Marijanovic had had a chance to get an overview of possible offers from an earlier secret Serbian directorate competition with "open prices" in which some 17 companies took part.  Some even believe that "the closed envelopes" were not that closed for a curious director Marijanovic;  indeed he had a cheapest possible victory, by the skin of his teeth.  The second complaint has a firmer basis, since Marijanovic is suspected of using gas obtained through "Progresgas-trading", that is unpaid gas bills as an advance payment for the wheat.<P>

At the session at which the offers were made public, Milivoj Jonjev, the director of "Koprodukt" from Novi Sad demanded that the competition be annulled, as the majority of participants did not have an equal access to the information about the suspension of the sanctions against FR Yugoslavia.  And the offer depended on the information, as the situation is quite different in the situation in which the access to the foreign sources of financing is possible.  He stated that he was convinced that the wheat would be exported for $140 per ton, which is below the amount which could be secured for the benefit of the Serbian budget.  Of course, Serbian reserves should be motivated to obtain the highest possible price.<P>

One problem for our favorite, "Progresgas-trading", was, it seems, that the import of gas and fuel from Russia is based on open or camouflaged barter arrangements, and barter is the most convenient way to hide the real prices of the traded goods and the profits made.  <em>Politika's</em> sources (11/22/95) claimed that the gas import hit a glitch when the Russian side refused to accept to barter gas for clothing and shoes but instead demanded foodstuffs, and not only wheat, but also meat, oil and sugar.  It is clear to every trader that the problem here is not in the lack of the latter goods in Serbia, but the assumed prices of the goods in the barter arrangement.  In seems that the owners of "Progressgas-trading" on both sides (Russian and Serbian) cannot agree, among themselves and with their states, what sort of profit should be made on the import/export of gas.  "Progresgas-trading" is conveniently placed to make a profit both as an importer and an exporter and both  deals are set up by the corresponding governments.<P>

In the public there is quite a lot of confusion regarding the "world market price" for wheat.  According to an expatriot who is among the leading wheat traders in one of the biggest Swiss firms, there isn't a single world market price for wheat.  Depending on the quality of wheat, transport arrangements and  the part of the world, the price ranges from $170-180 per ton and $280-300.  The prices have significantly gone up since this summer because both European Union and the USA have abolished subsidies to their farmers and the world reserves of wheat are at the lowest level in the last 17 years.<P>

Our wheat can probably fetch between $170-175 per ton ("break even" price), since those willing to pay more will probably choose French or other similar wheat because of its more even quality and better established and more reliable delivery technology.<P>

All together, it is already noticeable that the Serbian directorate for reserves, which has so far only paid two thirds of the amount owed to the farmers for the wheat which had been bought this summer for 280 dinars per ton (which, last summer, corresponded to approximately $60 to $70 per ton) already has made a huge profit, in excess of 100 percent.  Now it will divide a part of that profit with an exporter.  Besides, if the gas is paid with wheat, based on the prices mentioned by experts, monthly import of 189 millons of cubic meters of gas would correspond to approximately 75,000 tons of wheat.  "Progress" offer in theory means that the payment would cover the whole year of gas deliveries.  But, the socialism has taught us that there is a lot of difference between the theory and practise.<P>

By the way, the story of "Progress-trading" a company which has, with only 6 employees, reached the 9th position on the <em>Ekonomska Politika</em> list of the most successful Yugoslav companies has recently entered an interesting turn.<P>

It's been heard that prime minister Marijanovic has contested the registration of "Progresgas-trading" as a private company. Although it is impossible to check the validity of that rumor, it is the fact that <em>Ekonomska Politika</em> failed to publish the list of "200 most successful private companies" after the author of the survey informed the editorial board that "there are certain uncertainties in connection with the data used in the survey."  Those uncertainties could not be solved so that, on 11/27/95, <em>Ekonomska Politika</em> published the list while failing to name the top company, apparently "Progresgas-trading".  The uncertainties arose from a fact that "Progressgas-trading" was registered as a private company, and that prime minister Marijanovic now, three years later, is of the opinion that "Progresgas-trading" is not a private company.  The company's director, Toplica Nedeljkovic, stated that "Progresgas-trading" had been founded in 1992 as a "mixed russian-yugoslav company" and that it had been founded by "Progress" from Belgrade and the largest Russian company, "Gazprom"; consequently the investment and profits are equally divided between the founders.<P>

<strong>"Private Internationale"</strong>: the public still hasn't been informed about the nature of the alleged court mistake in the registration of "Progresgas-trading", probably because in that explanation, prime minister Marijanovic would have to explain how the monopoly on import of gas and oil to Yugoslavia was taken from "The Serbian Oil Industry", even before the sanctions had been introduced, and ended up in his hands.  According to some rumors circulating through Belgrade three years ago, Marjanovic's main argument for allocation of the gas import monopoly to "Progresgas-trading" was that the Russian side insisted on dealing with a private company.  Besides, it is questionable whether the Russian side is represented by a private company, or whether the controlling influence in "Gazprom" is a person in a position similar to that of Marjanovic.<P>

Not only has "Progresgas-trading" snatched away profitable business from the largest state owned company in Serbia, it has also pushed aside an earlier consortium and won the contract for the gasification of eastern and southern Serbia.  Toplica Nedeljkovic now claims that the Russian and Serbian sides have agreed to invest this Spring the whole profit (Russian part as well) made from the import of gas into construction of a southern extension of a main gas pipeline (Paracin-Pojate-Dimitrovgrad) which would also extend from Nish on one side towards Kladovo and Prahovo, on the other towards Leskovac and Vranje and on another one towards Kursumlija and Gnjilane (the cost of this project has been estimated at $250 million).  Once this pipeline is completed, the total capacity of the Serbian pipeline will jump from the present 3.5 millions of cubic meters to 7.5 billions.  Multiplied by 0.33 dinars, which is the present domestic consumption rate for gas, those cubic meters amount to DM 1 billion.  Once that figure is compared with the present theoretical capacity of DM 400 million, it becomes obvious that the question of ownership of "Progresgas-trading" is not unimportant.<P>

The problem here is not in the possible profit made by a private company.  The problem is that a public official has a conflict between his own interests and that of the public.<P>

<strong> The reports submitted by the UNCRO operational teams for human rights (HRAT), UN service for humanitarian crisis and European observers, written from the personally obtained data as well as the data obtained from other sources - although still a "rough material" - suggest that the "Storm" besides liberation of the occupied territories also had for a goal ethnic cleansing of Serbs from that area.  After initial sporadic informations, reports from that macabre UN-accounting are becoming "richer" with corpses, looting, burned houses...</strong><P>

<hr>

While in the Croatian public, the "Storm" has already been covered in golden dust and while we are only waiting for the election before the operation moves to history text books, a new chapter about the "Storm" has just been opened by the world.  After the analysis of its military-political consequences and changes which it has brought to the power balance in the former Yugoslavia, its dark side has recently come into a focus:  murders and systematic destruction and theft of the property of the Krajina Serbs.  The impetus for this shift was given by the documents of the UNCRO, European observers and organizations for the protection of human rights, whose content jumped on the front pages of the world media outlets, and then, as usual, reluctantly returned to Croatia.<p>

Although the material is still "rough", the first general reports about the humanitarian aspects of the military-political action of the Croatian army and police, its content suggests that the "Storm" besides the liberation of the occupied Croatian territories had for a goal ethnic cleansing of Serbs from that area.  The most convincing proof for this thesis comes from the UNCRO documents, actually that of its service for a humanitarian crisis.  Although final reports and analysis will be finished, due to the amount of the material according to UNCRO, at best in a month, the existing compilation of the reports about human rights and the chronology of the human right violations in sectors South and North already seem like a continuation of the Bassiouni commission report which mostly records Serb crimes committed during first years of the war in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina. <P>

Immediately after the agreement between Hrvoje Sarinic and Yasushi Akashi on 8/6/95, with which UNCRO was confirmed as a monitor of human rights in the area  the "Storm" rolled over, operational teams for human rights (HRAT) were founded;  they were composed from the members of the UN Center for human rights and UNCRO-PHA and persons for liaison with civil  UN police and military UN observers.  The members of the teams started moving through the recently liberated territory recording day after day everything that was happening in the wings of the "Storm".  While the chronology of the human rights violations in sectors South and North, concisely, almost like  on a contents page, records a date, place and a short description of the human rights violation, the Service for a humanitarian crisis report (subtitle indicates that it is a compilation  of the reports about human rights) chronologically, starting with 8/7/95 and ending with 9/12/95 in the form of news reports describes human rights violations recorded by the UN teams, as well as European observers and also informations obtained from other sources.<P>


<h2>New Cases of Arson</h2>

After initial brief information, with frequent remarks that UN teams had a limited freedom of movement and access to certain places, already after 8/10 daily reports become more detailed and "richer" with corpses, burned and demolished houses as well as looting.  For example, in sector South on 8/16/95 HRAT recorded: "Knin authorities finally allowed UN to inspect the cemetery.  All together 96 crosses have been placed on four mounds with flattened tops;  one of the mounds is significantly larger than the others.  The crosses  are standing very close to each other (approximately 70cm apart);  there are no individual graves.  Less then 20 crosses have a name on them.  Despite obvious efforts of the authorities to prepare the location in advance of our visit, the over-all look of the location leaves the impression of a mass grave. A civil defense official, present during the inspection, stated that all the casualties had been fingerprinted and that they had been photographed and taped with a video-camera.  The same official stated that the majority of the dead were from Knin and that they had died during the Croatian army artillery assault on Knin on 8/4/95 and 8/5/95.  It was said that the bodies had been buried 'according to the international conventions', each in a separate bag, at the depth of 1.1m and 10cm from each other.  When the UN civilian police team tried to investigate a different location, which was suspected of containing a mass-grave as well, they were shot at from a sniper rifle.  Nobody was hurt.  The team counted 22 fresh graves, the smaller number of which was marked with crosses, and only five of which had names.  They noticed more houses in flames on 8/15/95 on locations near Benkovac, Otric and Drnis..."<P>

<h2>Corpses in a Ditch</h2>

Already, the following day, 8/17/95 the report noted:"Regional EU monitors center in Zagreb reports that arson in sector South continues.  According to their estimate, destruction of the property of non-Croats has wide proportions and is coordinated and performed under orders and, apparently, supported by the highest authorities.  It is impossible to correctly estimate the degree of destruction but the EU monitors estimate that 60%-80% of the property in the former sector South has been partly or completely destroyed.  One of the EU-monitors teams visited the collection center and military jail in Gospic.  They reported that there were 74 war prisoners and about 80 elderly persons in the center.  They also noticed more houses in flames; in some instances Croatian soldiers were present.  One burning house was seen in the village of Padeni, three along the road between Padeni and Gracac, three in Komalic, two in Bakarja, three in Kistanje, three in Otocac and one in a village near Drnis.<P>

A TV team from WTN, accredited by the UN tried to film an arson near Drnis; seven Croatian soldiers surrounded them; the team was taken inside a house where they were in a very insulting way told that they have no right to film anything.  Their videotapes were confiscated, their documents thoroughly inspected and more than DM1000 was stolen from one of the team members.  Later, the team was turned over to the Croatian police who threatened to take their passports away.<P>

On 8/16/95 a HRAT team saw 4 bodies in the village of Zagrovici; they looked as if they had been dead for at least a week.  Two bodies, both men, were lying in a ditch next to the main road.  Traces on the road indicated that the bodies had been dragged across the road to the place where they were found.  Both men had shot wounds through their heads.  Both were dressed in underwear and T-shirts and one of them had slippers on.  The right hand of the man with slippers was mutilated; several fingers had been cut off.  Both men were about 50-years-old.  Further away from the road the HRAT team found two more corpses; one was a 50-year-old man, lying next to his house wrapped in a bed sheet and with a shot wound through his head.  The fourth corpse,  the son of the previously mentioned man, as was later established, was found in a field;  the cause of death couldn't be established due to the advanced decomposition of the body.  UN civil police reported the discovery of another three corpses:  one body was that of a middle-aged man, dressed in a civilian clothes; it was lying in front of a burned (no signs of shelling damage) house in Zvjerinac;  the other two were men in uniforms, found in Golubic.  UNHCR officials were not allowed to enter the village of Vrlika on 8/16/95 although a HRAT team visited the village the day before without any problems.  We received a report that several bulldozers were seen during the day working next to the Orthodox cemetery in Vrlika.  On 8/15/95 the HRAT team noticed protective masks and rubber gloves, which seemed brand new, left on the ground in that place as well as the fresh tracks of a bulldozer..."  <P>

<h2> With a Bullet in the back of a head</h2>

And so on, day after day, a row of houses in flames, a row of looted houses, a row of civilians and  soldiers caught while looting the houses, and then corpses, old, in advanced stages of decomposition, but also new ones, of recently killed persons, cemeteries in Knin, Gracac, Gospic and elsewhere with fresh mounds, whose number grows incessantly during every follow-up visit by  HRAT teams.<P>

On 8/28/95 the report says:" A HRAT team found bodies of five recently killed persons in the village of Grubori.  On 8/25/95 the team checked on a big cloud of smoke and found a whole hamlet, some 20 houses and other buildings, in flames.  According to the HRAT team unconfirmed reports, allegedly a unit of ten Special Forces soldiers had been seen in the area that morning, approaching Grubori;  the unit had been wearing camouflage uniforms.  When the team arrived in Grubori, they only found elderly women in panic; the other inhabitants had been waiting for the UN workers near the village.  It had been reported that the Croatian police had been pressuring the inhabitants to leave the village.  The team received assurances from General <strong>Cermak</strong> that the Croatian authorities would respond adequately to that situation;  however, the representatives of the authorities only visited the village the following day.<P>

On the evening of 8/25/95 a HRAT team returned to the village and found bodies of two persons.  One, a 70-year-old man was found on the floor of his bedroom with a shot wound on the back of the head.  The other man, about 65-years-old, was found in the field with his throat cut.  When the team left the village, six elderly women and an elderly man, who remained in the village, declined the team's  offer to be taken to the town.  The women were crying and were deeply traumatized.  The following day, a HRAT team found burned remains of a 90-year-old man among the burned out ruins of the houses.  On 8/27/95 corpses of a man and a woman, 41 and 51 years old respectively, were found in the fields.  they had been shot in the head.  One person had disappeared.  The team also found a body of a person who had been killed approximately two weeks earlier near Grubor.  Croatian authorities claim that the arson and killings in Grubori were caused by an uncontrolled fire as a part of an anti-terrorist campaign to flush out the remaining 'RSK' [Republic Srpska Krajina] fighters from the area."<P>

<h2> General Cermak's Stance</h2>

On 9/4/95 HRAT recorded in its reports that "on 8/23/95 military observers found a dead body in Ivosevci;  when they returned to the same place on 8/24/95 they noticed that the corpse which was lying with a face turned toward the road and wrapped in a bed sheet, was that of a 75-80-year-old man.  The cause of death could not be established.  The team returned to the area on 9/1/95 and discovered that the body had been moved by 3 meters and covered with two bed sheets on top of which a video-recorder had been placed.  The team removed the bed sheets and found out that the body had been decapitated in the meantime.  After a search they found the head in a pigsty..."<P>

HRAT teams frequently informed the Croatian military and civilian  authorities about their discoveries, demanding an end to a destructive, thieving and bloody feast.  On 8/25/95 HRAT recorded:" Yesterday, at a meeting with general Cermak, the Croatian side was informed about the looting and arson.  At first, general Cermak ascribed responsibility for those deeds to the bandits in uniforms of the Croatian army, but later admitted that he was in charge of a large area and that  it was hard to control all parts of the territory.  He stated that he sincerely regrets these events, which were against the policies of the Croatian government."  On 9/1/95 it was however written:"UN continues to protest against the restrictions on the freedom of movement imposed by the Croatian authorities in the area northeast from Knin.  In a letter to general Cermak, sent yesterday, the commander of sector South mentioned that HRAT teams had noticed a dark smoke raising above a forest within the forbidden area.  He asked the authorities to abolish all restrictions of the freedom of movement and to stop the torching of houses.  He wandered why the authorities who were capable of so efficiently controlling all movement in the area, were unable to prevent incessant massive destruction of property..."<P>

<h2>Massive Hand Waving</h2>

Already on 9/5/95 HRAT recorded that "in the letter replying to the UN complains regarding the limitations on freedom of movement continuing looting, general Cermak claimed that he 'was shocked by yours statements about 'the banishing of the poor and elderly from their land,' which he thought 'were too strong and baseless accusations.'  He asked UN to reveal proofs for 'at least one case of people being expelled from their land and their houses burned.'  When a HRAT team spotted yesterday two buildings in flames in Cvijanovici and two Croatian soldiers overseeing the fire, they immediately informed general Cermak, but were told that he was out of the town."<P>

Reactions of the other representatives of the authorities, as well as that of good part of the opposition, to the UNCRO report (which in the meantime reached hands of Croatian journalists) and other reports about systematic human rights violations during the "Storm", are similar to that of general Cermak.  Satisfied that with the operation "Storm" was "finally solved the serb question in Croatia" they shrug everything off and qualify it as a political pressure on Croatia with a goal of forcing her to accept the latest solutions by the international community for Bosnia-Hercegovina and the occupied part of Croatia.<P>

How quickly it was forgotten that, until recently, Serb politicians, even those from Krajina, shrugged off similar reports and demands by the international community to stop crimes on the territories which they used to, or still, control?  When the internal impetus to stop a crime, for the sake of Croatia, is lacking, the concrete warnings are already coming, for now in a form of a question: how can Croatia expect reintegration of eastern Slavonia, Baranja and western Srijem, while at the same time she doesn't stop crime against the Serbs and their property in recently liberated territories?  Maybe the answer can already be found in the erdut agreement about the two-year-long international military protectorate over that area? <P>

<h1> Spies in a Grocery Store</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Perica Vucinic <br>  Vreme, 7/24/95, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia</i></h2><p>


<hr>

<FONT SIZE="+1"> The trial against seventy one Albanians ended last Monday after the verdicts had been pronounced at the District Court in Pristina;  the media referred to the accused as "the former policemen from the Republic of Serbia State Security Service (SDB)", as "parapolice of the Republic of Kosovo" or as "the syndicate of the former policemen."  Accepting the prosecution's claims, the court council found 18 persons from the group guilty of "organizing for enemy activity" (art. 136 of the FRY Criminal Code) in connection with the crime of "endangering the territorial integrity" (art. 116 of the Criminal Code); the Court Council sentenced them to jail terms lasting 4 to 8 years.  Fifty persons from the accused group were sentenced to jail terms ranging from one and a half years to four years for joining the group, two persons were acquitted and a trial against one of the accused was set aside to be continued separately.<P>

With Pristina sentences, a wider and large process against the Albanians from Kosovo accused of organizing a parallel police force draws to an end.  According to the indictment, those formations, arising from the legally registered syndicate of the former employees of the Serbian State Security Service, would serve "the Republic of Kosovo", the proclaimed goal of the Albanian national and political movement.  Before Pristina, the first one of these trials was brought to the conclusion in Pec in the middle of April; the next one was concluded in Gnjilane on June 6 and one is still going on in Prizren.  In Pec, the accused, who were tried in two groups (nine and seven persons), were sentenced to jail terms of one to five years; sentences in the following trial at Gnjilane were much milder.  Out of 28 accused persons, 16 received jail terms of six months to three years, eight fled Kosovo, four persons were acquitted and all the sentenced were released until the sentences go into effect.<P>


<STRONG>CALCULATIONS:</STRONG> In the context of Kosovo, and in the context of the overheated campaign with the newspaper headlines such as :"Parapolice on trial", "Lists for liquidation", "Ready for terror", "Spies in the Grocery Store", the sentences at Gnjilane were characterized as "measured" and "mild"; the conclusion was that the authorities had changed their attitude toward the case.  Therefore, those sentences were a precedent hailing a change in conduct;  hence, the people hastily started making calculations.  The explanation for the end of the trial against the Gnjilane group was found in the alleged directive from the United Yugoslav Left (JUL) which, allegedly, wanted to demonstrate the policy of reconciliation with the Kosovo Albanians;  along those lines, in calculations was included the reaction of the League of Communists - Movement for Yugoslavia (SKPJ) which accused the leader of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS), Vojislav Seselj (currently arrested in Gnjilane), of spreading hatred between the nations in Kosovo.  According to other speculations, Serbia wanted to demonstrate  to the world that it was reaching out to the Albanians, while they were refusing reconciliation.  After Pristina, two other explanations remain - local and "international".  According to the first one, the president of the Court Council in Gnjilane is about to retire, and hence didn't have to excessively pay attention to the wishes of the authorities; therefore he won't end his career as a "hanging judge".  The other, "international" explanation, instead of a sentimental judge, identifies the leader of the Republicans in the American Congress, Bob Dole, who is also a lobbyist for Albanians, as the primary mover;  Dole has brought attention to the Kosovo trials in the political bodies of his country, especially because of use of torture in the investigation.<P>

Regardless whether human or political sensibility was responsible, it was shown that guilt can be stretched from one case to another, as is always the case when art. 136 ("endangering territorial integrity") and 136 ("organizing for enemy activity") of the Criminal Code of the FRY are concerned.  "Neither of these articles is  questionable, in principle, although they should be analyzed to make sure they do not have ideological connotations," well-known Belgrade lawyer Nikola Barovic stated for <em>Vreme</em>.  The problem is, according to Barovic, to prove that someone formed an organization and than decided "to endanger territorial integrity of the country."  Or as Bajram Kelmendi, one of the defense attorneys in the Pristina trial stated for the news agency AIM, "at least one of the accused had to state that their intention had been to break away a part of the Yugoslav territory, namely Kosovo, and to form a separate state by force."  This defense attorney  believed that the public prosecutor drew the intent of the accused from the fact that the accused were Albanians;  having in mind that the Kosovo Albanians en masse, in the referendum, declared their wish for independent Kosovo, the prosecutor stated that the accused, undoubtedly, also in favor of the secession of Kosovo.  The crime sanctioned by the article 116 of the CC assumes the use of force, since that is the only way for secession, emphasize the defense attorneys.<P> 

<STRONG>PREPACKAGED SET UP:</STRONG>  Defense attorneys, without an exception, emphasize that the trials are fabricated political trials packaged in the criminal law.  Unofficially, one of them stated that in a trial like this, there was no defense and the epilogue would be the one desired by the authorities.  Therefore, he said, the tactical space of the defense was narrowed down, most often coming down to the decision of whether is was better simply to do nothing and shorten the procedural troubles of the accused or to persistently insist  on the lawfulness of the procedure and still produce no results in the end.  This remark is interesting; one can say that it is appropriate, but also suspicious.  It brings up several questions: does the defense counsel have a right, as a professional, to keep quiet once he determines that the trial has left the sphere of law; is the task of the defense to - when this is the case - only determine the political character of the trial, or to expose it during the proceedings, from "inside"?  All this brings out another interesting point: if the defense attorney is, in the political trial, more involved as a politician then as a lawyer, isn't it perhaps in the interest of the political agenda which the defense attorney represents that the defendant receives a stiffer sentence; in other words, to sacrifice the defendant to the altar of certain ideology.  Let us recall that the communists, also measured the greatness of their idea, force and victory with the sum of the years spent in jail; however, after coming to power, the "heroes" were ones who added up the years, not the ones who had been in jail.<P>

In case of the trials in Pec, Gnjilane and Pristina authorities quickly finished their part and got rid of a hot potato.  From their point of view, this was understandable: clean up your yard as quickly as possible so that the neighbors don't see the chaos. <P>

The trial in Prizren is still far from its conclusion. It began on May 3 and was adjourned on Monday (after the sentencing in Pristina).  43 of the accused are Albanians and one is a Turk.  "Group 44" is accused of "running an organization  since 1991, until 1994, on the territory of the Prizren district; the goal of the organization was to change the constitution and social structure of the FRY with use of force, and to break off a part of Kosovo and Metohija, inhabited with the members of the Albanian minority, from the Republic of Serbia and FR of Yugoslavia; on the initiative of the so-called Ministry of Internal affairs of the Republic of Kosovo and the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of Kosovo, they organized a police force, paramilitary forces with both active and reserve units..."<P>

Officially, the trial was adjourned for July 24 because the accused Halil Blakaj was not able to follow the trial.  The defense insisted that the trial be continued, and the Blakaj's case be continued later separately; Blakaj suffered a stroke in the courtroom, suffers from angina pectoris and is paralyzed in the left side of the body.  The suggestion was rejected, and the defense suspects that the reason for adjournment was that the police refused to present evidence, even to the court, before July.<P>

<strong>IMPROVISATION</strong>: "This trial is a pure legal improvisation; on the other hand, it represents a premeditated and organized political repression," said for <em>Vreme</em> Nikola Barovic, one of the defense attorneys in the trial.  The other one, Orhan Nevzati, didn't hide his resentment when he said that from the start this was "an unjust trial."  "This is not a legal trial; it serves a political purpose," said Nevzati for <em>Vreme</em>.  As a proof for his statement he used the composition of the accused.  Unlike in the other already finished trials in other towns, where the accused were all members of the syndicate of the former policemen, in Prizren, according to Borovic and Nevzati, there are four unrelated groups of accused.  The accused come, according to the defense attorneys, from the so-called parallel Albanian county authorities from the county of Orahovac; second group consists of the former employees of the state security service; president of the Turkish Peoples Party (TNP), Sezair Saipi, his nephew, who has been pushed into this in order to testify against his uncle, and the former president of the court in Orahovac make up the third group (these three also had almost no contacts between themselves); finally the fourth group are two farmers who hardly know anyone among the other 42 accused, and are known by almost no-one of the other 42; however they were caught in possession of a German machine gun.<P>

The defense attorneys Nevzati and Barovic concluded that the indictment was a pure political construction, amalgamation of the unrelated facts.  In that construction, they explained, Sezair Saipi from TNP was inserted in order to passivize his party, the only politically relevant Turkish party in Metohija in opposition to the government;  the same reasons guided insertion of the parallel Albanian authorities from Orahovac, while the two farmers with a machine gun were included so that the intentions of violent endangerment of the territorial integrity could be ascribed to the whole group.  The construction was thus completed.<P>

"These four groups were not even in a physical contact," said Barovic and added that "that story is totally incoherent; in order to put together those incoherent pieces, it was necessary to obtain confessions.  That couldn't be achieved in any other way but with torture."  "Those confessions were not even forced; instead, people simply signed whatever was given to them by the police.  A forced confession is when I don't want to say something and somebody forces me; however, that was not the case here," said Nevzati.<P>

"Political trials are characterized by pressure applied to the accused and members of their families," continued Barovic while looking for the title "Gulag Archipelago" [Solzenitsin's novel about Stalinist prison camps in Siberia] in his library.  "Saipi was threatened with arrest of his 16-year-old daughter who has back-bone problems.  Than it is up to a person: Saipi is a strong man with a lot of stamina; he hasn't said a word, nor signed anything; when his daughter was mentioned he hit the interrogator with the fist, so that he fell on the floor.  In given conditions, naturally, the interrogator returned copiously, but Saipi held out.  His nephew gave in when they told him that that his pregnant wife would be treated in the same way as himself; he said he would sign anything they want," related Barovic.  To these stories he added another one about a minor, a boy, who was alone in the apartment for two days after his father had been arrested.<P>

As their achievement, the defense attorneys in the Prizren trial listed their success in publicly exposing that "the evidence from the investigation, due to torture" is different from that given to the court.<P>

The defense attorneys read "the Prizren trial" as a political trial and with their legal persistence keep trying to demonstrate that.  The trial is getting old; when a trial like this lasts for a long time, it becomes, with time, more and more unpleasant for the instigator.<P>

We present a protocol that efficiently allocates resources in a communication
network among voice and data users.  The proposed protocol gains efficiency
over methods with separate channels for voice and data
by taking advantage of idle periods in the voice activity.  An exponential
on-off voice activity model is used to determine the performance
of distributive or centrally controlled systems.
In addition, communication systems considered in this work can use either Code
Division Multiple Access (CDMA) or Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
as the underlying multiple access technique.  In either case, the protocol
is a valid mechanism for integrating voice and data in a multiple access
channel.  Comparisons are made between mathematical analyses using
a Markov model of the servers and simulation results using a communication
network simulation tool.  Results for both CDMA and TDMA systems are
presented.

<h1> Emperor is Naked</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Duska Anastasijevic <br>  Vreme, 7/24/95, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia</i></h2><p>


<hr>

<FONT SIZE="+1">When Miroslav Radulovic, head editor of the <em>Borske Novine</em>, finished printing of the latest issue, he wiped the sweat from his brow with satisfaction.  It was hot, the inhabitants of Bor since the beginning of the summer had had water "black outs" sometimes lasting 12 hours a day; Radulovic decided to try to lift the spirits of his fellow Borcani.  He happened to have a copy of <em>Onogost Standard</em>, a paper which on the pages dedicated to humor and satire, "zezal tribune", had published "a stenographic record" of the meeting between "Slobek" and "Franjek" in Karadordevo.  The paper from Niksic [Onogost Standard] described the imaginary meeting of the presidents of Serbia and Croatia as cordial and close and wrote that Slobek and Franjek were gleefully tearing Bosnia apart.  Following the example of Split weekly <em>Feral Tribune</em>, <em>Onogost</em> from Niksic, illustrated the text with the photomontage of bare-butted [naked] presidents Tudman, Milosevic, Lilic, Bulatovic in the company of Seselj, Kontic, minister Jovanovic and Radoman Bozovic.<P>

The editor of <em>Onogost Standard</em> believed that, since Tudman didn't seem to get offended because of <em>Feral Tribune's</em> similar and frequently more brutal jokes, then , perhaps, neither would Bulatovic, Kontic and others.<P>

The editor of <em>Borske Novine</em> inquired with the colleagues from Niksic and was reassured that they hadn't had any problems and that no one had been offended because of the photomontage.  He believed that, if Montenegrin honor hadn't been offended (and their sensitivity is famous), there should be no reason for anyone in Serbia to be offended.<P>

"Yes, I was in two minds about that page," Radulovic stated for <em>Vreme</em>, "but not because I didn't want to antagonize the authorities; more because of the necessity to maintain a certain tone in the publication.  Then I thought that it was a summer and people liked to relax, had enough of heavy politics;  Bor was dead at the time...  I didn't believe that anyone would be offended.  I sent the issue, as I always do, to the office of the public prosecutor and the issue was at his desk before seven o'clock in the morning."<P>

<STRONG>RAID:</STRONG> At two o'clock that afternoon three persons appeared in the <em>Borske Novine</em> office: two in civilian clothes and one in uniform. "They confiscated seventy copies of the paper, everything we had in the office.  I had many more copies at home but they didn't have a search warrant," continued Radulovic. "We were lucky that the public prosecutor hesitated; he didn't see a reason to ban the issue.  However, he had been pressured by Dusko Radivojevic, a member of the county council of the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS, ruling party in Serbia and in the federal parliament].  By the time of the raid the paper was almost sold out.  They confiscated several hundred copies from kiosks and the plate used for printing of the incriminated page from the printing works."  Miroslav was given two certificates about "the temporarily confiscated objects (70 copies of <em>Borske Novine</em> and one copy of <em>Onogost</em>) because of a suspicion that a crime" of ridiculing the president of Serbia  "has been committed." Since the only employee of the paper is Duda Radulovic, Miroslav's wife, police took her in for an interrogation.  "They behaved appropriately; they wanted to know whether I as the owner of the paper also edit the paper.  I wanted to protect Miroslav so I said that I was responsible for everything.  We have been receiving calls from friends and readers who want to congratulate us on this move.  After all, on the front page of that issue there was a photo of naked swimmers at the Borsko lake beach.  So far nobody has found it necessary to protest because of that photo."<P>

<STRONG>This is it: controversial photomontage</STRONG><P> 

<STRONG>REASONS:</STRONG> <em>Borske Novine</em> is a private fortnightly paper; their circulation is approximately 2,000 copies and it is the only independent media outlet in the Bor municipality, which has about 60,000 inhabitants.  Miroslav Radulovic believes that the authorities were simply waiting for a good excuse, since the paper has been writing about a lot of issues they must have found unpalatable.  "My opinion is that a group of donkeys led by a lion is more useful than a group of lions led by a donkey.  While Borcani lead a hard life, the authorities have confiscated Tito's villa in Dubasnica;  that location is now a private hunting grounds for officials and Milosevic himself is a frequent guest.  They hunt mountain goats and deer although more frequently they 'catch' a turkey or a lamb.  Mother nature gives and father uses," complained Radulovic.  However it is known that nature is a mother to some and a step-mother to others.  All together, Milosevic, Tudman, Kontic, Lilic, Bulatovic, Jovanovic, Seselj, and especially Radoman Bozovic, shouldn't feel hurt.  Anyway, the pictures don't show the most interesting parts, and in any case it is obvious that their heads were planted on bodies of strong and muscular men who lead a healthy life.  Maybe the above mentioned individuals weren't angry after all, but actually flattered, while the eager protectors of public morality hurried to save the honor of highest officials.<P>

While Radulovic is awaiting the court's decision many local papers have decided to solidarize with <em>Borske Novine</em>.  <em>Svetlost</em> from Kragujevac [central Serbia], <em>Novi Pancevac</em> [from Pancevo near Belgrade], <em>Smederevac</em> [from Smederevo] and <em>Vranjske Novine</em> [from Vranje, southern Serbia] have announced that they would , in spite of a possible ban, also publish in the future issues the photomontage with the "stenograph".<P>

<h1>Tuzla Rejects Accusations</h1>
<FONT SIZE="+1">
<h2><em>by V. Jahic</em>, Oslobodenje (European Weekly Edition), Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 8/24-31/95</h2>

Dr. Ismet Grbo has recently stated, during a press conference organized by SDABiH [Party of Democratic Action, Bosnia-Hercegovina, the largest party representing Muslims in Bosnia-Hercegovina], that he felt that "in Tuzla, there is a strong Yugonostalgic [a generic term used by nationalist political parties in all of Yugoslav successor states to discredit their opponents; the implication is that Yugonostalgics are not patriotic and that they yearn for those "horrendous" times when Yugoslavia still existed] faction, and Yugoslavism has always blown in the sails of the Chetnik [derogatory term for Serbs; name of a Serb nationalist movement during the WWII; its members have committed atrocities against Muslims] ideas and movements."<P>

At the same press conference, Adnan Jahic, strongly criticized Beslagic's [mayor of Tuzla, an industrial city in northeastern Bosnia] 
statement, given in an interview to <a HREF="/info/students/marko/cropat.html"><em>Vjesnik</em></a>: "that the victory of SDA in Tuzla would lead to renewed emigration of Croats and Serbs from Tuzla." He considered that remark outrageous, since it was given to a foreign instead of a domestic newspaper. <P>

Jahic then continued by strongly criticizing the Civic Forum in Tuzla; Dr. Sead Jamakosmanovic, the president of the Cantonal SDA council in Tuzla, said that "the Forum's posters and other initiatives are against this country and this people.  They are a fifth column and declared Serb lovers; they are helping the aggressor." <P>

These statement have provoked reactions from Selim Beslagic and the Civic Forum activists.<P>

<h2>Political Smear Campaign</h2>

"I did blow in the sails of greater Serbia in order to push it as far as possible from Tuzla.  This was obvious in the fateful moments on 5/15/1992.  They are accusing both the governing party in Tuzla [Social Democrats] and myself, because we did the right thing when it was necessary to resist the Serbian-Montenegrin aggressor.  They know what they are doing; they are trying to discredit  me.  I stand behind this statement: those who talk about Yugonostalgics are Yugonostalgics themselves.  Chetniks have called me a war criminal, while the influential individuals claim that I am a Serb lover and what not.  Doesn't this seem absurd to any normal person?  Before the beginning of the aggression, I said that I have no other homeland besides Bosnia-Hercegovina.  I never negotiated with anyone about symmetrical or asymmetrical Yugoslavia.  Regardless, influential members of SDA are trying with all their might to discredit me; their media are making up lies about me.  I have even filed suits because of these offenses and slanders; unfortunately I am not powerful enough to move the judicial system.  It is in the hands of the ruling party [SDA].  If their accusations were true, I should be in the court.  Why don't they sue me?" These are the words of Selim Beslagic, the mayor of Tuzla.<P>

About the accusations regarding the statement given to <em>Vjesnik</em>, Beslagic said the following:" One should read my interview first, and then talk about it. The interview was a whole page of text from which they pulled one sentence and tried to smear me because of it.  In that interview I said that the abolition of the 115th HVO [Croatian Defense Council] brigade prodded Croats into emigration from Tuzla.  And furthermore, that I assess that SDA's election victory in Tuzla would induce many Croats and Serbs to leave the city.  This is my assessment.  We have unmasked in Tuzla Pohara and some other former influential members of SDA who had tried to incite interethnic intolerance with their activities.  Furthermore, the criticism that I gave the interview to <em>Vjesnik</em> and not to one of the domestic media outlets is unfounded.  I am always ready, as the president of the strongest opposition party in Bosnia-Hercegovina [Social Democrats] to give an interview to RTVBiH [state controlled Bosnian television station]; unfortunately, the authorities won't let me."<P>
 

<h2>Announcement of a Future Suit</h2>

In the Civic Forum, they were surprised by the sharpness of the SDA accusations.  Citizen Forum president, Vehid Sehic, is not at the moment in Tuzla; neither are the two vicepresidents; hence no one was ready to give an official statement to the media.  In conversation with some activists, we heard the assessment that the SDA criticism are a sort of a pressure exerted by totalitarian factions whose goal is destruction of secular initiatives on the territory of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  Some thought that they were exposed to that criticism because of their support for the preservation of a unitary Bosnia-Hercegovina within its internationally recognized borders, and also because they publicly denounced the forces who publicly and secretly negotiated with the aggressors about the ethnic division of Bosnia-Hercegovina; because they revealed their hypocrisy which manifests itself in their public support for multiculturalism while in practice they worked on ethnic transfers of the population within the homeland.  They still considered the collection of signatures in support of the withdrawal of the prime minister's (Haris Silajdzic) resignation, to be only a form of extrainstitutional democratic pressure exerted by the public.  In connection with that, they indicated that the institutions were not holly shrines; their assessment was that the attacks on the state were far stronger when an institution with its decisions "broke" constitutional principles or laws, and when it came to decisions which were only beneficial to the ruling circles.  They considered that they were exposed to a strong pressure because they loudly pointed out such anomalies;  this time <a HREF="/info/students/marko/froslo1.html">their attitude with respect to the people expelled from Srebrenica</a> was interpreted with glee; also some circumstances in connection with that were made up.[!?]<P>

<h1>  Blast During the Curfew</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Zoran Daskalovic<br>  Feral Tribune, 4/24/95, Split, Croatia</i></h2><p>

<hr>

Sava close to Sisak still washes out corpses.  Two weeks ago another two dead bodies were found in it.  Nevertheless, the stories about earlier murders are still being retold.  It is only necessary to listen to the people who cannot and do not want to forget the murders.  This is how <i>Feral</i>, after publishing a partial list of murdered citizens of Sisak, found out the additional details of Sisak Death Chronicle<P>

Four member Vila family - father, mother and two sons were beaten to death.  Branko Oljaca was decapitated.  Retiree Vaso Jelic had worked for a long time in France, for "Renault", and at the beginning of the war volunteered and maintained the National Guard's and Police's vehicles for free; one evening [he] was taken from his house; his corpse was washed out of the river Sava two months later.  When a <a Href="/info/students/marko/gospic1.html">group of masked men</a> suddenly showed up in front of the house, Vaso's wife started shouting at him to flee through the back door.  ``God be with you, woman, why should I flee?", was Vaso's reply.  Afterwards, it was too late.  The masked death squad broke into the house, tied up other household members and took Vaso Jelic away to never come back.<p>

Many secrets are buried in the Sisak cemetery.  Those days, the cemetery was out of bounds.  Those brave enough to visit their dead were even shot at.  Reason: a permanent part of decor at the cemetery was a trench digging machine and a gas bottle.  Trench digger was incessantly digging and the gas bottle was used to weld shut the metal coffins in which the murdered and "missing" inhabitants of Sisak had been placed.  The coffins were buried in a common grave, to the left from and right next to the cemetery entrance...<p>

Obviously, someone in Sisak had, similarly to the Parliament President Nedeljko Mihanovic, ``obtained reliable information" about cooperation of some of their compatriots with the enemy.  That is why they, just like that, ignoring the judicial and investigative process, laws and justice, as if they were the God himself, made decisions about ''traitor's" liquidation, about life and death.  The authorities were quiet and remain silent.  Because ``the Croatians in this war could not have committed crimes."  Even President Tudjman, in his address at the 2nd congress of Croatian Democratic Union (CDU), in trying to convince some of the CDU members from the extreme right to withdraw from running for the leadership posts, mentioned that international institutions and organizations had their names on the lists of suspected war criminals.  But then he added that he himself would give them decorations for everything they had done in the war for the defense of Croatia.<p>

The murdered inhabitants of Sisak, however, live in the memories of their loved ones.  They have been pleading for justice for years now, for the punishment of the murderers of the innocent.  We present a frame from that grim movie.<P>
<hr><p>



Making a hole in the window pane, a bullet killed 19 year old Ljubice Solar.  It happened on 9/17/91 in Sisak in an apartment on the Mose Pijade Square, hundred or so meters as a crow flies from the Sisak Police Station.  The murderer shot furtively, from the darkness.  Many facts point out that the shot came from the Police Station window<p>

The curfew had just been introduced in Sisak.  Ljubica had just come back from an evening out with a girlfriend and was alone in the apartment.  Her boyfriend, Dusko Malovic, also her apartment mate and intended future husband, had left that morning for Sarajevo.  The intent behind his journey was to find the apartment for the two of them in Sarajevo.  They had actually decided to leave Sisak and move to Sarajevo.<p>

The day before, Ljubica had written in her diary:``<i>Crazy things are happening - war between the Croats and JNA, Serbs in Croatia.  People are fleeing from the totally destroyed villages.  People are left without their houses, property, livestock;  they are loosing everything.  They are all scared.  The worst thing is the ever larger hatred.  I am afraid - for father,mother, uncle, auntie - all my cousins in Glina.  Only now I realize how much I love this city and how difficult it is to part with it.  I suddenly love its people as well.  I do not have a desire to leave.  I am afraid of the life there!  What will it be like?  How shall I get over leaving my mother?  I hate everything that is happening!  I hate it!  Maja is leaving tomorrow for Slovenia and Sanja too; Sinki is gone, Plamenko and Ljubisa; everyone has suddenly disappeared!  I have just talked to Maja and Sanja.  They were crying... I UNDERSTAND THEM.  (signed: Ljubica) Dad, please forgive me for everything I have done to you! Forgive me for being so hard towards you! I love you, I really love you.  Remember that for all times!  Mother, forgive me for leaving when it is most difficult and for going away for a long time. Please UNDERSTAND, I am leaving looking for a better life, searching for happiness.  Pray that I find it!</i>"<p>

<h2> ``Nothing Terrible"</h2><p>

Ljubica had talked to her mother Vjera earlier on the  evening she was murdered; her mother tried to talk her into coming over to her parent's house instead of spending the night on her own in the apartment.  In the end Ljubica stayed in the apartment and her mother was supposed to pick her up the following morning with a car and take her to the house.  When the mother, Vjera, phoned the following morning, the receiver was picked up by policemen who, after she had told them she was looking for her daughter, presently arrived to her house.  The policemen told her that ``nothing terrible"  had happened to her daughter.  She was asked to follow them to the Sisak Hospital, with a neighbor, if one happened to be around.<p>

``One of the two policemen went to get my neighbor.  She came crying and I knew then that something terrible had happened.  But I did not think Ljubica was dead.  I thought maybe she was wounded or something like that.  The policemen drove us to the hospital and left.  There, my colleagues from the Surgical Department, where I have worked for 34 years, gathered around and wanted to give me an injection, which I refused.  They took the neighbor to the morgue to confirm that the body was Ljubica's...  She came to the door crying:``Oh, Vjera, it is your Ljubica .." Then I went there .. I do not know how I returned home ... A man gave me a lift, since the policemen had left.  To this day I do not know why my child was murdered and who killed her, but I saw from the death certificate that was killed on 9/17 at 11:00 pm, right at the curfew's start."<p>

Ljubica Solar was born in Sisak on 5/10/72.  After three years of high school she decided to transfer to a school for beauticians.  She tried the one in Zagreb, but since they could not transfer her high school credits, she went to live with her uncle in Zemun and there finished the final year of the beauty school.  After completed internship she returned to Sisak in July of 1991.  Her boyfriend Dusko Malovic was a member of ex-JNA[Yugoslav Peoples Army].  In March of 1991 he left JNA and since he had been more than successful in full-contact ( he had some international trophies), worked as a body guard on Tatjana Matejas Tajci's concerts and as a bouncer in night clubs.  After Ljubica's return from Zemun, they lived in an apartment owned by the ex-JNA, for which Dusan had residence rights.  Dusko Malovic found out about Ljubica's death on his way to Sarajevo.  At first he wanted to return to Sisak for her funeral.  He was convinced to stay away as he might have been in danger as well.  He died later in the war in Bosnia and Hercegovina.<p>

<h2> Funeral Under Guard</h2><p>

Ljubica's father Jovo, a Serb from Banija region, and his son Doko left Sisak that summer.  Why did they leave?<p>

``Actually, we still did not know anything, only that people had been disappearing.  Oljaca was killed, then Crnobrnja, Vila family... You know, we heard stories, that people were disappearing and that their corpses would be later found floating in Sava; we thought, let the men go, and we women will stay because nobody would touch us.  Therefore, my husband at the end of July went to Zemun and son at the beginning of August to Germany; he would have ended up at the front if he had gone to Zemun, which we did not want.  At first he [son] did not want to leave Sisak.  I insisted every day: ``Doko, c'mon, you have an aunt in Germany, go there, you know I always worry if you will return safely when you go out after dark; I do not sleep until you come back."  He left and later told me that several times, when he was returning late in the evening from the city center, he was stopped, up there on the hill, by his ex-classmates and searched for guns.  They used to spend days in my house drinking and eating, during weekends...  But I was not afraid for the little one... She was such a good child.  Dusko was her first boyfriend.  She did not go out before that."<p>

Vjera Solar is a Croat.  Her mother, a Croat from Boka Kotorska died died during the WWII, and father Josip Braun, a domobran sergeant perished while demining a bridge connecting two sides of Sisak close to the end of the war, in order to stop the Germans from blowing it up during their withdrawal from Yugoslavia.  Vjera says:``See, even my son married a Croat woman in Germany last year, Janko Bobetko's cousin.  And my daughter was murdered by my Croats.  She was buried on Saturday 9/20.  Our house was under guard.  They were probably waiting to see if her father or brother would show up.  The cemetery was also under guard.  I was not aware of that, but the others have told me.  The police came immediately after the funeral, around 11 o'clock in a Mercedes and took me to the Police Station.  I was there until 2.  My friends were waiting back in the house.  The policemen wanted to know were my husband was, where my son was.  I even gave them their phone numbers.  I was interrogated two more times.  At the beginning of '92 and once more."<p>

<h2> Life With Brodarac</h2><p>

 Nobody ever contacted Vjera Solar about her daughter's murder.  She tried to get some information on her own.  She went several times to Duro Brodarac, now the Zupan [Governor] and then the Sisak Police Chief.  By the way, Brodarac used to be, until he moved to the city center in 1991, Solar's neighbor, third house from theirs.<p>

``I went to Brodarac.  He told me:``Nobody killed her, her boyfriend killed her."  I told him:``You are wrong.  He could not have killed her.  He was on the road then."  I did not understand immediately.  Later I realized that Ljubica was killed because of her boyfriend.  I came to that conclusion and understood why he had been telling me that Dusan had killed her although he [Dusan] had not been there.  I still analyze that.. Three and a half years have gone and I still think about the same thing...  Who had the right to kill my child?  Who had the right?  I said that I would not rest in peace until I found out who and why murdered my child.  I had my child because I wanted to.  When I gave birth to a daughter I was overjoyed...  Only to have her murdered nineteen years later...  She was allowed to live as long as they gave her...  And that was it...  That is terrible.  I do not care about my life, it does not mean anything to me.  I have been alone for four years.  I have been fighting all the time.  There were provocations.  I would get phone calls asking if my house were still in one peace.  Why would not have it been?  It only stopped after I protested at the local Command."<p>  
    
Vjera Solar tried to find out more through the attorney Silvije Degen's office, Croatian Helsinki Committee, Serb Democratic Forum.  But she found out nothing; no one could help her.  Duro Brodarac only allowed one visit to the apartment in which her daughter had been murdered.<p>

``I told him that I still had not been to the apartment to pick up her things, and that I had heard a policeman had moved in to the apartment.  He told me that I could go and pick up Ljubica's things.  The policeman in the apartment was a nice man.  He told me to take  Ljubica's things.  However, I was not allowed to take anything belonging to her boyfriend.  The policeman even helped me carry her things to the car.  I did not have any problems with him.  He even told me he would rather not be in the apartment.  I was in the apartment  a month after Ljubica's murder; everything was still bloody.  The floor was bloody...  Even the door was still bloody...  I suppose because my poor child had tried to open it...  It had not been washed...  The bullet hole was still in the window pane...  Through which she had been killed...  And my daughter, when she was three, used to sleep with Brodarac's daughter.  She changed her diapers, fed her, had been to their house so many times.  I showed him a photograph of my dead child.  And he told me:``I have seen worse."  What could had he seen worse than that?  Only if his own child had been murdered like that."<p>

Even the organizations and individuals outside Sisak, whose help Vjera Solar sought, could not help.  A car with documents about Ljubica Solar's murder, belonging to Croatian Helsinki Committee, was stolen. At the Sisak Police Station, it was suggested to their co-worker inquiring about the case, to avoid getting to curious about it.<p>

We found out about the existence of the two theories.  The first one, originating in the Police, states that an ``unknown person shot at Ljubica Solar from the railroad tracks passing nearby the apartment in which she was killed."  The other one, which the majority of our contacts found more believable: that the bullet came from the Police Station, which is also very close to the apartment.  We asked Ljubica's mother whether she had heard about these two theories.<p>

<h2> A Shot, not a Bullet</h2><p> 

``Yes, that is what I have heard.  No one told me that officially. Actually I have never been told anything officially!  I do not have any papers, nothing!"<p>

``Was the autopsy performed?"<p>

``Yes, it was performed. I was told by a pathologist, Dr. Kovacevic.  I met him at the cemetery on Sve Svete in 1991.  I had not seen him since my daughter's death.  He hugged me and then said:``My Vjera, that is the worst crime I have seen in this war."  He said that it had not been a bullet but a shot.  The intention was to kill her.  It ripped everything inside her...  I say, I do not want to believe that the Croatian authorities allow these things to take place.  But they have not done anything against it.  That is the saddest thing of all.  I cannot believe in the existence of authorities which would allow that people are killed in such a way.  My child did no harm to anyone..."<p>

<h1> Medications, Milk, Equipment...</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Uros Komlenovic <em>Vreme</em><br>  Vreme, 3/6/95, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia</i></h2><p>


<hr>

Since the moment when, instead of the cry "Serbia won't give in", another one, "There's no alternative to peace", became prominent in the "patriotic" media under the control of the governing party, a lot has changed, but the treatment of the Soros Foundation Yugoslavia remains the same: this organization in still high on the list of "the enemies of everything Serbian and Orthodox." (On this list a special place is reserved for the founder of the Foundation, financier George Soros.)  It seems that this campaign is picking up in intensity; judging by the segment recently broadcasted as a part on the program "ZIP", the next on the list are the Foundation's programs for international exchange of students and grants for studying abroad.  Medical and humanitarian assistance hasn't been mentioned until recently.<P>

"Between June 1992 and July 1994 we distributed supplies worth $9,300,000 among the medical institutions in the FRY ;  we are currently in the process of distributing supplies worth another $5,000,000," says the coordinator of the Soros Foundation Yugoslavia medical team, Dr Vuk Stambolic.  "Supplies include medications, equipment and material;  the aforementioned sum doesn't include our education programs, organization of seminars, support for participation of our physicians at conferences abroad and health care seminars for teachers and educators."<P>

The extent of medical activities of the Soros Foundation Yugoslavia have, apparently, come to attention "Where It Matters"; consequently, on 2/24/95, "Revija 92" published an article under title "Gives publicly but rules from the shade" in which the author didn't hide the fact that the Foundation is "officially the largest benefactor of the Serbian health care system"; however, in the following paragraph, under title "Narco-foundation", he stated (writing about Soros):<P>

"Maybe that is the reason for the fear of the money he [Soros] frantically gives away, since it resembles a well tried techniques of drug dealers - drugs are free for a first few times, but the user pays dearly later.  Sometimes with his life."<P>

DELIVERIES:  The most recent delivery of the Soros Foundation medical assistance consists of special powdered milk for children and baby food.  One of the members of the medical team, Dr Predrag Zivotic, explains:<P>

"The delivery consists of 15 tons of special powdered milk and baby food, whose value is $112,837.  It has been distributed among 38 medical institutions from practically all regions of the FRY.  We gave out seven kinds of concentrate: powdered milk for babies and infants, enriched with iron and vitamins;  milk based baby food in six different flavors: wheat, rice, banana and three other kinds of fruit; special milk for premature babies;  lactose free powdered milk for children with metabolism disfunctions and milk for children suffering from feniketonutria."<P>

In this delivery, the most important component is the last item, milk without which children with disturbed metabolism (actually inability to break up  an important amino-acid) cannot survive.  Head of the department for metabolism and clinical genetics of the Institute for Mother and a Child in Belgrade, Dr Ljubomir Stojanov, explains for <em>Vreme</em>:<P>

"Feniketonutria is a hereditary inability to decompose fenilalanin.  This amino-acid accumulates in that case within the body, is toxic and adversely affects development of the nervous system.  Without treatment, children with this defect develop the most severe variety of mental retardation known today.  In addition they also develop untreatable epilepsy.  The treatment must begin in the first month after the birth of the child and consequently, within our screening program (which is unfortunately confined to the territory of "Serbia proper"), we perform tests 4 days after birth.  If the test is positive, we immediately start treatment which consists of a special diet, low in fenilalanin.  The full treatment takes 16 years and women who were treated as children must repeat the treatment during a pregnancy."<P>

The most important ingredient of the aforementioned diet is powdered milk which is extremely expensive - the price of one can, which is on average enough for 5 to 6 days - is approximately DM230.  A child with a hereditary defect must drink this milk every single day, at first 6-7 meals a day and later only in the morning and evening.  Since family expenses, for the milk only, amount to DM1300 per month any comment is unnecessary.  Before the sanctions the milk was distributed by the state, for free.<P>

"After the imposition of sanctions in the Spring of 1992, the state was not capable of providing the special milk," says Dr Stojanov.  "We have been receiving help from benefactors but that wasn't enough, so that the parents were forced to use other means, usually friends and relatives living abroad.  Two years ago we had one larger delivery through the Red Cross of Yugoslavia.  The second large delivery arrived through the Soros Foundation Yugoslavia.  We received 900 cans, which should provide nutrition for our 27 patients for, approximately, three months.  After that, we'll see."<P>

We talked to a mother, who because of understandable reasons wishes to remain anonymous, in order to find out the "logistics" of obtaining the special milk.  She is a mother of a five-year-old A-student who is also active in sports.  The child's development has been completely normal, but that depends on its special diet.  Otherwise...<P>

"My child has been on a diet since  ten days after birth," said our colocutor.  "The state has, until the sanctions, provided the milk for free through the Institute for a Mother and a Child, but we had to buy special flour, rice, biscuits...  My child mustn't eat meat, eggs, fish, wheat and various kinds of beans and peas and allowed only in very small amounts.  Besides fruit and vegetables everything else has to be bought in pharmacies and prepared separately.  These kids are always hungry.  My child has recently admitted that he dreams about eating chicken meat and he is capable of registering if someone in the building prepares fish which he likes a lot, but..."<P>

Troubles for this family started after the imposition of the sanctions:<P>

MEDICATIONS: "We were told in the Institute that we'll have to provide the milk ourselves and they gave us the address of Walter Petrik, the owner of the Austrian company which distributes the milk in this part of Europe.  I sent them a letter, but after a reply in which it was explained that the smallest possible order was DM15,000, I had to give up.  We tried to form a group of the parents with the same problem, but it turned out that even together we couldn't do anything.  We were not able to register because we are to few in number - this deficiency is rare.  We contacted the Red Cross of Yugoslavia and they helped three times, once with a large donation which lasted for a whole month.  Dr Manojlovic from "Intereksport" helped twice in a critical situation with smaller amounts of the milk ("Intereksport" had been preparing to import the milk, so he had some left-over samples).  I have been writing to humanitarian organizations all over the world, foreign media, Red Cross organizations in Denmark, Norway, Finland, to UNICEF, Synod of Serbian Orthodox Church, every single state and federal ministry and - nothing.  Help coming from abroad, from mothers with the same problem, was precious:  two women from Vienna, one from Germany, one from Italy...  They would order more than they needed for their children and then would send me a can or two.  We, as well as our extended family, gave up everything.  The company for which I work also helped as well as relatives and friends, but all together I had many more unsuccessful than successful attempts to get help."<P>

Problems remain even when the money is there:" the special milk is produced by only a handful of companies, two-three in the Western Europe and one in America.  All other countries order according to their needs.  The milk is not available on the free market, so that even when there is money one has to improvise and use unofficial contacts.  Recently a delivery, the largest one since the imposition of the trade embargo, donated by the Soros Foundation has arrived.  I received 12 cans, which means three to four peaceful months at home," said this woman while putting away her documentation: four folders overflowing with letters, replies, tables for calculation of the amount of fenilalanin in certain types of food, fliers...<P>

The special milk for children suffering from feniketonutria is certainly (financially) the most valuable item in the latest Soros Foundation delivery, although one shouldn't forget to mention lactose free milk, without which children with genetic inability to decompose this sugar develop slowly and die, or milk for premature babies (after Albania the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has the largest infant mortality in Europe).<P>

Besides, the Foundation has recently donated psychiatric medications worth $460,000 to Yugoslav neuropsychiatric institutions;  in this delivery probably the most important item was a donation of drugs which are essential for hospitals with patients with chronic diseases (for example, neuropsychiatric Hospital in Topionica near Nis, which at a time became famous because of the terrifying photographs published in <em>Borba</em>).<P>

Judging from a randomly selected list of the thank you notes (fifty or so directors and heads of medical institutions from all over the country) shown by the people from the Soros Foundation medical team, the opinions of our physicians  about this organization differ from those of the "patriotic media".  In this situation our health care institutions with gratitude receive any help since, as one doctor said during the distribution of neuropsychiatric medications, "one doesn't say no to a present."  Even in the absence of a proverb which says that "one does not say thank you for a cure",  only an optimist could expect  any expression of gratitude from local authorities.  Benefactors, who donated so much of essential medications have a right to at least distribute these medications without harassment, since they are willing and able.<P>

<h2> Interview with Sonja Liht: Unconditional Help</h2><p>

Conversation with Sonja Liht began with her reminiscing about the start of the work of the Soros Foundation medical team:<p>

"Immediately after the introduction of the economic sanctions, every medical institution in Yugoslavia requested assistance from us.  With Mr. Soros' approval, we formed a medical team and gave priority to essential medications, drugs needed for treatment of psychiatric cases and children drugs.  We made a list of institutions with intention of, at first, providing help to those hospitals with the largest number of patients in critical condition.  Later we expanded the network and by now, I think, we cover everyone; because of fairness, besides the number of patients we also introduced geographic criteria.  In the meantime we moved into preventive health care and now we also support community health centers, factory health centers and institutions which care for the elderly...  We also started helping smaller health care institutions since the current situation will last and the problems aren't "acute" but "chronic".  We've started health care seminars in order to mitigate fatal interruption of the flow of information in health care.  The first seminar, dedicated to the children suffering from cerebral palsy (organized in cooperation with the center for cerebral palsy and developmental neurology) was expected to attract about 40 participants.  Instead, there were 120 medical workers!  Lecturers, top experts from the U.S.A. and Russia, later said that they had never encountered people so thirsty for knowledge as in Belgrade.  This is a sign that we are on the right track, and the next seminar about child neurology will be held at the end of March." <P> 

<strong>VREME: Are you satisfied with the cooperation with medical institutions?</strong><P> 

LIHT:  The cooperation is good; from the start we insisted on helping end-users and on collecting information on what they needed the most and in what amounts.  We cannot promise to fulfill all of these needs, nor we want to order drugs using only our database and the data provided by some central institution:  the most important information is that coming from "the field."  We have a lot of documentation and we enter every donated medication.  We also demand that the recipient institutions publicly display lists of all donated drugs so that the patients know what is available and the risk of misuse and theft is reduced.  Some institutions fulfill this demand while other ignore it.  In some instances we have heard of people taking off our stickers;  this makes us sad but it is not a reason to stop the deliveries of aid.  We don't help the institutions but their patients.<P>

<strong>VREME:  State controlled media have been persistent in their attacks.  How do you rate the Foundation's relations with the authorities?</strong><P>

LIHT:  This medical program cannot be implemented without the cooperation with the authorities, without import permits for medications or permits for work in refugee centers.  Our problems start across the border, because the official position that the humanitarian aid is not under embargo is a sham.  First, we have to wait for a permit from the U.S. government (our headquarters are located there), then permit from the Sanction Committee, then everything goes back to Washington...  This procedure sometimes takes several months;  then begin problems with our [Yugoslav] authorities: we need permits from the Red Cross, the federal Health Ministry, customs...  We haven't had bigger problems with the authorities and there's no reason why we should.  At a time I said, and I repeat it with full responsibility, that whoever closes down the Soros Foundation Yugoslavia will endanger lives of 50,000 persons.  Anyway, we had occasional contacts with the departments in the Ministry of Health, but they haven't shown a lot of interest in our work, although they should have in my opinion.  For example, within projects "Friendly toward children" and "Friendly toward women", we provided funding for the renovation and buying of new equipment for the maternity hospital in Zrenjanin.  The director of the maternity hospital said that everyone offered verbal support but that we were the only organization to help with funding.  This year we plan to include four more  maternity hospitals in the program and to try to identify other sources of funding.  Besides "white plague" [negative population growth] in some parts of our country we are facing a growth in infant mortality.  Let others verbally address these problems; we'll try to do something practical.<P>

<strong>VREME: Do you recall cases in which people who were publicly critical of the Foundation, privately tried to take part in one of the Foundation's more attractive programs (for example, scholarships for graduate studies abroad)?</strong><P>

LIHT:  I can't vouch that these are the same people, but they certainly come from the same institutions.  Pure hypocrisy: people who attack us do not themselves believe in what they are saying, except for the small number of those under the influence of false informations.  I am certain that all those who in this state follow the work of public institutions know the truth.  They know well that the exchange program used to be under auspices of the Institute for international scientific, technical and cultural cooperation and that its activities were interrupted because of the sanctions.  There was no criticism of the Institute.  No one has a problem with those who charge thousands of Deutch Marks and Dollars to send children abroad on exchange programs.  Instead they attack the Soros Foundation which organizes those programs for free and tries to make sure that the children return [to Yugoslavia] after completing a program.  It is a fact that we live in the atmosphere of limited possibilities and that we suffer from a lack of everything including perspective.  People approach us asking for assistance,  many are responsible, but there are those who prefer to forget the origin of help as soon as they receive it.  This Foundation, as in the past, will base its assistance only on the need (when medical and humanitarian assistance is concerned) and quality of proposed cultural and educational projects.<P></em>

<h1>Victims and Manipulation</h1>
<FONT SIZE="+1">
<h2><em>by Hamza Baksic</em>, Oslobodenje (European Weekly Edition), Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 8/24-31/95</h2>

Media attempts to find out whether there were civilian victims in the Croatian "Storm", murders, arson and Zagreb's intent to conduct the final cleansing of Serbs, in spite of individual and temporary humanitarian motives also have their practical and political function.  They are supposed to reduce the awareness of the crimes committed by Serb fascist after the fall of Srebrenica.<P>

Were there unnecessary civilian victims in Krajina?  Of course there were.  Were there deliberate murders of civilians?  Almost certainly.  Were there any arson attacks?  No doubt.<P>

Has anyone expected that that wouldn't occur in the continuation of as bloody a war as was waged in the first half of 1991?  Is there a command which fully controls its soldiers?<P>

Do the individual cases fit in the undeclared plan of the Croatian government: the events which occured during the exodus are supposed to place a barrier of fear along the line of ethnic division?<P>

We shall see.  The principle "Serb people follows a Serb army", namely the concept of ethnic concentration by all means, wasn't formulated by president Tudman.  What were the feelings of the individual viewers of the program about the great migration depends on the individual attitude and, above all, individual destiny.  Some have experienced that as a repetition of their own misery, others as a revenge of politics, and others as a revenge of fate.<P>

The whole migration of the Serbs from Krajina towards the mother land is turning into a media mystification.  It is a dense and, probably, well prepared move, maybe even as good as the "Storm".  As such, it has moved towards oblivion the exodus of Bosniacs from Bosanska Krajina which still goes on: three times as many people and almost thousand times as many victims.  It should also deflect attention from the fresh impressions from Srebrenica; even though it is not even comparable to Srebrenica.<P>

More and more facts are indicating that a huge crime was committed in Srebrenica; so huge that it couldn't have been done without knowledge and approval from both Belgrade and Pale.  We are not talking about individual murders far away from the eyes of officers and political headquarters.  The crimes were committed in Bratunac, in front of a large number of inhabitants; at the same place where, at the beginning of the war, the locals were bringing in criminals from Serbia in order to help with the slaughter of the Bosniacs from the area, because the locals couldn't accomplish alone the mission given to them by the God, Holly Synod [of the Serbian Orthodox Church] and the Serbian Academy of Sciences [alluding to the so-called memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, which is considered to be the blueprint for a Serbian take over of Yugoslavia]. <P>


Why another crime which cannot be hidden?<P>

Neither Bijeljina, at the beginning of the war, nor Srebrenica, at the time which some consider to be close to its end, were not spontaneous expressions of killing rage.  Bijeljina was a well organized announcement of ethnic cleansing and was supposed to prod a column of unarmed people to flee.  They certainly didn't have an arsenal which Krajina Serbs have surrendered [to the Croatian Army].  Srebrenica and ravines near Bratunac can only be one thing: a sign that Pale authorities and their mentors [from Belgrade] will not allow the return of refugees.<P>

Killing fields near Srebrenica, and it is UN's responsibility to ensure the right to conduct an investigation, indicate unchanged character of the Pale junta which executes a policy which can only be implemented with means like those.<P>

Although one regrets every victim of this war, equally one in Knin as well as  one in Srebrenica, it is only human that the death of a larger, or far larger, number of people will cause more sorrow and a stronger reaction.  Otherwise, even dead are only useful for additional political manipulations.<P>

<h1>  Corpses Washed Away in Water</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Zoran Daskalovic<br>  Feral Tribune, 4/10/95, Split, Croatia</i></h2><p>

<hr>

In the early evening on 8/26/91, three uniformed persons came to the Rajsic family apartment in Sisak; they asked Dragomir Rajsic's wife, who was alone in the apartment, to give them the arms owned by her husband.  She gave them a hunting rifle and two handguns, for which Rajsic had valid permits, but she was unable to find any ammunition.  The men returned to the apartment ten minutes later and found the ammunition themselves, obviously based on information they could have obtained only from Dragan Rajcic himself. They did not leave a receipt for the taken arms or give any indication where Rajsic was or what had happened to him. <P>

The very same night Dragan's son, Dragoljub Rajsic, tried to find out about his father's whereabouts and why he had been arrested, both in the Police and National Guard Command.  However, he was unable to obtain any information.  He  next tried the County Prison and the Investigation Center of the District Court in Sisak, with the same results.  From his mother's description and other indications, he concluded that Dragan Rajsic had been taken away by the National Guard members.  The following day he contacted the Information Center in Sisak, the County president, the Croatian Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Central National Guard Staff, the Parliament's Committee for Protection of Human Rights and finally the office of the at the time president of the Yugoslav Presidency, Stjepan Mesic.  After all that he still had no information about his father's destiny.<p>

<hr><p>

<h2> Partial List of the <a HREF="/info/students/marko/gospic1.html"> Murdered and Missing</a> inhabitants of Sisak</h2><p>

<i>Murdered: Family Vila (father Dusan, mother Evica, sons Marko and Zeljko), Nedeljko Kusic and his son Petar (worked for Refinery Sisak), Branko Oljaca (Sisak Police Command employee), Milenko Dapa (worked for Refinery Sisak), Grdoljub Nikolic (worked for Refinery Sisak), Dragan Sundac (lawyer in the Medical Center), Vaso Jelic (retired), Stevan Borojevic (worked for Tiskara), Jovo Crnobrnja (retired policeman), Damijan Zilic (technical director in Refinery Sisak), Vatroslav Vargas (solder in the Croatian Army), Vlado Bozic (driver in Slavijatrans from Petrinja), Ilija Martic, Stana Zivkovic, Staka Cadi (retired), Kuzman Kovacevic (worked for Zeljezara [steel works]).<p>

Missing: Dragan Rajsic (retired), Branko Dabic (worked for Refinery Sisak), Petar Pajagic (economist in Refinery Sisak), Duro Lukac (retired).</i><p>


<hr><p>

<h2>Newspaper Warrant</h2><p>

Two weeks later he sent a letter to the Sisak Police Force Chief, Duro Brodarac, pleading for help in search for his father.  He also sent copies of the letter to the National Guard Commander, the President of the Crisis Staff for Banija, Posavina and Moslavina, Ivan Bobetko, the local government representatives Miroslav Matic and Andrija Preloscan, the President of the District Court and the District Public Prosecutor and to Ivan Vjekic, who was the Minister for Internal affairs in the Croatian Government.  However, none of them wanted or could explain to the Rajsic family what had happened to Dragan.  The situation is still unchanged, almost four years after Dragan failed to return from his afternoon walk through Sisak.<p>

Four years ago Dragan Rajsic was retired, after many years of work in INA-Refinery Sisak, in bad health and politically and socially inactive; the family saw the only reason for his arrest in the text which appeared on 6/19/91 in the 66th issue of <i>Slobodni Tjednik</i> and which had a list of 14 Sisak inhabitants who were allegedly agents for KOS [Yugoslav Counter Intelligence Service].  Dragan Rajsic's name was on the list.  In the period between the publication of the list and his disappearance,  Rajsic and his whole family had been through all sorts of unpleasant experiences.  Everything finished two months later when Dragan Rajsic <a HREF="/info/students/marko/gospic1.html">disappeared</a> like a speck of dust in the emptiness of the universe.<p>

<hr><p>

Dragan Rajsic is only one in the procession of inhabitants of Sisak who disappeared in a similar fashion; however, the bodies of some of them were later found , mostly floating down the rivers Sava or Kupa.  The president of the Croatian Supreme Court in 1991, Vjekoslav Vidovic testified in the previous issue [number 498] of <i>Feral Tribune</i>, about the destiny which befell the inhabitants of Sisak whose names were on the (already mentioned) list which appeared in <i>Slobodni Tjednik</i>.  In order to describe the circumstances in which the judges and courts worked in those days, he briefly told the Sisak story.  The story deserves to be repeated in more detail.  According to  Vidovic, two judges from Sisak phoned him and asked for a meeting.  Although he had other engagements, Vidovic decided to see them, judging that it was an important matter, since judges rarely request urgent meetings with the Supreme Court.  Since, when the judges came to the Courthouse, he had been at the meeting in his office, Vidovic asked the secretary to take the Sisak judges to  a different room and ask them to wait for a few minutes.  When he later joined them, he did not hear anything extraordinary, which left him wondering about their intentions.  He concluded that the judges changed their minds in the last moment and decided to hide the real reason for their trip to Zagreb.<P>


<h2>Panic in the City</h2><p>



Later Vidovic set up a meeting with the presidents of the Supreme Court departments where he ,among other things, told the story about Sisak judges and repeated his suspicions.  They agreed that one of the Supreme Court judges should go to Sisak the very same day to find out what exactly was going on there.  In Sisak he found out that the city was living in fear, even panic, because some of its inhabitants, from the list which had been published in <i>Slobodni Tjednik</i>, had been murdered and their corpses had been found in the river Kupa.<p>

Since one of the local judges had been at the investigation and identification of the corpses, a documentation on the cases existed in the court files, but the authorities in charge had not done anything to start the investigation.  Sisak judges, being scared themselves, decided to contact the Supreme Court and try to have something done about the cases.  After returning from Sisak, the Supreme Court judge prepared a report, which Vidovic presented to the Prime Minister, Franjo Greguric.  After being told about the situation in Sisak, Greguric asked curtly whether Vidovic had anything on paper.  In the end Vidovic passed on the report to Greguric.<p>

After he was removed from the position of the Supreme Court President, Vidovic asked for a copy of the Sisak report which had been placed in the Supreme Court Archive; however he was told that the report had disappeared.  That was the end of the story.  Franjo Greguric was not the only person to be informed about the events in Sisak.  U.S. Helsinki Watch Committee recorded the murders of 13 Sisak inhabitants, as well as the Dragan Rajsic's disappearance and informed president Tudjman about them.  At the beginning of '92 Croatian public prosecutor, Zeljko Olujic, visited the Helsinki Watch head office in New York where he was given the detailed information about the murders.<p>

Later the Union of Serbs in Republic of Croatia in one of its letters to president Tudjman, also addressed the events in Sisak, stating that ``the total number of murdered [persons] cannot be known without a thorough and objective investigation (it is estimated, based on the number of disappeared, that at least 400 persons were murdered)."  The Union suggested to president Tudjman to personally order `` an investigation into all cases" and to ``personally follow the results of investigations."  They also added:`` taking into account informations from the territory of the Sisak Zupanija we also believe it is unacceptable that Duro Brodarac or any other individual who compromised himself with his passive attitude with respect to the events in Sisak, be elected for a Sisak Zupan [Governor]."

<h2> Black Hole </h2><p>

In spite of everything, despite the documentation in Sisak Court about the discovered corpses and even the documentation about approximately 40 Sisak inhabitants murdered by the unknown perpetrators at the Sisak Hospital pathology department, thorough investigation never occured.  At one point a rumor that the investigation had been started and some suspects arrested spread through Sisak; however, ever if it were correct, nothing has ever been heard about the results of the investigation.<p>

In the meantime, the present President of the Supreme Court, Milan Vukovic, became notorious because of his remark that Croats in this war could not have committed crimes. This has reserved a place for him in the reports of the international human rights organizations.<p>

Supreme Court judges in the case of Sisak murders demanded respect of laws in the work of all state and judicial authorities and stated that, despite defensive character of the war, war crimes occured also on the Croatian side; probably because of that, they failed to pass through the CDU orchestrated selection process in nominations for the judges of the new Supreme Court (the process has been annulled by the Constitutional Court). The destiny of the Sisak judges who initiated demands for solution of the problem of the Sisak ``black hole" which swallows people, will become clearer when they take their turn for the nomination to permanent judicial positions.  We will see whether they will be, as ``masochists", banished from the Court, or will, afraid, stay silent as if nothing ever happened in order to keep their positions, personal peace and safety.<p>

<i>Of all murders in Sisak, the public only knows about the details of the murder of Damijan Zilic, who was a chemical engineer and the production director in Sisak Refinery.  He was murdered on 11/23/91 in Jakusevac, Zagreb.  Four guardsmen from Sisak were suspects in this case, but were released without charges.  A driver in Petrinja company ``Slavijatrans," Vlado Bozic, died from injuries suffered due to physical mistreatment after his arrest by the Ministry of Internal Affairs reservists.  Sisak Police Chief, Duro Brodarac, confirmed at a press conference that the reservists over-stepped their authority in that case, but they were not charged with anything.  Ilija Martic was killed in Sisak while leaving a restaurant.  Staka Cadi and Kuzman Kovacevic were killed in 1993 in their respective homes.  The circumstances under which the others were murdered remain unknown and their bodies were found mostly in the rivers Sava and Kupa or in a forest in Brezovica.  The corpse of Stana Zivkovic from Mokosica was washed out of Sava at Zupanja [some 200 miles down the river from Sisak].  Duro Brodarac, Sisak Police Chief, confirmed in February of '92 that 12 suspects in the murders of the persons of Serb nationality had been arrested.  However, the suspects have never been brought to trial.</i><p>

<h2>Letters to the Editor, 4/17/95</h2><p>

Dear Feralers!<p>
 
First, receive my earnest congratulations for your courage and persistence.  You are winners after all, and that gives hope.<p>

It makes me happy that you write about Sisak cases, which could have been solved if the city rulers wanted so.  Incredibly easily, it was possible to find out in Sisak restaurants, market, even in the church, who murdered who and, even worse, who was next.<p>

Regards,<p>
T.D., Sisak

<h1>  Interview with Alun Roberts, UN spokesperson in Knin: Systematic Burning</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> <br>  Feral Tribune, 8/14/95, Split, Croatia</i></h2><p>

email:FERAL_TRIBUNE@ZAMIR-ZG.ztn.apc.org<p>

<hr>

<strong>UN commission for human rights has counted 45 burned houses between Drnis and Knin.  "These houses were destroyed according to a plan, assiduously and systematically," claims Alun Roberts.  "All houses and apartments outside the Knin city center look as if they were broken into and looted." </strong><P>

<hr>

Since Tuesday afternoon, when we were allowed to enter some of the villages around Knin, UN military observers and civil police have seen many burned houses, as well as some which were still burning.  UN commission has established that the houses had been destroyed according to a plan and - what is interesting - very assiduously and systematically!<p>

This is a part of a statement given by Alun Roberts to <em>Feral's</em> journalist.  Alun Roberts is a UN official in Knin, and he was there when the Croatian Army liberated the city.  Asked to back up his claims with a proof, Roberts responded:<P>

On Thursday night, 10 August, UN representative for human rights, counted along 18 kilometers of the road between Drnis and Knin 45 houses in flames.  Smoke was coming out of some of them.  They had been set on fire minutes earlier.<P>

<strong>Q: What are your informations about the situation in Knin?  What happened during the military operations?</strong><P>

As far as as we could tell, in the streets outside of the city center, almost all houses and apartments looked as they had been broken into and looted.  We found clothing and furniture, children toys and other similar items at the city  dump, not far from the center of the city.  We can not talk about the number of civilian victims or about the behavior of the Croatian Army immediately after the the end of military operations since we left the camp for a first time on Tuesday.<P>

<strong>Q:Why?</strong><P>

UN observers and civilian police did not get the Croatian military authorities permission to enter the city.  Only on Tuesday afternoon, when everything had been already finished, after a lot of effort, a regular patrol was allowed to walk through the city.  Therefore it is impossible for UN to tell whether the Croatian Army behaved appropriately or not.<P>

<strong>Q:Croatian authorities have, however, informed the UN about the start of operation "Storm"?</strong><P>

That is correct but it does not offer much comfort.  Several hours before the start of operation "Storm", UN military headquarters in Zagreb received the Croatian authorities warning that the definite attack would start on Friday at 3 a.m. - maybe 3:15 a.m. - and that the bombardment would commence 2 hours later.  That is how it happened.  Everybody left the city on Friday afternoon or during the Friday on Saturday night.  Street fighting occured on the outskirts of the city, where every sign of civilian life had disappeared.<P>

<strong>Q:You have about 600 people from the Knin area in your camp.  According to the information published in the local daily press, alleged war criminals are among them.  What can you tell us about that?</strong><P>

We know about that and we immediately took a stand on that issue.  According to the Akashi's agreement, alleged war criminals will remain under the jurisdiction of the military authorities in sector South until the Croatian authorities start legal proceedings against them.  Cases like those require careful investigation which can not be conducted carelessly or quickly.  Until the evidence against alleged war criminals is revealed, in detail and clearly, they will, regardless of what anyone might think about that, remain in the sector South camp.  They cannot leave the camp - neither voluntarily or under pressure - since helicopter link between Zagreb and Knin is only maintained in case of emergency and used by UN officials.<P>

<strong>Q:Have the Croatian military authorities tried to reduce tensions in the area?</strong><P>

Yes, they have, but their methods are rather strange.  For example, work of UN commander for sector South has been hampered by Croatian police which, unfortunately, keeps doing the opposite of what it should and keeps provoking clashes.  The commander of sector South simply cannot transfer the message of reconciliation between these two separated communities, which both suffer from the tragic consequences of the war.<P>

<h1> On the Way to Never-Never Land</h1>

<h2><em> by Aleksandar Ciric</em>, Vreme, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 7/24/95</h2><P>

<FONT SIZE="+1">The current situation in the metropolitan Tuzla area is a clear indication of the forced concentration of the ethnically "cleansed" population.  According to the 1991 census, this area had 437,000 inhabitants in 1991; current estimates use a figure of 663,000 people, more than half of whom are Muslim refugees from other parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  At the same time, 67,000 Serbs (out of 82,000) and 20,000 Croats (out of 39,000) have fled the Tuzla area.  The most recent estimates, made by the UNHCR (UN high commission for refugees), mention 1,327,000 refugees and 1,422,000 persons affected by the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina;  the total is almost equal to the present population of what is left of the former Bosnia-Hercegovina.<P>

In October of 1991, Ms. Sadako Ogata, warned on behalf of UNHCR that the number of refugees at the time had reached the saturation point in the countries receiving refugees; she also expressed fear that by the end of that year the number of refugees, both within and outside Bosnia-Hercegovina, would increase by another 400,000.  Reality, as usual, surpassed all fears:  in December of 1991, the number of refugees within Bosnia-Hercegovina was higher than 500,000, and the total number of refugees was estimated as 750,000.  Term "population exchange" entered daily use, without causing unusual distress, especially among politicians of a "national leader" type.  Besides, ever since the two famous meetings between Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudman, in Tito's hunting grounds at Karadordevo and Belje, at the beginning of 1991, the rumors about the agreed "swap" of Western Slavonia for Eastern Slavonia and, of course, the division of Bosnia-Hercegovina were rife.<P>

<strong>WAVES AND A FLOOD</strong>:  The existence of that one and similar agreements among the national-state leaders, has never been denied, neither by them, nor by the events in the following four years of the latest round of Yugoslav wars.  Waves of refugees became, not only a sad reality, but also the means for political promotion - or manipulation, it doesn't matter.  
 An example which cannot be ignored is a first exodus from Western Slavonia in December 1991.  As, more or less, the direct consequence of "serbing" of the former communist generals, posturing of the local territorial defense and empty promises of brotherly help from Bosnian Serbs and "our" JNA {Yugoslav Peoples Army, "old" federal armed forces],  at least 20,000 people fled in the dead of winter.  The recipe remained, since then, unchanged: they were greeted in Banja Luka by Radovan Karadzic and his "most-serb" [serbujusci] collaborators, who promised resettlement in Eastern Slavonia to women, children and elderly and guns and return to the front line to the fighting age men.<P>

The summer of 1992 brought the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina, new movements of old refugees and, so far, the largest waves of new ones.  Only in June of that year, 14,000 passports were issued in Subotica [northern Serbia, province of Vojvodina] to the refugees from Bosnia-Hercegovina; crowded trains, full of refugees, were stranded for days at border crossings;  Slovenia refused to allow the trains to its territory, Croatian authorities were taking fighting age men off the trains and sending them to Bosnia; European states had hard time agreeing about the numbers of refugees they were ready to receive.  In Serbia, followers of the chetnik vojvoda [leader] Vojislav Seselj, president Slobodan Milosevic's favorite politician, practically implemented their model of "realignment" of population in Hrtkovci [village in Vojvodina with large Croatian population before the war] (bomb attacks, threats, arson, one murder).<P>

Infection spread to eight counties in Vojvodina, burdened by the largest portion of 140,000 refugees from Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina.  Not for the last time, Serbia's national Skupstina [Parliament] refused to issue an amnesty for all those citizens who refused to take part in the war;  besides everything else, this was a big contribution to ethnic cleansing, since it blocked the return of several tens of thousands of citizens who are not Serbs but were eligible for military service;  ethnically correct [Serb] war resisters were labeled as "bad Serbs" and it was deemed that they shouldn't be allowed back.  That summer, the official estimate of the number of refugees within the country [former Yugoslavia] reached 1,7 million; the number of refugees outside the country was estimated at about 500,000 people.<P>

<strong>HEARTH CLEANSING</strong>: Whatever the case until then, the world joined the local production of refugees, and at the same time was trying to understand what the war parties wanted.  Thus, the first maps for division of Bosnia-Hercegovina appeared ("Cutillero's" map in March 1992).  Starting with "Cutillero's" map all the way to the Contact Group map, all of the maps accepted at least the possibility of ethnic cleansing by using the ethnic majority as the basis for territorial division.<P>

There's no trace of cynicism in the remark that the following year, 1993, was dedicated to the thorough cleaning of the territories which the war parties had occupied or considered to be theirs.  Truck driver from Trebinje, national leader Bozidar Vucurevic concluded, erroneously as the events would show, that the war in eastern Hercegovina had finished; therefore, in January 1993 he expelled several thousands Muslims who were loyal to the Serb authorities; many of them fought against Hercegovina Croats together with the Serbs.  "We cannot guarantee your security," he said on that occasion.  Nor the property, of course:  in the middle of winter, crossing the mountains, the refugees crossed into Sandzak [part of Serbia with large number of Muslims] and Montenegro carrying only plastic bags with personal belongings they had been allowed to take and certificates about "voluntary giving up of property for humanitarian purposes".<P>

On the eve of new 1993, UN Secretary general, Boutros Ghali, revealed the "qualified" estimate by the competent UN organizations that there were more than three million people with refugee status from the former Yugoslavia or within the country.  Almost every eighth citizen of the former Yugoslavia.  However, already in the Spring of 1993, started the Croatian-Muslim war in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  Enemies on some "front lines" suddenly became friends on others: several thousands of Croatian refugees from Central Bosnia found the refuge in the territory controlled by the Serbs; later, some of them were let through to Croatia, while the rest were sent back to fight.<P>

<strong>TRADE IN HUMAN FLESH</strong>:  "Safe Havens", formed in Bosnia-Hercegovina under international protection, were slowly turning into concentration camps;  the victims of "silent" ethnic cleansing, which continued unabated congregated in them.  From the rest of the territory, emigration was "humane", in front of the eyes of international observers.  An example: between June 1994 and May 1995, 9054 citizens left the territory of Bosanska Krajina (Banja Luka, Prijedor, Sanski Most, Prnjavor and Bosanska Gradiska); they were the remnant of those who didn't have the luck to belong to the "victorious" nation or weren't unlucky enough to be eaten by darkness.  When the Army of Bosnia-Hercegovina (ABiH) decided in June 1994 to settle accounts with Fikret Abdic, some 45,000 people fled with him to the Republic of Srpska Krajina; Croatia refused to accept them, Europe as well; the refugees refused to return to the territory controlled by the 5th Corp ABiH and, these days, the majority of them celebrated the anniversary in the small area around Velika Kladusa which Fikret Abdic controls with help of the army of Krajina Serbs.<P>

Coincidentally, that same June 1994, Bratislava Morina, Republic of Serbia's commissioner for refugees, announced revision of the refugee status.  Result: 90,000 of persons without a refugee status and a hunt on fighting age men conducted by brotherly police forces of all Serb lands.  While the hunt went on, and the refugees learnt the vocation of an illegal refugee, Ms. Morina revealed for the state-controlled "Borba" her complaints regarding the help sent from abroad and her preferred solution:" We asked to receive money in the new assistance so that we can buy ourselves whatever is really needed by the refugees."<P>

The refugee story ends, so far, with the first of May cleansing of Western Slavonia from the remaining 15,000 Serbs and exodus of about 35,000 Muslims from the Srebrenica enclave.  At this time, grenades are falling on Zepa and Bihac, United Nations are announcing withdrawal of Blue Helmets from Zepa and promising to continue protection of the civilians there even after the withdrawal.  Todays civilians are learning from todays refugees how to tie a knot on a sack.<P></FONT>

<h1> Buried Truth</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Gojko Beric<br>  Oslobodjenje, European edition, 6/29-7/6 1995, Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina</i></h2><p>


<hr>

For days, a group of women in black was on a hunger strike under a tent in front of the Parliament building in Zagreb.  That was another desperate attempt of mothers and wives to find out the truth about the destiny of their husbands and sons who were forcibly taken away during the aggression of the former JNA [Yugoslav Peoples Army] on Croatia.  Official Croatian sources give a number of 2,864 persons, half of which disappeared after the fall of Vukovar.  It is thought that the majority of them ended up in camps and jails in Serbia where all traces of them were lost.  At the end of the last week, competent state commissions from Croatia and self-declared Yugoslavia, again held talks about that matter,  without any progress.  On the other hand, the authorities in Belgrade are seeking about 1,000 Serbs and Montenegrins, their citizens, who have allegedly disappeared during the war in Croatia.<p>

This dirty war, one of the dirtiest in recent history, will be remembered after the bestial killing of civilians and prisoners of war.  By destroying thoroughly Vukovar, house by house, Gen. Kadijevic's army and Serbian paramilitary formations killed thousands of people.  After the city fell, mass executions of captured Croats occured.  It is estimated that several hundreds were killed on that occasion while a certain number were allegedly transported to Serbia.  Of course, the Croats were not innocent in the conflict with the rebel Serbs. Crimes in Gospic and other places are the object of an international investigation.  In every war, a crime and revenge go hand in hand, closing the infernal cycle of death.  During the war in Croatia many prisoners of war were shot on the spot, as is confirmed by many mass graves.  Hatred was stronger than any human concern.<p> 

The Serbs installed crime into their greater Serbian project as the goal of the war.  They committed such atrocities against Bosniak [Bosnian Muslims] people that even their descendants will have to pay for the sins of the ancestors.  The whole Bosniak families were killed in many burned to the ground villages.  The number of the missing is in the thousands.  The Belgrade regime claims there are no prisoners of war in its territory, but the reliable UN sources signal the opposite, stating that some may be held in the camps close to Nis and abandoned Aleksinac mines.  Manfred Novak, chief of the U.N. commission for missing persons, stated that almost 600 requests to the Belgrade authorities remained unanswered due to their refusal to cooperate with the U.N.<p>

Milosevic's police is also quiet about the <a HREF="/info/students/marko/musabd1.html">abduction of a group of Muslims</a> from the train at the station in Strpci, which happened at the end of March 1993.  Although only an episode in the mass suffering of civilians, this abduction is one of the greatest mysteries of that kind in this war.  Strpci is a small train station on a short stretch of the Belgrade-Bar railroad which passes through Bosnia.  On the tragic day, a group of armed men boarded the train and took away 20 passengers after checking their identity papers.  Two months later, Slobodan Milosevic received the relatives of the abducted citizens of unrecognized Yugoslavia, promising to "turn heaven and earth" and clarify the destiny of the missing.  As usual, Milosevic didn't fulfill the promise.  Instead, the Pale authorities said that "the army of the republic Srpska destroyed a paramilitary group which was responsible for the abduction."  Until today, the destiny of the abducted passengers is not known.<p>

There are different data about the number of missing in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  International Committee of Red Cross, the most competent organization in this area, will have a difficult task in Bosnia.  It is never easy to find the truth in these painful questions.  Sarajevo and Pale are locked in fruitless negotiations about the release of about 400 persons from the jails on Kula and Tarcin respectively.  Sarajevo persistently insists on clearing up the destiny of 178 Bosniaks-muslims from Hadzici who were taken from their homes in May 1992.  The only condition of the government of Bosnia-Hercegovina for the release of all Serbs jailed in Tarcin is that [the authorities in] Pale say anything about the destiny of those people.  The destiny of 28 Croats from Bugojno, who according to their relatives were taken by the bosniak army is also unclear.<p>

Politics, in principle, does not have an ear for human suffering, especially during a war.  Just before the unsuccessful meeting of the above mentioned commissions in Belgrade a Yugoslav representative said:" our concern in this matter should not be thr politics but the people and their families.  We should help them."  Deception, therefore, [even] before [the meeting started.] everything else.  Because the true concern here is the politics and not the people.  Gogol, in "Dead Souls" testifies about the way in which the functionaries in imperial Russia counted the dead as the living in order to steal their income.  The politics in this war deals in living and dead.<p>

The Serbs confirmed several months ago that they had on their lists 25 persons sought by the Croatian side.  However when the UN representatives went to find those people, they did not find anyone.  Recently, a group of Croats deported from Western Slavonia to the Serb jails in 1991 was somehow tracked down.  But what about hundreds and hundreds of others, still classified as missing?  Maybe a few of them are still in a camp or a jail.  The majority was probably massacred.  That is typical of this war.  The truth about them is buried for now, but it will come to the surface one day.  The tragedy is in the fact that nobody wants to announce that truth to the people;  that is a crime of politics against the families of the missing and abducted.

<TITLE>Reintegration of Bosnia</TITLE>

<h1>In Our Minds First</h1>
<FONT SIZE="+1">
<h2><em>by Ibrahim Prohic</em>, Oslobodenje (European Weekly Edition), Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 9/14-21/95</h2>

As the chances for the end of the war are increasing, the problems of the constitutional order of Bosnia-Hercegovina and internal political relations gain in importance.  Bosnia has three constitutional peoples [state of Muslims, Serbs and Croats] and at least as many crucial problems.  The most difficult problem is the one of relations with the serb entity; nevertheless, things are not going smoothly in the Bosniac-Croatian federation either.  Also, among the Bosniacs, there are tendencies which might lead to the dissolution of Bosnia-Hercegovina.<P>

In this moment, it is important to remember that Bosnia has better chances in peace than in the war.  The time in front of us is the time of decision about the Bosnia's destiny.  We are at the crossroads, and there are only two options: reintegration or dissolution.  Both have their supporters and their players and one should not bet on either one.  It is necessary to warn that the time left for the final decision is limited, and that the countdown has started already.  The forces supporting reintegration must act immediately, and cannot afford any mistakes, because there will be no time for corrections.<P>

The goal of aggression against Bosnia was its breakup.  The fundamental aggressor's idea was that peoples cannot live together and that solution is in division and national states.  The tradition of Bosnia is the opposite of that idea and is based on coexistence.  The antithesis of Bosnia hasn't won, but it hasn't been defeated either.  That should be done in this transitional period.  It is necessary to forcefully reaffirm idea of Bosnia through social practice.  All segments and levels of the social being should be colored with that idea.<P>

It is necessary to clearly define principles which are the soul of Bosnia and on the basis of these principles plan the concept of its reintegration.  All relevant political and social factors must be won over to that concept.  Consensus of all elements of Bosnia's social being is necessary for Bosnia-Hercegovina which will be the continuation of its thousand years old tradition.<P>

No one, absolutely no one, must stay outside that general movement for Bosnia.  The stakes are too high to leave things to politicians.  A historic challenge lies in front of intellectuals of all kinds.  They have to recognize in the current moment lasting, authentic, historical interest of Bosnia.  The same is true for artists, scientists, religious institutions and their leaders.  Their task is to take this idea to all citizens of Bosna. All factors which are for the reintegration of Bosnia must enter the political and social scene; the union of these factors should be strengthened, methods and means determined.  Reintegration must be implemented; nothing will occur spontaneously, nothing should be given to chance, especially because the enemies of Bosnia won't stand still.<P>

They will simply transform their activities, but the tendency for the dissolution of Bosnia will still be present.  The states surrounding Bosnia won't give up their "greater-state" [expansionist] appetites.  One has to count on low blows.  Manipulations and media distortions will also be there.  The media match in the field of propaganda can also be expected, and this will give great importance to the electronic media.  Bosnia must urgently obtain a satellite channel and fortify existing radio and TV signals and use professional and creative people to form a concept of promotion of the Bosnian idea.  Kenovic and Isakovic must not stay outside Bosnia; Sidran, Gojer and those like them must take part in the realization of that concept.<P>

The basis of Bosnia is multinational and multicultural; it relies on the right to be different, tolerance and openness to all values.  The expected peace solution with two entities is both a chance and a trap for Bosnia.  Reintegration and dissolution are both theoretical and practical possibilities.  The forces supporting reintegration must be different in everything from those which want the opposite, above all in the quintessence of their idea and the broadness of their base.<P>

That base must include everything which represents the essence of the Bosnian being, Bosnian spirit and tradition.  National, religious and political variety is the Bosnia's fortune and plurality the only mode of existence.  Reduction of Bosnia's complexity along the national lines would help the aggressor.<P>

The war showed clearly disastrous consequences of the nationalist solution of the contradictions in the society. The existing demographic picture in Bosnia is not a natural one, nor is it in agreement with Bosnia's tradition and essence.  The current state is a product of violence and therefore historically illegitimate and illegal.  To build the state structure on such situation and determine the character of the society counters the Bosnian essence.  The essence of Bosnia is outside individual historical periods.  That is why continuity is a significant characteristic of Bosnia.  The historic perception must be wiser than current traps.  Those who follow short term interests are punished by history.<P>

Several goals must be accomplished in the transitional period in order for the reintegration of Bosnia to succeed.  Above all, realization of the Bosniac-Croat Federation must confirm that coexistence in this territory is possible.  Then it should be demonstrated to the serb entity with concrete and tangible arguments that the Bosnian idea is more valuable and desirable.  How?  By economic recovery and raising of the standard of living.<P>

Germany has already begun the initiative for the formation of a fund for development of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  The sponsors, beside Germany, would be the USA, Japan, European Union and Persian gulf countries.  It would be similar to the well known Marshall plan.  Capital in itself won't guarantee development.<P>

In order for the Serbs to accept reintegration the life in Bosnia must be more attractive than secession.  Indoctrination of Bosnian Serbs by the Belgrade regime has alienated a good number from Bosnia.  They should be helped in their awakening.  In Bosnia-Hercegovina they must recognize security and a state in which their individuality and self-realization are possible.  Whether this is possible after collective hypnosis and history, the time will show.  Maybe this is more likely today than in 1990, since the practice (life) has confirmed the failure of the idea of a single-nation state.  Bosnian Serbs encountered a wall in Serbia, antagonisms and intolerance of the "brothers in the fatherland".  We should find the way to awaken in Serbs a natural need for self realization and development, which has been suppressed in recent years.<P>

Reintegration of Bosnia must (and can) be completed on an intellectual plain at first and than in practise.  It is necessary to define and reaffirm social ideals which will be guideposts and spell out short term and long term goals which would direct social movements.  If in those ideals a large number of people recognizes the possibility of realization of individual needs, the Bosnian idea has a chance to be widely accepted.  This would increase the likelihood of the territorial integration as well.<P>

In this paper we consider an additive white Gaussian noise
multiple-access channel and investigate the performance degradation of several
multiuser detectors due to imperfect knowledge of channel parameters, induced by
either estimation errors or sampling/quantization of the receiver's 
sufficient statistics.  The 
symbol error rates and the Asymptotic Multiuser Efficiencies (AMEs) 
of these detectors are  
examined as functions of both true and approximated channel parameters 
for 2 asynchronous users. 
The results quantify the loss of near-far resistance due to parameter 
estimation errors and 
demonstrate that detectors which are optimal for ideal conditions 
are often more sensitive to 
parameter mismatch.  Examples are given which illustrate a reverse ordering of t
he symbol error 
rates for these detectors in the high signal-to-noise regime, 
and also illustrate cases when the 
conventional matched-filter detector exhibits superior performance 
over multiuser detectors.

<h1>Croats and Serbs are (Un)suitable</h1>

<h3>by Duro Kozar, Oslobodenje-Svijet, Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 2/8/96</h3>

In June, 1992, Safer Halilovic, then the Chief of Staff of the Bosnian Territorial Defense (TD), informed the public that 18 percent of the TD members were Croats, 12 percent Serbs while the remaining 70 percent were Muslims.  He explained that these percentages did not correspond to the proportions of population in the last Bosnian census in 1991, but that one had to keep in mind that a majority of Serbs were in republic srpska, while the majority of Croats had joined the units of the Croatian Defense Council (HVO); he also pointed out that a lot of people had fled the country.<P>

The fact that 12 percent of soldiers in the TD units at the beginning of the war were Serbs, meant a lot in the political as well as in the military sense.  That was an unmistakable sign that a part of the Serb people refused to follow the policies nationalist of Radovan Karadzic.  The Pale authorities tried to deny this fact, but were ultimately unsuccessful in that.<P>

In the middle of 1992, a Serb lobby managed to convince a British journalist to ask a Bosnian Army soldier, a Serb, Radoslav Zoranovic, a provocative question about the participation of Serb people in "Alija's army".  The journalist asked: "Do you really fight or are you simply a statistical factor?"  Zoranovic didn't allow to be confused; he replied with confidence:" We do fight; as for our number and quality, you should ask Karadzic's Serbs about that: they know!"<P>

Some changes followed: the TD was transformed into the Bosnian Army and Rasim Delic became a new Chief of Staff instead of Sefer Halilovic.  The reorganization went quickly, Corps and ranks were formed; the Army settled accounts with those units and individuals who tried to stay out of the command chain.  During that process, which was followed by significant battlefield successes, the participation of Croats and Serbs in the Bosnian Army was drastically reduced.  According to some data, at the end of 1995, Delic's Army had at most 5 percent of Serbs and Croats!<P>

In spite of the official declaration that all Bosnian patriots are welcome in the Bosnian Army, there seems to be an unofficial opinion that Serbs and Croats are unsuitable and that the Army is better off without them.  This discrimination reaches all the way up to the Deputy Chief of Staff, brigadier general Jovan Divjak [a Serb], who is these days in charge of "parading".<P>

Intensive personnel changes in the Bosnian Army began in the Fall, 1993, when  brigadier general Stjepan Siber [a Croat], until then an assistant to the Chief of Staff, was suddenly (at least as far as the public was concerned) relieved of his duties and appointed to the position of a military attache in the Bosnian embassy in Switzerland.  It was a strange decision: a country in war gives up the services of a general who had proved himself on a battlefield and transfers him to the foreign service.  It seems that somebody's goal was to send Siber as far away as possible from Bosnia-Hercegovina and to remove the only Croat with strong pro-Bosnian orientation from the Bosnian Army.  After that, there were rumors that the Bosnian presidency and the Army Staff would appoint another Croat to the position of an assistant to the Chief of Staff, but nothing came out of it.  It was expected that brigadier Andelko Makar, also a Croat and then the Deputy commander of the Second Corps in Tuzla, would replace Siber.  However, Makar was actually removed from an operative duty and sent to the officer school in Zenica, to teach.  This happened in the second half of 1993, during the worst battles in this war, when the knowledge and experience of brigadier Makar was needed a lot in the zone of operation of the Second Corps in Tuzla.<P>

The case of colonel Mihajlovic is probably the best illustration for this story.  This officer was born in Serbia but, as an officer of the former Yugoslav Army,  lived and worked for a long time in Bosnia-Hercegovina; at the beginning of the aggression against Bosnia he didn't escape to the so-called Yugoslavia nor joined Karadzic like some of his colleagues; instead he volunteered and joined the Bosnian TD.  During 1992 he was an assistant to the commander of the First Bosnian Army Corps, in charge of morale and religious problems.  A year later, he was relieved of his duties and demoted to a position of a chief of the department for social problems of soldiers.  He accepted that duty as a soldier, although aware that he was demoted.<P>

However, that wasn't enough; at the end of the last year, Mihajlovic was sacked and put on a waiting list for a new assignment!  Mihajlovic finally understood what was going on.  He felt cheated, because when, in the Spring of 1992, he joined the TD he hadn't been told that three years later he would become unsuitable because of his nationality.  Something similar happened to officer Nikola Ivancevic.  He left the former Yugoslav Army with the rank of the captain and joined the defenders of Bosnia.  He reached the position of the assistant to the commander in charge of morale at the Teaching and Recruiting center in Sarajevo.  Then, as a Montenegrin, he became superfluous.  Because the people from the Army personnel department couldn't find anything which could discredit Ivancevic, he wasn't expelled from the Bosnian Army but was instead assigned to a position of an intendant in a logistics base.  Considering the offered assignment equal to a demotion, Ivancevic refused to accept it as, in his words, "I didn't graduate from a Military Academy in order to work as an accountant in a military warehouse."  He complained about the assignment to the command of the First Corps but he never received a reply.  What is his status today?  Officially, he is still a member of the Bosnian Army, he receives his salary and cigarettes; however, he hasn't worked for more than a year and a half.  It seems that someone in the Army would rather have an non-Bosniac do nothing.  Ivancevic could be very useful to the Army, but unfortunately, has an unsuitable nationality.<P>

Mihajlovic and Ivancevic say that they complained to general Divjak about their status.  They say that Divjak received them well and showed understanding but that he is unable to help; even his position doesn't correspond to his rank.<P>

General Divjak was effectively assigned to civilian duties.  He represents the Army at meetings, exhibition openings, book promotions, talks to children and does everything but what he knows the best - to command soldiers. Divjak graduated from a military academy in the former Yugoslav Army, worked for a long time in military education (he was even for a while the chairman of a tactics department), but all of that is of no use because of his nationality.  There were rumors that he would be moved to foreign service or sent to retirement; however General Divjak says: "Even if they retired me, I would stay in the Army as an ordinary soldier."<P>

Officer Zlatko Petrovic isn't any more a member of the First Corps Staff; there, he used to be the chief of a legal department.  He has a mixed ethnic origin: his father is a Serb and his mother a Bosniac [Bosnian Muslim], but since his surname is Petrovic [a Serb surname], he is "privileged" to be listed as an Army member while working as a lawyer.  After his and Mihajlovic's departure the First Corps Staff has become ethnically pure, purely Bosniac.  The same is true for the Staffs of all other Corps except for the Fifth Corps, based in Bihac in western Bosnia.<P>

From the beginning of the war, everything in the Fifth Corps has been "multi".  The largest number of officers of all nationalities from the former Yugoslav Army joined the Staff and the units of the Fifth Corps. Its commanders, Hajrudin Osmanagic, Ramiz Drekovic and Atif Dudakovic, cared more about the abilities of their men than about their surnames.  Very soon, the Fifth Corps became the best organized unit, even the best unit in the Bosnian Army.<P>

Even now, the third in the chain of command is a Serb, colonel Aleksandar Mrenica.  There is another Serb in the Staff: Drago Ilic.  A significant number of soldiers in the units of the Fifth Corps are Serbs.  There are a few Croats as well.  Two Croat officers, Ivan Prsa and Franjo Grgic were members of the Fifth Corps Staff; they were later transfered to the HVO command for the Bihac region.  This is the reason behind good cooperation of the Bosnian Army and HVO in the Bihac region.  Division general Dudakovic, besides being a capable commander, is also a very wise man.  All commanding officers in his headquarters are highly skilled professionals.  On one occasion he said:" I can loose a battle before i explain the tactics to an amateur."<P>

The situation might improve in the future.  According to some unofficial informations, it seems that general Dudakovic has ordered that colonel Mihajlovic be assigned to a new duty and that every case of dismissal of non-Bosniacs from Corps Staffs be investigated and he informed about the results of the investigation.  This is an encouraging move.<P>

<h1> Serbs Hunt Serbs</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Gojko Beric<br>  Oslobodjenje, European edition, 6/29-7/6 1995, Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina</i></h2><p>


<hr>

Aggression on Croatia and Bosnia demolished at least two myths about Serbs: one about their invincibility and the other one about how "a Serb gladly goes to war".  Their army, recruited mostly among criminals, peasant scum and forcibly mobilized desperate wretches, suffered in the last few months several serious defeats, losing Kupres, the Mt. Vlasic, Western Slavonia and the Mount Dinara.  What especially changes the stereotypical picture of this war is a large number of deserters among the Serbs.  About 200,000 people in their best years escaped from Serbia in order to avoid mobilization.  Thousands of young men and experts, from technicians to doctors, left the Karadzic's criminal parastate because of the same reason.  He personally issued an order to execute every Serb who refuses to take a rifle and shoot at his non-Serb neighbor.<p>

Realizing the senselessness of further fighting, more and more Mladic's soldiers are running away from the front.  Lack of man-power is a big problem for the Pale authorities.  Knin is in panic as well.  Response of volunteers in Serbia is falling.  Neither Seselj nor Arkan are capable of gathering more than a few hundreds.  Martic demands from Milosevic between 15 and 20 thousands of military recruits, Karadzic significantly more.  It is claimed that they were the main stake in freeing of the captured UN peacekeepers.  For one peacekeeper, Milosevic promised to Karadzic 10 refugees whom Pale claims as soldiers.  Other sources, however, claim that the mass return of Serbs across the Drina river was planned much earlier, as part of the Belgrade's war strategy.<p> 

All over Serbia, a great hunt of Serbs on Serbs goes on.  Independent Belgrade media report about large police raids in apartments, student dorms and refugee camps.  The kidnapers are Martic's and Karadzic's policemen in uniforms with generous help of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs.  The police is taking away even people born in Serbia who have worked in Bosnia and Croatia in the past.<p>

Brutal kidnapers threaten young men with weapons and handcuff them.  There are even murders.  The papers write about a savage hunt on refugees in Belgrade; among the refugees rules a psychosis of fear and betrayal.  After being caught, the recruits are transported to collection centers, the largest of which is in Sremska Mitrovica.  Resistance is not advisable at all.  <em>Nasa Borba</em> and <em>Vreme</em> reveal a case of a certain Mirko Drljaca, a logger, originally from Virovitica [Croatia], who a year ago became a Serbian citizen.  When he tried to escape from the collection center in Sremska Mitrovica, Drljaca was cut across the legs by a burst of fire from a machine gun.<p>

Karadzic gave a 5 July deadline to everyone on the deportation lists to join the Mladic's units.  Otherwise they will face a military tribunal.  Karadzic obviously isn't thinking about peace; his long term strategy is war.  By sending him reinforcements in a shape of cannon fodder, Milosevic makes it clear that he supports Karadzic in that [strategy].  It is not clear how the West will react to that fact, having in mind that the Serbian president has been trying to convince it the opposite.  Besides, we are also talking about human rights violations.  But who cares about that these days?  In any case, Milosavic took off the mask of a peacemaker from his warrior face.  By deporting them across the Drina, Milosevic cheated bosnian and croatian Serbs for a third time.  At first, he pushed them into a pan-serbian state which will amount to nothing.  Then he greeted them with open arms as refugees, actually victims of his bloody adventures, promising a pleasant stay in Serbia, only to return them back to where they escaped from.  Now, the trenches and death are waiting for them;  these are the only things Milosevic can offer to the Serbs.<p>

<h1>  Pavelic's Picture and Other Stories</h1>
      <h2>  Ugonostalgia in Vodinci, the Village with Triple U</h2><p>

 
<h2><i> by Drago Hedl<br>  Feral Tribune, 1/30/95, Split, Croatia</i></h2><p>
 

``I do not see anything contraversial in naming my restaurant ``U". ``U" can stand for ``ugostiteljstvo" [hotel business] and ``usluga" [service] or anything else beginning with an ``U", although to some people that ``U" can mean only one thing. Why does not anybody question why a hotel in Zagreb is named ``I" ," asks thirty years old Zeljko Petricevic, the owner of restaurant ``U" from Vodinci, a village near Vinkovci [town in eastern Croatia]. His restaurant's name became more familiar after the logo, consisting of a capital letter U and a Croatian coat of arms appeared several times on the advertising pages of a Vinkovci magazine, ``Hrvatski Vjesnik" [Croatian Messenger], also known because of its motto:`` Serbs, be damned wherever you are", displayed on the front page.<p>

`` Yes, I used to sponsor Zvonimir Sekulin, the editor of ``Hrvatski Vjesnik", but I have ceased to support him. Actually, I could not afford to pay DM 200 for every issue," says Petricevic.  `` And as for your question whether I had any problems about the restaurant's name, I can simply reply: no, none at all. The road maintenance company from Vinkovci was the only one to demand I remove the billboard next to the street within three days. They did that last year, but I told them to remove the sign themselves if it bothers them. As you can see, nobody came to remove the sign. Nevertheless, they sent the financial police and fined me DM 12,000; that might have happened because  of the restaurant's name.  This country is still run by the communists and such things are possible."<p>

<h2>Seks will Do It</h2><p>

Jure Brkic, Zeljko's best man, owner of a restaurant named ``U2", located a few hundred meters further up the street, says he pondered over what to name his restaurant. He had, he says, different ideas, and then it seemed logical that if Zeljko's restaurant is named ``U", his should be named ``U2". He knows that is the name of a rock band, but that did not motivate him to name the restaurant.<p> 

Jure finds nothing scandalous in the names of his and Zeljko's restaurants. On the contrary, he believes it is a scandal that the memorial to the antifascist fighters fallen in the WWII still stands in the neighboring village of Stari Mirkovci.<p>

`` That is why they put the county seat in Stari Mirkovci, instead of here. Because Stari Mirkovci is, unlike Vodinci, a Partisan village, so they are still privileged, as during the last 50 years", says Jure Brkic. `` We complained to Vladimir Seks [Governor of East Slavonia] and demanded that the county seat be moved to Vodinci and he promised to do everything in his power to fulfill our demand.<p>

Between Zeljko Petricevic's restaurant ,``U", and his best man Jure Brkic's ``U2", on the village's main street was until recently located a third restaurant, owned by Zeljko's brother Zdenko; The main street used to bear the name of Partisan Stanislav Lehota, but is now named after Josip Juraj Strossmayer. The third restaurant had a name ``Poglavnik" [term corresponding to Fuhrer in Croatian fascist terminology], and the billboard above the street entrance was adorned by Ante Pavelic's likeness [leader of the Croatian fascists during the WWII]. Together with the owner's name, Zeljko Petricevic, bar's name ''Poglavnik" and Pavelic's picture, the text on the billboard also included: Vodinci, NDH [ Nezavisna Drzava Hrvatska, Independent State of Croatia, Nazi puppet state during the WWII on the territory of Bosnia-Hercegovina, most of Croatia and  parts of Serbia].<p>

<h2>Mercep's Beer</h2><p>

Jure Brkic says that Zdenko Petricevic did not have any problems because of the restaurant's name. He has actually, as did Zeljko and Jure, legally registered the restaurant's name with Tomislav Berkovic of the hotel and restaurant business regulatory office in Vinkovci. The reason for ``Poglavnik"'s temporary closure is that Zdenko is due to some problems, says Jure Brkic, incarcerated in Germany and had sold his restaurant to a Swiss gentleman married to a Croatian citizen.<p>

`` Ante Dapic, a Parliament member and the president of the Croatian Party of Rights, especially liked to stop by my brother Zdenko's restaurant ``Poglavnik" ," tells us Zeljko Petricevic. ``It is a pity Zdenko is not around to show you the photos and video recordings. I should not complain either. Without exaggerating, at least a half of the present members of the Croatian Parliament have visited my restaurant ``U". They all had a good time and liked the atmosphere; only Tomislav Mercep complained that the waiter gave him a warm beer. And it was warm because we had not had electricity for three days before that; they are always connecting and reconnecting something around here."<p>

Zeljko says he is sorry he does not know where a portrait of Ante Pavelic, ``a beautiful work in oil by a German painter from 1942," ended up; the painting used to hang in his brother Zdenko's restaurant, ``Poglavnik". He is also fond of Pavelic's portrait which he displays in his restaurant, ``U". Poglavnik's portrait in pastel has been done specially for Zeljko, by Vlatko Kordic, also known as Smuk, which in these parts of Croatia is a synonym for a person fond of a bottle.<p>

<h2>Jozo Ustasha's Present</h2><p>

`` I have been offered SF 1000 and DM 1000 and once even DM 3000 for that painting. But I am too fond of it to sell just like that," explains Zeljko Petricevic. His restaurant is closed until 4pm and since we spent the morning in Vodinci, Zeljko fulfilled our request and showed us the interior. Pavelic's picture dominates the space next to the bar and the picture of Ban Jelacic [Croatian 19 century leader] is right next to it. A ceramic tile with the Croatian coat of arms and a large black ``U" is also there; it is a gift and bears a dedication from ``Jozo Ustasha" [Ustashe were Croatian fascists] from Donji Miholjac. That kind of tiles used to be produced for a special customer [ during the WWII ] in the Ceramic tile factory in Orahovica, near Slavonska Pozega.<p>

`` Jozo does not even know that I hung up his present with the dedication right next to the Poglavnik's portrait," says Zeljko. `` He will be very happy when he stops by next time and notices that." <p>

Zeljko says another restaurant, named ``Mladost" [ Youth ], used to be at the same place as his restaurant, ``U". His mother managed the restaurant. When the war in Croatia started in 1991, Zeljko was among the first to join the Croatian National Guard. Restaurant ``Mladost" remained closed for a while and when he left the Croatian army in the spring of 1992 (``I left when the ones now parading with memorials and ranks started to put on the Croatian Army's uniforms") he was overcome by ugonostalgia; consequently, he decided to take up restaurant business. That is how he opened the restaurant, naming it ``U".<p>

`` Hundreds and hundreds of cars have stopped by the sign advertising my restaurant on the main road. Many had themselves photographed with the sign for a souvenir. I do not see anything wrong in that."<p>

<h1>Half of Bosnia Without an Address</h1>
<FONT SIZE="+1">
<h2><em>by Prof. Dr. Ilijas Bosnjovic</em>, Oslobodenje (European Weekly Edition), Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 8/24-31/95</h2>

Relatively long period of peace after the WWWII was beneficial for the population development in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  The population has grown from 2,564,308 in 1948 to 4,377,033 in 1991, or by 71 percent.  In the former Yugoslavia, only Macedonia has recorded a larger growth (76 percent), while the other republics had a significantly smaller growth: Croatia 26%, Slovenia 37%, Serbia without provinces [of Kosovo and Vojvodina] 38%.  Large population migrations, the largest in the former Yugoslavia, are also characteristic of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  Until 1991 the number of emigrants was larger than the number of immigrants by 1,712,488 inhabitants.<P>

<h2>Peasants Became Workers</h2>

...<P>

The industrialization and other socio-economic changes in the period after the WWII have determined the mode of population development in Bosnia-Hercegovina:  the process of the so-called demographic transition has been started; in this process, the natural population growth is reduced, the population ages with time and, after a while, begins to decrease in number; in other words it begins to die out.  Although the population of Bosnia-Hercegovina has partly preserved its vitality until 1991, the signs of demographic transition were even then clearly noticeable, as in the whole of population as well as in the three major ethnic groups individually.  This process has to a largest extent engulfed Serbs, then Croats and then Bosniacs.<P>


<h2>2.5 Millions of Refugees</h2>

The 1992 war has caused great demographic disturbances in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  The normal population development was interrupted and all trends in that development were deformed.  Since the end of June 1995, over 2.5 million people have left their permanent residence; in other words they have been forced to migrate.  Out of that number a little bit less than 1.3 millions of persons have sought refuge abroad (refugees) and the rest have found temporary accommodation within Bosnia-Hercegovina (displaced persons).  These demographic disturbances are differently distributed among the different ethnic groups in Bosnia.  43.2 percent of the total, or 540,000 persons were Bosniacs, 31.2 percent, or 390,000 were Serbs and 17.8 percent or 222,000 were Croats while 7.8 percent or 97,000 were the Yugoslavs or people from other ethnic groups.  The breakdown of numbers of displaced persons according to their ethnicity is as follows:  Bosniacs 702,000 or 54 percent, Serbs 340,000 or 26.2 percent, Croats 1555,000 or 11.9 percent and Yugoslavs and others 103,000 or 7.8 percent.  In addition, the direct and indirect demographic losses due to the war amount to 352,000 persons. Out of that number, 279,000 were killed, died during the war or are missing, 15,000 were added due to the increase in mortality [with respect to the prewar levels] and 58,000 can be ascribed to the reduction in the number of births.  Bosniacs make up more than a half of total war losses, or 9.4 percent of their population before the war.  Serb losses are 32.5 percent of the total losses, or 8.3 percent of the Serb population before the war.  Croats constitute 10.9 percent of total losses which corresponds to 5 percent of the Croat population.  Yugoslavs and people from other ethnic groups make up the rest: 5.3 percent of total losses which corresponds to 5.4 percent of their prewar population.<P>

<h2>Vitality of the Bosniac Population</h2> 

Out of three major ethnic groups in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Bosniacs had the greatest demographic losses during the war and take up the largest proportion of displaced persons.  Their participation in the losses and forced migrations is significantly larger then the percentage of the Bosniac population at the beginning of the war [according to the census taken in 1991, Muslims (Bosniacs in this article) were 44 percent of the total population, Serbs 31 percent, Croats 17 percent and Yugoslavs and others 8 percent of the total population].  However, this population has preserved its demographic vitality.  This can be seen from the fact that Bosniacs account for 56 percent of the wartime births on the whole territory of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  Likewise, their share of the number of children younger then 14 is also large (57 percent).  This is a so-called children demographic foundation on which both the reproductive capacity and the development potential of the population is based.<P>

The changes mentioned above occured before the end of June, 1995.  Since then, war events have further influenced the demographic situation in Bosnia.  Approximately 40,000 persons were expelled from Srebrenica and Zepa and the fate of another 8 to 10 thousands is still unknown.  Ranks of expelled and missing Bosniacs have been increased by that number.  Forced expulsions of Bosniacs and Croatians from the Banja Luka area still go on (about 50,000 people).  On the other side, 115,000 to 200,000 Krajina Serbs have fled Croatia.  On their way to Serbia a part of this population will stay for a longer or shorter time on the territory of Bosnia-Hercegovina outside the control of the [Muslim-Croat] Federation.  Whether some of these people will permanently settle in that part of Bosnia-Hercegovina, it is hard to predict, since they have a tendency to migrate to Serbia.  However, the measures whose goal is to keep the military capable men in Bosnia have been implemented.  It is possible to make an estimate of the largest possible number of man in that population: between 17 and 19 years of age, 2,500 to 3000, 20 to 39 years of age, 22,000 to 29,000 and 40 to 50 years of age, 7 to 9 thousands, which adds up to 31,500 to 41,000 men.  We can only guess what proportion of that number will stay in Bosnia or join the military service.<P>

<h2>Demographic Amputation</h2>

If we consider the situation after this war in its totality, the demographic future of Bosnia-Hercegovina is uncertain.  Even without war destruction, the demographic transition [aging] of the Bosnian population presented a problem in itself.  It is a sickness of the whole demographic tissue and we can only be fought in peace.  In Bosnia-Hercegovina, the countermeasures must consist of well planned and decisive actions based on coordinated efforts of all Bosniacs, Serbs and Croats.  In your circumstances this is the only way for each one of the three major ethnic groups to avoid depopulation and extinction, which to a smaller or larger extent threaten all of them, although this threat would become reality earlier for some of them and later for others.<P>

Besides grave consequences of the war which were discussed above, the amputation of particular parts of the united demographic body has been carried out.  In that situation, the destructive influence of demographic transition [aging] has a clear way and their malignant influence is stronger, especially in the environment in which the loss of reproductive capabilities has already started.  The connection of the problem of demographic transition [aging]  with economic, urban, social and ethnic factors in Bosnia-Hercegovina, will make any separate [ethnic] population policy ineffective.  Those policies would have an absurd goal: to revitalize amputated parts of a united demographic body!  Because of these reasons it is only possible to talk about a global population policy in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  It would aim at all ethnic groups in Bosnia and its main goal would be to reverse the negative results of the war and than to stop the depopulation in the cases where the reproductive biological potential has been reduced to the critical limit; finally, it would aim to harmonize the further demographic development of Bosniacs, Croats and Serbs.<P>

<H1>Interview with Vladimir <A HREF = "#seb">Srebrov</A> </H1>

<H2>with Adil Kulenovic, Vreme, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 10/30/1995 </H2>

Writer Vladimir Srebrov, one of the founders of the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) in Bosnia-Hercegovina (BH), was put in jail by those who took over from him the leadership of that party.  In the meantime, he has "spent" a short time in another party and from a nationalist  Srebrov was transformed into a supporter of a civic Bosnia-Hercegovina.  After 39 months spent in jail he has returned to Sarajevo.  He spoke for <em>Vreme</em> about his former friends, days in prison, Sarajevo...<P>


<strong>Mr Srebrov, you were one of the founders of the Serb 
Democratic Party. What were the goals of the party at the time you founded it?</strong><P>

I am not <strong>one</strong> of the founders of the party; I am a legal signatory of all documents about the founding of SDS in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  SDS was conceived as a national movement of the Serbian people in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  As you already know, in 1990 and 1991, it was only possible to gather a people under a national banner.  Before us, SDA [largest Muslim party in BH] and HDZ BiH [Faction of the ruling Croatian party in Bosnia-Hercegovina, today the largest Croatian party in BH], and we wanted to see their programs and to find out how those parties would be accepted in BH as national parties.<P>

At that time I was too much of an optimist since I believed that the nationalist phase would last for a short time and that SDS would transform itself in a civic party which would support the development of BH into a secular, civic state.  In the end, because of that ideal I've been detained for 39 months in the jail in Kula.<P> 

<strong> At a certain moment you distanced yourself from the party you helped to found. Why?</strong><P>

I had come under tremendous pressure to accept a plan which, 
as I was subsequently to learn, had been drawn up not in 1990, 
but in the 1980s.  This was the famous 'Ram Plan', the aim of 
which was to destroy Bosnia economically and completely 
exterminate its Muslim people.  I was terribly shocked.  I am 
not exaggerating when I say that I felt terrible pain when I 
heard about this from people who had been my friends for 
almost twenty years.  The plan was drawn up in the 1980s by 
the General Staff of what was then the Yugoslav People's Army 
(JNA).  It envisaged  a division of Bosnia into two spheres of 
interest, leading to the creation of a Greater Serbia and a 
Greater Croatia.  The Muslims were to be subjected to a final 
solution: more than 50% of them were to be killed, a smaller 
part was to be converted to Orthodoxy, while an even smaller 
part - those with money, of course - was to be allowed to 
leave for Turkey, by way of a so-called 'Turkish corridor'.<P>

<strong>What was a so-called 'Turkish corridor', which has been mentioned in the public from time to time?</strong><P>

People with money, were to be allowed to buy their lives and leave, probably, through Serbia,  for Turkey.  
The aim was to cleanse Bosnia-Herzegovina completely of the 
Muslim nation, and to divide the country along the River 
Vrbas.  The very name of Bosnia was to disappear.   This was 
the aim behind the creation of 'Republika Srpska'.  <P>
<P>
<strong>From what you say it would seem that the war in Bosnia-
Herzegovina did not start spontaneously.</strong><P>
<P>
Of course not.  This war was conceived by the General Staff of 
the former JNA.  One day this evidence will be found:  
as I know, it is a two-page typed document outlining what to 
do with Bosnia in the future, though when the plan would 
become operational was not stated.   General Kukanjac referred 
to this plan in a television interview, when he also said that 
he would soon be publishing his memoirs.   These, 
unfortunately, have not come out, since Kukanjac knew it all, 
and it would be interesting to know how the military plan for 
the destruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina was actually made.   
There was also another plan - the Memorandum [of the Serbian 
Academy of Arts and Sciences] - which was the spiritual 
complement of the military one.  The main ideologist of the 
Memorandum in Bosnia-Herzegovina was Milorad Ekmecic.  I 
intentionally omit to mention his doctoral title, because he 
proved to be a great coward, an inhuman person and a great 
enemy of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  You remember that in 1992, in an interview with Dubravka Kenic, Milorad Ekmecic said that that 100,000 victims were not a too great a price to pay for the Greater Serbian idea (I am paraphrasing this, but that's basically what he said).<P>
<strong>In March 1992, in conversation with an SDS delegation, 
Ekmecic said that the Serb people was ready to sacrifice at 
least 100,000 to 200,000 lives in order to realize its historical 
aims.  He also said that the Serbian people uprising would be like a French revolution.</strong><P>
Before the war I held Milorad Ekmecic in high regard as an 
intellectual.  But he did not use the great respect he enjoyed 
among the Serbs to direct them in the positive direction.  He 
should have ended up, like me, in the Kula prison.   It is 
shameful for the Serb intellectuals of Bosnia-Herzegovina that 
I alone among them was imprisoned for his beliefs in the so-
called Republika Srpska.  It would have been better if at 
least 1,000 of them had ended up in prison. <P>
<P>
<strong>How do you judge the responsibility of the Serb 
intelligentsia for the fate of the Serb people, not only in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina but also in Croatia?</strong><P>

They proved to be real cowards, which was incredibly surprising for me.   Most of them turned out to be nonentities.  We must make an exception here, of course, for Mrs Vesna Pesic and a small number of intellectuals in 
Serbia, who have protested.  I am surprised they have not been 
killed or imprisoned because of their views. <P>

<strong>Radovan Karadzic is undoubtedly a person who will leave his 
mark on the destiny of the Serb people in Bosnia-
Herzegovina.</strong><P>

You mean Radovan Karadzic the criminal, Radovan Karadzic the embezzler.<P>

<strong>The way he is treated by the international community</strong><P>

I am surprised that you don't refer to him as doctor Radovan Karadzic.
You may remember that in 1990-1, when he started to be 
promoted by certain circles in the political and academic 
establishment of Serbia, I was saying that he - like Krajisnik 
- was an embezzler, and that such people could not be Serb 
national leaders.  The proof of his criminal past can be found 
in the archives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Ministry of the 
Interior.<P>

<strong>However, it is he who influences decisively the fate of the 
Serb nation today.</strong> <P>

No, not at all.  You are making a big mistake here.  Those 
who hold power are not in Bosnia but in Serbia.   I have in 
mind, in particular, President of Serbia Milosevic and former 
President of 'Yugoslavia' Dobrica Cosic.  Milosevic also engineered 
my removal from the SDS leadership in 1990.    <P>

<strong>Nevertheless, even as an instrument of Slobodan Milosevic's 
political will, Radovan Karadzic is officially in power. </strong><P>

You keep talking about him as a government, but he is 
nothing but a common swindler.  Those who are protecting him 
and working with him are mainly criminals.  He is an insane 
person, chosen - I say this openly - by the Serbian leadership 
as their instrument for the destruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  
They chose Radovan Karadzic because he was already known as 
somebody who hated Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina.  He was a 
member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Writers' Association. As its 
members we knew that he was working for the police, that he 
spied on us for the police. Being a man of no moral integrity, 
he was a suitable person to implement the plan to destroy 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Please, read his speeches and you will realise that he is worse than Hitler.<P>

<strong>It is indisputable that in this war the Bosniak-Muslims 
have suffered most, and that the Croats have suffered as well.  
Not enough is known, however, about the suffering of the 
Serbs.</strong>  <P>

When we talk of genocide against the Muslim people, we 
must at the same time speak of the genocide against the Serb 
people.  But this genocide against the Serb people has been 
conducted by no other body but the SDS leadership - what goes 
by the name of the Presidency of the so-called Republika 
Srpska.  It is well known that 150,000 Serbs between the ages 
of 18 and 30 have died in this war, which means that Serbs in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have been biologically destroyed - they 
have become a nation of old people.<P>
 
It would be wrong to classify the Bosnian Serbs as a genocidal 
nation. According to the pre-war census, there were 1,350,000 
of us Serbs here.  Only a core of about 20-30,000 people set 
out to commit massacres in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  They were 
later supported by some 270,000 more.  But 1,000,000 have not 
taken part in the war.  Imagine what an army 1,300,000 Serbs 
could have created, if they had all wished to destroy Bosnia-
Herzegovina. Bosnia-Herzegovina would not have survived. I 
must say that we were politically inexperienced, because we 
allowed the JNA to take its weapons out of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  
Those weapons were later returned to the fronts in Bosnia-
Herzegovina and used to wage war.<P>


<strong>Let me mention a well known thought: "While Zagreb and Belgrade talk about rationalism, people in Bosnia die."  What do you think about the involvement of the Serbian Writers' Association in this war?</strong><P>

Serbian Writer's Association was a progressive and courageous organization before this war; in this war it turned into nothing.  I am surprised by the downfall of the Serbian writers.  Their protests were insignificant.  Serbian Writers' Association has as a member one Gojko Dogo.  A while ago, I used to sign petitions for his release from jail; recently that same man publicly demanded that I be shot to death with all other detainees...  What happened with Dorde Sladoj? And Adam Puslojic?  What happened with the large number of my, I must say former, friends from the Serbian Writers' Association, whose voice hasn't been heard.  I didn't expect them to try to protect me, far from that.  But they should have simply spoke out about the events in Bosnia-Hercegovina.<P>

<strong>Why did you remain in Sarajevo?</strong><P>

Before the war, I was not too keen on Sarajevo.  I lived 
in lodgings, which was miserable.  As a student I experienced 
all kinds of hardships and when I started to work I suffered a 
lot of unpleasantness.  But when I reviewed it all, I realised 
that all this negative experience was part of life, that it 
could not negate my belonging to Sarajevo and Bosnia-
Herzegovina, that my life was tied to this city and to Bosnia-
Herzegovina.  It was this that made me (gave me the strength 
to) say to myself: 'Wait, your place is in Sarajevo.  Whatever 
happens to its inhabitants will happen to you as well.  If 
every Sarajevo citizen is to be killed by a bomb, then you 
will be killed as well.  But do not run away.'  When I was in 
prison , I used to say: 'My only desire is to take a walk from 
Marin-Dvor to Bascarsija.'  Why?  In your city you are a 
citizen,  because a hundred people greet you.  You are a 
citizen because you communicate with thousands of others like 
you, because you know every house, you know so much.  Abroad 
you are nobody.  <P>

<strong>39 months ago you, in the middle of this city's cataclysm, 
you made a suicidal gesture by going on what can be described 
as a mission of good will, probably hoping to be able to bring 
those who were systematically shelling this city to their 
senses.  How do you see that act now?</strong><P>

I went to meet the SDS leaders because I hoped I would be 
able to sit down with them and talk to them about three 
things.  The first was the feeding of the 60-80,000 Serbs who 
remained in Sarajevo.  They were surviving thanks to [the 
Muslim charity] 'Merhamet' and [the Catholic charity] 
'Caritas' - whereas [the Orthodox charity] 'Dobrotvor' existed 
only on paper.  The second was the opening of a corridor 
through Ilijas - a corridor of life for Bosnia and Sarajevo.  
The idea was to allow all those who wished to leave Sarajevo 
to go, and those who wished to come in to do so.  It did not 
occur to me then that they wished practically to dig up 
Sarajevo, to kill its complete population and turn it into a 
field of wheat. But this is precisely what they did intend to 
do.  The third thing I wanted to tell them was: 'Stop 
shelling.  Most of those who get killed are children.' <P>

<strong>Instead of being received by your former associates, you were arrested.  What can you tell us about the days you spent in prison?</strong><P>

I don't want to talk a lot about prison.  That cannot be described.  I was sentenced to be shot to death; later that sentence was reduced to 10 years in jail, then to 5 and finally to three years.  At the end of my jail term they refused to release me since supposedly, the political situation wasn't appropriate etc.  Why didn't they kill me?  I've asked that question myself many times and I think that I know the answer: because of the public opinion.<P>

<strong>While you were in prison, were you ever visited by someone, someone whose visit you expected, or someone whose visit you didn't expect?</strong><P>

I didn't expect a visit from my jailers, but they did visit the prison.  For a while they threw parties at the prison.  Imagine: on one side there were people who had no food, datainees and war prisoners, and on the other people who don't know what to do with their food.  At the Kula prison, there was a room, which was visible from behind the bars.  That was a so called function hall, where Nikola Koljevic [Bosnian Serb vicepresident] was a frequent guest.  They threw parties for his visits, played gusle [traditional Serb folk instrument], drink, eat, had orgies.  However, Nikola Koljevic never came to visit, although he only had to walk 50 meters to mu cell.  Ljubomir Zukovic showed up once and his first sentence was: 'You know what's up?  Nobody knows I'm here.'<P>

Can you imagine a culture minister who would say something like that?  Isn't that absurd?  I have to mention my good professor, Dr. Josip Besic, who payed me a visit; he looked like a ghost, and I have to say that he risked his own life by doing that.  we talked for about half an hour, in police presence, of course, and he told me that he was leaving for Novi Sad to 'Sterijino Pozorje' [Serbian theater festival].  A month later, I heard that he had died from a heart attack while sitting at a table in the hotel 'Park' in Novi Sad.  They didn't allow his wife Rava to see me, but her message and present did reach me later and are very dear to me.  Since I still cannot reach Rava, I would like to on this occasion extend my best wishes.<P>

<strong>You could get asylum in practically any country.  You have, 
nevertheless, chosen to stay in Sarajevo.  Why?  </strong><P>

Why should I go away?  To lecture at some university abroad?  
I do not need that.  When I was in prison, Radovan Karadzic 
and Nikola Koljevic used to send emissaries to tell me that I 
should apply for 'Republika Srpska' citizenship and promised 
me a good life.  But from the very first day I used to tell 
them: 'I only want to be in Sarajevo.  The only place I want 
to go to is Sarajevo.'  That is that.  Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
my country and Sarajevo is the city in which I want to live. 
Never mind that Sarajevo is destroyed, for we shall rebuild 
it.   We will make it the cultural, political and economic 
centre of the Balkans. It is meant to be that way. That is clear. <P>

<H3><a name="seb">Vladimir Srebrov</a>
</H3>
<strong>Date and place of birth</strong>: Vladimir Srebrov was born on 10/23/1954 in Pozarevac (Serbia) as Milan Nikolic,  son of a JNA officer and a teacher.<P>

<strong>Nationality</strong>: "A Serb by birth, declared Yugoslav, Slav by soul." ("Nedjelja", August 1990)<P>

<strong>Education and Career</strong>: Completed primary and high school in Travnik and Banja Luka.  Graduated from the philosophy department at the Sarajevo University.  Enraptured by the Panslavic movement, during graduate studies in USSR changed his name to Srebrov.  
Before the war, he was in charge of the Philosophical Faculty library of the University 
of Sarajevo. He has published four books of poetry.<P>

<strong>Political views</strong>:  Liable to sudden and drastic changes.  In 1990 he was a founding member of the Serb Democratic Party 
(SDS), whose leader became Radovan Karadzic.  He was a leader of <strong>Mlada Bosna</strong> (militant youth wing of SDS), then for a while an official of the Serbian Renewal Movement [Serbian nationalist, opposition party] for Bosnia-Hercegovina; he left SRM because of a clash with its leader, Vuk Draskovic.  Immediately before the outbreak of the war, after the resignation of the SDS members Nikola Koljevic and Biljana Plavsic [today both vicepresidents of Srpska Republic], he suggested to Izetbegovic to appoint him for a Serb representative to the Bosnian presidency (he was rejected). In late March 1992, he warned 
Serb intellectuals - at their famous congress held in Sarajevo - that the quest for a 
Serb ethnic state in Bosnia-Herzegovina was leading the nation to war and genocide; he also accused Karadzic of corruption and was removed from the hall.  For a while he cooperated with Davor Perinovic, then president of the Croatian Rights party (HSS) and the former president of HDZ BiH.  After the outbreak of the war, he decides to stay in Sarajevo and founds a Civic Party whose member he remains until today.<P>

<strong>Why was he expelled from SDS?</strong>: because of extreme Serb nationalism: after Srebrov's invitation to the JNA to take over the power in Bosnia and his promise that his "iron guards" would help in that, Radovan Karadzic decided in 1990 that "para-militaristic, almost militant outbursts of M.A. Vladimir Srebrov are foreign to the spirit of the Serb people"; Karadzic disbanded <strong>Mlada Bosna</strong> and suspended Srebrov.<P>

<strong>When and how was he arrested?</strong>: In early September 1992, after obtaining personal safety guarantees from both the 
Bosnian government and Pale,  he went to meet Karadzic and Nikola Koljevic in the 
occupied Sarajevo suburb of Ilidza, to discuss with them the situation of the Sarajevo 
Serbs. On his arrival he was promptly arrested, beaten up and imprisoned in Kula.<P>

<strong>What was he sentenced for?</strong>: Karadzic's military court at Han Pijesak charged him with committing, through his 
appearances on Sarajevo television, 'the criminal act of attempting to weaken army 
morale and sow unrest among the soldiers', and also 'other acts that could be 
interpreted as high treason'.  Srebrov was condemned to five years (later reduced to 
three) in prison. <P>

<strong>How did Sarajevo react?</strong>: General Sefer Halilovic, who was then commander of the Bosnian 
Army, offered to exchange him for several Republika Srpska army officers, but the 
offer was rejected.<P>

<strong>And Belgrade?</strong>: state-controlled press greeted his arrest and wrote that "Srebrov gained 14 pounds in jail," and that "he cannot return to Alija's [Izetbegovic, Bosnian president] Sarajevo, because he would be slaughtered, since they slaughter all Serbs there."  Serbian Writer's Association stated that Srebrov's arrest had been "hasty".  Out of all political parties in Serbia only the Serbian renewal Movement, Civic Association [Vesna Pesic's party] and Serbian Liberal party demanded his release from Dobrica Cosic, then the president of FR Yugoslavia.  Without success.<P>

<strong>How did he behave in jail?</strong>: In the few interviews he gave to the independent Belgrade media (Radio 92 and <em>Borba</em>) during his term 
in prison, he consistently refused to show remorse and continued to insist that Karadzic's SDS 
was leading Bosnian Serbs into a catastrophe. Consequences: three broken ribs and water in one knee.<P>

<strong> What did he say about his jailers?</strong>: "I completely understand them.  It was hard for them to listen to me in those times.  I was too well known and too independent in my thinking; consequently, I was dangerous for them." [He was recently released and now 
lives in Sarajevo.]<P>

<h1>A Party or a State?</h1>

<h3>by Gojko Beric, Oslobodenje-Svijet, Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 2/8/96</h3>

Two distinguished generals of the Bosnian Army have unexpectedly strengthened the leadership of the political party whose members they are.  Atif Dudakovic and Mehmed Alagic, commanders of the Fifth and the recently disbanded Seventh Corps, were elected last week to the SDA [Party of Democratic Action, the largest Bosnian Muslim party and the ruling party in Bosnia] Central Council.  Generals Fikret Muslimovic and Sakib Mahmuljin, the former a member of the Army Staff and the latter the commander of the Third Corps, are already in the leadership of the ruling party [SDA].  Only communists had more generals in their central committees.  General Dudakovic is a big disappointment for those who disagree with the involvement of soldiers in politics.  Those who do not support nation based and nationalist parties were also disappointed with general's decision.  It was widely held that this distinguished warrior was more of a Bosnian patriot [as opposed to being a Muslim, Croat or a Serb] rather then an exponent of the policy of the party whose member he is.  At times, I thought that he could turn into a Bosnian Simon Bolivar [South American George Washington].  Dudakovic has grown into a war legend.  Although it is unclear under which circumstances the general entered the party leadership, the very fact that he accepted the post affects his image.  As an old proverb says: "Think with your own head."<P>

It is natural that the political promotion of another two generals has caused new clashes on the topic of Army's involvement in politics.  The indoctrination of the Army was a topic for heated discussions a year ago in the Bosnian presidency.  Without mentioning the immediate reason (Alija Izetbegovic's address to the Seventh Muslim brigade in Zenica), Nijaz Durakovic, Stjepan Kljujic, Ivo Komsic, Tatjana Ljuic-Mijatovic and Mirko Pejanovic [non-SDA members of the Bosnian presidency] signed a common statement.  They distanced themselves from "the abuse of religion in some units of the Bosnian Army."  They even threatened to submit a collective resignation, but the whole thing was cleared up very quickly.<P>

It would be naive to expect that the Bosnian Army can be removed from all political interests.  Pacifists despise all uniforms, but the Army was the one to protect the Bosnian people and Bosnia from destruction.  It is true that the Bosnian Army hasn't won this war, but it hasn't lost it either.  The Army hasn't grown out of the state or religious institutions, but as a result of a more or less spontaneous resistance to the greater serbian invasion.  The flesh and blood of that effort were the Bosniaks [Bosnian Muslims], a people which for a third time in this century had a knife pressed against its throat.  Nevertheless, the universal character of that resistance comes from those Serbs and Croats who crossed to the side of the victim and turned the resistance in the struggle of good against evil.<P>

In the first phase of the war, the dark side of that resistance, at least as far as Sarajevo was concerned, came out of the twiglight zone.  Jusuf-Juka Prazina , the commander of several hundreds of volunteers, was given a rank of general by the state Presidency.  Juka defended and thoroughly looted besieged Sarajevo.  At the peak of his power, he could have, if he wanted, without any significant danger for himself arrested both the government and the Presidency, including Mr. Izetbegovic.  They were all afraid of Juka; that's why they made him a general.<P>

The rule of Musan Topalovic Caco followed;  Sarajevo residents will remember his terror for a long time.  Caco despised all those not carrying a rifle.  He militarized Sarajevo atmosphere to that extent that even those whose cousins and sons were important officials were afraid of every armed passerby.  This was most often used by those who hadn't fired a single bullet at the Chetniks [derogatory term for nationalist Serbs].  The smallest example of how they terrorized the population was visible in water lines.  They would come at the start of a line and shout:" Move away, I'm coming from the front!"  Collective silence was simply an expression of a mentality which had for years been formed under totalitarian authorities and a soldier boot.<P>

Circumstances have changed in the meantime.  Civilian authorities have more or less consolidated their hold on power; the war has stopped and the Army isn't any more an institution which intimidates politicians.  Nevertheless, an army is a powerful institution even in peace.  Even in the countries with parliamentary democracy, relations with military aren't always smooth.  Political history is full of examples of that kind.  Even one De Gaul, unquestionable political and moral authority in France, in the late sixties, had difficulties in controlling the generals who refused to end the war in Algiers.<P>

The control over an army is an imperative for every democratic authority.  Also, it is an imperative for every dictator.  Therefore, the nature of power determines the nature of control over a military force.  In the example of Josip Broz Tito [Yugoslav communist era ruler], we could have seen what it means when an army turns into a pretorian guard of a deity also known as the Leader.  Loyal to one man only, unnaturally large, privileged and indoctrinated, the former JNA [Yugoslav Peoples Army] broke all moral principles, betrayed all other peoples and sided with the most numerous one [the Serbs]. <P>

Regarding the Bosnian affairs, the necessity to establish and solidify control over the Army is undeniable.  The question is who should be in control.  Ejup Ganic sees the political promotion of Generals Dudakovic and Alagic as a most natural event:<P>

"Generals should help to map out of the further development of the state.  Fighting and dyeing is not their only role."<P>

The opposition doesn't agree.  It accuses the ruling party, whose political philosophy has a strong religious orientation, of militancy and militarisation; it claims that the ruling party wants to gain total control of the Army by including the two generals into the party leadership.<P>

At first glance, this is a multifaceted clash: between conservative and modern, totalitarianism and democracy, ethnic and multiethnic, theism and atheism and even different visions of patriotism.  There is a bit of everything in this.<P>

But since the politics is a double bottom suitcase, one should think of the most immediate motives.  The elections are coming.  The Army is not only a huge source of votes but also a great backdrop for election commercials.<P>

<h1>Defenseless Defense</h1>

<strong><em>by Kresimir Meler</em></strong><P>

<h2>Oslobodenje-Svijet, Sarajevo-Ljubljana, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 4/11/96</h2>

Tihomir Blaskic has arrived to the Hague.  With his arrival, after several 
months of haggling, the question whether the Croatian authorities will 
fulfill their obligations with respect to the international community and
extradite Croatian citizens indicted for war crimes to the Hague tribunal
for war crimes committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia has been
only partially resolved.<P>

The problems began when the Croatian authorities received from the Hague 
a rather unpleasant letter.  It contained a very detailed indictment against
the seven most influential members of HV(O) [HV stands for Croatian Army, 
while HVO stands for Croatian Defense Council, Bosnian Croat militia], and 
Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) of Bosnia-Hercegovina.<P>

The accusations, as we have found out, were very serious.  Tihomir Blaskic
was indicted because of the failure to prevent war crimes against the Muslim
village of Ahmici in the Lasva valley.  Both the Croatian authorities and 
the authorities of the so called Herceg-Bosna reacted very promptly.
At the beginning they expressed surprise "that the indictment against Blaskic 
and another six Bosnian Croats [has been] sent to Zagreb, since it is well known
that Croatia has nothing to do with him as he resides in Bosnia-Hercegovina 
at the moment".  Even the Croatian president got involved.  Seemingly bitter,
he kept stating that "Blaskic and company couldn't have committed war crimes 
since they were simply defending their homes and that Croatia, even if it wanted,
cannot deliver the accused to the Tribunal in the Hague since they are not
at the moment on the Croatian territory."<P>

<strong>Hypocritical statements</strong>:  Public appearances of other top
officials from the ruling party [in Croatia] followed the president's statement.
The president of the Croatian Supreme Court reached the summit of hypocrisy
when he stated: "In a defensive war it is impossible to commit war crimes.
We are talking about self defense, and self defense can never be a crime."<P>

It would have been fine if the Croatian authorities stopped after these strange
statements.  Unfortunately they went a step further.  Perhaps exalted
 with Blaskic's activities in Bosnia, the Croatian president pulled him from his
 position at the time in the (para)sate in "which he had no influence", and 
 appointed him to the position of the chief inspector of the Croatian Army.
 In addition to that, the Ministry of Defense awarded to Blaskic and Dario 
 Kordic (who had also been indicted for the crimes in the Lasva valley), perhaps
 as a reward, apartments in newly built buildings in Vukovar avenue, almost
 across the street from the Ministry of Internal Affairs [Police].  And while
 Croatia hasn't even considered extradition of Blaskic to the Hague, pro-government
 papers were raising a lot of noise because FR Yugoslavia was persistently refusing to 
 extradite its war criminals.  With open malice, the papers commented that
 "Milosevic is afraid to extradite the war criminals because their testimonies
 could result in his indictment."<P>

 Serbia was accused of hiding and, furthermore, celebrating war criminals; 
 the proof for that was the former major and today colonel Veselin Sljivicanin.
In that, the commentators "forgot" some tidbits: Croatia, not Serbia, was the first
one to call its criminals "heroes" and "fighters for national rights".
Tihomir Blaskic had been promoted before Sljivicanin, and unlike Sljivicanin,
Blaskic also received the protection.  Finally, Sljivicanin has been after Vukovar
on a relatively insignificant position, unlike Blaskic.  Even when Sljivicanin was 
transfered to Belgrade, he was given a new job at the Military Academy, which
is not a high position in the military hierarchy, regardless of the flashy
title of the principal.<P>

<strong>Inappropriate comparisons</strong>: in the meantime, as slowly as possible
and after numerous sharp rebukes from president Clinton, Warren Christopher and 
"traditional Croatian friends" from Germany, Croatian government began to work on the
so called constitutional law which was supposed to enable extradition of Blaskic to
the International Tribunal.  Of course, the authorities did not forget, not even 
for moment, to quote in the media under control of HDZ the statements of the
high officials of the Tribunal such as the one that "FR Yugoslavia is a criminal
state since it is refusing to extradite war criminals."<P>

It turned out that the truth is a relative notion for the government-controlled
media in Croatia.  Still the most interesting events were to follow: the constitutional
law regarding the cooperation of Croatia with the International Tribunal came
in front of the representatives in the Croatian Parliament. On the first day 
of the debate one of the representatives made an inappropriate comparison:
"To accuse Blaskic for war crimes is that same as accusing New York Police 
Department chief because on a particular night a certain number of murders occur
in Bronx!"  This comparison might stand if that police chief, as was the case
with Blaskic, was commanding those who had committed crimes and was responsible
for their actions.<P>

Then, Vice Vukojevic, the president of the legal committee in the Croatian 
parliament, demanded that "the lower house of the Parliament postpone 
the debate about the proposed Constitutional law until the Statute of
the International Tribunal for the war crimes in the territory of the former
Yugoslavia since 1991 and the tribunal's rules regarding the evidence and 
procedure are modified.  This request, which has been submitted by the 
Croatian government, concerns the modification of the rules according to which
the tribunal can only sentence the accused to those sentences existing
in the law of the states in which territory the crimes had been committed."
Brought to its absurd conclusion, this demand is equivalent to post-war
Germany demanding that it decide about the rules and procedures of the
Nurnberg tribunal in 1945.  It is questionable how much this would be in
the interest of Blaskic and company, since Bosnian laws prescribe harsher
punishment for war crimes, including death penalty.  It was also 
mentioned that "neither the UN charter, nor the Statute of the International
tribunal for War Crimes define who is an aggressor and what is a war crime;
and that is a very elastic category notion."  This is a blatant stupidity
since all that was defined at the Geneva Conference before World War II.<P>

<strong>Meticulous "treatment"</strong>: The statement of the Minister
of Justice, Miroslav Separovic, from the time when both 
Blaskic and Kordic had had apartments in Zagreb for a while and Blaskic 
was the chief inspector in the Croatian army demonstrates the extent 
of the cynicism of the  Croatian authorities: "I don't know where 
Blaskic and Kordic are at the moment, but I know that both of them
have legal representatives."  By the way, his ministry has found the defense
attorneys for both of them and has been paying the attorneys as well as
covering the cost of  Blaskic's defense from conditional freedom, which
amount to DM 230,000 per month.  If we add Separevic's endless wonder that
the international community "demands from Croatia, as well as from Serbia,
to extradite war criminals, although Croatia was a victim," the Croatian
authorities idea of the rule of law becomes even murkier.  Especially since
Blaskic is for a while a Croatian citizen and then he isn't.<P>

Finally, only a few days before Blaskic's departure to the Hague (supposedly
voluntary) which (by chance?) happened after the American Defense Secretary
William Perry's visit to Croatia, Croatian president attempted one more time
to blackmail the international community.  Without blinking he stated that
"the remaining accused are not in the Croatian territory but in Herceg-Bosna.
The resolution of their problem will depend on the solution of the problem
of others who took part in war clashes, both Serbs and Muslims."<P>

If the other statesmen behave in the same manner (why would they give up
"their" men while Tudman keeps his?) the justice will not prevail.  It
is exceptionally cynical that Tudman doesn't recognize the existence of 
the Federation in practice and claims for the people walking in front 
of his eyes that they are somewhere else.  Of all that, the most interesting
fact is that Croatia, in spite of promises that it will cooperate with the
tribunal, does everything in order not to extradite those Croats
most responsible for the crimes or to extradite them after a detailed 
"treatment".<P>

Do Croatian leaders adore international scandals, or are they afraid that 
a lot of dangerous evidence will surface in the Hague?<P>

<h1>Death to Democracy - Long Live Violence!</h1>

<strong><em>by Gojko Beric</em></strong><P>

<h2>Oslobodenje-Svijet, Sarajevo-Ljubljana, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 8/29/96</h2>

The last weeks of the election campaign in Bosnia-Hercegovina are developing 
as expected: as the election day (September 14) approaches
the conditions are becoming increasingly abnormal.  However, the referees who are formally
in charge of the current Bosnian nightmare, from Robert Frowick to Carl Bildt, do
not want to change anything.  "Only a new war, or God's will, can now stop 
these elections," specified Frowick.  Of course, God's will plays no part here;
in fact everything depends on the will of the USA government, and they've
had enough of Bosnia.  But that's an old story.  The goal of these elections
guided by Americans is to put Bosnia on its own feet.  That must happen sooner
or later.  Still, one wonders if it was necessary to try to urgently bring
 Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks to their senses by following the motto: Death to Democracy -
Long Live Violence!  I doubt that Americans would publicly promote this motto,
but they definitely keep the right not to limit their traditional
pragmatism in foreign policy.

The only significant value in these forced elections is that Bosnia-Hercegovina  will have to face itself, and each one of us will have to drop a few illusions.
The situation is, unfortunately, more than dark.  Only now one realizes how
much damage was produced by the war, on one hand, and the hypocrisy of
leading world powers on the other.  Hate and fear became the pilots of mass 
consciousness, and one can say that the victory of nationalist elites [in the
new elections] is certain.  The attempts by the opposition to disrupt their
plans testify more about the spiritual situation of the masses than about
the democratic struggle for power.  We are witnessing organized political
violence in which basic tools are handguns, clubs and knives.<P>

Ironically, former Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic was the first one to
experience the consequences of veering away from the collective opinion.
In Kladusa, populated exclusively by Bosniaks [Bosnian Muslims], he was 
brained with a wooden club.  Currently, United Opposition List for Bosnia-
Hercegovina, a multinational and multiparty coalition, is going through 
the most difficult trials.  Its members were at several instances prevented from
holding their pre-election rallies.  The ruling Party for Democratic Action
(SDA) is in power in all the places where that happened.  If its staunchest 
supporters, equipped with party banners and wooden clubs, shout that
Stjepan Kljujic and Ivo Komsic [Bosnian Croat politicians who support
unitary multi-ethnic Bosnia-Hercegovina] are Ustashe, Bogic Bogicevic
[ethnic Serb politician, last Bosnian representative in the collective
presidency of the former Yugoslavia; supports unitary, multi-ethnic
Bosnia-Hercegovina] a Chetnik and Zlatko Lagumdzija and Nijaz Durakovic
[Bosnian Muslim opposition politicians] traitors, than we have a tragic
misunderstanding.<P>

What are the roots of this misunderstanding?  Are they in the ideology of 
SDA or in the political ignorance of people isolated in the sacred space of
their own religion, their own blood and soil.  Maybe those people have a
vision of the future Bosnia, but that vision can only be harmful for Bosnia
or impossible to implement.  After the incident in Gradacac where the candidates
of the United Opposition List  were physically assaulted, the head of Gradacac
municipality, Safko Mesanovic, reacted by sending a letter to <em>Oslobodenje</em> 
in which he unintentionally reveals his political philosophy: "While many are 
discussing the future of Bosnia I have to take care of Bosnia today".  Mr. 
Mesanovic adds that Gradacac managed to defend itself from the Chetniks
without help from outside, which is well known in the rest of Bosnia; hence
he probably wants to say that the city is capable of defending itself from other evils,
such as democracy.<P>

In one of his last reports, Robert Frowick, OSCE chief for the elections
in Bosnia-Hercegovina, warns about the intransigence of local power brokers
in Capljina, Bugojno, Drvar, Sanski Most and Stolac ([Muslim-Croat] 
Federation territory), and in Doboj, Lopare, Teslic and Zvornik which belong
to the Republic of Srpska.  The American diplomat  accuses the authorities 
in these municipalities of limiting the freedom of movement, return of 
refugees, freedom of media and freedom for political activity.  Electronic 
media in the Republic of Srpska are engaged in ideological terrorism against 
their own population, promoting totalitarianism and discouraging dissent.  "Today, more
than ever, Karadzic is our leader," says one of the editors at the Srpska 
state controlled television.  He continues: "Besides, all of us here are
'Karadzics'".  Thus, he establishes the public measure for nationalism,
below which no one running for power dares to go.  If someone tries,
there are those who will "bring him to his senses".<P>

Ethnically divided, Bosnia is today rotting from inside.  All those who desire
to base life in Bosnia on national, religious and cultural divisions are taking
part in this process, although they used to be full of talk about [tolerant 
and multi-cultural] Bosnia that all of us remember.  How is it possible that
ten centuries of Bosnian history were erased from their memory in such a 
short time?<P>

Three ruling parties quietly agreed to push forward with the elections.  Although
there are significant differences among them, their ultimate goal is the same:
to stay in power at any cost.  Not only because of the attraction of power as such,
but because staying in power delays the problem of responsibility of national 
leaders [for the war].  As long as that question is not raised by a sufficient
number of their subjects, each one of the national leaders will live convinced
that he and he only is the saviour of his own nation.  Still, they will have
to face their responsibility sooner or later.  The question here is whether
the people can hold out longer without bread or without nationalism.  Anything
is possible.<P>

One shouldn't forget that the rise of Nazism started with organized incidents
in German beer halls, schools and squares.  Instead of Nazi bullies, the Police
mistreated and persecuted their victims.  The election campaign testifies that
Bosnia is at the verge of taking the same course.  Today, all three police
forces in Bosnia are under control of corresponding political parties, because
the state, as such, doesn't exist.  Only naive and stupid can expect that in
such circumstances police can be on the side of citizens.  Therefore, Serb, 
Croat and Bosniak policemen mind their own business.  They know very well 
that they will not be punished because they failed to protect the assaulted
citizen of "other" nationality.<P>

The Serb Democratic Party (SDS) has since its inception been set up as a terrorist
organization, armed and prepared for a war of conquest.  Threats, rapes,
concentration camps and ethnic cleansing were the essence of its programme.
The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) has had all the characteristics of a militaristic
organization since its founding.  Although at first it didn't have a clear 
political programme later, during the war against the Bosniaks, it used the
same methods as Karadzic.  The practice of political assassination was made 
official after the murder of Blaz Kraljevic.  The executions are allegedly
the monopoly of the Mostar Mafia, controlled by Mladen Naletic Tuta.  Sources
from Mostar claim that during this summer Tuta twice tried to kill Jadranko
Topic, well known former soccer player and one of the leaders of the HDZ in
Mostar at the start of the war.  Naturally, orders arrive from the "headquarters"
in another state.<P>

Unlike these two parties, the Party of Democratic Action (SDA) appeared on
the political scene as a populist movement, lacking clear ideology, unless
we take into account its rather strong religious character.  However,
squeezed between two fascistoid parties, with time it rejected democratic
ideas as an unnecessary burden.  If after the September elections there 
are no serious guarantees that Bosnia-Hercegovina will survive, SDA will
probably more and more resemble SDS and HDZ. So far it is not clear whether
the actual goal of the leading Bosniak party is the return of the lost
territories or the renewal of the multi-ethnic society in Bosnia.<P>

The paradox is that the opposition democratic parties are the strongest 
ally of SDA in its struggle to reintegrate Bosnia-Hercegovina; unfortunately
SDA does not see them as compatible and this coalition is definitively a
thing of the past.  Instead, SDA signed a "fair-play agreement" with HDZ,
according to which they "will allow each other to campaign in their 
respective territories".  As this is a natural democratic right, this
agreement cannot be taken as a sign of sudden embrace of democracy by the
two parties.

<h1>Female Side of War</h1>

<strong><em>by Jelena Grujic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vreme, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 12/4/95</h2>

One hundred and fifty testimonials by women about the war have been collected 
in the study "Women, violence and war"; the women are today in different 
situations, of different age, different marital status, education and experience. 
The only common thread is that all of them are refugees.  "The basic idea was
to describe the invisible, female, side of the war.  The strongest impression
after reading of the study is that every violent disruption of living (normal
state  of things) is experienced as violence.  This encompasses both the experiences 
from the war and those experienced later as refugees," says Vesna Nikolic-Ristanovic,
one of the authors of the book which was published by the Institute for 
criminological research with financial assistance from the Soros Fund.  
Her coauthors are Natasa Mrvic-Petrovic, Slobodanka Konstantinovic-Vilic and 
Ivana Stevanovic, all three members of the European movement in Serbia's group
for women's rights.<P>

Significant difference between male and female experiences in connection with 
violence is based on the fact that the essence of armed struggle  lies in
the struggle for power in which men and women participate in different ways.
For public, rapes are synonymous with with the violence against women;
sexual violence can also be taken as a symbol of a war.  However, women suffer
from additional types of torture: they are murder victims, suffer from malnourishment,
fear, psychological and physical mistreatment.  They also suffer because of
the loss of or forced separation from their children, husband, relatives,
different types of discrimination and violence in exile.  Even when she is
not physically hurt, a woman can suffer severe psychological consequences.
"Aren't manipulations with women and children refugees also a type of
violence?  Isn't it violence when you have to queue to buy milk, when 
you wait for a blackout to end, when you are cold?  When you have to  
go from one state official to another and cannot accomplish anything?"<P>

<strong>SEXUAL AND PHYSICAL VIOLENCE</strong>: Nevertheless, for the majority 
of women, the first association with violence was sexual and related physical
violence.  Vesna Nikolic-Ristanovic explains this by "not only the nature
of this crime as the most specific and one of the most severe types of violence
against women in general, but also the strong media campaign which followed 
the cases of rape in the war and which in practice made rape synonymous with
violence against women."  In the interview for <em>Vreme</em> she says that 
because of that the authors chose to avoid using statistics in the book.
"Regardless whether one talks about Belgrade, Zagreb or Sarajevo, rapes 
were promoted in order to achieve certain goals.  There was no protection 
for women.  They were used for political means.  We know that certain 
foreign journalists used to visit refugee camps and inquire whether among
the refugees there were raped women who spoke English."

Vesna Nikolic-Ristanovic believes that the manipulations with the number 
of raped women are usually counterproductive as far as the attitude of
the public with the respect to the problem is concerned.  "If one were
to speak about a smaller number of raped Muslim women, that meant that
one was trying to deny the guilt of the Serb side, while if one were
to reveal a smaller, again more realistic, number of raped Serb women,
that was usually greeted with ironic questions: 'Only that many?' and
'What is that compared with thousands of raped Muslim women?'  It is hard 
to avoid the impression that certain circles are sad that the number
of raped women is not larger, so that they can use the women as a 
cover for their attitudes and actions."<P>

"A group of Muslim soldiers broke into the apartment of a girl who 
worked for  IRS.  They tortured her, beat her, all of them raped her
and finally pushed a bottle into her vagina.  The girl died from the
received injuries.  By the way, she was very pretty and well known 
in Sarajevo because of her public criticism of Muslim authorities and
the current events," testifies Lepa.  Cruelty of rape is amplified in war
with the fact that in the eyes of the rapist the victim often symbolizes
the enemy.  In accordance with patriarchal values, women are viewed
as the property of the enemy - a man.  Therefore, we can view rape
as a final symbolic expression of the humiliation of the enemy.  On the other
hand the society has a hard time in accepting raped women: "Her husband
who had been raised patriarchally, told my brother that he had a hard time
accepting that his wife had been raped although he knew that it wasn't
her fault," says Gordana.  She testifies about rapes motivated by revenge: in   
Deretelj, Croatian jail for Serbs and Muslims, a woman, a physician and an educator, 
" was exposed to extreme torture because they were 'impressed' by her status
and education (other prisoners were mostly young women).  The physician, an
38-years-old Serb, had been raped several times a day and told that she wouldn't
be released until she gave birth to an Ustasha.  Fortunately she didn't conceive...
She was raped by people whom she had helped hundreds of times in the past."<P>

<strong>MILENA, EMINA, BLAZENKA</strong>:

The authors explore the use of rape in ethnic cleansing, and demonstrate its strong links with the patriarchal culture: women is considered to be an object, a "vessel" which passively accepts male seed and doesn't add anything to it.  "Milena, we have to procreate Balije children," a Muslim soldier responds to Milena's plea to enter the room and save her friend who is being raped by the soldier's friend.  The authors emphasize that this is a war crime of forced pregnancy which still hasn't been defined by the international community nor by the International tribunal for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia:" to feel the rapist's child in your womb and be convinced that everyone will know that this is a child of the enemy, and to know at the same time that the child is yours
as well is one of the most cruel types of torture of women in war.  Rapists are
also telling to the husbands of the raped women that they [the women] are worthless since they are giving birth to the children of their enemies.  The most horrible thing is that the husbands really feel that way."<P>

The book also says that, besides prostitution as a strategy for survival which some of the women used in order to protect themselves from the loss of dignity,  some women were forced to accept sexual blackmail and humiliations in order to realize some of their rights, to leave a besieged city, join their children in exile etc.  Emina tells a story about a cousin who, in order to obtain a permit to leave Mostar, had to have sex with a Croat who issued the permits.  He told her that he wouldn't let her go until she gave birth to an Ustasha, although he was aware that she had three children.  He let her leave Mostar when she was in the fourth month of her pregnancy.  She doesn't want to give birth to that child and is afraid that her children, brother and the rest of the family will reject her.  She is afraid that her husband will tell her: "You came here to give birth to an Ustashe bastard."<P>

Physical maltreatment and murders of women in war have basically the same motives as sexual maltreatment.  However, through analysis of the testimonies the authors detected a discrepancy between the rape as a war tactics and individual physical assaults and murders of the women compatriots.  On one hand women are forced to bear the children who will belong to the rapist's nation while on the other hand their children are murdered in order to cause suffering.  The authors also mention examples in which, in the middle of an ethnic conflict, women married to men of different ethnicity become victims of their husbands and because of their husbands.  "Croatian Guardsmen broke into the apartment of a woman, a Croat, whose husband was a Serb and an officer.  They threw her out of the apartment, together with her children.  They dragged her to the building entrance where she was tortured.  The guardsmen cut off her arms, one for her husband and the other one for the husband's brother.  The children ended up in hospital after that," testifies Blazenka.<P>

<strong>HATE BECAUSE OF A HUSBAND</strong>: Hate towards wives of military personnel, as the consequence of resentment towards the Yugoslav Peoples Army, was expressed with cruelty regardless of the nationality or actual military involvement of the male members of a family.  Slobodanka Konstatinovic-Vilic in the chapter about psychological violence explains that in Slovenia armed phase of the civil war was preceded by a long period of special war which was directed towards the members of the Army and their families.  "My husband is a
YPA officer, an ethnic Serb who has spent all his life in Slovenia.  I am by birth Slovenian, without a doubt a member of the aryan Slovenian nation.  I've had a horrible time during the preparations for war, attacks on Serbs, YPA and maltreatment because I was a wife of an officer.  I suffered terribly, for example when they showed the picture of my husband on TV with titles saying that he was a Serb Chetnik [derogatory term for Serbs, World War II Royalist Serb partisans] and gave his full name," says Katja.<P>

The women who participated in the study emphasized that they also experienced violence in exile.  Those women who hadn't  established themselves as independent personalities, but had based their identity on the fact that they were "somebody's wives" had the hardest time.  Separation from their families hit especially hard those women who were in mixed marriages - they had betrayed their own nation while failing to establish a corresponding position among the husband's compatriots.  Women suffer because of being in a passive position, being torn between the need to express solidarity with the loved ones who stayed in the war stricken region and taking care for the future of their children.  Long term separation brings alienation in husband-wife relationships and the relationship between parents and children.  "I had to ask my husband to turn of the light when I started to take my clothes off, before going to bed at night; I had a feeling that I was taking clothes off in front of a stranger.  I felt the need to be courted again by my husband in order to gradually achieve the former intimacy," says Metka.<P>

In exile, women are faced with impoverishment, which is especially troublesome for those who had been wealthy before the war: "this status is worse than fear.  There, I was afraid for my life, that I would be killed; here, I am afraid that I will die because of poverty, uncertainty," says Mirjana.<P>

A large number of women are forced to suffer various humiliations because of their poverty: "My boss was flattered when I would make and serve coffee to him and his friends.  He boasted to his friends: I have an employee, a woman with the Masters of Arts degree in economics, and she prepares coffee for me."  The authors mention that employers, landlords, directors of refugee centers, Red Cross employees sometimes use their position to blackmail and harass refugees.  "Women made ends meet in any possible way, some of them engaged in prostitution.  All kinds of things happened.  I also lost some sort of my dignity.  That man, a widower, also asked me to go with him to Vojvodina.  I know a woman who got married, left a husband who is still alive in Zenica [in Bosnia-Hercegovina].  Women loose their dignity.  Poor and sad were those women who were in Perucac [refugee center in western Serbia] and had sex for ten eggs.  They had to; I found an excuse for them: they had to when a child said 'I'm hungry!'"<P>

Talking about future, most women emphasized that the biggest help would be a job in their profession.  The authors state that this would be a first step towards the new environment and the old status and away from hard psychological crises.  Women suffered in this war from several types of violence although they did not want this war to happen.<P>

Because of that they have a full moral right to demand from the host country and the international community to provide conditions in which their and their children's future will be secure and better than today.<P>

<h1>Idiots Have No Idea!: Interview with Dr. Miodrag Zivanovic, the president of the Liberal Party in Banja Luka</h1>
 
<strong><em>by Davor Glavas</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, 3/11 1996</h2>

Doctor <strong> Miodrag Zivanovic</strong>, a professor at the Philosophy faculty in Banja Luka, the founder and president of The Liberal party, is often mentioned as the only "real" opponent for the ruling political team, and not only in the Banja Luka region.  This interview took place at the party headquarters, in the center of Banja Luka.  Heating was not working ("bandits carried away the pipes from the city heating plant") and the darkness was imminent: a regular blackout was expected any minute.<P>

<strong>What have you, as a party, done, I'll use your own words, to reduce the invoice of evil in this city?</strong><P>

I believe that we have succeeded to bring back to the people at least a small bit of trust in reason, that we have, at least by a little, removed everpresent fear.<P>

<strong>Fear of what?</strong><P>

Fear of repressive methods which the local regime has used and is still using against the people.  Actually, I should say against its own people, since after the completed ethnic cleansing, we are here ethnically homogeneous. An entity, as that is called these days.<P>

<strong>How much influence does your party have?  Are we talking about mostly local influence?</strong><P>

It is a paradox, but our influence is much stronger abroad, within international institutions and bodies, then here.  The local media are inaccessible for us, the communications are extremely difficult and we simply are not able to conduct a wide reaching political campaign.  Our policy boiled down to moral appeals: it is well known that on several occasions we demanded that <strong>Karadzic</strong> and <strong>Krajisnik</strong> be replaced; actually the emphasis was on Krajisnik because we think that he bears more responsibility.<P>

<h2>Krajisnik to the Hague</h2>

<strong>Why do you hold him more responsible?</strong><P>

I would say that Karadzic was more like a Minister of Foreign Affairs, at least until the decisions of the International Tribunal in the Hague, while here Krajisnik was firmly in control.  He has been in control since the beginning of the war.  He is the president of the Parliament, he controls the media, economy, police.  He should be indicted for war crimes.  He has done the most against the interests of his own people.<P>

<strong>What is Koljevic's position in the trio Karadzic-Krajisnik-Koljevic?  Is it true that his power base is here in Banja Luka?</strong><P>

I wish to respond as a private person, and then as a politician.  As a human being I believe that none of the top officials, <strong>Krajisnik, Karadzic, Koljevic, Plavsic</strong> etc., has any moral rights to lead this people and that time has come for them to face us and explain how they pushed us  into this tragedy.   As a politician I accept speculations that one of them, at least at first, should stay because of continuity, easier transfer of authority.  I agree that Koljevic could take that role, although even he is responsible for everything that has befallen this people.<P>

<strong>What do you mean by that: "everything that has befallen this people"?</strong><P>

War, death, wounded youth, ethnic cleansing, family tragedies.  Our families have been destroyed, marital beds divided.  We have returned, based on the ideology of blood and soil, myths, on totally irrational bases, to the long gone past.  This leadership managed to place the whole people in a retrograde time-machine.<P>

<strong>How did they do it?</strong><P>

Through perfidious use of irrational motives; this is a well tested way to influence masses.  People were convinced that World War II hadn't finished and that this generation was predestined to conclude the last war, still fighting against the Ustashe and Balije.  The church took part in this, bones were carried around and blessed, the past was mythicized.  The basis was in the absolute authority of the nation and national power.  The nation was raised above everything else and our human living reduced to our ethnicity, which is only one of human characteristics.<P>

<h2>Even a Horse Committed Suicide</h2>

<strong>In your printed material you use the term "republic Srpska".  What does it mean for you?  Is it a state, a temporary entity , something else?</strong><P>

It hasn't been formally defined so far.<P>

<strong>But, what does it mean to you?</strong><P>

It should be a part of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  I would prefer if it became a region within the state.  The idea that the national question is automatically solved once a nation obtains its own state is one of the greatest illusions of the nationalists.  On the contrary, we in Banja Luka cannot survive unless we open up towards Croatia, towards the sea, towards our geographical hinterland.  If we remain the way we are now, within a statelet, we will irrevocably die off.  The Vrbas valley has more value to us than some Pale.<P>

<strong>If you were to go to Pale tomorrow and meet Karadzic, what would you say to him?</strong><P>

Nothing.  One can not talk to a man like him.  He needs a psychiatrist, not a philosopher.<P>

<strong>Do you expect changes after the forthcoming elections?</strong><P>

I will reply by telling a story.  Before the 1990 elections, the Communists had a pre-election meeting; the leader of the party was supposed to address voters.  Before the start of the meeting, <strong>Nijaz Durakovic</strong>, then the leader of the Communists, had to go to the bathroom.  An SDS [Serb Democratic Party, ruling party in Republic Srpska] member, then still an SDS agent in the Communist league, locked him in the bathroom, and went out in front of the voters and explained that "comrade Durakovic is drunk and the meeting is adjourned."  That is our democracy.  Mafia in power will do everything it can in order to stay in power; I don't have any reasons to believe that anything will change in the future.<P>

<strong>Where do we go from here?  Some believe that Bosnia has to go through another war catharsis in order to find itself?</strong><P>

We have reached the bottom.  I realized that, please excuse my example, when I was a soldier on the Vlasic mountain.  The terrain there is so hard that there is no vehicle that can get to the top.  Vlasic command had a horse which carried food to the soldiers up the mountain.  One morning I saw the horse at the edge of an abyss.  For two hours he stood at the edge and stared in front of himself.  It looked as he were thinking.  Then he jumped.  He didn't slip, didn't fall.  He jumped, committed suicide.  What can be said about us, then?  I don't believe in another war; none of us has strength for that.  We are all dead tired.<P>

<h2>Amputated Life</h2>

<strong>What is the life in Banja Luka like these days?</strong><P>

One lives with a feeling that everything, all suffering, destruction was unnecessary.  Banja Luka has been destroyed as a city.  Before the war, the Serbs were just over one half of the population in Banja Luka, the rest were Croats and Muslims.  Today, a half of the prewar urban Serb population remains and I don't even want to talk about the number and the destiny of the Croats and Muslims.  Only a fourth of the prewar urbanized population remains.  This war has brought at first physical and then spiritual isolation.  Ethnic cleansing destroyed the basis of the common living, destroyed the treasure of coexistence
and interconnectedness which had been cultivated for centuries.<P>

Departure of citizens and the arrival of refugees resulted in the domination of the rural factor, dissolution of the middle class and its values; everything one refers to as urban spirit.  One of the crazed nationalists suggested that the name of Banja Luka be changed to Serb Palanka [provincial town], not realizing how appropriate he was in his primitive cynicism.  Today the city economy operates on 8-10% of its prewar level.  Salaries are DM 20 to 30, and even that mostly in coupons.  We have public kitchens, but don't regularly have heating, electricity and water.  Before the war we had 17 mosques, today there is none.  They were destroyed and the idiots still don't understand that it is not enough to build new minarets to bring back the richness of common living.<P>

<strong>If you had an opportunity to talk to one of your exiled and displaced friends, what would you say to them?</strong><P>

That my life has been amputated with their departure.  That I will greet them as friends and that I beg them for one more sacrifice: to return to the city which in the foreseeable future cannot provide living worthy of a human being.<P>

<h1>Party With Hitler: Interview with Stjepan Kljuic, a member of the Bosnian Presidency</h1>
 
<strong><em>by Senka Kurtovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, 11/27 1995</h2>

   
<h2>Compromise</h2>

Imagine that the allies in 1945 set at the table with Hitler and signed an agreement.  This is a painful compromise, especially because of the numerous victims; not only the dead, disabled nor the persecuted and expelled persons: the victims are those who have supposedly survived this war.<P>

<h2>Loosers</h2>

The war has ended, but what is there anything good in that for the citizens of Bosnia-Hercegovina?  Maybe that Bosnia-Hercegovina lost its statehood in an American airforce base on November 21?  Or that the sanctions against FR Yugoslavia will be suspended?  No one has gained with the Dayton peace agreement, not even the Karadzic Serbs.  The greatest victims are, however, the Croats in Bosnia who have lost both the population and important regions in which they had been the pillar of the Bosnian spirit.<P>

<h2>Snipers</h2>

Posavina is probably the richest region of Bosnia-Hercegovina and also a strategically important region for Crotia.  Because of that, it matters who is a neighbor to Croatia.  I know how this will end: Croatian fishermen are wrong if they hope to fish in the Sava river.  Those from the other, "serb", side will shoot at them from sniper rifles.  Then it will be published in the papers that "several fishermen from Croatia have been killed; perpetrators unknown."<P>

<h2>Division</h2>

Croats have lost the central Bosnia and are now given an opportunity to move into the homes of those who were expelled from Grahovo, Glamoc, Drvar [Serb majority towns in western Bosnia]...  They have received a flier which calls on them to populate those territories.  That is an intentional exchange of territory.  The fact that the fertile and rich Posavina was exchanged for a traditionally undeveloped region says enough about the "success" of that deal.  I understood everything on that "painful day" in February 1992 when I left HDZ.  I told then to Ika Stanic: "If Bosnia-Hercegovina is divided, your family home, your office and your wife's stores will be on the Serb side."  I was right.<P>

<h2>Zubak</h2>

I don't know whether the president of the Muslim-Croat Federation had become a servant of the Zagreb [Croatian] regime or the traitor of the Bosnian Croats, as he has told me recently. Perhaps I am the only man in the world who can understand Zubak.  I don't know what he did in Dayton, nor whether he took part in the sale of the territory.  That is because I was never a member of similar delegations nor took part in negotiations like these.  Croats in Bosnia-Hercegovina have been so wronged that this time reminds me of 1699, when Eugene of Savoy burned down Bosnia.  Behind him remained only 26 Catholic monks and 17,500 Croats.  A lot of time and patience was needed for expelled Croats to come back.  And a lot will be needed now, even more now since the Bosnian Croat political leadership is absolutely disorganized.<P>

<h2>On Being Croatian</h2>

All political structures with prefix "Croat" are tragic.  It is tragic that the Zagreb policy was not a support to Bosnian Croats but a handicap.  After the signing of the Washington agreement, Bosnian Croats had a chance to reintegrate into Bosnia-Hercegovina with dignity.  But they didn't!  They should have had a firm attitude that they loved Croatia but that Bosnia was their homeland.<P>

<h2>Deal</h2>

In the Dayton negotiations it was obvious that the agreement between presidents Milosevic of Serbia and Tudman of Croatia was followed when Posavina was concerned.  That's what I've been told.  Milosevic, when he was pushed into a corner, said: "please, we have already agreed about this."  He made a good deal, got rid of undeveloped regions and gained rich Posavina.<P>

<h2>Tudman</h2>

When I met Tudman for a first time he asked me if I was willing to work for our cause.  I said: "You know, Mister, I've been working for our cause for 35 years already."  But I didn't want to be somebody's tool.  If I wanted, I could have been closer both to the Communists and the new lot than Smiljko Sagolj [author of both old (Communist) and new (HDZ) election laws in Croatia].  I used my own head, and the Bosnian Croats will have to do the same.  They must understand that they belong to Bosnia-Hercegovina.  Where they used their own, instead of somebody else's head they have protected both their honor and their possessions.<P>

<h2>Zagreb</h2>

Zagreb has made two mistakes: it did not return our love and did not have enough knowledge.  That way, the long tradition of the independence of the Bosnian Croats has been interrupted.  We should not reject Zagreb.  The regime in Zagreb should be our support, guarantor, protector.  But, if for the freedom of Knin and eastern Slavonia, we had to loose Posavina or central Bosnia, then I am against that regime.<P>

<h2>Applauses</h2>

Croatia has become a step mother to the Bosnian Croats.  Even worse than that.  But the Croat people in Bosnia bears some responsibility as well.  All Croats in Bosnia will have to be involved in politics until they die.  If they can applaud, but they don't see what their leaders are doing, then they deserve to bear the consequences.<P>

<TITLE>Commentary of Bosnian Election Results from Oslobodenje</TITLE>

<h1>No Change</h1>

<strong><em>by Vlastimir Mijovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Oslobodenje-Svijet, Sarajevo-Ljubljana, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 9/25/96</h2>

The results of the September 14 Bosnian elections haven't surprised anyone.
They certainly didn't surprise voters who had made their decision a long time ago. 
Nationalist zeal is still a dominant emotion and the victory of
the nationalist parties was the most likely outcome.  Still, a few dared to fantasize
about possible different outcomes, not realizing that this election had 
nothing to do with programs, policies, parties and their leaders and everything
to do with the voter's state of mind.  In Bosnia-Hercegovina, in both
entities and all three national communities,  people are still barricaded in
their national strongholds; they are convinced that the existing huge problems will
be easier to solve in three-party inter-ethnic talks in which each nation will
be represented by one party only.<P>

Our people is intelligent.  They've seen how things had been solved recently, 
who was supported by the omnipotent international community.  It has been
suggested to the voters from all sides, except for a small part of opposition 
supporters to organize along ethnic lines and vote for only one party, and 
they realized what they were supposed to do.  Consequently, three national
parties, SDA [leading Bosnian Muslim party], SDS [leading Bosnian Serb party]
and HDZ [leading Bosnian Croat party], received the largest number of votes.<P>

The whole process went without a glitch: everyone kept to the previously
written script.  There was a little bit of excitement about some lass important
matters, just enough to make the election somewhat interesting.<P>

<strong>Presidential Thriller</strong>: We witnessed a veritable small thriller
in the contest for the three places in the new Bosnian presidency.  True, 
Izetbegovic, Krajisnik and Zubak had no problems to win the majority of votes, 
each in his own ethnic community, but this part of the elections suddenly
became immensely important because of the race for the Chairman of the Presidency,
who will represent Bosnia until 1998.  For Bosniaks and other citizens of Bosnia-
Hercegovina who had a role of victims during the war, this was the most important
contest; fortunately, Izetbegovic again became "first among equals".<P>

The excitement would have been even greater if the voters knew before the
election that the first presidential mandate would not last 8 months as
they were led to believe.
If they did know, we are certain that a run-off between Izetbegovic, Zubak
and Krajisnik would have been necessary, since each one of them would have
won 99,99% of votes.  People would have gathered behind their national representative
in proportions much higher than recorded anywhere else in the democratic
world.  Each nation would have done that because of its specific reasons:
Bosniaks because it would have been humiliating for them to have either
Krajisnik or Zubak as a president.  The former one because he owes the worst
possible debt to the Bosniaks - debt of blood.  Zubak, because as a Federation
president he clearly demonstrated that he was incapable to represent all
people living on the Federation territory.<P>

The promotion of Krajisnik for the President of Presidency was important for the 
Serbs from the [Serb] entity as a way to mock the idea of the common state and
common government and turn the tragedy which they had produced into a farce
in which they would be the ones with the last laugh.  Croats homogenized around
Zubak (and they would have done it in even greater numbers if they knew that the two year
mandate was up for grabs) in order to paralyse the most important potentials
of Bosnia-Hercegovina through this former inhabitant of Doboj.<P>

<strong>Mandate as a Favor</strong>: Someone deceived all of us in the race 
for the Presidency members.  We believe that in a rotating presidency 
(three times 8 months) it wouldn't  matter who was first and who
last in the line for the top post.  International Community Representatives,
as the interpreters of the Dayton Agreement, on numerous occasions prior to
the election clearly stated that the first mandate would be divided in three
parts.  For example this was stated by Holbrooke, Bildt, Kornblum and even
domestic participants in the Dayton negotiations.  They misled the voters
and the candidates as well.  It seems that the decision about the two year 
mandate was brought ad hoc, once Frowick and his staff knew the election 
results.<P>

With this decision, which was most likely not made in Dayton in November 1995, but in 
Sarajevo, in September 1996, the international community finally did a favor to
the Bosniak people and its political representatives.  It is possible that
the compliance of Croats and Serbs was paid by undisclosed concessions,
but that is not necessarily the case.  Still, it is significant that Krajisnik
and Zubak have no objections regarding the sudden threefold increase in the
duration of the first Presidential mandate.<P>

There will be more battles about the Presidency, but that's a different story
which doesn't have much to do with the elections.<P>

<strong>Liberal Fiasco</strong>:  These elections are also interesting because
of the debacle of the opposition parties in the Federation, although the results
of the opposition parties in the Serb entity are also rather unimpressive.  The opposition
fared the worst in the Croat para-state but, on the other hand, it could be 
considered a success that the opposition parties ran in Herceg-Bosna since
until recently there was no opposition on that territory.  Hence the assertion
about the failure mostly concernes the opposition parties based in Sarajevo.<P>

Within that circle only the United List has been successful, actually SDP and
UBSD as the strongest parties in that coalition.  They will be represented at almost
all levels of legislative authority, in some instances with a highly respectable
number of deputies: for example in the federal parliament they will have about
10 deputies.  This coalition has done well having in mind their rather confused
program which was the result of a coalition of parties with significantly
different political orientation.  The succour came in the guise of well known,
and well respected personalities who, via the United List for Bosnia-Hercegovina,  
managed to break through to the places where decisions will be made in the future.<P>

Liberal parties from Sarajevo and the territory under the control of the Bosnian
Army were the greatest losers in these elections.  Both Rasim Kadic [Liberal Party]
and Dr. Muhamed Filipovic [Muslim Bosniak Organization] ignominiously failed
in these elections.  Tiny percentage of votes won in the September elections can 
endanger their chances of running in the next elections (although they are hoping for
a victory in 1998!)  Rasim Kadic and his political team should carefully analyse
the reasons for their failure, and the public should regret that a politician
of Kadic's stature will not serve in the Parliament.<P>

The results of Silajdzic's Party for Bosnia-Hercegovina can also be characterized as
a failure.  It turned out that it was not even close to competing with SDA
as had been planned at its founding.  In the national corner of the Bosniak heart
there's only enough space for one party and one leader.  On the other hand,
Silajdzic didn't succeed in spreading his support among the members of
other nationalities who, besides love for their nation, carry in their heart love
for their homeland, Bosnia-Hercegovina.<P>

Something strange happened with Silajdzic and his party.  They led a very shy 
election campaign, and demonstrated a fear of direct political 
competition against SDA.  Even Silajdzic, in his race against "the father of 
the nation", didn't try to use any one of the advantages he had.  Still, he
didn't pull out of the campaign and stayed in the race until the end; then,
he was probably relieved that he hadn't taken enough votes from Izetbegovic
to allow Krajisnik or Zubak to win the post of the Chairman of the Presidency.<P>

The Party for Bosnia-Hercegovina has gone through a debacle, but that does not
mean the end of Silajdzic's political career.  SDA and Izetbegovic will probably
find an important post for Silajdzic in the Federation government or in the government
of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  For now, Izetbegovic and Silajdzic were photographed
together after the announcement of the official election results.<P>  

Fiasco of Spahic's citizens, Omersoftic's women, Halilovic's patriots and the
Party of Economic Prosperity also contributed to the impoverishment of the 
political scene in Sarajevo.  The Party of Economic Prosperity (SPP) had claimed before the
elections some hundred thousand members who, it turned out, didn't vote for their party.
Actually, now it is obvious that this was a lie of SPP leadership.  Had these
alleged hundred thousand members voted for SPP, it would have been the second
largest party in the Federation, immediately behind SDA.<P>

The results of the September election bring us back to 1990.  It is not hard to
agree with president Izetbegovic that the circumstances are different.  The 
sum of same components is not always the same, especially if the two summations
are separated by six bloody years.  Therefore, there doesn't have to be another war. 
Unfortunately, with such nationalist political teams, especially Serb and Croat
ones, one can not hope for peace and comfortable living.<P>

<h1>What is Steiner Ashamed of?</h1>

<h2>Oslobodenje-Svijet, Sarajevo-Ljubljana, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 6/27/96</h2>

Last week, deputy high representative of the international 
community in Bosnia-Hercegovina, ambassador Michael Steiner,  harshly criticized the authorities
in Sarajevo bringing up the alleged violations of the human rights
of Serbs who had remained in the reintegrated parts of the city.
The interview, which Steiner gave to journalist Amra Kebo and which was published
in two parts in <em>Oslobodenje</em> [daily], provoked strong reactions and
initiated discussions about this "hot" topic.<P>

We decided to reprint parts of that interview together with the reactions from
prominent Sarajevo politicians.<P>

Steiner started the interview with these words: I am ashamed for Sarajevo. 
I am personally ashamed because I have promised to the Sarajevans of Serb
nationality, doctors for example, that they would be able to keep their jobs.
I saw, however, that two weeks after the transfer of authority [from the
Republic of Srpska to the Federation] in Ilidza, a pediatrician to whom I promised
that he would be able to keep his job, was fired.  The events which are taking 
place in the parts of the city which have been transferred under the Federation 
jurisdiction are shameful for this city.  I wonder why President Izetbegovic
doesn't say something about these events.  Where is that pride of multiethnic
Sarajevans?  No one has been able to explain to me why it was impossible to
protect 8,000 Serbs who remained in Sarajevo from criminals.  
Every day we are informed about <a HREF="/info/students/marko/AIM/aim01.html">attacks on Serb owned property and houses</a>; 
everyone knows about this and no one can claim
that the police can not stop this.<P>

Really, I wonder why Reis-ul-ulema Mustafa Effendy Ceric [head of Bosnian
Muslims], who consistently speaks about the return of refugees, and who
demands the implementation of the right to return, doesn't raise his voice
against such a situation?  The towns of Ilidza, Ilijas and Vogosca 
 have since the transfer of authority been filled with refugees
who had begun to create parallel local authorities, to enter Serb houses and
expropriate Serb property; the refugees decide how many rooms Serbs need
and move in the rest of the house.  Every night windows of Serb houses are
smashed, houses are constantly looted...  Victimized Serbs go to police, report
the theft, the police files a report and nothing happens.  Please, don't
tell me that the city which managed to defend itself for three years from
Karadzic's troops cannot protect 8,000 people.<P>

What I don't understand is that at the beginning of the war demonstrations
for the multiethnic life in Bosnia took place in Sarajevo.  Why aren't there
demonstrations today?<P>

<strong>You mean, the demonstrations which took place immediately before
the criminal Serb attack on the city?</strong><P>

Yes, those demonstrations.  Then, the whole city stood up against those
who were against the multiethnic life in the city.  The situation today is
very close to ethnic engineering.<P>

No one can claim ignorance.  All reports are regularly sent to the government
officials.  President is silent about this, reis as well, there are no 
demonstrations by those who had always supported that Sarajevo spirit of
multiethnicity and common living.  Instead, 8,000 Serbs, who stayed in the city
despite tremendous propaganda by [the Bosnian Serb authorities in] Pale,
are scared to death and are beginning to leave the city.  What then?  I am
ashamed for this city, ashamed for my work.<P>

<strong>Can you comment the incident on Kobilja Glava where some Bosniaks
were sowing a field which had previously been cleared of mines.  When they came a 
month later to check their crop one of them lost a leg!  The whole field
was again mined.  Who did that?</strong><P>

I don't see how these events are related?  I often hear from people that
they support multiethnic Sarajevo.  However, the situation is exactly the
opposite.  The suburbs are full of refugees and no one is willing to take
responsibility for their moving in.  But they are there and are exacting
revenge on the local Serbs because of their previous suffering.  The 
consequence is that this society is moving towards a monoethnic society.<P>

No one can accuse me of trying to hide the situation in the Republic of Srpska.
However, it is difficult to defend the rights of Bosniaks who are calling
for the right of return throughout the country, if in
the capital, day after day, we can witness the implementation
 of the policy which is exactly the opposite of that proclaimed as a goal
 for the rest of the country.<P>

<strong>Former Chetniks, who bombarded this city, who tortured these people
in the camps, and who are still at the same positions are free to enter this city.
We have the same situation as after W.W.II, where victims can see their torturers
at large.  How do you explain that?</strong><P>

We can discuss that.  Still we can not approve the current policy.  Constantly
we encounter the situation in which crimes are justified by previous crimes.
But that's not the point.  The question here is whether you want a city which
will be the capital of the whole country.  If you do, then you should behave
accordingly.  I think that this is irresponsible and shameful.<P>

<strong>Have you discussed this problem with some of the officials</strong><P>

Of course.  I have spoken to president Izetbegovic, Prime Minister Muratovic,
Police Minister Hebib.  All of them agree that this is not right.  But the
looting and attacks have gone on for months.  If there were political will
to stop the crime, it would have been done by now.  What happened with the
solidarity of those multiethnic Sarajevans?  I've seen those terrified Serbs, who
don't deserve what is happening to them.  They are not the victims of Sarajevans.
The city is full of refugees who intend to stay here.  They come to a city, are not 
accustomed to live in a multiethnic society and believe that, because they
are refugees, they have all the rights and the Serbs, although they are Sarajevans,
don't have any rights.  With that sort of policy, you are directly encouraging
separation and division.  Regardless whether it is organized or not, the situation
in Sarajevo is ethnic engineering.<P>

UN-international police is writing reports and delivering them to the local
police.  The local police say that they have problems and that they are doing 
all they can.  I don't believe that.  It's been going on for too long.(...)<P>

<strong>At the last session of the Common Civilian Commission you proposed the
text of the principles for the protection of property.  There is also a working
committee for the complaints in that area?</strong><P>

We must start from the point that the laws in Srpska and the federation are
blatantly braking the Dayton agreement.  Both sides agreed that those laws
must be modified.  Both entities must submit draft laws to the working committee
by July 7, since the next session of the Common Civilian Commission will take
place on July 9.<P>

We proposed several measures: suspension of present laws until the new ones are
enacted.  The decision to do this was made in Geneva in March.  But nothing has
been done until now; ombudsmen have in the mean time received more than 8,000
complaints related to the violations of the ownership of apartments
and houses in the Federation only.<P>

I must say that the fact that these laws still exist casts a shadow on the
intentions of the politicians, here in the Federation too,  regarding the 
return of refugees.  If the present Federation laws are implemented, the
return of refugees to Sarajevo is de facto impossible;  this automatically
damages your credibility when you demand the return of refugees to other
territories.  It is extremely important, especially here in Sarajevo, to
extend the brief period of two weeks during which the refugees are supposed
to return, if they do not want to loose their homes, to the end of the year.<P>

I believe that an absolutely unacceptable and short-sighted election season calculations
are behind all this.  I am concerned that those who obstruct the enactment of such
laws are exactly those who wish to prevent the return of refugees.<P>

Unfortunately, in the Republic of Srpska the situation is much worse, since
there the law about property also must be modified.<P>

A day after the interview was published, <em>Oslobodenje</em> [daily] carried
several reactions which were recorded by our journalist Borka Rudic.<P>

<strong>Zlatko Maric</strong> (Social Democratic Party of Bosnia-Hercegovina):
"We in SDPBH on several occasions talked to the Serbs from reintegrated
territories.  They also initiated contact, so that we are aware of the situation,"
says Maric, emphasising that he and his party support every action whose goal
is to prevent incidents.  According to Maric, provocations and maltreatment of 
people have decreased lately because of more effective police action.  "Refugees
from Srebrenica and Zepa, who are moving to reintegrated parts of Sarajevo
are behind these undesirable events.  I believe that the reason is that they
have a hard time adjusting to the urban environment and that these incidents
will disappear with time."<P>

<strong>Stjepan Kljuic</strong> (member of the Bosnian Presidency and the
President of the Republican Party): "I took Steiner's interview as an action
of a tried friend of Bosnia and a jurist who should be trusted.  I think that
finally everyone understands that some of our legal authorities
are consciously working against the Dayton Agreement," says Kljuic, adding
that a coup d'etat took place in Sarajevo when the legal city council was dismissed
and the city turned into a canton which doesn't reflect the ethnic structure 
of the local population.<P>

"If on the territory under the control of legal [Bosnian] authorities we
subvert the Republic [of Bosnia-Hercegovina] and the [Muslim-Croat] Federation,
then one shouldn't be surprised by events which take place in various para-states,"
says Kljuic.  He added that as the citizen of Sarajevo he felt especially 
responsible for everything that took place in Sarajevo and that he would,
as the president of the Republican Party, demand the resignation of the
cantonal authorities and the local police command.<P>

<strong>Rajko Zivkovic</strong> (vice-president of the Serb Civic Council):
"When we gave credit to the Federal police immediately after the transition 
of authority, the situation was really satisfactory and there were no big 
problems.  Unfortunately, later the situation became worse although we
contacted the highest officials in Bosnia-Hercegovina (President Izetbegovic, 
[Police] Minister Hebib and others) demanding protection," says Zivkovic.
He thinks that the problems in the reintegrated territories must be viewed
from three points of view, especially regarding the responsibility for the
exodus and suffering of Sarajevo Serbs.  According to Zivkovic, the highest 
responsibility lies with the [Bosnian Serb] regime in Pale which forced the
majority of Serbs to leave their homes, to burn and destroy everything that
could be destroyed.  The second level of responsibility falls on the authorities 
in Sarajevo which failed to timely enact the amnesty law and used every occasion
to state that all but those who served in the Bosnian Serb Army were welcome to stay.
International Community is the third culprit.  They, according to Zivkovic, 
chose to react now when hardly anything can be done, while they failed to
prevent arson, looting and violence...  "Present incidents, somehow seem natural,
having in mind that the refugees from the Serb entity have moved into these
areas," says Zivkovic.<P>

<strong>Kresimir Zubak</strong> (Federation president): He refused to comment
the aforementioned interview adding that he had had bad experiences with 
journalists.<P>

<strong>Ejup Ganic</strong> (Federation vice-president): He was prepared to 
talk to us, but only at the time when this issue was supposed to be in the press.<P>

<strong>Mirsad Ceman</strong> (secretary general of the Party for Democratic
Action [SDA, the largest Bosnian Muslim party]): he stated that Steiner's
interview was very biased and considered only the consequences while failing to
mention the causes.  "Bildt and Steiner should have done much more during the 
phase when we pleaded with the Serbs to stay in Sarajevo, when we almost begged
the international factors to prevent the looting of factories and burning
of houses of those same Serbs who are now complaining that they have nowhere to
return to.  Of course, SDA does not condone attacks on people and their property
and will renew the demand for their full protection."<P>

Ceman said that he would suggest to Steiner to do more for the rights of Bosniaks
and to try to return them to their homes, from which Karadzic and others had
expelled them.  To the question whether the police could have done more to
protect the citizens, Ceman responded that he did not know, but that the police
should have done all that it could.  He added that he didn't know the number of 
actual incidents and that it was impossible to post a policeman in front of
every house.  Ceman was certain that refugees hadn't taken part in the incidents
and added that they were not settled in those areas in order to provoke clashes and 
incidents.  "I thinks that it is humane to settle people in empty houses,
if only for a few months.  SDA never supported resettlement of refugees because
of ethnic homogenisation but in order to help those people," concluded Ceman.<P> 

<strong>Sefkija Okeric</strong> (city hall president) was not prepared to comment
Steiner's interview.<P>

<strong>Avdo Hebib</strong> (Minister of Internal Affairs [Police]): "Despite
trying to get in touch with him for several hours," writes <em>Oslobodenje</em>
journalist Borka Rudic, "we were unable to obtain his opinion."<P>
