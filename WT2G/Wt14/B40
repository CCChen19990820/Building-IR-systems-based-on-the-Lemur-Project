<p align="left"><a name="Introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></a><strong>:
The Origins of Gold in South Africa<br>
</strong>The <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/6398/">Thulumela
archaeological project</a> in the <a
href="http://www.pix.za/Kruger_Park/">Kruger National Park</a>
has revealed that <a href="howgold.htm">gold</a> has been exploited
in South Africa for over 500 years for commercial and decorative
purposes. &nbsp;It is also known that gold was actively traded
between African and Arab counterparts in that period. Many surmise
that the <a href="/images/greatzim.gif">Great Zimbabwe Ruins</a>
were at the heart of this trading activity. In the seventeenth century,
gold was exported in significant quantities from the ports of
Sofala and Delagoa Bay. &nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Modern South African history records that gold
was first discovered on the Witwatersrand in 1834 when Carel
Kruger apparently discovered gold during a hunting expedition to
the interior, and took samples back to <a
href="http://www.ctcc.gov.za/ccchome.html">Cape Town</a>. &nbsp;A
more reliable account is the discovery of gold in 1852 on the
farm Paardekraal (now Krugersdorp), by English mineralogist John Henry
Davis. Many believe that the subsequent discovery of gold in 1886
by the Australian digger, George Harrison, that opened up the Witwatersrand
gold fields as we know them today, was from the very same ground
prospected by Davis.</p>

<p align="left">Gold was also found in <a
href="http://www.durban.org.za">Natal</a> in 1853, and the report
of Robert Raw (described as an operative chemist) is reproduced below:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><em>Dear Sir<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago Mr Brooker, who lives on the road
    to Pine Town, on the German Estate, called upon me with some
    specimens of pebbly quartz </em>(probably conglomerate)<em>,
    taken from the surface, near his dwelling, desiring me to
    place any that might be preferred to a chemical analysis,
    having in view the finding of some trace of gold. I picked
    out such as bore auriferous appearance, and after cleaning
    off the iron by solution in dilute nitric acid, I placed the
    remainder under the influence of nitrohydrochloric acid; this solution
    being now subjected to the usual tests of a salt of protoxide
    of iron, and a solution of protochloride of tin. The first
    yielded the usual brown precipitate known as 'the Purple of
    Cassius' </em>(can detect gold concentrations as low as 0,01
    parts per million)<em>, thus chemically proving beyond doubt
    the decided presence of gold. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">The first gold was found in the form of nuggets
or veins and was recovered fairly easily by hand. The discovery
of larger-scale alluvial deposits with fine gold grains required
concentration of the material before handling. Where gold occured
in conglomerates, some form of milling was necessary to separate
the gold prior to concentration using strakes and vanners. Mercury amalgamation
was then widely adopted as a supplement to gravity concentration.
This was followed by dissolution in cyanide in conjuction with
zinc precipitation. More recently, the carbon-in-pulp process has
become an important method to win gold.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="Gravity"><strong>Gravity</strong></a><strong>
Concentration</strong><br clear="all">
Gravity concentration has been practised for at least 4&nbsp;000
years, allowing fine gold grains to be recovered from sand or
river gravel. This was effected by washing the material in a
stream of water across flat, sloping rocks, along inclined
troughs, or, over animal hides pegged to the bottom of a ditch
(the Golden Fleece). Using these techniques, the heavier grains
of gold were retained as a concentrate whilst the lighter sand
was carried away by the flowing water. The difference between the specific
gravity of gold (r.d.19,3) and that of the gangue (2,6 - 2,75) resulted
in a satisfactorily high degree of concentration and of
extraction. (Note that gravity concentration does not use buoyancy
differences but inertia differences related to relative density [r.d.].)
Where gold is found in particle sizes between 600 and 30 microns,
gravity concentration remains effective. Therefore, it can be
applied to crushed conglomerates such as South Africa's.</p>

<p align="left">This is made problematic where ores are
refractory, especially in the Barberton district in <a
href="/images/SAMAP.gif">Mpumalanga</a>. Although Witwatersrand
and Free State ores are classified as non-refractory, about half
the gold remaining after cyanidation of the ore, was gold locked
in pyrite (r.d. 5,0). Generally, it is held that gravity
concentration is unviable in treating ore grades below 10g Au/t
or where a high proportion of gold is locked in sulphides. In
non-refractory ores, the ore was concentrated in Johnson drums or
plane tables, followed by re-dressing on endless riffle belts or
shaking tables.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="Amalgamation"><u>Amalgamation</u></a><u><br>
</u>Amalgamation was the principal gold recovery method used in
South African gold mines last century. Crude amalgamation is still
practised by some artisanal gold miners in South Africa, mainly in
the Mpumalanga province. Unfortunately the method is in
widespread use in other African countries, with devastating
consequences for human health and the environment as mercury is released
into rivers during processing. </p>

<p align="left">In large-scale commercial applications of
amalgamation, ore was crushed and ground in stamp mills, and
later in tube mills which represented a significant technological
improvement. The crushed ore, as fine as talcum powder, was
hydrated to form a viscous pulp that was passed over copper
plates (4,57 metres long by 1,52 metres wide, 18% slope) coated
on their upper surface with mercury. By virtue of its high
relative density, the gold sank through the pulp into contact
with the mercury, by which it was caught, and converted into
amalgam. This amalgam, (a solution of gold in mercury that took
the form of a thick paste) was scraped off the plates, and <a
href="#Retorting">retorted</a> to yield gold sponge. Despite
regular scraping, hard layers of gold amalgam accumulated on the plates.
This was removed by softening the amalgam with steam which
allowed it to be scraped off without exposing the copper.</p>

<p align="left">By 1922, amalgam plates were replaced by corduroy
strakes that were positioned in the discharge streams of tube
mills. Using this process, pulp was passed over a flat, inclined
surface covered with strips of corduroy fabric laid across the
surface at right angles to the pulp flow. The gold and other heavy
constituents were trapped in the corduroy riffles. The cloths
were then removed and washed off into receptacles for
amalgamation followed by retorting. </p>

<p align="left">Amalgamation was still retained after the
introduction of cyanidation in 1890 because it allowed the recovery
of as much gold as possible at an early stage in processing.
However, the introduction of the tube mill forced a move away
from amalgamation since the slurry was coarser and less suitable to
such treatment.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="Flotation"><u>Flotation</u></a><u><br>
</u>Flotation was initially ignored in South Africa because of
the efficiency and effectiveness of cyanidation. In flotation,
reagents are added to flotation cells through which the finely
ground ore is passed. Certain reagents will cause certain
minerals to float to the top in a foam, and this can be collected
as a concentrate for subsequent processing. By the early 1900s,
flotation was an important recovery process in the South African
gold mining industry, although it was mainly confined to refractory
ores such as those of the Barberton area. However, the recovery
of uranium oxide from gold ores from 1952 had a significant impact
on its application in South Africa. This resulted in a trend
toward using flotation as a complementary process to cyanidation. On
South African gold mines, gold and the gold bearing minerals are
floated as they constitute the smallest component of the ore.
Common practice favours high pyrite recovery. </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><a name="Cyanidation"><strong>Cyanidation</strong></a><strong><br>
</strong>In 1890, JS MacArthur and the Forrest brothers of
Glasgow, introduced the cyanide process to the Witwatersrand gold mines.
The original process involved dissolution of the gold from the milled conglomerate
by a weak cyanide solution in the presence of oxygen and its
subsequent precipitation from the solution by means of zinc
shavings. In modern plants, gold is precipitated out of the 'pregnant
solution' using zinc powder or absorbed onto activated charcoal.
The precipitate is then filtered out of the solution, and the
filtrate (which looks like black mud at that point) is then
melted with fluxes at the mine to recover the gold bullion as
doré bars (typically 84 per cent gold, 10 per cent silver and 6
per cent base metals), which are refined to 99.5% or 99.99%
purity by <a href="http://www.bullion.org.za/associates/rr.htm">Rand Refinery
Limited</a>. Gold absorbed onto charcoal is recovered by elution and submitted
to the same pyrometallurgical process.</p>

<p align="left">The introduction of cyanidation certainly saved
the industry from stagnation and possible demise although it was
not without great struggle as the <a
href="http://www.bullion.org.za">Chamber of Mines</a> (then the <a
href="/info.htm#name">Witwatersrand Chamber of Mines</a>) fought
the excessive royalties demanded by MacArthur's African Gold Recovery
Company. In 1896, the Chamber challenged the validity of two
MacArthur patents - No. 47 for cyanidation and No.74 for zinc
precipitation. Judgement was given in favour of the Chamber on
the grounds that in 1885, gold had been extracted using a
solution of potassium cyanide after which it had been
precipitated on zinc plates.</p>

<p align="left">Recovery by means of amalgamation had declined
steadily and attempts to improve recovery using chlorination
proved costly and ineffective. When the first commercial
cyanidation plant was established in 1890, 75% of the gold
contained in amalgamation tailings was recovered, resulting in an
overall recovery (by amalgamation and cyanidation) of nearly 90%.
In contrast, crude amalgamation had recovered less than 60% of
gold from the sulphide ores encountered underground. The introduction
of frue vanners and corduroy strakes produced a concentrate from which
gold was recovered by roasting and chlorinating. This process
achieved an overall recovery rate of 74%.</p>

<p align="left">The MacArthur method was challenged briefly from
1894 to 1898 by the Siemens-Halske electrolytic precipitation
method. However, MacArthur's patented zinc-lead couple proved
more effective and less costly, and became the dominant
extraction process. Counter current decantation cyanidization
remains important for ore that is not amenable to heap leaching.
The operating cost is much higher than heap leaching since the
ore is crushed and then ground to perhaps 80% minus 200 mesh (or
even finer), prior to gold recovery.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="Heap"><u>Heap</u></a><u> Leaching</u><br>
The <a href="http://mbendi.co.za/kalgold/press.htm#HEAPleach">heap
leaching</a> process involves placing ore in a stationary heap
and a solvent (cyanide) percolates through the solid. The primary
benefit of heap leaching is that it can be done with little
reduction and hence significant cost savings.</p>

<p align="left">Generally, ore of selected rock size is placed on
a leach pad, which is saturated with a weak cyanide solution. The
pads are constructed by laying impermeable plastic sheeting over
a gently inclined, compacted graded soil. Before stacking the ore onto
the leach pads, a thin, protective layer of sand is placed on the
plastic as in insulator. The gold (and other metals) is then leached
from the stack where they it is gathered in a recovery pond for
subsequent processing. For single stage leaching, two steps are
involved: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. contact
of solid and solvent for transfer of solute to solvent; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. separation
of resulting solution from the residual solid.<br>
<br>
The <em>extract</em> is the solvent phase and the <em>raffinate</em>
is the solid material and its adhering solution. The solute in
the raffinate is in both dissolved and undissolved forms. &nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Heap leaching is not widely used in South Africa
because of the nature of the ore bodies. A derived process for
refractory ores involves bacterial leaching to oxidize sulphide
minerals. </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><a name="Precipitation"><strong>Precipitation</strong></a><strong><br
clear="all">
</strong></p>

<p align="left"><a name="Cementation"><u>Cementation</u></a><br
clear="all">
Leaching gold ores and concentrates with cyanide results in a
solution containing anionic metal cyanide complexes from which gold
must be recovered. The traditional method used was the separation
of solution prior to gold recovery. The newer method is the <a
href="#Activated">carbon-in-pulp</a> technology. </p>

<p align="left">The most important method of recovery from dilute
solutions arising from liquid-solid separation is zinc
precipitation. The early use of zinc shavings was superseded by
zinc dust from 1911 (the Merrill process) which offered a greater
surface area per unit mass and required less handling than shavings. Aluminium
and charcoal were also applied as precipitants but never achieved
the efficiency of zinc dust.</p>

<p align="left">Zinc leaching plants initially consisted of a
series of gently sloping long, narrow and shallow tanks in which
bundles of zinc shavings were stacked. Gold bearing slurry was
introduced at the raised end of the box and pased slowly through
the shavings to overflow at the lower end. To maximise contact with
the zinc, five or six vertical plates were introduced. With the introduction
of the zinc-lead couple in 1894, the shavings were dipped in a 5%
solution of lead acetate. As gold precipitated on the zinc, the
shavings would break up as some dissolved in the cyanide solution and
some became heavily coated with gold. The boxes were typically
cleaned once per month. The concentrates were cleaned in
sulphuric acid vats to dissolve the bulk of the zinc. The
insoluble residues were then smelted to produce gold bullion. The
primary weakness of this process was the lock-up of significant
quantities of gold.</p>

<p align="left">The process was improved using zinc dust,
pioneered by CW Merrill in Montana between 1907-1908 when he
added zinc fume to the pregnant solution and pumped the emulsion
through a filter press. The precipitated gold and excess dust
remained in the filter frames while the barren solution passed
through the canvas filter cloth into a storage tank for re-use in
the cyanide plant. </p>

<p align="left">Further improvement took place in the form of the
Crowe-Merrill zinc dust precipitation process invloving the
replacement of pressure-filter presses by suction-operated canvas
frame filters (1,22 metres wide by 1, 83 metres high) comprising
36 or 48 leaves set radially in a circular tank. The main feature
was the vacuum de-aeration tank invented by TB Crowe. This
allowed dissolved oxygen in the pregnant solution to be removed
just before the addition of zinc dust. The leaves of the filters
were connected to a header pipe leading to the suction of a
centrifugal pump. Solution gravitated to the Crowe tank, where
zinc dust and lead nitrate were added continuously, and then into
a circular tank in which the canvas frames were completely immersed.</p>

<p align="left">To overcome the labour intensivity of the Merrill
process in terms of cleaning the filters, enclosed pressure
filters (mainly Stellar candle filters) were introduced in 1960
that allowed a measure of automation using back-washing. These
filters were based on water clarification techniques developed
during World War II.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="Activated"><u>Activated</u></a><u>
Carbon (Carbon-in-Pulp)<br clear="all">
</u>The application of activated carbons to gold recovery has its
origins in the patented use of wood charcoal for the recovery of gold
from chlorination leach liquors in 1880. However, its use in precious
metal recovery is a small element of activated carbons' potential
and existing applications in any number of fields. </p>

<p align="left">The carbon-in pulp (CIP) process, which was <a
href="http://www.mintek.ac.za/EMD/CIP/CIP.htm">developed to its
present form in South Africa during the 1970s</a>, is considered to
be the most significant advance in gold recovery technology in recent years.
The CIP method, which is increasingly widely used (by 1995, there
were 42 CIP circuits installed in South Africa). CIP makes use of
the tremendous physical affinity 'activated' carbon has for gold
(it can attract 7% of its weight in gold), which it readily
attracts to its surface in cyanide solution. The finely ground
ore (typically about 75 µm particle size), and the slurry of fine
ore and water (the 'pulp') are treated with cyanide in large
tanks that are stirred mechanically or by air-agitation.
Activated carbon is used to adsorb the gold directly from the
cyanided pulp which flows continually from the first vessel to
the last in the series, and the carbon is transferred intermittently
by pumping in the opposite (countercurrent) direction. The gold
value of the pulp decreases downstream, and the gold loading on
the carbon increases upstream, with the highest value in the
first tank. </p>

<p align="left">The CIP process consists of three essential
stages: adsorption in which the dissolved gold in the pulp is
loaded on to aerated carbon: elution, in which the gold is
removed from the carbon into an alkaline cyanide solution, and
electro-winning, in which the gold is removed by an electrical process from
the alkaline cyanide solution and deposited on steel wool
electrodes. The carbon is then treated with acid to remove
contaminants, after which the acid itself is treated. Both are
then recirculated into the adsorption-elution circuit. When the
leach and absorption circuits are combined, the process is
described as carbon-in leach.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><a name="Pyrometallurgy"><strong>Pyrometallurgy</strong></a><strong><br>
</strong>The final stage of recovery is the conversion of gold
concentrate to bullion. Generally, South African mine doré
contains about 10% silver and 2 to 3% of copper, iron and other
base metals. The removal of the non-gold metals is achieved in
refineries. As a result, smelting in mine metallurgy plants is
restricted to producing a suitable quality bullion that can be
accurately sampled and assayed.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="Retorting"><u>Retorting</u></a><br
clear="all">
With amalgamation, the gold amalgam was retorted in cast iron
'retort boats' set horizontally in coal-fired furnaces. Pressed amalgam,
containing 30-50% gold was heated to above the boiling point of
mercury. The vapourised mercury was then distilled by passing it
into a water-cooled condenser for re-use on the amalgam plates.
Distillation is usually complete after 4 hours at 800°C. 'Sponge
gold' then remained in containers inside the retort cylinder. The
sponge was then melted in plumbago crucibles and poured into
moulds. Retorting was simple and efficient, improved only by oil
and then electric furnaces instead of coal or coke firing.
Handling of mercury presents a serious hazard and considerable
care has to be taken to avoid any inhalation of mercury vapour or
even skin contact with it.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="Calcining"><u>Calcining</u></a><br
clear="all">
With the zinc-lead couple process, insoluble lead sulphate and
other impurities could be separated from the bullion only by pyrometallurgical
means, namely, calcination and fusion. Calcining refers to the
removal of moisture, burning off of combustible impurities and
the oxidiation of base metals such as lead and zinc prior to
smelting which provides higher-grade bullion and cleaner slag. Oxidiation was
achieved by placing the moist filter cakes of gold slime on flat
clacine trays and then placing them in ovens where they were
roasted at a dull red heat for several hours. The ideal cake thickeness
is 75mm with 16 hours of roasting at between 550 and 700°C.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="Fusion"><u>Fusion</u></a><br>
After cooling, the calcined material was mixed with a suitable
flux (usually borax and sand). The mixture was then placed in plumbago
crucibles that were heated in reverberatory furnaces for two to three
hours at approximately 1&nbsp;200°C (gold melts at 1063°C). A
fluid slag developed made up of borosilicates formed from PbO and
ZnO2 combined with molten sand. After fusion, the fluid slag in each
crucible was poured into moulds with the gold and silver settling
to the bottom and slag forming a supernatant cover. The slag and
bullion were separated by tapping with a hammer. The bullion was
then re-melted into bars of approximately 1&nbsp;000 Troy ounces
(31kg) for delivery to Rand Refinery. The reverberatory furnaces
have been largely replaced by submerged arc furnaces, particularly
for smelting calcined slime and melting gold sponge. </p>

<p align="left"><a name="Roasting"><u>Roasting</u></a><u><br
clear="all">
</u>Flotation concentrates have to be subjected to roasting to
render the gold amenable to extraction by cyanidation. This is a major
factor in the Archaen sulphidic ores of the Barberton and
Pilgrims Rest areas. The process has to be conducted slowly and
at controlled temperatures, usually between 450 and 800°C. The
roasting process has environmental implications, particularly because
it produces sulphur dioxide which is used to manufacture
sulphuric acid.</p>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Formation"><b>Formation</b></a><b><br>
</b><a href="http://www.mbendi.co.za/indy/ming/mingmrc2.htm">Diamonds</a> were formed aeons ago deep in the mantle of the earth, some 150 kilometres below the surface. Molten magma in 
the mantle was forced upward through fissures to the earth's crust to burst out as <a href="http://volcano.und.nodak.edu">volcanoes</a>. Free carbon particles in the 
mantle which were caught in the upward volcanic stream were subjected to heat and pressure so intense that the particles 
were crystallised into diamonds - the diamondiferous magma becoming known as 'blueground' or kimberlite. </p>
<p>Further outpourings of kimberlitic magma occurred and when the magma eventually cooled, the diamonds remained trapped in 
the solidifying magma pipes. </p>
<p><a name="Occurrence"><b>Occurrence</b></a><b><br>
</b>The first diamond to be discovered in South Africa was found in 1866 on a farm near Hopetown, south of Kimberley. This 
was followed by the finding of kimberlite bearing pipes and further discoveries of alluvial diamond fields in the drainage system 
of the Vaal River Lichtenburg and Namaqualand, and eventually even on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast.</p>
<p>Between 1870 and 1891 no less than six kimberlite pipes were discovered in Kimberley, while the Koffiefontein pipe, some 
130 kilometres south of Kimberley, was discovered in 1880. The Premier, the biggest pipe in South Africa and, geologically, 
by far the oldest, was discovered at Cullinan near Pretoria in 1902. The world's largest gem diamond, the 3&#160;106 carat 
Cullinan, was found here in 1905. Several other small but payable deposits were discovered elsewhere in the country in the 
early years of the century, though most of these have been worked out and abandoned. </p>
<p>At Kleinzee, south of Port Nolloth in Namaqualand, diamonds were found in marine terraces in 1925. These diamonds were 
brought down by the Buffels River system in an ancient bed a few kitometres from its present course. A year later, another 
deposit was found at Alexander Bay on the South African side of the Orange River mouth to the north of which, in Namibia, 
Consolidated Diamond Mines (now CDM) was mining diamond bearing marine terraces along the whole coastline to 
L&uuml;deritz.</p>
<p>Diamond deposits were found in 1927 around Lichtenburg in the North West Province (then the Transvaal), though today 
these are virtually exhausted.</p>
<p>A more recent discovery was made in 1961 when Allister Fincham discovered the Finsch pipe, which proved to be one of the 
largest on the continent, Finsch, in the Northern Cape, came into production in October 1965.</p>
<p>In the early '80s a diamond bearing pipe was discovered at Venetia in the far north of the country close to the Limpopo River. 
In late 1989, <a href="http://www.mbendi.co.za/codb.htm">De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited</a> announced the go-ahead for the Venetia diamond mine at an estimated 
cost of more than R1 billion. The company is developing an opencast mine to treat 3,3 million tons of ore and produce 4 
million carats of medium quality diamonds a year, The mine will have an estimated economic life of about 20 years.</p>
<p><a name="Mining"><b>Mining</b></a><b><br>
</b>In South Africa, volcanic kimberlite pipes are mined as both underground and opencast operations. The Kimberley mines and 
Premier are underground operations; Koffiefontein, formerly mined by opencast methods, is now worked as an underground 
mine; while Finsch is presently an opencast operation, though underground mining is scheduled to start in 1990. Venetia will 
be an opencast mine. A variety of mining methods are employed ranging from blasting and then hauling the ore away by huge 
trucks in open-pit mines, to open-benching. block-caring, open-sloping and panel-retreat operations underground. </p>
<p>On the Atlantic coastline in Namaqualand, beach or marine alluvial diamond deposits are worked by surface sand-stripping 
methods, by gravel- and pothole-exploitation methods in shallow water, and by suction-dredging in deeper water to 
considerable distances off the coast. </p>
<p><a name="Production"><b>Production</b></a><b> and sales<br>
</b>South African diamond production in 1989 was 9,1 million carats out of world production of around 100 million carats. Apart 
from a small number of private-sector workings and State diggings, diamond Mining in South Africa is primarily in the hands 
of De Beers, In 1989, De Beers' South African mines - Finsch, Premier, the Namaqualand and Kimberley mines, and 
Koffiefontein -treated 24,1 million tons of ore to recover 8,7 million carats of diamonds. In the same year, De Beers' 
London-based <a href="http://www.mbendi.co.za/orgs/cbfp.htm">Central Selling Organisation (CSO)</a>, which handles some 80 per cent of the wodd's trade in rough diamonds, 
achieved diamond sales worth $5 billion, while sales at retail level worldwide climbed to around $50 billion.</p>
<p><b>'</b><a name="lndustrials"><b>lndustrials</b></a><b>'<br>
</b>Only some 15 to 20 per cent of the world's diamond production is gem quality; the rest is destined for industrial use. 
Natural-diamond 'industrials' - 'boart' - (along with synthetic diamonds) are required by the modern world for their hardness in 
cutting; sawing; wire-drawing; drilling purposes, mainly in the masonry, mining and oil businesses; and for grinding and 
polishing in the engineering industry. In many applications diamonds, indeed, are indispensable: without them many 
high-technology industries simply would not exist.</p>
<p><a name="Prospecting"><b>Prospecting</b></a><b> and the future<br>
</b>Prospecting continues to be undertaken in several parts of South Africa. A key area of focus is the Namaqualand coastline, 
where De Beers and other companies are carrying out major reconnaissance sampling, using specially converted 
mining-research vessels in deep-water-prospecting lease areas.</p>
<p>Latest studies predict an optimistic future for diamonds at least until the turn of the century. The CSO is expected to maintain 
its position as the paramount marketer of rough diamonds, thus assuring continued stability in the diamond industry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>TO : THE PRESIDENT <br>
CHAMBER OF MINES <br>
55 HOLLARD STREET <br>
MARSHALLTOWN 2170<br>
</strong><br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DATE: 17 AUGUST 1996</strong><br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We, mineworkers and members of the National Union of Mineworkers, are gathered here today to remind the chamber of 
Mines of the historic struggles we have waged since the inception of the mining industry. We want to remind the Chamber of 
Mines that August has a special meaning in the struggle of mineworkers and that history has a way of repeating itself.</p>
<p>It was on 12 August 1946 that the African Mine Workers Union showed its muscle to demand a minimum wage of ten 
shillings per day. It was on 09 August 1987 that the 21 day strike shook the Chamber.</p>
<p>This mass action &quot;The Great Mineworkers Strike&quot; challenged the harsh working and living conditions created by the Chamber 
of Mines. It challenged the cruel migrant labour system, hostel accommodation, high frequency of accidents and starvation 
wages. It was a collective demand from the down trodden to be treated as human beings. Single sex hostel accommodation 
was and remains fertile ground for agent provocateurs in many cases in collusion with employers to instigate tribal faction 
fights. The unfortunate killings in East Driefontein, even during the course of this week is proof of the dangers promoted by the 
hostel system under the Chamber of Mines.</p>
<p>Today mineworkers are still subjected to injustices, inequality and racial discrimination which has been outlawed in the rest of 
the country. Like our comrades in 1946 we still demand :</p>
<ul>
<li>that the life of all mines be prolonged. That the mining industry be made safe and become the highest paying in line with 
the rest of the world. </li>
<li>a new and appropriate job grading system which rewards and encourages improved skills. </li>
<li>that this system replace the archaic Paterson Grading System meant to keep black mineworkers subservient and 
unskilled. </li>
<li>that employers should finance education and training with emphasis on collective bargaining and industrial relations and 
other life skills. </li>
<li>an increase in paid maternity leave and guaranteed job security. </li>
<li>the dismantling of inequality, especially racial discrimination in payment of wages. </li>
</ul>
<p>and finally<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>a living wage. </li>
</ul>
<p>After 50 years of struggle, our demands are still as resonant and relevant as they were in 1946 and we demand that they be 
addressed now.</p>
<p>We demand that the Chamber of Mines responds within seven (7) days or take responsibility for the consequences.</p>
<p align=center>Signed in JOHANNESBURG on the 17th day of August 1996.<br>

</p>
<p>After being for centuries man's main source of heat, and of energy too in the industrial age, <a href="/publications/coalfacts.htm">coal</a> suffered a major decline when 
the <a href="http://www.mbendi.co.za/afoi.htm">oil industry</a> displaced it and the world opted for liquid fuel. Gaseous fuels, initially the by-product of <a href="http://www.mbendi.co.za/afoi.htm">oil</a>, also grew in 
importance; again, coal stuttered. <a href="http://www.mbendi.co.za/afoi.htm">Oil</a> became the substitute for coal and defeated coal in most of its traditional markets. Oil 
not only dominated the world&#146;s transport scene; it came to have widespread use in domestic and industrial heating and for 
power generation. In short, in many countries, oil became the prime source of energy<br>
<br>
That situation still prevails: on a global basis, oil and gas are still the most widely-used fuels. But since the oil-price explosions 
of the '70s, which restored coal as the dominant fuel for power stations and cement works, coal has steadily come back into 
favour, in only 16 years total world production of hard coal (excluding sub- bituminous fuels such as lignite) has increased 
from 2, l billion tons to 3,6 billion tons a year, in spite of oil prices continuing to remain at relatively modest levels.<br>
<br>
<a name="Geology"><strong>Geology</strong></a><strong><br>
</strong><a href="http://www.mbendi.co.za/indy/ming/mingmrc1.htm">Coal</a> is formed when peat - the residue of decomposed vegetation - is subjected to pressure and temperature over a long time 
period. Generally, the greater the pressure and temperature,the higher the coal rank or maturity: from peat to lignite to 
bituminous to anthracite.<br>
<br>
Coal reserves in <a href="http://www.mbendi.co.za/cysacy.htm#Basic">South Africa</a> are found in sediments of Permian age which overlie a large area of the country. They generally 
occur as fairly thick, flat, shallow-lying coal seams. In the Witbank area of Mpumalanga. which contains extensive coal 
reserves and is the country's most productive coalfield, five major coal seams occur at intervals within a sedimentary sequence 
deposited during a 35-million year geological time period.<br>
<br>
<a name="Occurrence"><strong>Occurrence</strong></a><strong> and production</strong><br>
There are 19 coalfields in the country spread over an area of 700 kilometres from north to south and 500 kilometres from east 
to west. Generally the rank or carbon content of the coals increases eastwards while the number of seams and their thickness 
decrease. Thus, Mpumalanga and Northern Province coals are usually classified as bituminous, occurring in seams up to 
several metres thick, while KwaZulu-Natal coals are often anthracitic and are found in relatively thin seams. The recoverable 
coal reserves in South Africa amount to some 58 billion tons, equivalent to about l0 per cent of the world&#146;s total (this figure 
excludes low-grade, high-ash content coal which could add as much as 25 per cent to the country's total reserves). Most of 
South Africa's coal is of a bituminous thermal grade; only two per cent is anthracite, and 1,6 per cent coal of metallurgical 
quality. At current production levels, coal reserves are estimated at 200 years.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.bullion.org.za/fact.htm#95COALWRLDEX">South Africa is the third biggest coal producer in the world</a>. <a href="/members.htm#Coal">South African collieries</a> range in size from small operations with 
output limited to a few thousand tons of coal per year to Secunda, the world's largest underground coat-mining complex, 
which has an annual production of some 35 million tons. There are more than a hundred collieries operating in the Republic, 
although about 68 per cent of saleable output comes from 12 very large mines while the 23 smallest mines contribute less than 
one per cent. Almost 90 per cent of the country's saleable coal is mined in the Mpumalanga, with <a href="http://www.mbendi.co.za/coamc.htm">Amcoal</a> and <a href="http://www.mbendi.co.za/orgs/cb23.htm">Ingwe Coal</a> 
dominating the industry and controlling between them some 85 per cent of output.<br>
<br>
<strong>Mining </strong><a name="methods"><strong>methods</strong></a><strong><br>
</strong>Around 40 per cent of coal comes from <a href="/images/mine12.jpg">opencast operations</a>, some of which have recovery rates approaching 90 per cent. 
Coal lying less than 70 metres below the surface is extracted from a progressive aeries of parallel, long, narrow trenches. 
Overburden rock and soil lying above the coal seams is blasted and scraped out of the currenlly-mined trench and tipped into 
the mined-out void of the previous trench. <a href="/images/cmine8.jpg">Walking draglines</a> with large scraper buckets slung beneath long, crane-type boom 
arms carry out the stripping operation. The exposed underlying coal seams are drilled and blasted loose and hauled out of the 
pit by heavy duty trucks. When the coal from all viable seams has been removed and the spoil of the next parallel trench has 
been deposited in the void, the rehabilitation process begins. The overburden is flattened, the previously-stored top soil is 
spread over it and the area is seeded with a mixture of grasses to return the landscape to its <a href="/images/mine10.jpg">ecological balance</a>.<br>
<br>
Three different mining methods are used in underground mines:<br>
<br>
The most common technique, accounting for just under half of total production, is the '<a href="/images/cmine2.jpg">bord and pillar</a>' method. Bord and pillar 
mining is ideal for relatively shallow deposits where overlying rock pressure is low. Seams are mined leaving in situ coal pillars, 
which are big enough to support the roof indefinitely, and a chequer-board pattern of mined-out 'rooms'. This method 
currently permits around 65 per cent of the available coal to be extracted. However, the adoption by several collieries of the 
'squat-pillar' method developed by the now defunct Chamber of Mines Research Organisation (COMRO), and recently 
approved by the Government Mining Engineer, will increase extraction rates -especially at depth - through the employment in 
bord-and-pillar mining of smaller pillars than were previously thought necessary.<br>
<br>
When the overlying strata impose no restrictions, 'total-extraction' mining can take place (though, in reality, somewhat less 
than 9O per cent is recovered on average) There are two major underground total-extraction systems employed in South 
Africa.<br>
<br>
In rib-pillar extraction, a continuous miner machine cuts a roadway up to 1,5 kilometres in length through the coal and five 
metres in from the edge of the area to be mined. This leaves a five metre-wide band of coal in the form of a long, isolated rib 
pillar along one side of the tunnel. With the aid of timber or hydraulic props to hold up the now unstable roof, the continuous 
miner cuts away the rib pillar in a series of curved cutting sweeps. The machine repeats the cycle by mining into the remaining 
coal area, again cutting a tunnel and leaving a rib pillar.<br>
<br>
The other total-extraction method employed is <a href="/images/cmine9.jpg">longwall mining</a>. Longwalls are usually several hundred metres long and 
essentially consist of a corridor in which one wall and the roof are formed by steel supports capable of resisting hundreds of 
tons of pressure from the subsiding mine roof above. The second side of the corridor is formed of coal and is the actual face 
from which coal is cut. A mechanical coal cutter, bearing two large revolving shearing drums with steel picks, runs the whole 
length of the coal face on rafts. This cuts into the coal and widens the corridor during each sweep, thus advancing the coal 
face. The hewn coal falls on to a conveyor and is drawn out of the longwall face.<br>
<br>
Hydraulic rams linked to the line of props push the conveyor and coal cutter forward into the newly-mined-out space in the 
face. In turn, each hydraulic support is then released from its position and hauls itself forward after the advancing face, 
reinstalling its steel canopy against the recently exposed area of face roof.<br>
<br>
<a name="Domestic"><strong>Domestic</strong></a><strong> uses<br>
</strong>Coal is South Africa's primary energy source and has been a major stimulus to economic growth and a significant factor in the 
country's industrialisation. It provides 88 per cent of the Republic's commercial energy needs and plays a vital role in meeting 
liquid-fuel requirements. The South African coal-mining industry is fortunate to be supported by a large domestic market as 
well as having a strong international position. Domestic sales are dominated by electricity generation (53 per cent), synfuels 
and petro-chemicals (33 per cent), with metallurgical and other users accounting for the remaining 12 per cent.<br>
<br>
About 40 per cent of all bituminous coal produced in South Africa is used in the generation of electricity, making this industry 
the largest single user of coal in the country. The coal fired power stations operated by the State controlled power-generation 
operation, <a href="http://www.eskom.co.za">Eskom</a>, together with a few local utilities, consumed some 69 million tons of coal in 1989.<br>
<br>
With power-generation demand likely to go on rising (despite a rather poor near-term outlook following Eskom's decision to 
close or 'mothball' 13 of its older power stations and delay the commissioning of some of its new 3 600 - 4 000 megawatt 
stations), this raises the inevitable question of how long South Affica's coal reserves will last. Assuming growth rates of 
between three and five per cent, the coal used by 2030 - when estimates suggest electricity demand is likely to peak at 
75&#160;000 megawatts -together with coal dedicated to future use by power stations either operating or under construction in 40 
years' time, amounts to a staggering 30 billion tons, about half of the country's reserves. By that time today's power stations 
will have reached the end of their useful lives and consumed most of the coal reserves of the dedicated collieries.<br>
<br>
Inevitably, alternative methods of generating electricity will need to be phased in alongside South Africa's coal-fired 
programme. More nuclear power stations are likely to come on stream in the early years of the 21st century and by the year 
2030 fast-breeder reactors will probably take up the base-load of electricity production. In the meantime. Eskom has 
demonstrated with its Lethabo power station, which at times uses coal with an ash content as high as 40 per cent, that low 
grade coal can be used in power generation, so adding up to 25 per cent to the total of the Republic's proven coal reserves.<br>
<br>
The second most important coal user in the home market is <a href="http://www.mbendi.co.za/cosaoi.htm">Sasol</a> which consumed some 39 million tons in 1989. The only 
successful <a href="http://www.mbendi.co.za/cosasf.htm">commercial oil-from-coal plant in the world</a>, Sasol uses the Fischer-Tropsch indirect-liquefaction method - which 
has the added benefit of being able to process high-ash content coal - to convert coal into petrol and diesel fuels, and 
provides raw materials for the petro chemical industries and other important by-products such as fertilizers.<br>
<br>
Other significant domestic users are <a href="http://www.mbendi.co.za/indy/ming/coic.htm">Iscor's</a> metallurgical plants (the steel industry requires coking coal to be prepared in coke 
ovens to provide metallurgical coke capable of reducing and melting iron ore to liquid iron in blast furnaces), the cement 
industry and large municipalities.<br>
<br>
In the last few years, offtake by Eskom, the railways and the mining industry has shrunk, while demand from Sasol and the 
metallurgical sector is flat. Any capacity for local consumption added to the South African coal mining industry in the 
foreseeable future, therefore, is likely to be replacement, rather than additional, capacity.<br>
<br>
<a name="Exports"><strong>Exports</strong></a><strong><br>
</strong>In 1995 South Africa had a 30 per cent share of the total market in traded coal, while it supplied 30 per cent of 
internationally-traded steam coal and just over two per cent of coking coal. In 1995 South Africa was able to take advantage 
of an improvement in market conditions, exporting coal - mainly bituminous, but also lean, thermal and metallurgical coal and 
anthracite - to more than 50 countries. Market conditions should improve further in 1996 with a substantial hardening of 
international prices and an increase of about 15 per cent in total world demand for steam coal.<br>
<br>
The South African coal industry is planning to increase coal exports by expanding the Richards Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT). 
The RBCT terminal is currently working at capacity, although R316 million upgrading programme in the early 1990s 
guaranteed a minimum throughput of at least 53 million tons of coal a year from 1991 onwards.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="Future"><strong>Future</strong></a><strong> developments<br>
</strong>The major mining houses continue to participate in coal-exploration and reserves-acquisition programmes. Encouraging 
progress is being made in the proving, evaluation, consolidation and extension of coal reserves. Prospecting activities are 
mainly concentrated in the established Mpumalanga coalfields and in parts of the Northern Province.<br>
<br>
The coalfields of the northern Transvaal are largely undeveloped, with the exception of <a href="http://www.mbendi.co.za/coic.htm">Iscor's Grootgeluk</a> mine near Ellisras 
and Tshikondeni coking coal mine near the Kruger Park. Output from Tshikondeni is being doubled to around 430 000 tons 
per year and a new rail link is in the planning stage. In the Waterberg coalfield, which may contain more than one-third of the 
country's coal reserves, extensive mineral rights are held by <a href="http://www.mbendi.co.za/cosami.htm">Sasol</a>. Experts believe that the upper zone coking coals in the 
Waterberg can be treated by direct liquefaction to produce crude oil. High-octane petrol and diesel can be produced with far 
greater efficiency using this process than by means of the Fischer Tropsch gasification method presently employed.<br>

<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Geology"><font size=3><b>Geology</b></font></a><font size=3><b><br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>The Bushveld Igneous Complex (BIC), which extends for 400 kilometres in the Northern Province, contains the world's largest known 
deposits of platinum group metals (PGMs) - platinum, palladium, rhodium. ruthenium. iridium and osmium. It is a large igneous (volcanic) 
intrusion through the earth's crust which having been tilted and eroded new outcrops to surface around what appears to be the edge of a 
great geological basin. <br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>The BIC system is divided into an eastern and western lobe with a further northern extension: it is believed that all three sections of the 
system were formed around the same time -some 2 billion years ago -- and are remarkably similar. Vast quantities of molten rock from the 
earth's mantle were brought to surface through long vertical cracks in the earth's crust creating the geological intrusion known as the BIC. The 
effects of these injections of molten rock over time, combined with the crystallisation of different minerals at different temperatures, resulted in 
the formation of a structure rather like a<i> </i>layered cake consisting of distinct mineral strata, including three PGM-bearing reefs. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Reserves"><font size=3><b>Reserves</b></font></a><font size=3><b><br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>The unique BIC contains estimated PGM reserves of some 50 000 tons (excluding the potentially huge Platreef deposits) some 69 per cent 
of the world total. So far, the Merensky<i> </i>Reef has been the source of most of South Africa's PGMs, It is estimated to contain some 17 000 tons 
of PGM, reserves. In the western<i> </i>BIC, where the major platinum mines are<i> </i>situated, the reef occurs in a narrow<i>, 25- </i>centimetre-wide PGM rich 
band bounded by two thin chromite layers. This pattern falls away in other areas resulting in the reefs diverging<i> </i>between the chromite bands<i> 
</i>until it is many metres wide The Merensky Reef is characterised by its high PGM grades and the high ratio of platinum to the other PGMs, 
especially those of major importance like palladium and rhodium. <br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>The UG2 Reef, which is more consistent throughout the BIC, is rich in chrornite but lacks the Merensky's gold, copper and nickel 
by-products, though its PGM reserves may be almost twice as large as those of the Merensky Reef. In the past it was thought difficult to 
process because of its high chromium content. These uncertainties now appear to have been resolved, and it is estimated that increasing 
exploitation of the UG2 Reef will lift its<i> </i>contribution to South Africa's platinum output<i> </i>from some 15 per<i> </i>cent in 1988 to<i> </i>nearly 30 per cent by 
1996. The Crocodile River mine was the first devoted entirely to exploiting UG2 ore. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>In the northern extension of the BIC the Platreef is found. Whereas the platinum palladium ratio in the Merensky and UG2 reefs is close to 
three to one, the two metals are found in equal measure in the Platreef deposits.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Production"><font size=3><b>Production</b></font></a><font size=3><b><br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>South African mines are the world's only primary producers of PGMs. In 1989 it was estimated that the Republic's mines produced 2,6 
million ounces out of a total global output of 3.4 million ounces of the metal. The country supplied just over 1,1 million ounces of palladium, 
against total primary supplies of 3,2 million ounces, and 56 per cent of total rhodium supplies of 330 000 ounces. Almost 90 per cent of 
ruthenium and iridium supplies emanated from South Africa. Finally, the rare metal, osmium, is converted in the Republic to value-added 
osmium tetroxide for export. Production of PGMs is dominated by the 'big two' - Amplat's Rustenburg Platinum and Gencor's Impala Platinum 
which estimates suggest, together accounted for nearly 80 per cent of the Western world's newly mined platinum in 1989. Several new South 
African mines, however, are due to add to supply in the near future. <br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Mining"><font size=3><b>Mining</b></font></a><font size=3><b> platinum<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>The mining of platinum ores is similar to gold mining inasmuch as the orebody is a thin, tabular reef covering an extensive area. This 
enables a progressive method of mining - the reef is drilled and blasted to advance the face, support being installed for local control of the 
hanging wall. As in gold mines, platinum mining is incorporating the increased use of mechanisation and trackless-mining methods in stopes 
little more than one metre high. <br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Platinum mining, however, differs from gold mining in several ways. Unlike gold reefs, which are sedimentary deposits resulting from the 
settling of granular particles on the bed of an inland lake and subjected to great pressure, platinum reefs are igneous rocks. They were 
intruded into the Bushveld area as molten volcanic magmata rising from below the earth's crust, later cooling and solidifying. This 
phenomenon created a strata control environment differing markedly from that of gold mines. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Platinum mining is also affected by a further geological feature - the occurrence of parboils in the plane of the reef. Varying in diameter 
from some 30 to 500 metres, and causing rapid sinking or rising of the reef, these potholes disrupt stoning operations, often requiring the 
re-establishment of stone faces.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Occurrence"><font size=3><b>Occurrence</b></font></a><font size=3><b> of PGMs<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>The Merensky Reef is the source of over 80 per cent of the platinum mined in South Africa This has been successfully exploited since the 
late '2Os by Rustenburg Platinum. The reef has been treated by Impala Platinum from 1969 and Western Platinum since 1971<br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>More PGMs are found in the chromatite reefs of the BIC. The highest PGM values are associated with the UG2 Reef which lies about 200 
metres below the Merensky. Since the mid-'70s increasing tonnages of UG2 ore have been mined and treated by the established producers. In 
1989, Crocodile River Mine was brought into operation on UG2 reef. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Smaller quantities of PGMs are found in the middle- and lower group chrome seams which are mined for their chrome content. Recently, 
some of these PGMs have been recovered by re-treatment of chrome mine railings. Other similar schemes are planned, though the quantities of 
precious metals from this source will never be very large<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>The PGM-bearing Platreef occurs in the northern portion of the BIC. Mining of this reef was discontinued in the early '30s owing to 
treatment difficulties and patchy values. Exploration and test-work have continued and at least one new mine is now planned for the Platreef.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Mineralogy"><font size=3><b>Mineralogy</b></font></a><font size=3><b><br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>The pattern of values in different ore samples can vary widely. The precious metals occur in a variety of forms. One or more of the metals 
may be present in combination with sulphur, arsenic, selenium or tellurium metallic particles of PGMs or of PGMs alloyed with base metals are 
also found. Additional PGMs are found in solid solution in base metal sniphide particles <br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Chromite crystals form a large part of the volume of UG2 and other chrome ores. Base-metal sulphides are much more prevalent in 
Merensky and Platreef ores than in the UG2 or chrome ores. The grain size of mineral particles varies widely but is coarsest in Merensky ores. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>The difficulty in recovering PGMs from any particular ore is determined by the ore's mineralogy. Although Merensky ores are often easier 
to treat, it is not easy to generalise. Ore from different areas of the same mine can have quite different characteristics.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Recovery"><font size=3><b>Recovery</b></font></a><font size=3><b> processes<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>PGM recovery processes for UG2 and Merensky ores are generally similar. However, the disparity in base metal contents is responsible 
for differences in the relative scale of some unit operations. Processes can be grouped into the four stages of concentration, smelting, base 
metals removal, and precious metals refining.<br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Concentration"><font size=3><b>Concentration</b></font></a><font size=3><b><br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>In concentration. the ore is ground to liberate mineral particles. These are then recovered in the form of a concentrate by froth flotation. 
The ore mineralogy dictates both the fineness of grind required for liberation and the ideal flotation conditions. Very fine particles are difficult 
to recover, so two or even three milling and flotation stages may be used to minimise losses caused by over-grinding.</font> </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>There are minor differences in the details of the equipment and operations employed by the various producers. In Merensky processing a 
metallic concentrate rich in PGMs is sometimes produced in addition to the flotation concentrate. This concentrate can be sufficiently rich to 
by-pass the smelter and be sent straight to base metal removal. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>In UG2 processing there are a number of options regarding by product chromite recovery and blending with the Merensky ore before 
milling. At present, though, only one South African producer is recovering chromite: this is done after primary milling, with the chromite 
crystals being liberated at their natural grain size. UG2 ores require finer grinding than Merensky are for optimum PGM recovery. Blending of 
the two before milling therefore gives lower recoveries and is to be avoided where possible.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Smelting"><font size=3><b>Smelting</b></font></a><font size=3><b><br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>The concentrate is melted in an electric furnace. Large units with six electrodes in line are used for smelting Merensky or mixtures of 
Merensky and UG2 concentrates. Smaller circular furnaces are used to smelt unblended UG2 concentrate. On melting, the concentrate 
separates into two layers. The upper layer is a silicate/oxide slag which is tapped off and then either discarded or returned to concentration. 
The lower layer is a sulphide motto which is sent for converting. <br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>The flotation-concentrate composition must be suitable for smelting. its rock mineral content should produce a fluid slag at the desired 
temperature. At the same time, it must contain enough sulphides to form a reasonable quantity of matter. To compensate for minor problems 
with chemical composition, various fluxes are added. Typically, the main addition is burnt lime or limestone but other materials such as 
carbonaceous reductants, sulphides, oxides or silicates are used as necessary. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Higher temperatures are required to melt UG2 concentrates owing to higher contents of chromium and magnesium oxides. More turbulent 
smelting conditions are also preferred to avoid build-up of chrome spinel in the furnace hearth. Crocodile River Mine was the first operation to 
be dependent on smelting unblended UG2 concentrates. Other operators have been able to feed their furnaces with a blend that includes 
Merensky concentrate.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>The furnace matte is further processed by converting. Excess sulphur and iron are oxidised in a refractory lined vessel. Fluxing agents are 
added to form an iron-rich slag that is skimmed off and returned to the furnaces. The converter motto is then sent for base-metal removal.<br>

<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>Base metals are removed from the converter matte either by leaching or by a combination of magnetic separation and leaching processes. 
Problem elements such as selenium, arsenic and tellurium are also removed. The concentrate which results is sent for further processing into 
refined precious metals. <br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Base metals are a valuable by-product of PGM extraction. Their further refining by the various producers is largely dictated by economies 
of scale. <br>

<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>Precious-metals refining processes have developed considerably in recent years. The older or 'classical' process involved first roasting 
the PGM concentrate. This made the rhodium, iridium and ruthenium insoluble in aqua regia. The platinum, palladium and gold were then 
dissolved and separated by a series of sequential precipitations, The remaining residue was then upgraded by pyro-metallurgical and leaching 
processes before being separated into individual metals. Final purification of all metals was by repeated dissolution and precipitation.<br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Improved separation and refining procedures have become available for all of the precious metals. These commonly involve operations 
such as solvent extraction or ion exchange. They' are being introduced either to replace procedures in the classical process or as part of 
completely new refining processes. Advantages such as improved precious metals recovery, lower refining costs and shorter processing 
times are being claimed.<br>

<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>The extraordinary physical properties of the platinum group make its metals almost indispensable in a wide range of industrial 
applications.</font></p>

<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"><b><i>Autocatalysts<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></i></b></font><font size=2>Motor vehicle exhaust systems are fitted with catalytic converters to reduce the polluting effects of exhaust emissions. The converter's 
main component is a ceramic honeycomb, the surface of which is coated with platinum and rhodium, to which palladium is sometimes added. 
The main form of autocatalyst is a three way converter, so called because as engine exhausts pass through the converter at around 300&#176;C, 
these precious metals convert nitrogen oxide, unburnt hydrocarbons and deadly carbon monoxide into harmless nitrogen, water and carbon 
dioxide.<br>
</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Autocatalysts, which account for more than 40 per cent of total demand for platinum alone, are the major demand sector for PGMs - and 
for the next few years this market is unlikely to see any economically viable substitutes for these metals. It is believed that total autocatalyst 
demand for platinum was some 1.5 million ounces in 1989. Palladium supplies to the industry in 1989 amounted to 265 000 ounces. In the same 
year record amounts of rhodium, a rare metal, far more expensive than platinum, were used in autocatalyst manufacture: autocatalysts 
accounted for 79 per cent of total rhodium demand of 330 000 ounces, around 56 per cent being supplied by South Africa.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>The major industrialised countries of the world - spearheaded by the United States, Japan and, most recently, the European Community 
member states are enacting legislation to apply increasingly stringent auto emission standards, in spite of developments like lean-burn engine 
technology (which aims at complete petrol combustion), and Ford's claims (subsequently shown to be exaggerated) regarding a new type of 
platinum-free, palladium oxidation catalyst, for the foreseeable future platinum/palladium/rhodium catalysts are likely to be the overwhelming 
choice of motor manufacturers worldwide. Autocatalyst demand, and especially that for the three way converters with their higher unit 
loadings of precious metal, continues to be encouraging. As a result of the European Parliament's series of votes in favour of tighter emission 
controls, 80 per cent of European cars were required to carry three way catalytic converters by 1993. </font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"><b><i>Jewellery<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></i></b></font><font size=2>Today, around 38 per cent of the world's platinum finds its way into jewellery. Japan, which accounts for almost half of total free market 
demand for the metal, is by far the world's largest consumer of platinum for jewellery fabrication - its off-take approaching 1,4 million ounces in 
1995 represented around 85 per cent of the entire weight of platinum used in jewellery in the non-communist world. Japan has traditionally 
favoured the metal over gold or silver. Else-where in 1995 sales of platinum appear to have improved in other countries in the Far East and 
climbed steadily in the two major European markets, Italy and Germany.<br>
</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"><b><i>Investment<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></i></b></font><font size=2>In 1995, investment demand was approximately 380 000 ounces or 8 per cent of gross Western platinum demand. Platinum has established 
a recognition for itself as a legitimate, complementary holding to gold and silver, primarily in that country, and also the United States and 
Western Europe. As growing evidence of this Johnson Matthey (UK marketing agents for Rustenburg Platinum), as well as the Chinese, 
Australian, Canadian and former USSR governments, all launched platinum coins and medallions on to the market, with the Canadian Maple 
Leaf, the Isle of Man Noble and the Australian Koala dominating the legal tender coin investment sector.<br>
</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"><b><i>Industry<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></i></b></font><font size=2>In this sector, demand essentially arises out of the servicing of platinum requirements to make up losses incurred in use and through 
recycling. Any growth, therefore, is largely dependent on the establishment of new capacity, although new applications for PGMs continue to 
be discovered in a widening range of industries.<br>
</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>PGMs continue to maintain their long association with the electrical and electronics industry, which accounts for 50 per cent of annual 
palladium and ruthenium demands. Although traditional usage of PGMs in electrical contacts has declined, the 'micro-chip' era opened up a 
wide range of novel electronic applications. The use of iridium crucibles at very high temperatures for growing single crystals of specialised 
electronics materials is but one example demonstrating that PGMs are proving indispensable in many facets of electronics technology<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>In the chemicals industry, the most important area of application for PGMs is in the production of nitric acid, essential for fertilizer and 
explosives manufacture and a host of other chemical uses. In the electro-chemical sector, ruthenium and iridium are used to coat electrodes for 
the production of chlorine, while iridium is employed in petroleum refining and other catalysts. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Platinum is essential to the petro-chemical industry. It is used as a reforming catalyst in the production of higher-octane fuels and the 
more complete exploitation of the various fractions of crude oil World demand for oil is recovering. which is resulting in more platinum and 
other PGMs such as iridium being needed to top up considerable stocks of reforming and isomerisation catalysts, while upgrading of refining 
capacity and construction of new isomerisation capacity will lead to greater demand. In addition, as the petroleum industry has pruned much 
excess capacity, the resultant sale back to the market of platinum recycled from spent catalyst has slowed down. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>PGMs are used in the glass industry in two principal fields - glass fibre, and other optical and high-performance glass. in glass-fibre 
product/on, the fibres formed as molten glass are extruded through fine bushings. These are invariably made of rhodium/platinum alloys [n the 
case of optical and high-performance glass used in camera and instrumentation manufacturing, video equipment and television, there is still 
no substitute for platinum. In 1995, estimated demand for platinum by glass producers was some 220 000 ounces or 4,7 per cent of total 
demand, and it is expected that the glass fibre industry will continue to grow steadily owing to increases in the use of glass reinforced plastics 
in the US and Europe and the fast-growing market for electronic printed circuit boards in the Far East. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Other areas of growth for platinum include catalysts for air pollution control, water purification and electrodes for cathodic protection 
against erosion.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Finally, motor manufacturers are introducing platinum-tipped spark plugs that offer longer life and improved combustion and fuel 
efficiency.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"><b><i>Medicine<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></i></b></font><font size=2>Palladium is rapidly supplanting gold in dentistry. In 1995 about 1,2 million ounces was used in dentistry worldwide. Platinum is used in 
the treatment of certain types of cancer. In the future PGMs may play a role in fighting viral. bacterial and parasitic infections: they may also 
come to be used as diagnostic tools.<br>
</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"><b><i>Fuel cells<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></i></b></font><font size=2>The clean and efficient fuel cell of the future, in which platinum catalysts are used to convert the chemical energy of a fuel into electrical 
energy, has for some time been seen as the next new major demand sector in the industrial area. Two problems plague further moves to 
achieve wide commercialisation of fuel-cell systems which utilise a platinum catalyst. Firstly, the current high capital cost of the 
pro-production units makes them uncompetitive: secondly, proof of reliability can only be achieved through demonstration of the generating 
plants. In Japan, however, projects have passed the research-and-development stage and it is hoped to launch phosphoric acid fuel cells as 
commercial products in 1993. It is forecast that there will be an increasing call for these types of cell in specialist applications, such as in the 
aerospace, defence and leisure industries.<br>

Karee and Eastern Platinum mines started production in the late 1980s. There has been some expansion at JCI's Lebowa Platinum Mines' Atok 
Section, while a new shaft was sunk at Rustenburg Platinum's Amandelbult Section and production was expanded at Union Section. On the 
Platreef, Southern Witwatersrand Exploration discovered a substantial nickel/platinum deposit. Lastly, AAC's proposed Uitkomst nickel mine 
in Mpumalanga was set to produce 30 000 ounces of platinum and 80 000 ounces of palladium from 1993.<br>

<li><p align=left><a name="INTRODUCTION"><font size=4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></a> <br>
<font size=3>Gold mining in South Africa, from its humble beginnings in the first recorded mine in Eesterling in the Northern Province 
in 1871 to its pre-eminence as the largest gold mining industry in the world, has played a significant role in the economic 
development of the country over the past 120 years. Through gold mining, many towns and cities have come into being. 
Notable examples include Johannesburg, Welkom, Orkney, Springs, Benoni, Witbank and Klerksdorp. Much of the 
infrastructural development of roads, electricity generation, water reticulation, telecommunications, housing and the 
development of industry to provide the inputs to the gold mining industry have resulted directly from gold mining. <br>
</font></font> </p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><a name="RESERVES"><font size=4><b>RESERVES AND PRODUCTION</b></font></a> <br>
<font size=3>South Africa has about 40 percent of known world gold reserves. The following graph shows South Africa's role in 
global mineral reserves and production:</font></font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=center><font size=4><img src="IMG00001.gif" align=bottom width=536 height=348><br>
</font></p>
<p align=left><font FACE="Arial"><font size=3>In 1994 the industry produced 25 percent of the world's newly mined gold.<br>

<li><p align=left><a name="IMPORTANCE"><font size=4><b>IMPORTANCE</b></font></a><font size=4><b> OF GOLD MINING TO SOUTH AFRICA'S ECONOMY<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></font></b></font><font size=3>The South African mining industry has been the mainstay of the South African economy for over a century. 
Gold and diamonds are the two highly valued commodities which were largely instrumental in the development of the 
country's infrastructure and the establishment of secondary industry during the first half of the twentieth century. <br>
</font></font><font size=4> </font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font FACE="Arial"><font size=4><b>GOLD MINING'S </b></font><a name="CONTRIBUTION"><font size=4><b>CONTRIBUTION</b></font></a><font size=4><b> TO GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT AND 
GROSS GEOGRAPHIC PRODUCT</b></font> <br>
<font FACE="Arial"></font><font size=3>Gold mining has played a pivotal role in the economic development of the domestic economy, contributing 4.8 
percent in broad macro-economic terms to GDP in 1995. This is substantially down from the 17 percent direct 
contribution recorded in 1980 when the gold price peaked. The following graph illustrates the contribution gold mining 
and other mining have made to GDP:<br>
</font></font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=center><font size=4><img src="IMG00002.gif" align=bottom width=542 height=293><br>
</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=3>Although the relative importance of gold mining has fluctuated over the last decade with the performance of the gold 
price, gold mining still contributes just under 5 percent directly to GDP. Taking into consideration the indirect 
contribution to the economy and the multiplier effects, gold mining's total contribution to GDP is closer to 10 percent. 
These multiplier effects include:<br>
</font></p>
<ul>
<li><p align=left><font FACE="Arial"><font size=3><b>Backward linkages<font FACE="Arial"></b></font>, which arise from the purchase of goods and services by the gold mining industry 
which stimulate industrial production and the provision of services (e.g. gold mines consume 15 percent of all 
electricity generated in South Africa).</font></font><font size=4> </font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font FACE="Arial"><font size=3><b>Forward linkages<font FACE="Arial"></b></font>, arising from the use of mineral products in other domestic industries, such as 
jewellery fabrication and production of refined gold.</font></font><font size=4> </font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font FACE="Arial"><font size=3><b>Social multipliers<font FACE="Arial"></b></font> which arise from the role of mining in the development of human resources and 
infrastructure such as schools, colleges, clinics, roads, and housing.</font></font><font size=4> </font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font FACE="Arial"><font size=3>The <b>primary incomes multiplier</b> which arises from household expenditures of primary incomes derived 
from mining.</font></font><font size=4> </font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font FACE="Arial"><font size=3>The <b>employment multiplier</b>, which arises from the employment created in other industries as a result of 
gold mining. This multiplier includes the benefits of the provision of employment for workers from deep rural 
communities and the transfer of funds back to these areas.</font></font><font size=4> </font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font FACE="Arial"><font size=3>The <b>income terms-of-trade multiplier</b> which arises from the positive impact that gold export earnings have 
on the balance of payments, foreign reserves, monetary policy and ultimately upon the general level of business 
activity in the country.</font></font><font size=4> </font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font FACE="Arial"><font size=3>The <b>capital formation multiplier</b> which arises from mining's influence in attracting foreign capital to the 
country (via the Johannesburg Stock Exchange or via direct investment), and in domestic capital formation.</font></font><font size=4> </font></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align=left><font FACE="Arial"><font size=3>The gold mining industry also contributes substantially to the national fiscus, both directly and indirectly. For the 
fiscal year 1994/95, the estimated total direct taxation paid by gold mining was R1,5-billion. Multiplier effects from gold 
mining in stimulating taxation paid by other companies which supply mining products or which use mining products, or 
by individuals who earn their primary incomes from gold mining, plus indirect taxes paid by the gold mining industry 
(such as tax on fuel) also need to be weighed in their contribution to the national fiscus. <br>
</font></font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=left><font FACE="Arial"><font size=3>The contribution of gold mining to economic growth in certain provinces is significantly greater than the contribution 
it makes to the overall economy. As illustrated in table 1 below, the mining sector was responsible for approximately 20 
percent of the Gross Geographic Product (GGP) of the Free State, 40.5 percent of GGP of the North West Province, 
24.6 percent of the Northern Cape Province, 20.4 percent of the Mpumulanga Province, and 20.1 percent of the 
Northern Province. Gold mining played a significant role in the Free State, Gauteng, and the North West Province.<br>

<p align=left><font FACE="Arial"><font size=3>In quantifying the overall contribution of the gold mining industry to the sub-economy of each region, consideration 
should be given to the multiplier effects generated by the industry. Multiplier effects are largely determined by the kind 
of industry which an activity supports, which in the case of mining tends to be more strongly connected to so called 
&quot;backward linkages&quot;, such as electricity, community services and manufacturing sectors. For example, in the Free State, 
the mining industry consumes some 76 percent of electricity produced and 36 percent of manufacturing output. Insofar 
as these purchases stimulate local industrial production, the eventual value added in the economy is larger than that 
raised in the gold mining sector alone. <br>

<font FACE="Arial"></font><font size=3>The export of primary minerals from South Africa has accounted for the largest portion of total foreign 
exchange earnings for many years as illustrated in the following graph:<br>
</font></font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4><img src="IMG00003.gif" align=bottom width=541 height=339><br>
</font></p>
<p align=left><font FACE="Arial"><font size=3>Gold has been South Africa's largest export for a number of years and in 1995 earned about 20 percent of South 
Africa's foreign exchange. Although declining from more than 50 percent in 1983 to just more than 20 percent in 1995, 
the importance of these earnings has been in the form of the &quot;incomes terms-of-trade multiplier&quot;. Gold mining, while 
being a very high net generator of foreign exchange, is also a very low net user of foreign exchange. Much of the 
materials used in gold mining are sourced from the domestic economy (which also shows that much of the mining 
technology has been developed locally). Manufacturing, on the other hand, is a very high net user of foreign exchange 
for the importation of machinery and equipment from overseas ( and this implies the importation of technology). Due to 
the constraints of financial sanctions (and thus the requirement that South Africa maintain a current account surplus) 
much of the machinery imported by manufacturing was purchased via the foreign exchange earnings of gold mining. <br>
</font></font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=left><font FACE="Arial"><font size=3>More recently, although South Africa has the capacity to now run a current account deficit, this capacity is 
constrained by the degree of capital inflows and access to international financing. In the past monetary policy (high 
interest rates) was used to curtail the import propensity of domestic industry if the current account of the balance of 
payments looked in jeopardy. More recently monetary policy is being used to ensure financial stability rather than to 
curb cyclical upswings in the domestic economy. However, if the deficit on the current account becomes too high the 
monetary authorities could be forced to curtail domestic business activity by way of higher interest rates. What is 
important is that the bulk of foreign exchange still needs to be derived from exports, and in this respect alone gold 
mining has a major role to play.<br>
</font></font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=left><font FACE="Arial"><font size=3>The gold mining industry will therefore continue to play a substantial role in the export earnings of South Africa, thus 
impacting on the current account of the balance of payments, on monetary policy and thus impacting on the general 
level of business activity in the country.<br>

economically active population or 3.5 percent of all those formally employed in the economy. Approximately R8-billion 
was paid to these mine workers as wages. Employment levels have been at a steady rate of decline since 1987 when 
approximately 520 000 were employed in the gold mining sector. The following graph illustrates the number of people 
employed in the gold mining industry since 1987:</font></font><font size=4> </font></p>

<font FACE="Arial"></font></b></font><font size=3>Gold mining has formed the economic base and has been responsible for much of the economic development 
that has taken place in South Africa over the past 100 years. Mining will continue to have a vital role in the economic 
development of the country in terms of contributions to wealth creation, to employment and social upliftment of many 
workers and their families, to infrastructural development and to foreign exchange earnings. Gold mining can continue to 
realise wealth that will act as the support base for the development of other industries.<br>

<li><p align=left><a name="SPECIAL"><font size=4><b>SPECIAL</b></font></a><font size=4><b> CHARACTERISTICS OF GOLD MINING IN SOUTH AFRICA<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></font></b></font><font size=3>South Africa has substantial gold resources. Much of these resources are located in the massive geological ore 
body known as the Witwatersrand Basin. In order to exploit the Witwatersrand gold deposits, massive mining 
operations were required. The need for large amounts of financial and human capital, and for technical expertise for 
such large-scale mines led to the formation of the mining houses. In many cases the setting up of large scale mining 
operations resulted in the establishment of new towns or cities in South Africa such as Johannesburg, Klerksdorp, 
Virginia etc.<br>
</font></font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=left><font FACE="Arial"><font size=3>The development of the technical capacity to mine deep-level gold ore bodies has seen South Africa become a 
world leader in deep-level mining technology. This has led to a dichotomy occurring whereby gold mining is both labour 
and capital intensive. This is because of the massive capital required for ventilation, cooling, hoisting, underground 
tunnelling and surface processing plants, and the need to have the mines operated by large numbers of workers, 
particularly with respect to hard rock mining. In the case of gold mining the depth of operations has increased to levels 
of four kilometres below the surface in some cases.<br>

<li><p align=left><font size=4><b>THE </b></font><a name="CHALLENGES"><font size=4><b>CHALLENGES</b></font></a><font size=4><b> FACING THE SOUTH AFRICAN MINING INDUSTRY<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></font></b></font><font size=3>The most fundamental challenge facing the South African mining industry is the productivity of labour and 
capital and their impact on the cost of mining and extracting minerals. For most minerals, South African producers are 
&quot;<b><i>price takers</i></b>&quot;, as the prices are set on international markets. In order to remain competitive, particularly with many 
low-cost emergent world producers, South Africa's mining industry has to focus on productivity and cost trends. 
Operating margins have to remain, or become competitive to attract investment into the industry, and to sustain existing 
operations. For the industry to remain competitive, it must be provided with an operating and investment environment 
that does not disadvantage it <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> other mining countries. Current inhibiting factors include restrictive government 
legislation (ring fencing, exchange controls), government intervention in the domestic economy (which has raised input 
costs to the industry, such as transport, telecommunications, input taxes on fuels, high tariff barriers on imported 
products [such as certain tyres which are not made in South Africa]), high levels of domestic price instability and high 
levels of domestic taxation (particularly on input costs such as fuel taxes, Regional Service Council levies, and high 
regressive taxes on labour which raise the cost of skilled human capital).<br>
</font></font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=left><font FACE="Arial"><font size=3>In order to improve the productivity of labour and capital, a number of strategies have been developed aimed at 
&quot;the restructuring of the industry towards productivity improvements&quot;, such as full calendar year operations, two tier 
bargaining and investment in human capital. What is also required is an enabling economic and investment environment 
that reduces investment hurdle rates and thus stimulates further investment into the sector (from both foreign and 
domestic sources). Such an enabling environment would require a stable, equitable taxation regime (fair tax on profits 
and not on input costs), lower levels of inflation, the abolition of unnecessary legislation (such as ring fencing and 
exchange controls), the reduction of input costs to the industry (such as lower costs of imported equipment due to the 
lowering of tariffs), the privatisation of state assets (which reduces input costs of transport, telecommunications etc., but 
which also reduces government debt and allows more efficient cost effective services to be provided) and generally an 
economy which is based on small lean and efficient government and a thriving, prospering private sector based on free 
enterprise.<br>

<p align=left>The Witwatersrand basin and its goldfields were laid down many millions of years ago. Geologists say that a <a href="/images/arc.JPG">great lake 
stretched 250 kilometres</a> from the Klerksdorp area to the present Springs Nigel region east of Johannesburg. Several rivers, 
they believe, flowed into this lake from granite mountains to the north and south west, carrying with them sand, silt and pebbles 
and fine particles of gold. <br>
<br>
This prehistoric land was carved and shaped by these rivers, which deposited pebbles and gold in fan shaped deltas near the 
shores of the lake. Over aeons there were alternating periods of deposition, of activity and calm. Sometimes fast flowing rivers 
and streams brought rock particles from northern mountains to the lake, rolling them out across the braided (laced with gravel 
and sand bars) deltas, piling them up, layer upon layer. At other times the streams ran slowly and carried only sand and silt 
with very fine gold: Eventually the lake was silted up, filled with vast sedimentary deposits containing gold bearing reefs rather 
like jam layers in a cake. The mud, pebbles, sand and gold were fixed and preserved in the sedimentary deposits which 
became very hard rock now known as the Witwatersrand System - in places 7 500 metres thick<br>
<br>
The earth's formative turmoil continued and the Witwatersrand rock became warped as the nascent formations were thrusted 
upwards and slipped downwards, sometimes a few centimetres, sometimes thousands of metres. Then volcanic action forced 
up great dykes of igneous material and lava flowed across the country. Deposits of dolomite rock were laid down later when 
the area was covered by the sea or at least another great lake. The whole bed of Witwatersrand rock was tilted at some stage; 
it became like a giant saucer with one edge deeply buried and the other thrust to near the surface. It was on the up-thrust 
northern lip of the saucer that the Witwatersrand gold deposits were discovered in an outcrop in 1886. <br>
<br>
Sedimentologists agree that the main deltas on the prehistoric lake, along with the river systems and their flood-plains, were the 
areas of greatest concentration of deposits of gold-bearing particles. Today, these ancient river deposits, now covered by 
kilometres of gully rock, form the rich gold-bearing reefs of South Africa's 'golden arc' where the main gold-mining activity has 
been concentrated for more than a century.</p>
<p align=left><a name="Mining"><strong>Mining</strong></a><strong> the Gold</strong></p>
<p align=left>South Africa's thin but extensive gold reefs often lie several kilometres beneath the earth's surface and usually slope through the 
ground at up to 20 degrees. The country's gold mining industry has to sink the <a href="/speeches/trn2.htm#Depth">deepest mine shafts</a> in the world sometimes 
close to four kilometres in depth - in order that miners can reach and extract these reefs. <br>
<br>
It can take several years to drill, blast out and equip a shaft. Once the excavation is complete, the tremendous depth of mining 
still presents problems in the form of the dual hazards of high rock pressures and the great heat bound up in deep rocks. <br>
<br>
Just like any other lift system, the shaft's cages stop at numerous 'floors' or 'work stations' in mining terminology, on different 
levels near the shaft bottom, allowing men and materials access to various points of the sloping reef ore-body. Often the 
distances from the shaft are so great that trains are used to transport miners. Mines are so deep today that shaft systems 
frequently have to be split into two or three stages, one above the other. The lower (sub vertical) shafts have their own 
underground hoist systems. </p>
<p align=center><a href="/images/cross.jpg"><img src="../images/cross9.gif" align=middle border=0 width=113 height=145>Cross section of a gold mine</a><font size=2> [JPG 1.4MB]</font></p>
<p align=left>Tunnels are driven from the shaft to reach the underside of the reefs, whereupon a network of access and transportation 
tunnels is constructed beneath the ore-body to service the mining operations. Entry is made upwards into the overhead reef 
layers where systematic drilling and blasting of ore take place in low roofed working areas called stopes. The stopes are 
planned to ensure the progressive extraction of optimum ore values over extensive areas. Broken ore is gathered and dropped 
down a number of short shafts, called ore-passes, often now cut mechanically with a blindhole-boring machine to a railway or 
trackless system below. <br>
<br>
Roof supports are placed in the void left by mining to temporarily hold up the stope roof. Mined ore is hauled away towards 
the main shaft and tipped down a series of inter-connecting ore-passes to gather at the foot of the main shaft. From here, large 
skips hoist the ore to the surface in a continuous, automated cycle. <br>
<br>
The main functions of a working mine are augmented by a multiplicity of essential auxiliary activities. These include the use of 
ice and refrigeration (to chilled water used to cool down air in the mine's depths where rock temperatures can be as high as 
45'C); pumping to surface of large volumes of waste water; maintenance services; the provision of electrical power; and 
compressed air. <br>
<br>
<a name="Mechanisation"><strong>Mechanisation</strong></a><em><u><br>
</u></em><br>
Today, with the tremendous pressure on profit margins in the gold-mining industry, which is mining steadily declining <a href="/speeches/trn2.htm#Grades">grades</a> at 
ever greater depths, there is more emphasis on <a href="/speeches/trn2.htm#Technology">mechanisation</a> than ever before. Mechanisation should extend the mines' 
longevity as it will enable them to mine lower-grade ore, and employ a smaller though more skilled, better-paid and, therefore, 
more productive <a href="/speeches/trn2.htm#HumanCapital">work force</a>. Among the many aspects of mechanisation which are the focus of ongoing research are 
technologies like trackless mining, backfilling and hydro-power. <br>
<br>
The mechanisation techniques involving the use of trackless-mining equipment - the use of tyred vehicles on roadways instead 
of conventional hoppers on rails in underground haulages - being introduced to South Africa's gold mines have been adapted 
from base-metal mines where they have been employed for several years. <br>
<br>
But, unlike many collieries and base metal mines, where very wide ore bodies are exploited, the reefs mined in South African 
gold mines - apart from exceptions like Western Areas - are narrow and generally less than a metre in thickness, This 
necessarily impacts on productivity. Whereas over the last decade or so South African coal mines have shown healthy 
productivity increases, it is more difficult to increase productivity in the narrow-reef, deeper gold mines which less readily lend 
themselves to mechanisation. Until recently, drilling operations always had to be carried out in such narrow stopes utilising 
traditional labour intensive methods with crews of workers using hand held drilling machines. Today, however, after years of 
stalled research until the rising labour costs of traditional gold mining methods started to make the economics of mechanisation 
attractive, a mechanised drilling machine has been developed that is small and mobile enough to work in such confined spaces 
The world's smallest, twin-boom, hydraulic drilling machine is being used increasingly on a number of gold mines. The rig is of 
most use in shallow mines, since it requires a fairly large unsupported span near the face; in deep mines it would interfere with 
essential close face support. <br>
<br>
Gold mines are making increased use of backfill - the filling-in of worked-out slopes with waste material which is ground into 
fine particles to give roof support and to reduce the heating up of ventilation air caused by rock at high temperatures. The 
backfill process dramatically reduces the damage caused by seismic disturbances, especially rockbursts, and should ameliorate 
conditions in slopes through the reduction of stress on lateral supports at the stope face. <br>
<br>
The feasibility of hydro-power using a single energy source, high pressure water, to provide cooling and hydraulic power in 
deep mines, has been confirmed. A comprehensive range of hydro-powered equipment has already been developed, while a 
fully-water-powered rockdrill, developed by the Chamber of Mines Research Organisation (Comro) along with a number of 
manufacturers, came into operation in the early 1990s. Availability of hydro-power will mean the end of compressed air 
under-ground. Looking further into the future, it is hoped that much equipment, now electrically driven, will be run off 
high-pressure water. <br>
<br>
<a name="Winning"><strong>Winning</strong></a><strong> the gold<br>
</strong><br>
<a href="AUextrac.htm">On average, only five parts per million of every ton of ore mined are actually gold</a>. It is therefore necessary to separate the 
precious metal from the more than 100 million tons of ore milled each year in South Africa. This is carried out in the mine's 
gold plant. Initially, ore hoisted from the mine is broken into smaller pieces by a primary crusher; secondary crushers break it 
down further, followed by a milling stage to produce a fine rock dust. <br>
<br>
At this point most of the tiny particles of gold contained in the ore have been exposed. A cyanide solution chemically dissolves 
away the exposed gold particles and the resultant liquid follows one of two routes to recover the gold now held in solution. <br>
<br>
In the first and older method, zinc dust is added to the gold bearing solution after unwanted rock fines have been filtered out, 
Zinc has the effect of taking gold&#146;s place in the cyanide solution, allowing gold to fall out and be gathered in solid form prior to 
smelting. <br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.mintek.ac.za/EMD/CIP/CIP.htm">carbon-in pulp (CIP)</a> method, which is increasingly widely used (some 40 CIP circuits have been installed already). 
makes use of the tremendous physical affinity 'activated' carbon has for gold, which it readily attracts to its surface in cyanide 
solution. The CIP process consists of three essential stages: absorption in which the dissolved gold in the pulp is loaded on to 
aerated carbon: elution, in which the gold is removed from the carbon into an alkaline cyanide solution, and electro-winning, in 
which the gold is removed by an electrical process from the alkaline cyanide solution and deposited on steel wool electrodes. <br>
<br>
The carbon is then treated with acid to remove contaminants, after which the acid itself is treated. Both are then recirculated 
into the adsorption-elution circuit. <br>
<br>
After smelting, which takes place on individual mines, bullion bars containing about 85 per cent gold are taken to the <a href="/associates/rr.htm">Rand 
Refinery</a> near Johannesburg and processed to either 99,5 per cent purity (the accepted standard for coinage) or 99,9 per cent 
purity to meet specialised demands from certain industries. <br>
<br>
Considerable research and development work is taking place to find more efficient gold extraction methods. The modern 
carbon-in leach (CIL) method pioneered and adopted by Ergo is in use at certain gold plants. At Ergo a pyrite concentrate is 
recovered through flotation of slurry from slimes dams and milled sand and rock waste dumps. The concentrate is acid leached 
for uranium recovery, roasted to produce sulphuric acid and the resulting calcine cyanide leached for gold. The flotation railings 
are further processed in the CIL plant for the recovery of additional gold. Certain mining operations like West Witwatersrand 
gold mine and the Drylands opencast project use the heap-leaching process whereby cyanide in solution with water percolates 
through highly leachable, heaped, low-grade ore, with the resultant dissolved gold being adsorbed on to carbon in absorption 
tanks. Finally, at Hartebeestfontein, the use of radiometric sorting equipment to extract low grade gold bearing ore from waste 
rock has yielded encouraging results. </p>

<p><a name="MINERAL "><b>SOUTH AFRICA'S MINERAL WEALTH</b> </a></p>
<p>South Africa's mineral reserves are unique in the Western world. The extent and variety of its mineral products, many of 
strategic importance, and the sheer size of the mineral industry's research programmes make South Africa one of the mining 
giants. South Africa is self-sufficient in most minerals and has abundant reserves of many minerals which are scares in the rest 
of the world. The region contains 92 per cent of the free world's total manganese ores, 94 per cent of platinum group metals 
and over 70 per cent of vanadium and chromium ores. South Africa also has the largest gold deposits in the world, with 
impressive reserves of uranium, antimony, asbestos, vermiculite, fluorite and high-grade iron ore. </p>
<p>The value of South African gold production has increased eightfold since 1940 and the value of other minerals produced has 
increased by no less than for-fivefold. The mining and processing of minerals has played a major role in bringing South Africa 
to the stage where, in almost very respect, it is the most advanced country in Africa. </p>
<p>In 1995 some 400 000 people were employed in the South African mining industry. The vigorous growth of mining and 
minerals processing creates many opportunities for mining, mechanical electrical and metallurgical engineers and geologists. 
Expansion has been so rapid that for many years the manpower requirements have outstripped the available labour resources, 
especially in the more highly skilled categories. Increasing mineral exports will generate investment capital for new ventures for 
greater local processing of minerals and the manufacture of finished products. Minerals will remain South Africa's major source 
of foreign exchange earnings and there is no doubt that mining will dictate the pace of economic development for many years 
to come. </p>
<p><b>THE </b><a name="CHALLENGES"><b>CHALLENGES</b></a><b> IN THE MINERALS INDUSTRY</b> </p>
<p>Man has been fascinated by minerals since the dawn of civilisation. The names given to the epochs of human development - 
Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age - reflect how human progress has been measured against man's ability to utilise minerals, 
smelt ores, and fashion metals into useful articles. Industrial society today would be inconceivable without mineral fuels, raw 
materials and processed goods. </p>
<p>As we move into the 21st century the challenges in mining and minerals processing become greater. Take, for example, the 
design problems created by Concorde. The faster a supersonic plane flies, the more stringent the material requirements 
become because surface temperatures and stresses rise dramatically. Originally, only titanium alloys were considered to have 
the necessary strength-to-weight ratio and resistance to high temperatures and corrosion for use in Concorde. But aluminum, 
at a tenth of the price of titanium, was considered to be an attractive alternative, if it could be alloyed to withstand 
temperatures of over 127&#186;C. This led to metallurgical and aeronautical engineers developing an aluminium alloy containing 
copper, magnesium, iron and nickel which now constitutes the 70 tones of metal that is used in Concorde's airframe and skin. 
the mining industry needs people who can think big; it also has the financial resources to convert bold thoughts into action. </p>
<p>Although some minerals are still mined at great depths, there is an increasing tendency to work low-grate deposits in large 
open pit (surface) operations. In this process, great tonnages of soil and ore are shifted by large earth-moving machines and 
ore carriers. Mechanisation, automation and computers help to keep costs down, increase production targets and maximise 
efficiency. </p>
<p>To ensure continued exploration and increased growth and efficiency, the mining industry spends hundreds of millions of rands 
on research and development, supporting the biggest research effort in the private sector of South African industry. Almost 
every category of scientist and engineer can be found amongst the many hundreds of researchers, technicians and technologist 
who are engaged in exciting projects which will take South Africa into the next century. Special emphasis is placed on safety, 
mechanisation and improved deep-level mining techniques. </p>
<p>Computers form an integral part of all mining and minerals processing operations. Engineers in the minerals industry rely heavily 
on these tools and have to know how to operate them. Mining operations are made more cost-efficient and South Africa 
remains competitive in world mineral markets with the help of computer technology. </p>
<p><b>UNLIMITED </b><a name="OPPORTUNITIES "><b>OPPORTUNITIES</b> </a></p>
<p>The vigorous growth in mining and minerals processing in the past decade has created wonderful career opportunities for 
school leavers and matriculants. South Africa is one of the most important mining countries in the world, having vast mineral 
deposits yet to be fully exploited. </p>
<p>Mining in South Africa has become one of the country's foremost technological industries, contributing nearly half of the money 
spent on research by private enterprise. The mines, mining finance houses and research organisations require an endless variety 
of technically skilled scientists and engineers to keep South Africa in the forefront of mining. The industry also needs many 
non-technical personnel to provide the legal, medical, financial and other services associated with an industry that has 
investments worth billions of rands. This is why the mining industry offers many valuable bursaries for different disciplines of 
university study. Furthermore, matriculants with potential and initiative who are interested in further study, may also reach top 
management positions. </p>
<p>The mining industry has a wide range of training schemes designed to make the most of young people's potential and, in many 
cases, regardless of the academic qualifications. The university graduate and technikon diplomate trained in scientific 
approaches to engineering problems have an undoubted advantage over others and are marked for rapid promotion to senior 
positions. This is, of course, assuming that their personal attributes match their academic background. Whatever the basic 
qualifications, competent personnel who are prepared to study and pass examinations can advance very rapidly in the mining 
industry. Although the demand is for good quality matriculants, with above average passes in mathematics and science, there 
are opportunities in many other fields as well! </p>
<p>Matriculants have the choice of a number of student official courses (mining and metallurgical engineering, mechanical and 
electrical engineering and, to a lesser extent, geology and personnel administration) designed to give them the practical 
grounding and theoretical knowledge necessary to obtain their national and higher diplomas. Matriculants, and in some cases 
persons with lesser qualifications, are sought for various apprenticeship courses. Those persons with standard eight and higher, 
can also do the more practically orientated student miners' course, provided that they are able to pass the necessary selections 
criteria. </p>
<p>Although not every graduate or diplomate engineer will become a mine manager, consulting engineering or managing director, 
those who show initiative and apply themselves will find considerable opportunity to reach senior positions. </p>
<p>The mining industry offers beginners a highly competitive starting salary, low-cost accommodation and meals and excellent 
recreational facilities. Don't get left behind, read on to find out more about a career in the minerals industry! </p>
<p><a name="PLANNING"><b>PLANNING</b></a><b> YOUR CAREER</b> </p>
<p>The word CAREER comes from the French word `carri&egrave;re' which means a chariot course. So it sounds as if a career should 
send one racing towards success. This is not always the case if you make an incorrect choice. </p>
<p>Choosing a career is probably one of the most important decisions that you will have to make during your lifetime, and careful 
though should be given to WHERE and IF you could be employed when you have chosen your career and study path. You 
should always try to establish if there is a demand for personnel in the type of career that you intend to pursue. Many pupils 
continue studying after they leave school, only to discover at a later stage that there are very limited work opportunities for 
people with their qualifications. Some qualifications, such as engineering, are always in demand in modern industrialised 
societies. for many kinds of further education at university, technikon and technical college, mathematics, physical science and 
technology subjects are important and necessary to gain entrance to these courses. Remember that mathematics and physical 
science are key subjects for many careers, so don't neglect them! </p>
<p>A career is a way of life and not only a means of living, therefore considerable time and though should be given to your career 
choice. Go out and talk to people in industry to find out what different careers offer and what courses and bursaries are 
available to assist you when you are studying. The career you choose should provide you with the following : </p>
<ul>
<li>Job satisfaction </li>
<li>Financial independence </li>
<li>Security </li>
<li>Job Mobility </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Here are some useful hints that you can use when preparing for an interview :</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you have the correct address, place and time of the interview </li>
<li>Try to establish beforehand who the interviewer will be </li>
<li>Always dress smartly </li>
<li>Relax during the interview but be articulate and positive when you answer questions </li>
</ul>
<p><b>These are some of the typical questions that you may be asked:</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>What can you tell us about your school career? </li>
<li>What do you know about the minerals industry? </li>
<li>Why do you want a bursary? </li>
<li>In what field do you want to study? </li>
<li>Do you have any plans for further study? </li>
<li>What sort of position do you see yourself attaining between the ages of 30 - 40? </li>
<li>How would you describe your character, abilities and weaknesses? </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="WHAT"><b>WHAT</b></a><b> IS ENGINEERING?</b> </p>
<p>Engineering is the application of scientific knowledge and imagination to everyday problems. The engineer is concerned with 
the improvement of people's living standards by designing and constructing buildings, developing new processes, machinery 
and equipment. Engineering in the minerals industry is responsible for extracting the raw materials and for processing metals 
and minerals which are the foundation for manufacturing. </p>
<p><b>What do engineers do?</b> </p>
<p>In most countries relatively few engineers are employed in innovative or creative activities. For example, not every aeronautical 
engineer gets the chance to be involved in the design of a new space shuttle or supersonic aircraft. The variety of engineering 
work opportunities lies in the operating and production fields. Whichever field of engineering you embark upon, your duties 
could include one or more of the following: production, design, research and development, construction, manufacture, 
planning, evaluation, operation and management. Many engineers attain management positions and must therefore be 
conversant with financial matters, have managerial skills and the ability to work with, lead and motivate people. They also need 
to be flexible and have a problem-solving attitude to work. </p>
<p><b>Who should become an engineer?</b> </p>
<p>ARE YOU CURIOUS AS TO HOW THINGS WORK? </p>
<p>Engineers must have enquiring minds and should ask questions to find out how and why things work. Engineers should be able 
to persevere on projects when the going gets tough and must strive for excellence at all times. Engineers must be concerned 
with the safety of the work place and the people who work there. </p>
<p>In order to gain admission to an engineering faculty at a university you will require, as a minimum, a matriculation certificate or 
an exemption from the Joint Matriculation Board, normally with C symbols and above on the higher grade in mathematics and 
physical science. Naturally, the better your marks, the greater are your chances of being accepted by an engineering faculty 
and of receiving a bursary. Many of the engineering students who enter the minerals industry have bursaries and scholarships 
from mining houses. </p>
<p>For admission to a technikon, you will require a senior certificate with an acceptable pass in mathematics and physical science. </p>
<p><b>What salary will you receive?</b> </p>
<p>Persons with engineering and technical skills may expect to receive above average salaries throughout the world. As in any 
large industry, salaries differ from company to company. To find out more about salaries and employment packages, please 
discuss this with your prospective employer when you attend an interview. Do remember that a career choice should not be 
based on salary alone. You should also satisfy yourself that your careers can : </p>
<ul>
<li>Provide further study, training and career development </li>
<li>Offer security </li>
<li>Give you job satisfaction </li>
<li>Allow you to develop management potential </li>
</ul>
<p><b>MINING </b><a name="ENGINEERING "><b>ENGINEERING</b> </a></p>
<p>Once discovered and evaluated, minerals must be mined, brought to the surface and extracted from the waste rock. There are 
two principal types of mining : open pit and underground mining. In open pit mining methods, the overburden must be removed 
by stripping the surface rock and soil to expose the orebody, which can then be removed and processed. </p>
<p>Deep-level underground mining and large scale open pit mining are developments of the 20th century, made possible by mining 
technology, modern equipment and advanced minerals processing techniques. South Africa leads the world in deep-level 
mining technology. In order to maintain this level of development, a high standard of education and training of mining engineers 
is vital. South African university mining and minerals processing degrees and the training received on mines are exceptionally 
good, and are recognised world-wide. </p>
<p>Mining engineering is a challenging career. The mining engineer requires a good knowledge of mechanical, electrical and 
metallurgical engineering as well as geology, finance, economics and people management. </p>
<p><b>What does a mining engineer do?</b> </p>
<p>Mining engineers plan, design, construct, manage and operate mines and the facilities that are used to extract raw materials 
from the earth. </p>
<p>They are responsible for the economic and safe operation of mines. Some mining engineers work with geologists and 
metallurgical engineers to evaluate new ore deposits. Others are involved in the research and development of mining equipment 
and processes. Mining engineers can also be involved in the protection and rehabilitations of the environment. The ability to 
manage people forms an important part of the mining engineer's work and those who have leadership qualities will generally 
progress to senior positions in the mining industry. </p>
<p><b>What educational qualifications do you need?</b> </p>
<p>In order to gain entrance to study a Bsc degree in mining engineer at university, you will need a matriculation exemption 
certificate, normally with C symbols or above in mathematics and physical science on the higher grade. </p>
<p>Since the mining industry is becoming more technologically sophisticated, an interest in computer sciences and technical and 
engineering drawing is advantageous. </p>
<p>Newly qualified graduates in all the major engineering disciplines are given intensive on-the-job training to give them further 
practical and academic experience in order to prepare them for the Government Certificates of Competency, and to comply 
with requirements for possible registration with the South Africa Council of Professional Engineers. </p>
<p><a name="METALLURGICAL"><b>METALLURGICAL</b></a><b> ENGINEERING AND MINERALS PROCESSING</b> </p>
<p>Initially, the word metallurgy meant `the art of extracting metals from their ores&#148;, but it now has a much wider meaning as it 
includes the science of the structres and properties of metals and their allos, ceramics and polymers. This is the fascinating field 
of the metallurgist, who uses sicentific expertise and knowledge to extract and process minerals in rocks in concentrations of as 
little as five parts per million. </p>
<p>Mining, minerals processing and materials fabrication are vital to all industrialised countires and the aviation industry is a good 
example of this interrelationship. Aluminium, normaly used in aircraft, is replaced by titanium in planes that exceed Mach ll. 
This is because titanium has a higher resistance to extreme temperatures and stresses. The lockhead A-11 Intercepter fighter 
plane, capable of Mach 111, is said to contain up to 85 per cent titanium by weight in the structure. Titanium is as strong as 
steel and half the wieght. It does, however, require specialised fabrication techniques and is costly, as an aluminium alloy is 
used in larger aircrafts. </p>
<p>With regard to the car industry, carbon fibre brakes have been specifically designed for formula one racing cars, resulting in a 
weight saving of more than 60 per cent when compared to conventional brakes. </p>
<p><b>What does a metallurgical and minerals processing engineer do?</b> </p>
<p>Metallurgical engineers need specialised knowledge of the properties of a very wide range of materials. They must have a 
detailed understanding of the physical and chemical characteristics of minerals an dhow they react under different conditions. 
The function of the extractive metallurgist is to manage the process of ores, the extraction of the valuable metal or mineral and 
further benefication or refining. Metallurgists design, test, operate and manage minerals processing plants, and must be 
competent to use the latest scientific technology. In addition, there are good prospects for metallurgists in research and 
development. </p>
<p>Because minerals are finite and because some ore grades are decreasing, metallurgists need to recover as much of the mineral 
possible. Modern processing and manufacturing plants, therefore, use the most up-to-date analytical instruments and 
computers to help monitor processes and maximise efficiency. </p>
<p>The metallurgical engineer, like the mining engineer, is a highly trained person and between them, they work out the probability 
of mining and processing various mineral deposits. The undergraduate has the choice of becoming an extractive metallurgist in 
the minerals industry or of becoming a physical metallurgist. Some metallurgists prefer to take employment in research and 
development organisations or academic institutions. Leaders in the industry forsee that the metallurgical graduate will leave 
more and more of the everyday plant operations to trained technicians and technologists so that the graduate can take the lead 
in research, process and development and management. </p>
<p><b>What educational qualifications do you need?</b> </p>
<p>A matriculation exemption certificate from the Joint Matriculation Board, normally with C symbols or above on the higher 
grade in mathematics and physical science, are the basic entrance requirements to study metallurgy at university. An interest in 
technology and computes is useful. </p>
<p>The mining industry also employs chemical engineers and preference is given to chemical engineers who have taken the 
extractive metallurgy/minerals processing option at university. </p>
<p><a name="MECHANICAL"><b>MECHANICAL</b></a><b> AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING</b> </p>
<p>Modern mining techniques, machines and equipment are far removed from the simple `pick and shovel' operations of our 
pioneers. today's miners use sophisticated technology to do their jobs. As we move towards the 21st century, there is an ever 
increasing demand for minerals and metals to provide for our daily needs and meeting these rising production targets is a 
constant challenge! In this atmosphere of dynamism, mechanical and electrical engineers play vital roles. No mine could 
function without power and the machines that depend on it. The responsibility for providing this power and the associated 
facilities rests with the engineering department on the mine and the consulting engineers' department at head office. </p>
<p>This enterprising world of deep-level and large-scale open pit mining, automation, robotics, computer-aided design, 
hydropower and environmental control and manipulation provides the challenges that engineers and engineering departments 
must face and overcome. </p>
<p>Fifty years ago most of us would not have believed that man would set foot on the moon, or mine gold at nearly four 
kilometres beneath the earth's surface. There are few of us who know what the future holds, but it will not be long before 
automated robots with laser technology will assist with mining orebodies which are difficult or dangerous to extract. 
Mechanical and electrical engineers are and will be involved in these developments. </p>
<p>The mining industry needs mechanical and electrical engineers who can create, innovate and manage systems that will take us 
through to the 21st century. The ultimate objective of engineering is to ensure that production targets can be achieved- by 
providing systems technology and machinery that will do the job as efficiently and as safely as is possible. Such mining 
equipment may be electronic and computer controlled, hydraulic or pneumatic in operation, driven by overhead wires, trailing 
cable or batter, or by diesel engines and gas turbines. </p>
<p>As part of their academic training, mechanical engineers need to study the principles design and testing of a wide range of 
mechanical devices and the types of materials and metals used in the construction of these machines. </p>
<p>The field of electrical engineering is divided into two main areas: </p>
<ul>
<li>Heavy current electrical engineering which is concerned with electrical systems and large currents of electrical power </li>
<li>Light current electrical engineering (or electronics) which involves the design, operation and maintenance of circuits 
which use smaller amounts of electricity </li>
</ul>
<p>Because so many students choose to work in electronics, there is a shortage of specialists in heavy current electrical 
engineering and this means that career and promotional opportunities are very good in this field in the mining industry. </p>
<p><a name="HOW"><b>HOW</b></a><b> TO BECOME AN ELECTRICAL OR MECHANICAL ENGINEER</b> </p>
<p>There are two main routes that can be followed to become either an electrical or mechanical engineer. These branches of 
engineering can be studied at either a university or a technikon. The university route is for the student with good grades and 
ability in mathematics and physical science. University students are required to work six to eight weeks per year in industry. 
The technikon route, while having an academic side, tends to relate to theory to the practical side of engineering, thus making 
the theory easier to understand. Students whose aptitudes do not lie so much with academic study tend to follow the technikon 
route. Technikon training alternates employment with periods of full-time study. </p>
<p>A third route to becoming an engineer is to obtain an N6 certificate through a technical college. This is the route normally 
followed by school leavers who join the mining industry as apprentices. </p>
<p>A Government Certificate of Competency as electrical or mechanical engineer is a prerequisite for certain mine appointments. 
Only applicants in possession of a degree, T4 diploma or N6 certificate are permitted to write this examination after they have 
worked on a mine for two years. Graduates only have to write mining law whilst applicants in possession of a T4 or N6 must 
write both mining law and plant engineering. </p>
<p><b>Learner Officials (Engineering) - Technikon study</b> </p>
<p>The learner official schemes are designed to provide the necessary training and education for young matriculants to progress to 
managerial positions in a number of fields. </p>
<p>Matriculants with university entrance passes in mathematics and science can become mechanical and electrical engineers 
through the learner official scheme offered by some mining houses. the intake of mechanical/electrical engineering students is 
limited and only the best applicants are selected. the learner official scheme in engineering offers similar benefits to those in 
mining and metallurgy. </p>
<p>Learner officials are eligible to be chosen for bursaries to study mechanical or electrical engineering full-time at a university. 
Others receive four years pratical training, interspersed by annual theoretical technikon courses of five months which prepare 
them for the engineering diploma examination (mechanical or electrical). </p>
<p>After obtaining their diplomas, learner officials join university graduates as junior engineers on a two year training course in 
order to prepare them for the engineer's Certificate of Competency examination. On passing this examination they become 
eligible for appointments as section engineers. </p>
<p>After acquiring sectional managerial status, mechanical and electrical engineers can rise to decision-making positions in 
industry. </p>

<p><a name="LEARNER"><b>LEARNER</b></a><b> OFFICIALS MINING AND METALLURGY - (TECHNIKON STUDY)</b> </p>
<p>The learner official courses in the mining industry have been designed for matriculants with initiative and for those who are 
unable or do not want to study at university but would be able to attend technikon. Matriculants between the ages of 17 and 
24 who enter the mining industry as learner officials are one of the industry's main sources of senior staff. Career in the minerals 
industry offers opportunity, responsibility, work of tremendous interest and a good salary. </p>
<p>Matriculants can be engaged as learner officials in different engineering disciplines and may embark on structured training 
programmes lasting from three to six years. During this period, learner officials work approximately six months on a mine as 
part of the initial practical training. This completed, the learner officials have the option, according to their abilities, of following 
one of three routes: </p>
<ul>
<li>Promising students whose performance and ability indicate that they are capable of completing the university course in 
mining or metallurgy can apply for a bursary for full-time study </li>
<li>Subject to satisfactory performance, the learner official can enrol for the technikon Higher National Diploma course, 
comprising five months full-time study a year, for four years. The remainder of each of the years is spent gaining 
practical experience on mines </li>
<li>Those who do not like intensive study, but who are more practically orientated, can do the two year practical mining 
course to become shift bosses </li>
</ul>
<p>Learner officials are paid good salaries whilst they study. The company that employees them also pays any course fees and 
makes a contribution to the cost of prescribed books. </p>
<p>All technikon students in mining disciplines engaged by mining companies, members of the Chamber of Mines, have a 
structured training programme and are guaranteed the period of employment which is a prerequisite for the completion of their 
diploma. Many mining students who are at university receive a bursary which pays for tuition, residence fees and text books 
and in certain cases they also enjoy company benefits and receive a portion of their salary. Makes you think - doesn't it? </p>
<p>Another advantage of taking a mining related degree or diploma is that the student is prepared for the mine manager's 
Certificate of Competency and the other necessary government certificates or qualifications. In addition, from the day that a 
learner official is accepted as a trainee he receives all the benefits to which other mine employees are entitled. Some of these 
benefits include : </p>
<ul>
<li>Attractive training courses which provide low-cost, single quarter accommodation and meals </li>
<li>Subsidised accommodation for married employees </li>
<li>Generous leave allocations </li>
<li>Insurance, pension, medical and provident benefits </li>
</ul>
<p>For a more detailed description of what a career entails in mining engineering and metallurgy, we suggest you make an 
appointment with the lecturing staff at the university's and/or technikon's mining or metallurgy departments to find out more 
about the subject content of degree and diploma courses. You could also contact the Manpower and Education Department 
of the Chamber of Mines for career information. </p>
<p>Technikon entrance requirements are as follows for learner official courses: </p>
<p><b>Diploma courses in mining</b> </p>
<p>A Senior Certificate with an E symbol for mathematics on the higher grade or a D symbol on the standard grade. </p>
<p><b>Diploma courses in surveying, economic geology, extractive metallurgy and assaying</b> </p>
<p>A Senior Certificate with an E symbol for mathematics and physical science on the higher grade or D symbols on the standard 
grade. </p>
<p><a name="GEOLOGY"><b>GEOLOGY</b></a> </p>
<p>The general public often pictures the geologist as a romantic individual who spends his time driving around in a 
four-wheel-drive vehicle and prospecting, hammer in hand, in the veld. This is the picturesque side to geology, and although it 
still exists today, most exploration or field geologists are equipped with modern scientific instruments to assist in the search for 
new mineral deposits. </p>
<p>Most minerals occur in specific settings and it is the geologist's task to identify and find these deposits. The geologist's trained 
eye draws a wealth of conclusions from borehole core samples obtained from the earth's crust. </p>
<p>Although there are a number of economically important minerals contained in the soil and rocks in your garden at home, one of 
the reasons that they are not mined is that they are not present in sufficiently adequate concentrations to be extracted 
profitably. The geologist concerns himself with minerals that have been sufficiently concentrated by geological processes to be 
mined economically. </p>
<p><b>What do geologists do?</b> </p>
<p>Geologists use the following techniques to locate new mineral deposits: </p>
<ul>
<li>Remote sensing, photogeology and geological mapping </li>
<li>Geophysics - magnetic, radiometric, electrical, seismic and gravity surveys </li>
<li>Geochemisty. </li>
</ul>
<p>Once a mineral deposit is located, borehole drilling and logging take place in order to define and quantify the grade and size of 
the deposit. In this way, it is established whether or not mining of the orebody is possible. </p>
<p>In the mining industry, geologists fall into two broad categories: </p>
<ul>
<li>EXPLORATION GEOLOGISTS - who are involved in the search for and evaluation of new ore deposits, using one 
or more of the above techniques </li>
<li>MINING GEOLOGISTS - who are involved with the daily duties of manning geological departments on mines. The 
work, which is concerned with establishing the basic geological and structural properties of the orebody at the mine, 
involves surface and underground mapping in conjunction with logging and sample analysis. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>What educational qualifications do you need?</b> </p>
<p>Although there is at present no statutory training period geologists after university, experience gained on the job in early 
working years develops a geologist's skills. Some companies do have a formal training period for mining geologists. A 
BSc(Hons) degree or equivalent in geology, with good academic and practical training, entitles graduates to register as 
professional geologists with the South African Council for Natural Scientists. </p>
<p>Promotion is based on merit and experience, and the ability to do the job well allows individuals to rise to senior positions on 
mines and head offices of the mining finance houses. </p>
<p>Some mining houses offer a learner official course in geology which includes technikon study. </p>
<p><a name="APPRENTICES"><b>APPRENTICES</b></a><b>/LEARNER MINERS</b> </p>
<p>The mining industry offers apprentice training in all popular trades: fitting and turning, mechanical, electrical, plating, rigging and 
others. Apprentice training centres on the mines are equipped with the most modern training facilities to ensure that the 
specialists that they turnout are a credit to the industry. </p>
<p>Many apprentices start off with a standard eight education, but higher qualifications provide greater opportunities. There is no 
reason why an apprentice should not become a junior engineer through further study. </p>
<p>The duration of an apprenticeship depends on the trade chose, educational standard and the person's ability to pass a trade 
test (with the aid of classes at technical colleges). An apprentice who has an N2 can complete a four year apprenticeship in 
two and a half years, or a three year apprenticeship in on and a half years. No apprenticeship takes longer than four years. </p>
<p>Inexpensive accommodation and recreational facilities are provided. </p>
<p><b>What do apprentices do?</b> </p>
<p>Fitters are responsible for the maintenance of all mining machinery, including the assembling and fitting of new components. </p>
<p>Fitter and turners do all of the above and, in addition, use a wide variety of power operated tools such as lathes and milling, 
drilling and shaping machines. </p>
<p>Electricians inspect and maintain all the electrical equipment on mining machinery and in plants. They also lay cables and install 
transformers. </p>
<p>Platers are responsible for cutting, welding and fashioning steel into parts for mining machinery, conveyor systems and 
underground and surface vehicles. They also carry out pipe and construction work on surface and underground. </p>
<p>Diesel mechanics maintain diesel vehicles, including the heavy earth-moving equipment found on open cast mines. </p>
<p><b>What does a miner do?</b> </p>
<p>A miner is in charge of a working section using, at times, a number of sophisticated mining machines. He also has between 30 - 
100 assistants under his supervision. As mining becomes more mechanised, so the challenges become greater. The miner is 
responsible for safety and productivity in his work section and for conveying management's objectives to all employees under 
him. </p>
<p>The mineral that is being mined must generally be blasted and removed using machinery such as scraper winches and 
mechanical loaders. Underground support systems must be installed in carefully calculated patters before clearing and the next 
phase of mining operations takes place. </p>
<p>Learner miners are trained at fully-equipped training centres in both the practical and theoretical aspects of mining. The 
Chamber of Mines operates 10 training colleges for learner gold miners and two training colleges for learner coal miners. </p>
<p><b>What do you need to become a learner miner?</b> </p>
<p>If you are a male between the ages of 18 - 30 years, physically healthy with a minimum standard eight qualification, you could 
make a success of mining. Regardless of qualifications, all candidates must pass an aptitude test and undergo an interview. </p>
<p>To become a miner, it takes approximately 12 to 15 months of training to work the necessary number of shifts and to acquire 
the mandatory blasting certificate. Most of the training is practical, on-the-job training. Opportunities do exist for promotion to 
shift boss and mine overseer on the basis of merit and the necessary certification as laid down in mining legislation. </p>
<p><b>What are the benefits?</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>You are paid a salary while you learn </li>
<li>Learner miners enjoy pleasant, inexpensive accommodation and meals at all of the Chamber of Mines training colleges </li>
<li>Miners who are prepared to continue with further study can reach managerial positions </li>
<li>Married employees are provided with accommodation. </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="ENVIRONMENTAL"><b>ENVIRONMENTAL</b></a><b> ENGINEERING</b> </p>
<p>The improvement of safety and working conditions in South African mines has always been a priority of the mining industry. 
The environmental engineering department on a mine advices mine management on all aspects of airflow, heat, humidity and 
dust control. Ventilation and refrigeration are two of the most vital processes that fall under this department's responsibility. </p>
<p>Ventilation in deep-level mining involves forcing immense volumes of air through a network of underground shafts and tunnels. 
The process requires gigantic fans, huge electric motors and underground refrigeration plants. All large gold, coal and base 
metal mines have ventilation departments and the specialist staff employed in these departments measure and report on 
environmental conditions. They are also involved in the planning and design of ventilation and refrigeration systems. The use of 
ice as a means of cooling deep mines was established in 1986, after tests demonstrated that ice can be pneumatically 
conveyed over long distances. Another advantage of ice is that freezing desalinates mine water and thus provides clean water. 
A dense ice slurry can be sent underground and melted to yield clean, cold water at temperatures just above 0&#186;C. Two mines 
have already started to introduce the large-scale use of ice and the ERPM gold mine has a refrigeration plant that will 
eventually make 6 000 tons of ice per day. </p>
<p>The Chamber of Mines operates environmental training courses for new employees and experienced officials. After a period of 
about one year, the trainees should obtain their Elementary and Practical Mine Environmental Control Certificates. After a 
further two or three years study, they should be able to obtain the Advanced Certificate of Mine Environmental Control. 
Training does not stop here and additional in-house training is given to keep abreast of technological developments in 
computer applications, heat transfer theory, thermodynamics, refrigeration and airflow. The University of the Witwatersrand 
offers a Msc degree course in environmental engineering. Post-graduate study is also available in rock mechanics. </p>
<p><b>SURVEYING</b> </p>
<p>&#147;Surveying is the art of making such measurements and observations as are necessary to determine the position of areas and 
volumes of natural and man-made features on the earth's surface as well as underground, and representing the results on plans 
or maps drawn to a suitable scale&#148;. </p>
<p>The mine surveyor carries out routine practical survey duties in the mornings so that he can prepare and update all statutory 
surface and underground mine plans. He determines directions underground and measures up the areas and volumes of rock 
blasted by production crews. In addition he takes regular samples of all the reef or orebody exposed in the underground 
excavations in order to determine which areas are payable. In the afternoons, back in the office, the surveyor calculates and 
computer processes the survey data acquired during the morning and every month, measures the quantity of work done by the 
mining contractors underground and calculates their contract earnings. During his initial training the surveyor becomes 
competent in all aspects of practical surveying including the use of calculators, computers and surveying equipment. He is also 
training through the whole spectrum of mine valuation, from sampling to ore reserve computations and viability studies. </p>
<p>Those men wishing to enter this challenging career must be matriculated or have an equivalent certificate with a pass in 
mathematics. Promotion is dependent upon merit and the attainment of the required qualifications or Certificate of 
Competency. The University of the Witwatersrand offers a degree course in mine surveying. </p>
<p><b>SAMPLING AND ASSAYING</b> </p>
<p>In any type of mining operation it is important to know, on a regular basis, how much of a mineral or metal is being recovered. 
This enables management to determine whether the recovery process is efficient and where losses are occurring. Sampling and 
assaying is the process whereby ore samples are used to ascertain the value of an ore deposit. The assayer is responsible for 
the labority analysis of samples. This must be done quickly and accurately, using modern equipment and sophisticated 
techniques. </p>
<p>Potential candidates should be matriculated with average passes in mathematics and physical science and have an interest in 
chemistry. Further study towards a diploma or degree in chemistry will be encouraged. Samplers collect the ore from 
underground for assaying and, although a school leaving certificate is recommended, persons with lower qualifications would 
be considered. </p>
<p><a name="ADMINISTRATION"><b>ADMINISTRATION</b></a><b> AND MEDICAL SERVICES</b> </p>
<p>Modern mines run on up-to-date business lines. This means that the mining industry offers the applicant a wide variety of 
commercial positions. If you are interested in a career in the business world you should select the one that best fits your 
knowledge and skills. To do this, you must find out as much as possible about each of the careers available, before making a 
final decision. You will need some of the following attributes to be successful in the commercial sector: </p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to understand and interpret figures </li>
<li>Good communication skills </li>
<li>The capacity to work with and manage people </li>
<li>Initiative, conscientiousness and determination </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Accountancy and Commerce</b> </p>
<p>The two branches of accountancy most in demand are : </p>
<ul>
<li>Chartered accountancy </li>
<li>Cost and management accountancy </li>
</ul>
<p>Either of these branches of accounting requires a period of part-time study after attaining a commerce degree. Persons with a 
broad based B Com degree are often in demand by mining companies. </p>
<p><b>Personnel Management</b> </p>
<p>Personnel work includes the following : </p>
<ul>
<li>Manpower planning </li>
<li>Recruitment and selection of staff </li>
<li>Establishment and operation of medical and pension schemes </li>
<li>Monitoring and evaluation of employee efficiency </li>
<li>Attention to employees' welfare needs </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Training</b> </p>
<p>Training is an ongoing process; its function is to improve employees' job performances by improving skills. Training staff liaise 
with managers to establish in which areas skills can be improved and implement courses to achieve this objective. Training staff 
also have to supervise the training and development of human resources on the mine. </p>
<p><b>Industrial Relations</b> </p>
<p>Industrial relations personnel are concerned with the establishment and maintenance of systems of negotiations, consultation 
and communication aimed at promoting healthy relationships between management and employees. </p>
<p>Their work involves : </p>
<ul>
<li>Negotiating agreements with trade union representatives on procedures and conditions of employment </li>
<li>Devising and implementing disciplinary and grievance procedures </li>
<li>The interpretation and implementation of agreements and labour legislation </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Medical Services</b> </p>
<p>The mining industry, which pioneered employee compensation in South Africa, continues to be a leader in the field of insurance 
cover for employees and their dependants through the Rand Mutual Assurance Company, an affiliate of the Chamber of 
Mines. </p>
<p>The mining houses run many well-equipped hospitals for mine employees throughout South Africa. In addition to the normal 
treatment of disease and injuries, mine hospitals actively promote public health and preventative medicine and thus offer good 
all-round training to young medical personnel. To encourage further training amongst mine medical officials (doctors), a number 
of fellowships are awarded every year for post-graduate training in South Africa and overseas. </p>
<p><a name="BENEFITS "><b>BENEFITS</b></a></p>
<p><b>Training and Career Advancement</b> </p>
<p>Many millions of rands are spent annually on training which is carried out by individual mines, by mining groups at centralised 
training centres, at training colleges and universities. Training in the mining industry is both practical and theoretical and all 
employees are encouraged to develop their full potential in all job categories. Most careers in the minerals industry offer scope 
for career advancement and the development of leadership abilities coupled with responsibility and security. </p>
<p><b>Salaries, Leave and Other Benefits</b> </p>
<p>Salaries and wages in the mining industry compare well with those in other industries and the mining industry offers many 
advantages that other employers would find difficult to match. </p>
<p>All skilled employees get a minimum of 21 calendar days holiday leave a year which can rise substantially depending on 
circumstances. Officials and union men receive a holiday leave allowance and this means a double salary cheque. Sick leave is 
also very generous and can be extended at the discretion of mine management. In general, sick leave benefits are far superior 
to all other sections of commerce and industry. </p>
<p>Mine medical benefit societies provide excellent hospital and medical facilities. Pension and provident fund benefits are 
comprehensive and afford high security for mining industry employees who retire or take early retirement due to ill health or for 
the dependants of deceased employees. </p>
<p><a name="SAFETY"><b>SAFETY</b></a> </p>
<p>The Mine Safety Division of the Chamber of Mines spearheads one of the longest-running mine safety campaigns in the world. 
The campaign aims to establish and maintain a climate and attitude conducive to the elimination of mine accidents. </p>
<p>Safety is the industry's top priority and during the past decade the industry has been rewarded by a sharp fall in casualty rates. </p>
<p>To assist mine managements in improving the implementation of safety measures on mines, the Mine Safety Division operates 
the Mine Safety Management System, which caters for the often unique conditions found in South African mines. The extent to 
which a mine implements this system is assessed regularly and the mine is rated accordingly. </p>
<p>Since deep-level mining on the scale now common in South African gold mines is not practised in other countries, safety 
comparisons with mining elsewhere can be misleading. But our coal mining industry's safety record has compared favourably 
with other countries. </p>
<p>The safety competitions organised by the Mine Safety Division are an effective method of promoting safety consciousness 
because of the competitive spirit they engender. Amongst the most sought after of the safety awards is the &#147;Millionaire Shield&#148; 
which is presented to mines achieving a million consecutive fatality-free man-shifts. </p>
<p>Twenty-two South African gold, coal and other mines that are members of the Chamber of Mines achieved a million 
consecutive fatality-free man-shifts in 1995. One gold mine gained this distinction twice in the year, resulting in a total of 24 
millionaire achievements in the year. </p>
<p><b>ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL AND REHABILITATION</b> </p>
<p>Mining nearly always produces large quantities of was, both from open pit and underground mining operations. Added to this 
is the fact that many minerals processing operations have waste sands and slimes as by-products of the extraction process. </p>
<p>The industry counteracts these negative aspects in several ways. In some mining operations, waste material can be channelled 
back into the earth, which is called `backfilling'. The pollution problems created by wind and rain erosion of mine dumps are 
solved by the Chamber of Mines' vegetation unit which undertakes the planting of grass and other vegetation on these dumps 
and also on slimes dams. The process also improves the appearance of these man-made features! </p>
<p>In the case of open cast mining, before any operation can begin, an environmental inventory must be compiled along with a 
rehabilitation plan - both of which must satisfy the Government Mining Engineer. Some large open pit base metal mines may 
remove up to 350 000 tons of rock per day, of which a large percentage is waste. This process, repeated for many years, 
leaves a large hole in the ground. In some circumstances, open pit mines are filled with fresh water and turned into recreational 
amenities. In all cases, however, large-scale land rehabilitation takes place and it may cost many thousands to rehabilitate one 
hectare of land. </p>
<p>Environmental protection is an integral part of the mining process. Every year, the South African mining industry spends 
millions of rands on environmental control and rehabilitation and researches more efficient ways of ensuring that mining does 
not cause unnecessary environmental degradation. </p>
<p><a name="BURSARIES"><b>BURSARIES</b></a><b> IN THE MINING INDUSTRY</b> </p>
<p><b>The Mining Houses</b> </p>
<p>The mining houses make available generous bursaries and scholarships to employees, matriculants and students. The emphasis 
for bursaries is on the professions which are most essential to the industry : mining engineering, metallurgical engineering, 
chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and mining geology. </p>
<p>Applications for bursaries should be made direct to the bursary department of the following mining houses : &#160;</p>

<p><a name="MainIntro"><strong>1. INTRODUCTION </strong></a></p>
<p>South Africa is settling down to its acceptance internationally, and to majority government. The withdrawal of the National 
Party from the government of national unity has meant that the country is now a conventional democracy. Greater coherence is 
being seen in policy development as a result. The transformation that has been taking place in all sectors of society is still 
occurring, but at a less frenetic pace. Contrary to the expectations of many, the government has embarked on a reasonably 
business-oriented economic policy, which has seen inflation fall to its lowest levels in many years. However, the high level of 
crime has had a marked impact on economic growth.<br>
</p>
<p>The coal mining industry has continued to grow, buoyed by a strong international steam coal market. The findings of the 
Commission of Inquiry into safety and health in the mining industry, which were released in April 1995, are gradually being 
implemented, though it is too early to assess their effects. A new Mine Health and Safety Act was promulgated in June 1996, 
but it has not been implemented yet. The coal mining and combustion industries are increasingly perceived as dangerous and 
polluting, and have much to do to repair their images.<br>
</p>
<p>The Department of Minerals and Energy (DME) released a Green Paper on energy during the year, and the White Paper is 
expected in shortly. A feature of government's energy policy is that its policy towards the coal industry is unchanged, with the 
industry continuing to operate according to market constraints.<br>
</p>
<p>A matter of great concern is that many government departments, including those relevant to the coal mining and combustion 
industries, have lost, and continue to lose, qualified staff owing to pressure on departments to cut costs, fears related to the 
implementation of affirmative action programmes, and sustained emigration of professionals because of high crime levels.<br>
</p>
<p><a name="MR_D"><b>2. COAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT </b></a></p>
<p>As part of the lead up to preparation of this report, and in order to assess the support for a move to better co-ordinate coal 
research being carried out in South Africa, a meeting was held, involving a wide variety of companies and organisations with an 
interest in the matter. Limited initial interest was shown in co-ordinated research, and the necessity for such a meeting will be 
continually evaluated. Owing to the many similarities in the interests of the South African and Australian coal producers, efforts 
have been made during the year to forge links between research organisations in the two countries. Discussions are still at a 
preliminary stage. <br>
</p>
<p>Unlike the conditions prevailing in the country's precious metal mines, many techniques and much equipment developed 
elsewhere can be adapted for use in South African coal mines. The mining industry's R&amp;D thus tends to be focussed on 
adaptation, rather than on development of new equipment. The R&amp;D generally falls into two categories, as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>A Safety in Mines Research Advisory Committee (SIMRAC) programme, carried out under the aegis of the DME and 
funded by a levy on the mines; this programme concentrates on work aimed at addressing the health and safety issues of 
the industry. </li>
<li>Work which mining houses arrange to have carried out in-house, using external agencies as necessary, as part of their 
own internal programmes of research. </li>
</ul>
<p>A programme of elective, cost-shared research, whereby the Chamber of Mines arranged, on behalf of its mining company 
members, for projects to be undertaken by external agencies has recently come to an end. The mining companies now arrange 
directly for their research needs to be met.<br>
</p>
<p>The government no longer supports coal research directly with funds from the fiscus. It provides funding for the universities for 
the whole spectrum of research, and provides funds to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) for strategic, 
exploratory R&amp;D, and for capacity building purposes. The DME commissions research on policy issues. Other government 
departments sponsor environmental projects, mainly to do with the rehabilitation of abandoned mine sites where responsibility 
for cleanup cannot be assigned to specific companies.<br>
</p>
<p>The mining industry and the statutory Water Research Commission co-operate through the Co-ordinating Committee for 
Mining-Related Water Research in carrying out several projects of an environmental nature, some of which relate to coal.<br>
</p>
<p>As there is only one major electricity generating utility (small amounts of electricity are generated by some of the larger cities), 
this utility, Eskom is really the only organisation that undertakes large-scale combustion-related research.<br>
</p>
<p>South African coal-related research is summarised on the pages that follow. An appendix describes each research project in 
greater detail, with an indication being given of the potential for collaboration. Owing to the proprietary nature of much of the 
research carried out directly by individual companies, only limited information from such projects has been included within this 
report.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="MS_H"><b>2.1. Safety and Health</b></a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="ME_f_d">2.1.1 <u>Explosions, fires and dust </u></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While South African collieries are generally not very gassy, methane explosions do occur infrequently, and are often associated 
with a high loss of life and damage to the mine. A recent analysis identified friction generated by cutting picks as the major 
ignition source in the South African coal mining industry, accounting for 68% of the known causes of ignitions of methane. The 
steady increase in frictional ignitions has followed the introduction of continuous miners in the early 1970s and has more than 
balanced the equally noticeable decrease in the percentage of incidents caused by blasting. Consequently, there have been 
several projects aimed at reducing the methane hazard, and fire and explosion risks. Dust is not only a potential cause of 
explosions, but also a significant health hazard, and methods for improved dust suppression are thus under investigation.<br>
</p>
<p>A short project reviewed methane prediction techniques, and commented on their applicability in South Africa. The conclusion 
was drawn that complex prediction tools are not required under normal conditions in South African collieries. Training 
guidelines are being prepared to enable supervisory and maintenance staff to use electricity more safely underground. More 
than two thirds of methane ignitions are caused by the friction generated by cutting picks in continuous miners, and a project 
aimed at reducing the risk of frictional ignitions made recommendations regarding a training and information kit, a 
machine-mounted active suppression system and the need for an effective wet-head. Another project seeks to improve the 
ventilation of continuous miner headings, which, if successful, will reduce explosion risks and benefit the health of underground 
mine workers. A face ventilation effectiveness system has already been developed. Scrubber designs are being upgraded to 
improve their effectiveness in capturing the dust generated by mechanical miners. A further project is aimed at improved 
methods for ventilation of mined-out areas. A less frequent, though potential, cause of methane explosions is the battery of 
safety cap lamps. A prototype has been designed that is intrinsically safe. A current project is aimed at suppressing explosions 
when they do occur, with encouraging preliminary results. Both a machine-mounted active suppression system, and a 
dispersed barrier system are being designed.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="MT_m">2.1.2 <u>Transport and machinery</u> </a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transport and machinery accidents account for a third of all fatalities and injuries on South African coal mines. In order to 
reduce worker exposure to the risk of explosions and rockfalls, a project is aimed at fitting remote control systems to 
continuous mining machines presently in operation. Another project will provide guidelines for the development of training 
manuals for the safe use of high-risk underground machinery.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="MSupport">2.1.3 <u>Support </u></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Falls of ground are a significant cause of accidents underground, and accounted for over 80% of fatalities there in 1995 (24% 
in 1994). Thus the underlying reasons for unsafe acts or neglect that lead to roof falls or sidewall accidents are under 
investigation, with the intention of developing training programmes and improving communication procedures. The Salamon 
formula for the design of coal pillars has been found to be inadequate when applied to coal seams outside of the original 
geographical range. Collapsed pillars are being investigated with a view to improved pillar design. Another aspect of this 
project concerns the effect of discontinuities on coal pillar strength, so as to allow pillar layouts to take account of 
discontinuities. Different roof support methodologies from South Africa and elsewhere are being reviewed so as to improve the 
safety of roof support, particularly in the face area.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="MCommcn">2.1.4 <u>Communication </u></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fatal and other injuries related to an underground explosion are not always the direct result of the explosion, but are also 
caused by disorientation of the initial survivors, particularly if communication and lighting equipment are damaged in the blast, 
and visibility is poor. Several explosion-resistant systems are being designed that should also enhance communication under 
normal operating conditions.<br>
</p>
<p>Paging and expert systems are being used to enable personnel and equipment identification. An emergency speech 
communication system on escape routes is also under investigation. Another project aims at enabling mineworkers to locate 
refuge bays using radio frequency transmitters located in refuge bays and on roadways. Theoretical investigations indicate that 
a single transmitter per section, located in the refuge bay will be sufficient, and experimental work underground has shown that 
propagation of radio waves through a radius of 500 m is possible, with greater distances feasible where there are no 
obstructions. The ability to communicate and log data remotely from equipment sited in hazardous areas is also the subject of a 
research project.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="MProd"><b>2.2. Productivity</b></a> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="MMining">2.2.1 <u>Mining </u></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Explosives are used to break large quantities of coal, especially in opencast mines. The production of fine particles (fines) by 
blasting reduces the yield of usable coal. Two projects are aimed at developing blasting techniques that minimise the quantity of 
fines produced. An empirical model has been developed for the evaluation of the sources of fines and the most sensitive 
parameters in their generation. It is currently being tested in the field. A means of visual evaluation of the effects of changing 
blasting parameters has been used successfully under both laboratory and field conditions. One of the mining companies has, in 
collaboration with a manufacturer, developed an explosive that is less prone to misfiring, although some explosive energy has 
had to be sacrificed. It had earlier been found that a high-strength detonator was ineffective in preventing misfiring.<br>
</p>
<p>Hard intrusions, such as dykes and sandstone, reduce the effectiveness and life span of continuous miners and longwall 
shearers. Projects are in progress to activate the cutters on these machines to enable them to cut through hard coals more 
economically and also through intrusions. A system is being developed to monitor the activity of shuttle cars and continuous 
miners in a production section. A number of trials are being conducted on continuous haulages. <br>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="MP_m">2.2.2 <u>Processing and metallurgy </u></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Projects are being undertaken in the fields of coal fines recovery, processing and transportation methods, metallurgy and the 
production of chemical feedstocks.<br>
</p>
<p>In addition to the projects described above that are seeking to reduce the production of coal fines, some possibilities are being 
investigated for recovery of the fines that are produced, in order to provide saleable coal and to reprocess the dumps that have 
already accumulated. In one case, a free jet co-current feed aeration mechanism to a flotation process has been implemented 
effectively. A model of the overall process is being developed so that new designs can be optimised and appropriate control 
systems can be developed. Another project aims to settle out coal slurry solids in drying beds, and removing the solids thus 
dewatered as saleable coal.<br>
</p>
<p>The amenability of various coals to separation by jigging is being investigated on a pilot-scale pneumatic jig. Coal softening 
technology has been looked at as a possible means of improving extraction productivity. The uniaxial compression strength of 
coal was reduced by 50 per cent. Research is being conducted into the hydraulic transportation and hoisting of coarse coal 
over long distances. The research is somewhat novel in that coarse, rather than fine, coal is the subject of the investigations, 
and that water is the only transport medium under consideration.<br>
</p>
<p>Coal is used as a char or coke as a reductant and energy source in several metallurgical processes. Owing to a deficiency in 
high-grade coking coals in South Africa, chars are increasingly being used instead. A wide range of Southern African coals 
have been characterised on the basis of their reactivity as chars using thermogravimetric analysis. The reasons for the 
differences in their reactivity are being investigated, with one aim being to form a basis for predicting the reactivity of untested 
material. A related project is concerned with the determination of what properties of a char are responsible for its reactivity in 
the smelting of ferrochrome. One of the country's steel producers has ongoing projects to characterise and evaluate the coking 
and non-coking coals it uses, and to evaluate and optimise the quality of coke it produces.<br>
</p>
<p>The South African chemical industry has no natural sources of aromatic compounds, and thus feedstocks have to be imported. 
It has been found possible to achieve very high conversion rates for the direct liquefaction of a volatile coal from the Northern 
Province of South Africa in the preparation of a stream rich in aromatic feedstocks. Attempts are being made to find backers 
for a feasibility study for a commercial scale plant.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="MEnergy">2.2.3 <u>Energy </u></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since coal accounts for more than 90% of South African electricity production, thermal efficiency of coal-fired power stations 
is vital to the national power generation utility, Eskom, and the nation. As part of its ongoing updating of its database of coal 
combustion characteristics, Eskom is seeking to optimise its combustion of coal, and to predict future problems. The database 
now allows the diagnosis of existing combustion-related problems on Eskom's plant, and allows predictions of problems on the 
basis of laboratory tests. Coals from other Southern African countries and elsewhere are now accommodated as well, thus 
enabling correlation with other power utilities. The government Department of Minerals and Energy (DME) funds the 
publication of an annual bulletin which gives certain physical and chemical properties of commercial products from producing 
South African collieries. An ongoing project at the University of the Witwatersrand is characterising Southern African coals in 
order to optimise production, utilisation, storage and environmental protection.<br>
</p>
<p>In order to enhance its coal combustion research, Eskom is developing a pilot-scale combustion research plant. The scope of 
its three-dimensional modelling facility is being expanded in order to enhance the evaluation of coal feedstocks, optimise 
furnace operation and minimise environmental emissions. It is also researching the applicability of fluidised bed combustion and 
coal gasification technology to low-grade South African coals. The DME sponsored a project in which 14 coal-fired industrial 
boilers of various types were tested to ascertain their operating efficiency. It was found that they seldom operate at their 
designed efficiency, and several recommendations were made to improve efficiencies. An Eskom project is concerned with the 
impacts of ash on all aspects of a coal-fired electricity generating facility.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="MEnvment"><b>2.3 Environment </b></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Environmental impacts from coal-related industries in South Africa are caused by opencast mining pits, subsidence of 
underground workings, combustion of and water drainage from coal and discard heaps, emissions from coal combustion by 
both electricity generation plants and household users, transportation of coal, and the chemicals industry that uses coal as a 
raw material. There are a few projects concerned with reusing discard coals, and a shift towards regarding them as an asset 
for potential future use. Household users of coal account for only 4% of South African coal consumption, but about 20 - 25% 
of particulate emissions. In order to reduce pollution by these small users, the DME has instituted a low-smoke coal 
programme.<br>
</p>
<p>Eskom is using a waste management programme to characterise the source distribution and trace chemicals in its power plants. 
A database and probabilistic distribution model will be developed in order to minimise and manage the environmental impacts 
of the chemical species in airborne, aqueous and solid discharges.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="MSurface">2.3.1 <u>Surface </u></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spontaneous combustion of coal and carbonaceous waste affects mining, storage and transportation. Research has been 
carried out using various methods to model the processes occurring in coal heaps in order to improve the design of coal 
stockpiles and dumps, thus minimising environmental impacts and meeting the relevant legal requirements. In one case, the 
research has reached the stage of transferring the developed expertise to industry.<br>
</p>
<p>Water-related environmental research receives a great deal of attention, not least because water is a scarce resource in South 
Africa. A study is being undertaken to examine the feasibility of diverting a river over a backfilled opencast mine. Covers 
constructed from coal discards, clay and topsoil in layers of various thicknesses and with varying gradients are being evaluated 
for used in the rehabilitation of abandoned opencast mines and waste dumps. There are projects concerned with the 
monitoring of groundwater pollution from the leaching of coal stockpiles and ash dams to determine the long-term pollution 
risks of stockpiling and control the discharge of heavy metals into the environment. Leaching has been found to vary markedly 
between the stockpiles at different power stations. The use of a particular natural wetland for assimilating acid mine drainage 
was investigated. It was found that the system was overloaded in terms of volume flow rate and chemical loading, but that the 
implementation of certain changes to the chemical treatment plant upstream would allow the wetland to function well. An 
artificial wetland is being used at an old colliery to ameliorate acid mine drainage with a view to using the system at abandoned 
mines. A passive water treatment system is being designed to remove acids and to use naturally occurring carbon sources to 
reduce sulphates. Significant sulphate reduction has already been observed. An attempt is being made to utilise gypsiferous 
mine water to irrigate croplands. A computer model and small-scale field trials have already been carried out.<br>
</p>
<p>The use of power station fly ash is being investigated as a potential fertiliser for the forestry industry. If successful, it will put a 
source of pollution to good use. An envisaged project is aimed at demonstrating the use of fly ash to backfill both opencast 
and underground mines so as to provide cost-effective, reduced pollution discharge from power stations closely tied to coal 
mines. The pozzolanic (cement-producing) characteristics and rain water infiltration into a particular fly ash dump are being 
investigated in order to better manage ash dams using the dry ash disposal method.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="MAtmos">2.3.2 <u>Atmosphere </u></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The burning of coal to generate electricity is responsible for a large proportion of the atmospheric pollutants emitted in South 
Africa. Thus Eskom has several projects under way to monitor the amounts and nature of the gases and solids released, as 
well as to reduce the impacts on the environment that these pollutants cause. Most of Eskom's power stations use electrostatic 
precipitators (ESPs) to filter dust from the flue gases. As a number of the ESPs will need to be upgraded in order to meet 
envisaged future emission requirements, several projects concern this equipment. Furthermore, the use of bag filters as an

</p>
<p>As part of its strategic planning initiatives, Eskom has an ongoing programme to monitor the ambient air pollution and its effect 
on air quality at a range of distances from its power stations, and to compare the power stations with other sources of 
pollution. The meteorology around several of the utility's power stations in Mpumalanga province is measured in order to 
model dispersion of emissions. A database for boundary level climatology has been established in conjunction with the Council 
for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). Atmospheric chemical processes, in the context not only of coal-fired electricity 
generation, but also natural processes and biomass burning, are being investigated in the same region in order to model and 
predict environmental impacts, such as acid rain. Computational fluid dynamics is being used to model two-phase flow within 
various fluid streams in order to optimise plant design. A scanning project is aimed at identifying appropriate technologies for 
gaseous detoxification. Thus far, the project has been limited to cost estimation and the examination of various technical issues, 
as legislation does not currently require the technology. Porous acrylic bag filters are being studied in order to develop a 
cost-effective technology to remove 99.99% of particulates and toxic gases from flue gas. A pilot plant has been erected and 
commissioned.<br>
</p>
<p>A small project is concerned with identifying potential technologies to upgrade the existing ESPs. Compact hybrid particulate 
collectors, wet ESP and electrostatically enhanced core separators have been identified as having potential. Another project is 
investigating the optimisation of vibrating (rapping) ESPs in order to remove the collected ash, thus enhancing ESP efficiency. 
It has been found that, if the flow within ESPs is skewed, particulate emissions may be cut significantly. The applicability of this 
concept is currently under investigation.<br>
</p>
<p>Projects concerned with the impact on water supplies of ash dumps were discussed in the preceding section. These dumps are 
also a source of dust pollution, and research is being carried out to evaluate windblown ash models in order to monitor and 
minimise ash dispersion. Initial results are promising.<br>

<p><a name="MLSF">2.3.1 <u>Low-Smoke Fuel</u></a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The low-smoke coal programme encompasses investigations into overall energy scenarios, development of low-smoke coal, 
and technical and sociological aspects of implementing the programme. The main aim of the programme is to replace smoky 
household coal with suitable low-smoke fuels.<br>
</p>
<p>While indirect apportionment studies have established that the dominant sources of atmospheric particulates in areas where 
household use of coal is high are coal smoke and road dust, a direct, receptor-based study is being carried out over a 
two-year period. The DME is developing an integrated energy decision support model to design a computerised simulation 
package to predict the impacts of any of the variables that affect health risks associated with household coal use. A 
specification for a low-smoke fuel, which describes physical, chemical and performance characteristics and maximum emission 
levels is being drafted. A system to sample particulate and gas emissions from stoves and braziers has been designed, and is 
being used to characterise emissions from potential low-smoke fuels. Studies are being carried out of potential low-smoke coal 
producers and distributors to determine their ability to produce fuel that meets the specification, sustain production in sufficient 
volumes, and distribute the fuel satisfactorily. Established companies have been assessed and businesses without a track 
record are in the process of being assessed. It has been found that the manufacturing capability exists to produce sufficient 
low-smoke coal, but that distribution of the new fuel will be a critical problem. Low-smoke fuels based on other raw materials, 
however, are unlikely to gain more than niche shares of the market. Nine low-smoke fuels were subjected to field tests in 
order to determine their acceptability to consumers. Those fuels that are acceptable, meet safety standards and can be 
manufactured in sufficient quantities and at competitive prices, will be subjected to a macro-scale field test in 1997. <br>

<p>The statutory Council for Geoscience is carrying out several projects to expand the knowledge of South Africa's coal 
resources and reserves. These projects are concerned with: formulating an internationally acceptable methodology for 
calculating the country's coal resources and reserves, and documenting the peat deposits and unexploited coalfields of 
KwaZulu-Natal province. The Council for Geoscience is also mapping the commercial energy resources, reserves and current 
production of each African country, together with infrastructural information.<br>

<p>One of the results of the Commission of Inquiry into health and safety in the mining industry that completed its work during 
1995 was a new Mine Health and Safety Act, which was promulgated in June 1996. It has not yet come into force, owing to 
bureaucratic delays, capacity deficiencies in the government department charged with implementing it, and some disputed 
provisions that allow for the mine manager to be presumed guilty of negligence in the case of an accident unless he can prove 
otherwise. Regulations under the Act are presently in the process of being drafted.<br>
</p>
<p>Safety statistics for 1994 and 1995 are given in Table 1 below. While there have been increases in the rates of some of the 
individual categories, overall fatality and injury rates have dropped at both surface and underground operations. It must be 
noted however that the fatality rates, in particular, are subject to sharp swings from year to year.<br>

<p><b>4. COAL AND THE ENVIRONMENT</b><font size=4><b> </b></font></p>
<p>The Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC), which was signed by South Africa in 1993, has been identified as 
having the potential to impact significantly on the South African coal mining and combustion industries. In line with its concern 
for the country's already limited water resources, and bearing in mind the energy needs of the country's many poor people, it is 
expected that the national government will ratify the Convention in early 1997, as a developing country. The reasons for 
ratifying the FCCC as a developing country are that this will enable South Africa to benefit from the favourable aspects of the 
convention, thus reducing the cost of ratification and providing the country's researchers access to the Global Environmental 
Facility. All stakeholders in the issue, including environmental pressure groups, have agreed that a national process for 
developing a policy on climate change must be commenced as soon as possible. An inventory of greenhouse gases in the 
country has already been compiled and preliminary work on mitigation options has been done. Pledges have been received 
from donor agencies for the determination of mitigation options, and related issues.<br>
</p>
<p>An environmental issue of wider importance locally is the consultative national environmental policy (CONNEP) process, 
which has involved extensive consultations with all stakeholders at national, provincial and sub-provincial levels. A Green 
Paper is in the process of being drafted at the time of writing.<br>
</p>
<p>The coal mining companies are very concerned that the direction of environmental legislation and policy, particularly water 
legislation and policy, could have a major effect on the economics of mining and on the likelihood of the development of new 
mines. This matter is being addressed with the government, but the issue is a very complex one owing to the scarcity of water 
in the country and the rapidly growing population.<br>
</p>
<p><a name="CCT">4.1 <u>Clean Coal Technology</u></a> </p>
<p>Coal will remain South Africa's major source of energy for the foreseeable future. Despite the abundant present capacity, the 
potential to import hydroelectric power from other Southern African countries and the possibility of generating electricity from 
gas, Eskom will have to consider building a new power station early in the 21st century. In the shorter term, coal consumption 
is expected to increase as power stations are operated more efficiently and using new technologies.<br>
</p>
<p>Although South Africa is fortunate to have low sulphur content coals for utility power generation, it is envisaged that future 
coal-fired power stations will be fitted with sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) controlling technologies. Further to the 
ratification by South Africa of the FCCC, will be the responsibility of investigating mitigation options for greenhouse gases 
which, for South Africa specifically, has to include potential clean coal technologies. New technologies, such as pressurised 
fluidised bed combustion (PFBC), integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and coal fired gas turbines (CFGTs), are 
under development worldwide, which have the potential both to reduce atmospheric emissions significantly and increase 
thermal efficiencies. Government's involvement is to the extent of monitoring, evaluation/ demonstration and facilitation, where 
applicable, as these and other technologies become known and determining the potential impact they might have on energy 
policy for the country. <br>
</p>
<p>Eskom's coal research programme has been focussing on minimising the environmental impact of its present pulverised fuel 
combustion technology by optimising the combustion process and quantifying the gaseous and particulate pollutants. Research 
priority is now being given to the modelling of nitrogen oxide formation during combustion so as to understand and influence 
the formation of this pollutant. The quantification of trace elements emitted from Eskom plant has also been initiated, as part of 
a joint development with the Electric Power Research Institute in the USA. These programmes are complemented by studies 
into the feasibility and cost of plant that can remove gaseous pollutants such as SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>.<br>
</p>
<p>Newer and inherently cleaner power generating technologies are also being researched as part of a desktop study at present, 
but laboratory work will commence during 1997 to research the suitability of low-grade South African coals for fluidised bed 
combustion and coal gasification. The focus of the fluidised bed combustion research will be on assessing the fundamental 
reactivity of South African coal, limestone and dolomite resources with the latest power generating options this technology 
offers. A similar approach will be adopted with the gasification research. Research partners are being sought nationally and 
internationally.<br>
</p>
<p>A further clean coal technology initiative involves the electrification of South Africa's urban communities, so as to provide them 
with an alternative to coal as a primary energy source. The use of electricity in these communities will reduce low-level gaseous 
and particulate emissions, which pose a serious health risk. It must be noted however that the use of low-smoke fuels will 
result in the production of greater quantities of carbon dioxide as a result of the energy required to manufacture them. <br>
</p>
<p>In order to quantify rain quality trends, it is necessary to assume that increases in emissions from Mpumalanga province are not 
offset by decreases in Gauteng province, an extremely conservative assumption given that rainfall is a regional phenomenon. 
Studies to date reveal that full electrification will result in small increases in hydrogen ion concentrations. However the changes 
in pH will only be seen in the second decimal place.<br>
</p>
<p>In classifying local impacts of electrification, indoor air quality is of vital importance, especially if its significance for human 
health is considered. Results obtained thus far indicate that children living in partially electrified areas had a 130% higher risk of 
developing respiratory infection than those living in completely electrified areas, while children living in non-electrified areas had 
a 190% higher risk of developing respiratory infection compared to the same age group in electrified areas.<br>
</p>
<p>The net emission reduction for full electrification calculated by the year 1998 will be in the order of 1.5 Mt of carbon dioxide, 
14 kt of sulphur dioxide and 250 kt of particulates. Thus it can readily be concluded that electrification will result in net 
reductions of total emissions and in addition will substantially improve the quality of life of many individuals. It should be noted 
that partial electrification is not expected to have a substantial effect on emissions.<br>
</p>
<p><a name="CEcon"><b>5. COAL ECONOMICS</b></a> </p>
<p>Coal production continued to increase during 1995, being buoyed by strong growth in international demand for steam coal. 
Saleable coal production amounted to 206.2 Mt, an increase of 5% over 1994, while run of mine production was 258.7 Mt, 
an increase of 6%.<a name="_Ref366472180"> </a>Domestic consumption increased by 5%, and exports by 9% (see Table 2 below). South Africa is the 
world's fourth largest hard coal producer.1 More than half of the country's domestic coal production is consumed by Eskom, 
the national electricity generating utility, which sold more than 160 TWh during 1995, about 92% of which was generated from 
coal.2 Most of the rest of the locally consumed coal was used by Sasol in the production of liquid fuels, plastics and other 
chemicals. South Africa is poorly endowed with high-quality coals, and a certain amount of beneficiation is required to 
produce them. Of exported coal, 54% went to Europe, and 35% to the Far East. More than 96% of exports were through 
Richards Bay Coal Terminal. Coal continues to be produced in almost equal quantities by underground (51%) and opencast 
(49%) mining.1<br>
</p>
<p>The stabilisation in the coal mining producer price index that was reported last year has unfortunately not been sustained. It 
increased by 22% between July 1995 and June 1996, compared with a 7% increase in the overall producer price index. 
However, productivity in terms of tons of coal produced per employee has continued to increase, though the industry still lags 
far behind its major competitors, the USA and Australia.4 The rise in production has led to a slight increase in employment 
levels, by 2% to 59&#160;000 in 1995.<font size=2><br>

<p>South African coal research and development continues to cover a wide spectrum of interests, from mining, to processing and 
metallurgy, to combustion and other types of coal burning. It is hoped that, in next year's report, details can be given of the 
oil-from-coal industry. The extensive R&amp;D that is reported here has been carried out despite relatively limited funding and the 
loss of much expertise in recent years. The reader's attention is directed to the appendix for further detail regarding each 
project, and particularly the potential for collaboration. <br>
</p>
<p>Coal will remain the country's primary energy source for many years to come. However, the mining and utilisation industries 
are facing an ever stricter regulatory framework as pressures mount for greater protection of safety and health and the 
environment. Already these two issues dominate the research being carried out nationally. As pressure to reduce research 
funds mounts, there is likely to be an increasing need to explore the possibility of co-operative research both intra- and 
internationally. In such a scenario, the need for bodies such as the ICCR is very apparent. <br>

<A NAME="intro"></A>
<B>INTRODUCTION</B><br>
In 1960 South Africa suffered the tragedy of the Coalbrook disaster when a large section of a handgot mine near Sasolburg in the Free State collapsed, leading to the loss of more than 400 lives. No machine capable of drilling holes large enough through which to rescue people was available anywhere in the country. Following this incident, and particularly after the successful rescue at Lengede in Germany, the Chamber of Mines decided to purchase a suitable drill which would make it possible to reach men trapped underground in South African coal mines.<p>

<A name="geology"></A>
<B>GEOLOGY OF SOUTH AFRICAN COALFIELDS</B><br>
The economic coal seams are contained at depths ranging from a few to about 300 metres in the largely horizontal Ecca Series of the Karoo Geological System, which consist mainly of reasonably soft sandstone, shale and mudstone. Intruded in these coal measures and overlying most South African collieries, are dolerite sills of varying thickness from a few to more than a hundred metres. The dolerite intrusions are related to the outpouring of the Drakensberg volcanics and belong to the gabbro family. The characteristic Karoo dolerite generally consists of a dark medium-grained rock made up of augite and plagioclase-felspar. Olivine is often present or the rock may occasionally be more acid resulting in quartz dolerites.<p>

The following ranges of uniaxial compressive strengths have been recorded for South African coal measures:<br>

<A NAME="rescue"></A>
<B>RESCUE DRILLING IN THE PERIOD 1967 - 1977</B><br>
In 1967, after a worldwide investigation of the available mobile drilling equipment, the Chamber of Mines bought a Wirth L10 drill rig similar to the Wirth L4 in use by the National Coal Board at the time. It was a conventional rotary drill, equipped to drill small diameter holes by air-flush methods and large diameter holes by reverse flush water circulation.<p>

The drill was able to penetrate ordinary coal measures at speeds of some 3 - 4 metres per hour with a large diameter bit, but as soon as dolerite was encountered, penetration rates dropped to less than 0,15 roeires per hour. Modifications to increase these penetration rates had limited success.<p>

The equipment was put into the hands of a commercial drilling company who used the drill, under constraints, for its own contracting work. In this way a trained crew was always available and the equipment kept in operating condition. The company, however, experienced serious :problems, one of which was that it fell on hard times and management was changed some four times in 2½ years. The drilling unit and its ancillary equipment quickly fell into poor condition and disrepair.<p>

<A NAME="present"></A>
<B>THE PRESENT RESCUE DRILLING UNIT</B><p>

<A NAME="equipment"></A>
<B>Equipment for Rescue Hole Drilling</B><br>
Large diameter downhole percussion drills were being developed during the early seventies. Ingersoll-Rand downhole machines were used in piling for the foundations associated with the Alaska pipe:2ne, albeit to relatively shallow depths.<p>

<i>DHD-124. downhole drill</i><br>
On the recommendation of Ingersoll-Rand of the United States, the Chamber of Mines in 1977, purchased their DHD-124 downhole drill on a T-5 Drillmaster mounting, which was capable of drilling a 635 mm (25") or 560 mm (22") hole through which trapped men could be raised. A DHD-130 drill was also purchased for drilling a 760 mm (30") hole, through the overburden so that casings could be installed in the unstable top section of the hole, but it has since been discarded in favour of a borer-type bit. which achieves far higher rates of overburden penetration.<p>

From actual operations it has been established that the DHD-124 drill can penetrate normal coal measures at rates of up to 10 metres per hour and dolerite at up to 3,7 metres per hour, which are far geater than penetration rates achieved by rotary means.<p>

<i>DXL-5000S whisperised compressor</i><br>
The main power-pack is a Spiro-Flo DXL-5000S whisperised mobile compressor capable of delivery 2,4 m3/s of air at 85C kPa (5 000 cfm at 125 psi). The unit consists of two 1,2 m3/s skid-mounted modules connected by a common air discharge manifold. Each module contains an air-end with its own 495 kW, 16 cylinder Detroit diesel engine, receiver, separator, coolers and accessories, and may be run separately. They are housed in a specially constructed acoustic enclosure, mounted on a 12 m long trailer, 3,8 m high and 2,5 m wide.<p>

The T-5 Drillmaster has its own built-in power-pack consisting of a 270 kW, 12 cylinder Detroit diesel engine and compressor capable of delivering a further 0,42 m3/s of air at 1 700 kPa (900 cfrn at 250 psi).<p>

<i>Drill rods</i><br>
The unit is equipped with sufficient drill rods, each 9,1 m (30") long, to reach the deepest present workings of some 270 m. Each rod has a mass of 1,6 tons and diameter of 508 mm (20"). The large diameter of the rods allows for the drill cuttings to be removed from the hole by air-flushing.<p>

Sufficient rod trailers are available to carry the rods.<p>

<i>Mobile crane</i><br>
In order to handle the drill rods of mass 1,6 tons each and the downhole hammer and bit of mass 4 tons, as well as numerous other heavy items, a 15 ton mobile crane with a 15 m collapsible boom forms an integral part of the Rescue Drilling Unit.<p>

<i>Rescue capsule</i><br>
A rescue capsule, known as the Dalbusch Bomb, with 430 mm outside diameter is used to raise trapped men from underground. A parachute-type harness is also available for raising men in situations where the capsule cannot be used, e.g. in very- low seams.<p>

<A NAME="probe"></A>
<b>Probe Hole Drilling</b><br>
Rescue hole drilling is a comparatively slow process and the Chamber of Mines Rescue Drilling Unit was therefore supplemented by a DHD-260 downhole percussion drill on a T--4 Drillmaster mounting, capable of drilling a 165 mm (6V2") diameter hole at rates of 35 - 50 m/hr in soft strata and 10m/hr in dolerite. It is a very mobile, self-contained unit which can get underway quickly, carries 80 metres of rods with it, travels at speeds of up to 80 km/h and sets up in half an hour.<p>

The L4 will drill probe holes to search and locate trapped miners and provide them with air, food, communication and other essential services to sustain them while the rescue hole is being drilled.<p>

The T-5 Drillmaster is also equipped for small diameter probe hole drilling if required. It takes about 3 1/2 to 4 hours to change the machine over from large hole to small hole mode and vice versa.<p>

<A NAME="ancillary"></A>
<B>Ancillary Equipment</B><p>
<I>
Workshop trailer</I><br>
A semi-trailer is rigged out and equipped as a workshop trailer, on which are carried spare parts, tools, welding and cutting equipment and power plant. A section is designed as sleeping quarters and also contains a small refrigerator and cooking equipment for the crew.<p>

The trailer is also equipped with an electric winch fitted with an inverter drive for speed control, to raise and lower the rescue capsule.<p>

<I>Underground surveillance probe</I>
A surveillance probe, fitted with a low-light video camera and on-board lighting as well as a two-way audio communication system, designed to search for and establish contact with survivors trapped underground, forms part of the Rescue Drilling Unit equipment. The unit, which can be lowered down a 150 mm hole. is housed in a mobile caravan. All its functions are operated from a control desk in the caravan. Once the probe is lowered to the required depth, the lower section can be rotated and the lens tilted to scan for personnel up to a distance of 60 m. The audio system, which incorporates a sound signalling device, is sensitive and will pick up sounds 30 m and more away.

<I>Surface communication</I><br>
The Rescue Drilling Unit has long range radio equipment for communicating between the drill site, the base station and Rescue Training Services. Where a network is available, use is made of cellular telephones.<p>

<I>Gas sampling equipment</I><br>
The Unit has equipment to sample the atmosphere in that part of the workings which was drilled into. It is used in conjunction with the Mobile Gas Laboratory (MOGAL) unit of the Collieries Environmental Control Service, which will be summoned to the site. It consists of a bundle of tubes and a sampling head which can be lowered down the probe hole and then coupled to a vacuum pump on surface for taking samples. The samples will be processed and analysed immediately.<p>

<I>Mats for traversing unstable ground</I><br>
During rainy seasons some areas around collieries may become marshy and difficult to traverse with heavy vehicles. The Rescue Drilling Unit acquired 120 metres of heavy-duty epoxy Mo-Mat Panels (15 m lengths) from the United States where it is used by the defence force to traverse beachheads and unstable ground. If soft underfoot conditions are experienced, the panels will be used in leap-frog fashion to reach the drilling site.<p>

<A NAME="management"></A>
<B>MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION OF THE RESCUE DRILLING UNIT
</B><p>

<A NAME="location"></A>
<B>Location</B><br>
The Unit is housed in fire-station fashion in Witbank which is reasonably central to the coalfields, from where it can reach the nearest colliery in less than half an hour and the furthest, some 400 km away, in about 10 hours.<p>

<A NAME="unit"></A>
<B>Management of the Unit</B><br>
The Chamber of Mines has a Collieries: Training College for trainee miners and apprentice artisans in Witbank, which is staffed with mining men, training officers and supervisors with engineering backgrounds and sound knowledge of diesel and hydraulic equipment. The Rescue Drilling Unit was placed under the supervision of the College management as an additional responsibility.<p>

The staff of the College have been trained to operate and maintain the equipment. A core of permanent personnel consisting of the Rescue Drill Supervisor and 6 Operators, was established. The operators are housed on site and informal standby arrangements are maintained over week-ends. Half of the operators are used for general maintenance work at the training centre during normal working hours.<p>

The full-time operating personnel are responsible for the planned maintenance of the equipment.<p>

<A NAME="training"></A>
<B>Training</B><br>

<I>Rescue drilling procedure document</I><br>
A Rescue Drilling Procedure Document, setting out the immediate action that should be taken by various functionaries such as the Mine Manager, the Group Head Office, the Colliery Training College Manager, etc, is circulated to all collieries who are members of the Rescue Drilling Unit. The document also contains a list of telephone numbers of all those persons and organisations who are, or may be involved with the rescue drill or with rescue operations.<p>

This document is updated and recirculated at 6 monthly intervals to ensure that the necessary communications are maintained.<p>

<I>Drilling exercises</I><br>
At least one practice hole is drilled annually to test the equipment and to hone the skills of the operators. These exercises are carried out under simulated emergency conditions, that is, personnel are not pre-warned and call-outs are done at all hours to keep personnel on the alert. Times are recorded through-out the operation in order to improve call-out times and operational efficiencies.<p>

<B>RESCUE OPERATION</B><br>
The Rescue Drilling Unit has only once been called upon to rescue persons from underground when 26 miners were trapped 65 m below surface by a major collapse of ground at the Emaswati Colliery in neighbouring Swaziland The collapse, which completely blocked their access, took place at approximately 10:00 on Saturday 9 June 1991. The trapped miners fortunately had access to a safe refuge bay underground. The Unit was alerted and put on standbv at 11:00. It left Witbank at 14: 15, having had to wait for confirmation and international border clearance.<p>

The Unit arrived at Emaswati at 01:45 after a 310 km arduous journey, much of which was in thick mist and rain. The rescue drilling operation proceeded without a hitch and by 12:55 the rescue hole had been completed and the rods, hammer and bit withdrawn for rescue to commence.<p>

Four proto men were lowered to make the area around the base of the rescue hole safe and to assist the miners into the rescue capsule. The 26 miners and four proto members were all brought to safety by 17:10 on Sunday afternoon 10 June 1991, 30 hours 10 minutes after the Unit had first been alerted.<p>

<A NAME="innovations"></A>
<B>INNOVATIONS</B><p>
<A NAME="overburden"></A>
<B>Overburden Drilling</B><br>
A DHD-130 drill and 760 mm (30") diameter bit of total mass 6 tons and special starter rods were part of the original equipment purchased for the purpose of drilling the soft overburden. When soft clay-type overburden was encountered penetration rates fell to as little as 7 m per hour.<p>

The Rescue Drill Supervisor designed a simple borer-type bit by mounting continuous-miner pick-boxes with picks on a flat steel plate in a spiral design and attached this to a cylinder which screws on to an ordinary 508 mm rod. This "drag" bit, as it was named. with mass 250 kg is now used and achieves penetration rates of up to 35 m per hour.<p>

<A NAME="removal"></A>
<B>Removal of Drill Cuttings from Hole Collar</B><br>
A "blooie" device for the removing (blowing away) of cuttings from the hole collar and drill area, which was very cumbersome and took about 4 hours to install between hole collar and footplate of the machine, was incorporated in the original equipment.<p>

This was subsequently replaced by a simplified design, consisting of a pneumatic groundseal mounted at the bottom of a short metal cylinder of sufficient diameter to allow passage of the overburdened drill. The cylinder has a short discharge pipe welded on to it and to which a longer discharge pipe can be fitted for discharging the drill cuttings away from the machine. This part of the "blooie" device is carried on the chassis of the machine below the drilling platform and is hydraulically lowered and pressed to the ground, which is first levelled, to provide an adequate seal.<p>

A pneumatic rod seal, which forms the other part of the device is also attached to a short section of metal cylinder of the same diameter as on the ground seal. The internal diameter of the ground seal snugly accommodates the rod and hammer which has the same diameter, i.e. 508 ram. The rod seal is fitted over the hammer or overburden drill before it is lowered in the hole. Before drilling commences the rod seal is attached to the cylinder of the ground seal by way of a multiple bayonet-type clip-on mechanism and both seals are inflated to provide a seal around the rod and to the ground.<p>

This modified blooie device takes about half an hour to install and together with the improved overburden drilling equipment have resulted in reducing the time it takes from arrival on site to commencement of hardrock drilling from approximately 10 hours to less than 2 hours.<p>

<B>Flexible Casings</B><br>
The need for lining a large diameter hole during rescue drilling operations will probably only arise if such large quantities of water is encountered, which the machine cannot handle, or which may pose a danger to men trapped in a confined space. It would then be possible to case and grout the 635 mm hole to seal off the water and continue the drilling operation with the 560 mm bit. Experiments to install rigid casings with large enough inside diameter to allow this were unsuccessful at depths of 30 - 40 m because of the small tolerances and unevenness of the borehole sides.<p>

In order to make a 10 m length of casing flexible, joints are cut in a self-centring dovetail-like pattern at 1 m intervals with a cutting torch. The dovetail joints keep the casing intact and are sealed with vulcanised rubber. The ends of the casings are cut to an exact saw-tooth pattern and covered with vulcanised rubber. Casings are then lowered down the hole one at a ,5me with a special device and the hole cased from the bottom up. The saw-tooth joints are self-centring and the vulcanised rubber provides a good enough seal for grouting.<p>

Casings of 600 mm outside diameter and 588 mm inside diameter were lowered and raised with ease down several holes.<p>

<p align=left><a name="INTRODUCTION"><font size=4><strong><u>INTRODUCTION</u></strong></font></a><u><br>
</u>Two years ago, at the bottom end of the African continent, a dramatic re-birth took place. South 
Africa, a country whose political leanings had for decades earned it &quot;most despised nation&quot; 
status, emerged from its self-inflicted, apartheid night into a world prepared to accept it once 
more. Archbishop Desmond Tutu appropriately and affectionately dubbed our re-born country 
as the &quot;rainbow nation&quot;.<br>
<br>
The rainbow symbol, as we know, has long been used by pragmatists and dreamers alike as a 
symbol of promise for the future, yet realists - unblinded by the brilliance of the rainbow - 
know that change is necessary for a bright future. In the euphoria surrounding South Africa&#146;s 
re-emergence sight was lost of the fact that as powerful an influence political change may be, 
there are other changes, perhaps even more potent, that have to be brought about to make the 
anticipated bright future work.<br>
<br>
In South Africa, the need for change was seen, fortunately, as fundamental to prosperity. The 
imbalances of the past were not only political, they permeated the very fabric of society: from 
where one was allowed to live, to land ownership rights, to work practices and so forth. And it 
is essential that this distinction be made clear because April 1994 - the date of South Africa&#146;s 
official transition to full democratic rule - does not mark the beginning of change but rather the 
culmination of a nation&#146;s desire to become something very different from what it was before 
and to build upon that departure point. <br>
<br>
Integral to the South African melting pot is a powerful and mature mining industry that itself had 
to cope with pressures of its own. Apart from political imperatives which it knew it would 
have to deal with once a new government came into power, it had been fighting the battle of 
change for itself since the early 1980&#146;s. New ore reserves of any significance had not been 
identified; costs were spiralling out of control; pay limits (particularly in the gold mining 
sector) were ever decreasing; unions were becoming increasingly organised, political, 
demanding and strong; while productivity slumped. &quot;An industry in decline&quot; became a 
catch-phrase in some quarters &#133;&#133;. <br>
<br>
<a name="ENVIRONMENTAL"><font size=4><strong><u>ENVIRONMENTAL</u></strong></font></a><font size=4><strong><u> CHANGES<br>
</u></strong></font>With a new government came a desire to right wrongs. Fortunately the government had been 
quick to reverse its earlier avowed intention of nationalising virtually every major enterprise in 
the country, mining included. However, there was soon a flurry of activity designed to redress a 
whole host of legislation, the result of which was critical examination of issues as diverse as 
mining and minerals policy, health and safety, conditions of employment, industrial relations, 
training and education, and very soon the debate centred on the provision of electricity, water 
rights and the supply of water in a water-poor nation, and the environment. And in 1996 we saw 
the birth of a macro economic model better known as GEAR (Growth, Employment And 
Redistribution plan) which we are confident will bring about the needed six per cent economic 
growth rate per annum if properly implemented.<br>
<br>
At the same time, the mining industry was itself examining ways to - amongst others - cut its 
costs, improve pay limits, up its production, and increase productivity. The whole environment 
in which we had to operate went from one where change was necessary for day-to-day 
survival, to one where change was also thrust upon it from outside of its sphere of influence - 
including the international world of business.<br>
<br>
To cope with these changes and to prevent further declines in the mining sector and to optimise 
on our existing resources, we actively and simultaneously embarked on four major activities.<br>
<br>
<u>Organisational development</u> led us to examine our existing hierarchical structures and we found 
that many of the accusations levelled at us by the unions were well-founded and as a result 
hierarchical levels were reduced from 27 to six. Closed shop agreements were cancelled, 
multi-skilling was introduced, supervisory areas were reduced and teamwork became the name 
of the game!<br>
<br>
The mining industry was in the forefront of eliminating racial inequalities in the workplace by 
having the so-called &quot;scheduled persons&quot; restriction removed from the Mines and Works Act. 
In the simplest terms being &quot;scheduled&quot; meant a person was prevented from holding a blasting 
certificate or a diploma in an engineering discipline, such as electrician, fitter, plater, plumber, 
etc., simply on the basis of skin tone. Since the elimination of this restriction at the end of 1988, 
about 2750 previously scheduled persons have received blasting certificates. In 1995 of the 
610 employees who qualified, the split between races was virtually 50/50 (48,9% non-whites). 
Of course, under the new political dispensation this is no longer an issue of real importance but 
it does emphasise my earlier contention that change - even as far as what was then a sensitive 
issue - had been implemented at the instigation of our industry prior to - in fact about five years 
prior to - the much more publicised political transformation.<br>
<br>
Our <u>support services</u>, a field where we were sure we had everything under control, were also 
put under the microscope. Rationalisation plans were not long in coming forth as a result. For 
example, the age-old separation of the disciplines of engineering and mining has in many cases 
been thrown out the window and has proved to be surprisingly successful. On the gold mining 
side, pay limits have improved, in some cases up to 30 per cent, and face advances have 
improved, even to as high as 150 per cent, with 100 per cent the more general trend. Rivalry 
between the disciplines has been replaced with co-operation. The spin-off has been that costs 
have dropped 30 per cent on project mines, life of mine years on one project mine have 
improved by 50 per cent, while production teams are receiving bonuses at the rate of 100 per 
cent of basic salary with the average standing at 70 per cent. As far as coal is concerned the 
improvements are perhaps even more marked. For instance, on one mine where a pilot project 
has been introduced productivity has leapt from 416 tons per man to 784 and is on track to 
reach a projected target of 915. This has been achieved with a workforce reduced from 231 to 
143 - about 40 per cent - with a cost reduction from about 35 Rand (less than eight US dollars) 
per ton down to 16 (or less than four US dollars), and an overall improvement in production of 
nearly 17 per cent (<em>96000 vs 112200 tons</em>).<br>
<br>
Our employees have not been neglected either as the following illustrate. In the field of <u>human 
resources development</u> great advances have been made in the field of Adult Basic Education 
and Training (ABET), so much so that some employees who until a few years or so ago were 
illiterate and innumerate have already advanced to positions of seniority. Specialisations are 
being eliminated and employees are being armed now with an arsenal of skills which has had 
the value-added benefits of not only widening an individual&#146;s skill&#146;s base, but also of allowing 
the workforce to be rationalised without there being a drop in productivity. Multi-tasking and 
multi-skilling are being introduced as a means of deflating unacceptable working costs, of 
which more than 50 per cent were attributable to the cost of labour on gold mines and 30 to 35 
per cent on coal.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the most important - though most intangible - of the four steps embarked upon was the 
<u>improvement of the quality of life</u> of the workforce. I would hazard a guess that most of you 
attending this presentation have not had to look after the social and basic needs of large 
numbers of workers housed in communal settlements, what we on the mines call &quot;hostels&quot;. The 
whole hostel system is being re-examined right now and I know there is going to be a drastic 
shake-up here in the not too distant future as well.<br>
<br>
The government&#146;s RDP (Reconstruction and Development Plan) has in some instances outside 
of the mining industry not met with the success one would have hoped. Yet, it is alive and well 
and thriving in the mining sector. ABET is a case in point, training of existing workers, the 
re-training of laid-off workers, the construction of rural clinic buildings, upgrading of schools 
and teachers and the provision of running water to households to mention but a few.<br>
<br>
The age-old management versus worker - the &quot;us-and-them&quot; scenario - is also fast becoming a 
thing of the past. While no one disputes the need for a management structure the creation of a 
commonality of interest was seen as imperative if the industry was to march instead of crawl 
into the next century. The traditional &quot;disciplinary hearing&quot; - while still having its place - has 
largely been replaced by some companies by pre-emptive &quot;Fair Treatment Committees&quot; where 
grievances, perceived or real, may be aired. In so doing, cases which in the past would have 
led to wild-cat strikes and their usual accompanying violent behaviour have been amicably 
resolved. Remember that we had a situation on our mines where 90 per cent of skilled and 
supervisory people were white - with far right conservative beliefs - and 90 per cent of the 
workers were far left radicals and yet we expected them to be able to work together! Sharing of 
information and closer communication through all levels is being actively pursued and has 
proved to be very successful indeed.<br>
<br>
In co-operation with employee representatives management is intent on securing the abolition of 
old-fashioned and ludicrous regulations which prohibit the industry from working on Sundays. 
Combined with an excessive number of public holidays (a total of 12), an 11-shift fortnight and 
the inevitable down-time in closing and starting up a mine, a total of some 90 days (three 
months), or a quarter of the working year, are lost to the industry.<br>
<br>
What I am saying here in essence is that with every change in our industry, growth has not been 
far behind. Growth in the sense that while the industry is mature it is not in decline. Growth in 
the sense that we are ready to face the future with confidence in our skills, abilities and vision, 
and more importantly, with confidence in our people as we are unlocking a source of skills, 
knowledge and experience that we had not before recognised.<br>
<br>
For more than a century the mining industry has been the primary catalyst for economic growth 
and development in South Africa. It has every intention of ensuring that it not only maintains - 
but also increases - its capacity to create wealth and provide jobs in the new democratic 
society that is today&#146;s South Africa, rainbow nation of mineral wealth. <br>
<br>
On the other hand, it has been publicly said that if future prosperity is to be ensured in South 
Africa, there is a need to encourage the expansion of more promising industrial sectors, and in 
the process downplaying the role of its premier industry, that of mining. <br>
<br>
Nobody will deny that a broadening of South Africa&#146;s industrial base is a commendable 
objective. What truly makes little sense, however, is to even vaguely consider a scenario where 
the development and extension of mining activity is seen as unimportant while pursuing or 
cultivating alternative enterprises. This thought process - if it can be termed as such - defies 
logic. To attempt to displace mining - which for over a century has been the country&#146;s leading 
business pursuit and principal earner of foreign exchange - with unknown or imagined potential, 
is mind boggling!<br>
<br>
It is a well known fact that South Africa possesses enormous mineral deposits of quite 
phenomenal variety. Turning those deposits to account - including the substantial unmined gold 
reserves - in itself means that mining will continue and will therefore remain in the forefront of 
the country&#146;s national economy for well into the next century.<br>
<br>
In stark contrast to the disheartening forecasts directed at the gold mining industry by some 
domestic and international analysts, there is a new vitality materialising. Innovative thinking 
and structural readjustment are exposing reassuring blue sky potential for the industry and are 
propelling it to what one senior executive describes as &quot;the next wave of its life.&quot;<br>
<br>
The prophets of gloom cited the ever increasing depths at which mining has to take place and 
declining production coupled more recently to political uncertainty which accompanied the 
arrival of a new government in South Africa, as their reasons for pronouncing negatively on the 
state of the mining industry. Since gold mining is seen in many quarters as a criterion against 
which other mining sectors are measured it is essential that both declining production and 
political uncertainty be examined critically because they do indeed have a damaging effect on 
investor sentiment.<br>
<br>
<a name="PRODUCTION"><font size=4><strong><u>PRODUCTION</u></strong></font></a><font size=4><strong><u><br>
</u></strong></font>At its production pinnacle in 1970 South Africa turned out just over 1 000 tons of gold. At the 
time, excluding what was produced by the then Soviet Union, this amounted to a massive 79 per 
cent of world gold production. Since then, with marginal exceptions in some years, South 
Africa&#146;s gold production has shown a consistent decline. The 1995 total was 522 tons, just over 
23 per cent of world production, and this year it is expected that the aggregate will drop by 
about 20 or so tons.<br>
<br>
The primary cause for the substantial reduction in gold output is a considerable drop in grades. 
This is well illustrated by looking again at statistics for 1970 when some 74 million tons of ore 
were milled by Chamber of Mines member gold producers at an average grade of 13,28 grams 
per ton. In 1995 almost 99 million tons were milled by Chamber member mines at 4,87 grams 
per ton. Or to put it in other terms, tons milled increased by about 34 per cent while the grade 
fell by 63 per cent per ton.<br>
<br>
While this vividly illustrates the changed conditions of gold mining in South Africa and 
demonstrates the country&#146;s diminishing production against the increasing volumes of other 
major producers particularly in South America, it nevertheless is a comparison that needs to be 
placed in proper perspective.<br>
<br>
At last year&#146;s production total of 522 tons South Africa remains, by almost 200 tons, the 
world&#146;s biggest single producer. With an estimated 40 per cent of the world&#146;s recoverable ore 
reserves not yet turned to account and the new initiatives that are underway, it is clear that 
South Africa - which is likely to maintain annual production levels in the region of about 500 
tons - will retain and entrench its position as the world&#146;s major producer for many years to 
come.<br>
<br>
In these circumstances it is difficult to understand - because the reasons are certainly not clear - 
why the international market so heavily undervalues South Africa&#146;s gold assets. At the end of 
the second quarter of this year the market capitalisation of South Africa&#146;s unmined gold 
resource was valued by a leading stockbroking company at 192 South African Rand (about 40 
US dollars) per ounce. By comparison, the value placed on Australia&#146;s gold in the ground was 
315 Rand (about 70 US dollars) per ounce. At that price, South Africa&#146;s unmined resource 
represents an exceptional bargain.<br>
<br>
The other mining sectors such as platinum, manganese, chrome and of course, coal, are not 
facing the same pressures as is the gold sector. However, this does not mean that because things 
are relatively easier in these sectors they are by any means being neglected. What I said earlier 
about the energies being expended in the gold mining industry to ensure its longevity applies 
equally, if not more, in the non-gold mining sector. And if what is being done in gold mining can 
be seen as a barometric indicator of potential throughout the industry, mining in South Africa 
certainly has a future well worth investor confidence.<br>
<br>
<a name="GOVERNMENT'S"><font size=4><strong><u>GOVERNMENT'S</u></strong></font></a><font size=4><strong><u> ROLE<br>
</u></strong></font>Critically linked to the private sector&#146;s vigorous endeavours to inject new life into a mature 
gold mining industry is the role that needs to be played by government in making certain that the 
correct and appropriate means are provided in which the industry can operate.<br>
<br>
South Africa&#146;s transition to democracy in April 1994 brought the African National Congress 
(ANC) from being an exiled liberation movement to a political party of national supremacy. As 
was expected after listening to the ANC&#146;s statements in this regard prior to assuming power, 
demands for increased state intervention in private sector activity were not long in coming. The 
despised legislative fabric of the previous regime was subjected to intense scrutiny in a process 
initiated to virtually rewrite the country&#146;s entire book of statutes. <br>
<br>
Because of its centrality to the national economy the mining industry was of course critically 
affected by government&#146;s legislative review. Through the <a href="http://www.bullion.org.za">Chamber of Mines of South Africa</a> - 
an umbrella body which represents about 85 per cent of mining industry interests in South 
Africa - the industry has immediately became an active participant in the national debate that 
has accompanied legislative and regulatory revision in South Africa. <br>
<br>
Without going into great detail, the short version of what is taking place is a tripartite process 
involving the views of government, business and organised labour. We all had our learning 
curves but since learning curves are there to be flattened, I would say that all parties are now 
approaching these forums (for want of a better word) far more open-mindedly and as a result 
are achieving consensus - or at least near consensus - and trust unknown to us in the past.<br>
<br>
The sentiment that government is there to create the environment and the opportunities is central 
to the stance the mining industry has taken on entering the debate on all the issues affecting it. 
Though what is without any shadow of a doubt - certainly from an industry perspective - the 
most significant area of legislative review, the revision to the mining and minerals policy has 
naturally received the brunt of industry&#146;s intense scrutiny. As important as all legislative review 
is to our industry, I would like to focus on the issue of mineral rights in particular since it is of 
singular significance to potential mining investors in our country.<br>
<br>
Initiated shortly after the 1994 election, the minerals policy deliberations have focused 
predominantly on the controversial issue of mineral rights. South Africa - like the United States 
- has a mixed system of mineral rights ownership. The most common estimates for South Africa 
suggest that about half of the country&#146;s mineral rights already reside in the hands of the state, 
while 20 per cent belong to mining companies and the remaining 30 or so per cent belong to 
tribes, landowners and private individuals.<br>
<br>
The system in place at present has been attacked by critics who express the view that mineral 
deposits are an essential part of a nation&#146;s heritage and should revert to state ownership. The 
mining industry has adopted a contrary position. Although it has no objection to the principle of 
state ownership, it contends that to attempt at this late stage to unscramble the existing regime is 
certain to cause confusion and a substantial erosion of confidence that would clearly be harmful 
to the best interests of the mining industry.<br>
<br>
Condemnation is also directed at the prevailing system on the basis that it locks out small 
mining entrepreneurs who are unable to gain access to mineral rights. This is seen by the critics 
as an obstacle to small business development. The small to medium business sector is touted in 
some quarters as a major potential contributor to South Africa&#146;s economic growth. The large 
industrial sector, including the mining industry, has no quibble with its potential for economic 
growth and would be delighted should that potential be realised. What is happening at this time 
is that major mining companies are examining their portfolios with the intention of making 
available to small operators those rights that are either too small or otherwise inappropriate to 
be mined by themselves.<br>
<br>
This is a but one aspect of the much larger and exciting process of empowerment that is taking 
place in contemporary South Africa. Before spending some time outlining some of the 
significant empowerment initiatives I would like to express the view that South Africa&#146;s dual 
system of mineral rights ownership is unlikely to be radically changed.<br>
<br>
<a name="EMPOWERMENT"><font size=4><strong><u>EMPOWERMENT</u></strong></font></a><font size=4><strong><u><br>
</u></strong></font>As important as criticism of the mineral rights system, perhaps considerably more important, 
have been the accusations levelled at the mining industry that it is unrepresentative of South 
Africa&#146;s majority black population. The policies of racial segregation which were the dominant 
features of an apartheid government distinctly disadvantaged citizens who were not white and 
effectively guaranteed that both political and economic power were firmly entrenched in white 
hands.<br>
<br>
Conscious of the need to temper white domination of South African business, the country&#146;s 
biggest mining house, <a href="http://www.edata.co.za/Anglo/anglostart.html">Anglo American Corporation</a>, structured a deal to facilitate black 
acquisition of a substantial industrial holding lodged in another of South Africa&#146;s major mining 
houses.<br>
<br>
Johannesburg Consolidated Investments, a well established mining house controlled by the 
Anglo American Corporation, was unbundled into three parts. Its platinum interests were 
placed in a company named Amplats; its gold, coal and base metals mining interests in <a href="http://www.bullion.org.za/organisation/members.htm#JCI">JCI</a>; and 
its powerful industrial holdings were assembled in Johnnic. Amplats was absorbed by Anglo 
American, and Johnnic and JCI were placed on the market with the express condition that the 
purchaser must be a black business grouping.<br>
<br>
In what will surely come to be seen as one of South Africa&#146;s business deals of the century, 20 
per cent of Johnnic was bought recently by the National Empowerment Consortium - a group of 
more than 50 black organisations - for more than 1,5 billion Rand (or US$325 million). The 
consortium has been given an 18 month option to buy an additional 15 per cent of Johnnic 
whose tentacles by the way extend into property, newspapers, motor vehicle manufacturing, 
brewing and pharmaceuticals.<br>
<br>
The central figure in the national economic consortium&#146;s bid for Johnnic was Cyril Ramaphosa, 
former secretary general of the ANC and principle architect of South Africa&#146;s new constitution.<br>
<br>
Anglo American, on 26 November, announced that Capital Alliance, another major black 
owned consortium, had purchased 34.9 per cent of JCI for 2.8 billion Rand (US$610 million). 
The mining industry, by finalising these two deals together with other though less headline 
grabbing but equally pertinent deals, broadcast a clear message to the industry&#146;s critics that it is 
in fact serious about and committed to the establishment of a significant black presence at the 
highest level of management in the South African mining industry. Certainly more will follow 
now that the precedent has been set.<br>
<br>
<a name="NEW"><font size=4><strong><u>NEW</u></strong></font></a><font size=4><strong><u> ENERGY<br>
</u></strong></font>Looking at new business, the compulsory revitalisation of an industry that several years ago 
was beginning to show signs of premature fatigue is being additionally animated by the 
optimistic prospect of a variety of new mega-ventures. Conservative estimates suggest that 
these will absorb more than 20 billion Rand (US$4.4 billion) in capital investment.<br>
<br>
One mining house, for instance, is engaged in the expansion and development of one of their 
gold mines which will produce more than 60 million ounces of gold. It is the single largest ore 
body actually or prospectively being worked in the world and, when it comes fully on stream 
just after the turn of the century, will have a life of at least 60 years.<br>
<br>
In the same area on the Far West Rand another mining corporation is investigating the 
possibility of developing at least two major shaft systems within the western ultra deep levels 
lease area. <br>
<br>
Another project with an estimated gold resource approaching 40 million ounces has been 
identified. A decision is imminent on whether to proceed with a 3 billion Rand (over US$650 
million) capital investment for shaft sinking and ancillary infrastructure.<br>
<br>
Now that political constraints have been removed, South Africa&#146;s mining companies with their 
considerable technological and intellectual resources are moving north into the African 
continent as well as throughout the rest of the world. Gencor acquired Billiton from Shell which 
elevated it into the premier league of international mining companies. The Anglo American 
corporation with business interests in Europe, North and South America and the Far East has 
long been a major global player. Other South African mining companies are pursuing 
opportunities in countries as diverse as Australia, Venezuela, India, Indonesia and Spain.<br>
<br>
<a name="CONCLUSION"><font size=4><strong><u>CONCLUSION</u></strong></font></a><font size=4><strong><u><br>
</u></strong></font>Ladies and gentlemen my presentation today has to a very large extent been focused on the 
South African gold mining industry. That is because gold is the metal most commonly and 
justifiably associated with South Africa. Coal, platinum, diamonds and an extensive range of 
other metals and minerals are found in almost embarrassing abundance in South African soil.<br>
<br>
Last year total mineral sales amounted to nearly 57 billion Rand or US$12 billion. The value of 
mineral exports in 1995 was 44 billion Rand (some US$10 billion) which represented close to 
42 per cent of the country&#146;s annual merchandise exports and if the value of beneficiated mineral 
products is also taken into account the exports exceed 60 per cent, which figures in themselves 
are hardly indicators of an industry in decline.<br>
<br>
Political uncertainty has now effectively been erased by a government that is giving serious 
attention to erasing the scourge of serious crime - probably one of the greatest deterrents to 
investment in contemporary South Africa.<br>
<br>
We are confident that the South African mining industry is moving into the next wave of its life. 
As it does so it will provide a profusion of profitable opportunities, not only for the people of 
South Africa, but also for the international community. Sure, there is risk involved in 
speculation, but I would venture that South Africa as a destination for speculative capital 
certainly is far less risky than other, perhaps more exotic, localities! Furthermore, South Africa 
has a burning need for foreign investment. While my country has a track record of providing 
more than fair returns to its investors, its populace also needs to get to work again. While the 
resources presently at our disposal are being used to their fullest, it is investment by outsiders 
which will eventually turn the tide and allow the country itself to progress to &quot;the next wave of 
<em><u>its</u></em> life.&quot; <br>

<p><a name="Introduction"><b>Introduction</b></a> <br clear=all>
It is indeed a privilege for me to be present at this conference and to address you on the impact of mine producer hedging on 
the world gold market, particularly from a South African perspective. I will briefly talk about recent price and production 
trends, the pricing and marketing issues that impact on hedging strategies for gold producers, and finally, the impact of hedging 
on the world gold market. Given the prevailing difficult circumstances of gold mining in South Africa, hedging has become an 
important component of the producer's marketing mix. </p>
<p>Prior to grappling with the topic in detail, I would like to take this opportunity to inform you about recent developments in 
South Africa. We just wish that the pessimism about South Africa in some quarters would push bullion to better price levels! </p>
<p>Following our welcome political transition to democracy, it is now apparent that a more sobering reality is upon South Africa. 
The so-called `Mandela dividend' has begun to wane as the country comes to grips with the demands of international 
integration and the reality of President Mandela's imminent retirement. Whilst the transition will remain an enduring symbol for 
democracy and conflict resolution, the next phase of democratic consolidation requires addressing the imperatives of 
sustainable growth and development by setting priorities that can realistically be achieved. South Africa's future will, almost 
exclusively, be determined by its success in aligning itself with global and regional social, political and economic dynamics. </p>
<p>Whilst we cannot profess to be entirely satisfied with developments in every area, we remain optimistic that the government 
will continue the trend toward international alignment and integration. We are encouraged by the market orientation of the 
government which seemed improbable some years ago. Indeed, it is sobering to witness the power of globalisation and the 
doctrine of the market at first hand. </p>
<p>Government's recently published <i>Macroeconomic Strategy for Growth and Development</i> is welcome confirmation of the 
direction in which South Africa must move. As the new government continues to develop the required confidence and 
competency, we will see this trend accelerating, and we have no doubt that South Africa will emerge as a strong contender in 
the race for honours amongst the developing countries. We acknowledge that it will be a difficult process, characterised by a 
lack of policy latitude in respect of national interest goals. It is certainly not a challenge that we will shy away from. </p>
<p><b>The gold mining industry in South Africa </b><a name="today"><b>today</b></a> <br>
It is now a common theme amongst many analysts and pundits that the South African gold mining industry is in a terminal state, 
kept alive merely by the good fortune of a depreciating currency. Whilst it is true that the gold mining industry, undisputedly 
South Africa's economic bedrock, is facing significant challenges, it is certainly not terminal or even short of breath. </p>
<p>It remains robust, energetic and exceptionally innovative. Indeed, if there is a defining feature of South African gold mining, it is 
its inherent resilience and capacity for adaptation. The formal mining industry will remain a reliable wealth generator for the 
sub-continent well into the next century, as it has done for over 110 years through seemingly insurmountable problems and 
periodic turmoil. In terms of the world gold market, South Africa will continue contributing the dominant share of world gold 
production for many years to come, although we recognise the increasing contribution from other areas. </p>
<p>Descriptions of a crisis in the industry are certainly exaggerated. There are serious concerns about the continuing decline in 
profitability in the face of high working costs and a relatively stagnant dollar gold price. However, the industry has responded 
to the challenges and we are seeing exciting progress where problems have been addressed creatively. This creativity is 
generating new production and revenue axioms, based principally on profit maximisation as opposed to the previous focus on 
cost management. </p>
<p>Any analysis of the conditions facing South African producers must be tempered by a thorough appreciation of the seven 
fundamental pillars that form an interactive system that makes mining our unique gold ore bodies possible: namely geology, 
grades, depth, human capital, the regulatory environment, revenues and costs, and technology. At any moment, these seven 
issues are impeding or accelerating improvements in the gold mining industry - it is the task of our miners to apply their 
considerable expertise to harmonising each element in the pursuit of greater rewards. It is notable that nowhere else in the 
world have these fundamentals been managed to mine complex orebodies similar to those of South Africa - it is a fine 
testimony to the gold mining industry's achievements. </p>
<p><b>Recent price and production </b><a name="trends"><b>trends</b></a> <br>
South African gold producers have to benchmark their performances internationally and locally, and this is achieved by 
examining production data in a number of ways. The most useful analytical method is the concept of the mill pay limit. The mill 
pay limit is the minimum amount of gold that needs to be recovered from every ton of ore milled in order to break-even on 
costs - given a certain gold price and cost per ton milled. The two important variants are the Rand gold price and working 
costs per ton. </p>
<p>The nature of the South African gold mine tax formula has encouraged the mining of grades as close to the mill pay limit as 
possible, to ensure that as many low grade ore bodies are brought to account as is feasible. Graph 1 illustrates South Africa's 
mill pay limit and average recovery grade for the period 1961 to 1996. </p>
<p>The difference between the lines reflects the average grade recovered in excess of the pay limit (i.e. the working profit). In the 
period 1961 to 1971 the gold price was constant at US$35/ounce, but costs were rising rapidly, resulting in an increasing pay 
limit and an associated rise in average grade to maintain profits. With tons of ore milled increasing, and the pay limit and 
average grade peaking in 1970, production also peaked in 1970 at about 1 000 tons as shown in Graph 2: (all indicators base 
indexed to 1961). </p>
<p>The liberalisation of the gold market in 1968, and more importantly, the United States' decision to break the link between gold 
and the dollar on 15 August 1971, provided the spark that pushed the gold price up to a new peak in 1974. </p>
<p>Graph 3 shows working revenue per kilogram in 1995 Rand terms, from 1961 to 1995. The sudden rise in the gold price, and 
the slower rise in working costs, meant a fall in the mill pay limit from 8,8g/ton in 1970 to 3,8g/ton by 1974. Average grades 
followed suit, declining from 13,5g/ton in 1970 to 10,2g/ton in 1974. </p>
<p>The mid 1990s have, in many respects, been aberration years. Lower levels of productivity, from both capital and labour, 
resulted in rapidly rising costs which raised the mill pay limit. The decline in ore mined from underground forced the use of low 
grade surface material to supplement volumes of ore through the mills. Consequently, average grades declined placing 
substantial downward pressure on profitability. Gold production in 1995 fell to 522 tons, a 12 per cent decline on the previous 
year. We expect the figure in 1996 to decline further to around 500 tons. </p>
<p>The decline in the level of productivity, rapidly increasing costs and constant, or at least relatively stable gold prices, have 
increased pressure on the high cost, older marginal mines. These mines have limited grade flexibility and are most vulnerable to 
closure. The development of new marketing and pricing strategies has become more important for South African gold 
producers if they are to maximise profits in the current environment. </p>
<p><b>The </b><a name="approach"><b>approach</b></a><b> to hedging by South African producers</b> <br>
Previous trends and perpetually bullish sentiment has seen most South African producers follow a passive pricing doctrine, 
relying on the cushion of substantial profit to revenue ratios rather than risk losing upside gains, which tend to be highly 
leveraged for South African producers. That cushion has been diminishing for some time now, noticeable by the fact that South 
Africa is now the highest cost gold producer in the world (Graph 4). </p>
<p>The widely publicised hedging programmes recently undertaken by some South Africa mines should not be interpreted as a 
panic response to a crisis. The re-evaluation is essentially a need to revisit perceptions of the market to determine whether the 
mix of fundamentals on which South African producers relied previously, are less important. Increased South African hedging 
is a welcome adaptation to globalisation and the need to maximise opportunities. </p>
<p><a name="Why"><em><u>Why</u></em></a><em><u> hedge? <br>
</u></em>The objective of gold producer hedging is generally to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and expected return by 
actively managing commodity price risk, to which gold producers are especially vulnerable given that they are price-takers 
rather than price-makers. Notably, most, if not all, South African producers take a strong stance against speculative hedging 
transactions. </p>
<p>By engaging in hedging, producers are able to lock in a required price for a percentage of production, assuring them of a 
steady stream of revenue that might be required to sustain a marginal mine or pay for major capital development projects. </p>
<p>Hedging decisions are generally informed by the competition for scarce and expensive capital, limited cash reserves, the 
savings that can be effected on operating costs and the tax structure to which gold mines are subject. </p>
<p>In essence, it is a reduction of uncertainty in a risk environment of exceptionally scarce resources that have to be allocated 
strategically as well as optimally. Hedging has become an important alternative price insurance device for South African gold 
producers in an era of declining production and rapidly increasing costs. </p>
<p>Historically, the North Americans and Australians led the way in gold hedging. In the latter case, hedging was essentially a 
by-product of the use of gold-loan financing that enabled the Australian boom of the late 1980s - encouraged by the bullion 
banks to reduce their risk exposure and at a time when financing expansion through the share market, following its collapse in 
October 1987, was no longer possible, and the cost of debt financing was exorbitant. </p>
<p><em><u>Pricing </u></em><a name="perceptions"><em><u>perceptions</u></em></a><em><u> <br clear=all>
</u></em>For the South Africans, there are two factors that affect producers' perceptions of how gold is `priced' - its production cost 
and its currency cost (converting US$ to Rands). First, the production cost impacts on the mill pay limit which determines the 
efficiency of extraction (the ideal is not to leave any gold in the ground, hence a demand for the lowest possible pay limit). </p>
<p>Secondly, the price of the South African Rand in relation to the US Dollar is of special significance. For example, the 
depreciation of the Rand against the US Dollar has for many years cushioned, to some extent, the effects of the flat gold price. </p>
<p>Notably, my Australian colleagues believe that hedging has been far more successful in that country because of the relative 
stability of the Australian Dollar against the US Dollar. Compare this to the Rand, which depreciated unexpectedly by over 20 
per cent against the US Dollar in the first quarter of 1996. In such a volatile environment, it is exceptionally difficult to develop 
forecasts with sufficient confidence, hence the reliance on flexible strategies that allow hedges to be unwound or rolled over on 
demand. </p>
<p>It is also useful to consider pricing conditions governing some other metals, especially the platinum group metals. These metals 
are commonly sold on a contract basis and enjoy a high degree of certainty and security in terms of medium to long-term price 
commitment and therefore, the anticipated revenue is more easily established. On the other hand, gold is rather unique in that, 
traditionally, a relatively small proportion of its production was sold forward for an agreed price. </p>
<p>In other metal and commodity transactions, the producer and consumer are generally known to each other and conduct their 
business bilaterally. As such, the seller and buyer are clearly identified, which is unusual in the case of gold. With gold, price 
can determine the character of the holder as a buyer or seller - the boundaries between the two are entirely fluid and, 
therefore, unpredictable. The widespread parallel markets for gold further complicate the equation. </p>
<p>Of course, the other central issue, perhaps more favoured by South Africans for obvious reasons, is that gold remains a form 
of money, despite attempts to deprecate its status to a mere commodity. In this sense, the usual loop between supply and 
demand cannot be seen as complete. The holding and disposal of gold carries significant consequences, usually in the form of 
opportunity costs. Essentially, very little gold is actually `consumed' in the way that other metals are. Much of the world's gold 
remains accessible and, therefore, tradable. Similarly, the much described supply `gap' must be viewed circumspectly - we 
have seen how vast volumes of metal can flow into the market at certain price levels and we have very little inkling of illegal 
gold production and trade. </p>
<p>South African gold producers certainly cannot be regarded as neutral pricing strategists anymore. By virtue of the massive 
capital investment required to bring an orebody to account, and the subsequent burden of operating costs, producers are by 
nature long gold. This is a weight that should not be underestimated. Hedging is not a sign of pessimism, but an alternative 
method for managing risk at any time - both good and bad. Consequently, satisfactory producer pricing of gold is a difficult 
business; if not a fine art! </p>
<p><a name="Reasons"><em><u>Reasons</u></em></a><em><u> for hedging <br clear=all>
</u></em>To some extent, hedging by South African gold producers might be regarded as an inverse barometer of price and revenue 
expectations - a pessimistic position. However, this is moderated by a common thread that governs any business - the demand 
for a degree of price certainty to enable meaningful strategic planning to take place in what is inherently a risky environment. 
Hedging is one way to achieve this and the management philosophy and corporate culture guiding its employment are 
important considerations. </p>
<p>In the first instance, producers must be distinguished from speculators. The speculative use of hedging has, somewhat unfairly, 
tainted it in certain quarters as a high risk boom and bust option that responsible companies should avoid. This is especially 
true where exotic derivatives have been employed with disastrous consequences. Fundamentally, the hedging objectives for 
any producer are these: to maximise returns over the long-term, to prolong the profitable production life of a mine and to lock 
in a gold price that is adequate to cover the costs of a particular development - such as a new shaft. </p>
<p>Any hedging programme will be founded on an assessment of all the risk factors, building in a degree of flexibility to allow 
measured responses to unfavourable conditions. This is fundamental to South African conditions where the operational 
circumstances and philosophies vary so significantly from one mine to another, and indeed, within the mining finance houses 
themselves. </p>
<p><a name="Assessing"><em><u>Assessing</u></em></a><em><u> risk<br clear=all>
</u></em>For producers, hedging is a component of the total risk package, the objective being to minimise each component's risk. 
Critically, the risk package cannot be easily unbundled for a pricing strategy. A producer can cut costs without too much 
regard for price - the point of reference is the international cost curve. However, the pricing strategy is as dependent on the 
cost component as it is on all the other factors. A producer's position on the cost curve will influence his capacity for exposure, 
both upside and downside, and determine the extent of fixed price sales. Consequently, in South Africa, we have seen more 
marginal mines using hedging as a precaution against downside trends and volatility. </p>
<p>There are five important risk factors that will drive the South African producer's pricing strategy: </p>
<ul>
<li>gold spot price; </li>
<li>local interest rates; </li>
<li>gold price volatility; </li>
<li>gold lease rates; and </li>
<li>exchange rate fluctuations. </li>
</ul>
<p>South African producers have attached little significance to gold lease rates in the past because of the primary reliance on 
equity financing. However, they are critical to a hedging strategy that is being used for financing purposes because they form an 
important component of the gold price contango. </p>
<p>Indeed, the closing months of 1995 saw gold lease rates soar unexpectedly which had a significant impact on hedging 
programmes across the world as the market went into backwardation for a while. What that period did demonstrate to many 
analysts, was the flexibility of hedging programmes. There was evidence that the lease rates were reversed by increased 
liquidity derived from producers using the opportunity to make profits on their production that was hedged at higher 
contangos. </p>
<p><em><u>South African </u></em><a name="examples"><em><u>examples</u></em></a><em><u> </u></em><br clear=all>
It is worthwhile noting that South African producers have altered their hedging disclosure policies in recent years to conform to 
international best practice. This is a welcome development, especially for the many analysts who make a living in this field! It 
will certainly assist in evaluating more accurately the impact of hedging on the international gold market. </p>
<p>In addition to the key risks, there are other considerations that are intrinsically related to a producer's circumstances, which are 
by no means uniform: </p>
<ul>
<li>production prospects in terms of cost inflation, capital and labour productivity, tax obligations and capital expenditure; </li>
<li>a producer's capacity for downside endurance or, conversely, the tolerance for losing the gains of an upward price 
movement; </li>
<li>the medium to long-term view of market trends, especially in terms of contangos or potential for backwardation; </li>
<li>the macro social, political and economic risks attached to the location of production; </li>
<li>the capacity to adequately benchmark returns on particular instruments; and </li>
<li>the availability of willing counterparties in a scenario of a persistent gold price contango. </li>
</ul>
<p>South African producers traditionally refrained from active hedging for a number of reasons, the most important of which are 
the gold sales arrangements with the South African Reserve Bank and the cushion of a depreciating currency which has 
allowed steadily increasing Rand prices to be achieved against a static dollar price for gold. </p>
<p>The underlying management perspective on hedging is a concern that the future dollar gold price will continue to move 
sideways, decline or rise less than the prevailing contango rate. Hedging is made more attractive by the ability to lock in prices 
with some upside potential using structured hedges that combine commonly used spot-deferred contracts with gold and 
currency call options. </p>
<p>An example of this was JCI Limited's use of Rand/gold call options on 55 per cent of Western Areas' production to allow the 
group to benefit from increases in the gold price. On the other hand, Rand/Dollar call options on the remaining percentage 
provides protection against a depreciating Rand. The programme was flexible enough to allow JCI to exercise the option on 
the Rand/gold call options, whilst rolling forward the currency options which allowed it to sell all production into the spot 
market at the higher prices that prevailed earlier this year. </p>
<p>Each of the mining finance houses adopts a different approach to hedging - as a group and for the individual mines that they 
manage. It is essential for us to recognise that each South African gold mine is unique and consequently has unique financing, 
production, sales and administrative needs. These cannot be met by an inflexible pricing and marketing arrangement, and as a 
result there is no single hedging doctrine to speak of save that the results should be profitable! </p>
<p>To illustrate this, Anglo American is a relatively aggressive hedger whilst Gold Fields of South Africa does not hedge at all. </p>
<p>Anglo American sold forward 20 per cent of production in 1995 and this has been increased to 44 per cent in 1996. 
Anglovaal has sold forward an estimated 19 per cent of its production, up by 5 per cent on 1995. Gengold has hedged 
production at Beatrix Gold Mine in order to secure the development of a new shaft system. The hedge covers total production 
for 5 years. Notably, Gengold only hedges on a project specific basis. </p>
<p>JCI Limited has routinely sold forward 10 to 15 per cent of production. The most recent contract was for Western Areas 
Gold Mine, in which 7,3 million ounces were hedged in order to develop the South Deep project. The group's H.J. Joel Gold 
Mine is also considering selling forward its entire gold output in order to finance its capital expansion phase, to be implemented 
by 2001. Randgold recently unwound many of its hedges and has replaced them with flat currency forwards in both Rands and 
Dollars. </p>
<p>Flexibility is the key requirement - producers want exposure built into options or the ability to roll positions. When recent 
interest rate increases in South Africa were anticipated, producers avoided locking in higher Rand gold prices in order to take 
advantage of a more attractive contango. There must be the ability to survive periods of crisis such as the recent rapid 
depreciation of the currency where South African producers were able to roll-over their existing positions. However, most 
producers, if not all, certainly ceased hedging during the extreme period of currency volatility, because it made forward sales 
protection via Rand/Dollar call options very expensive. </p>
<p>In future, producers will have to watch the declining net contango very closely to ensure that their hedging strategies are 
optimising price opportunities. Indeed, we have seen a number of Australian and North American producers closing out their 
positions because of the contango, which is at its lowest level in many years. </p>
<p><b>The </b><a name="impact"><b>impact</b></a><b> of hedging on the gold market</b> <br clear=all>
Hedging has by no means been without controversy. In retrospect, the increased volume of hedging in the 1980s and 1990s 
can almost certainly be seen as partly responsible for capping the gold price and tranquilising its traditional volatility which 
attracted so many investors. Other factors have included, of course, central bank sales and profit-taking by hedge and 
commodity funds. Similarly, the debate surrounding the possible sale of 5 million ounces from the International Monetary Fund 
(imf) gold stocks, and uncertainty about the use of gold in reserves by the proposed European Central Bank, will continue to 
occupy the minds of analysts and commentators. </p>
<p>Important in considering the effect of hedging, is the distinction between long-term and short-term trends. In the short-term, the 
gold price is definitely constrained, but in the longer-term, it offers a more stable risk environment that allows more reliable 
forecasting by the gold producer. </p>
<p>However, the school opposing hedging is quite forceful. Prominent fund managers have made strong appeals to producers to 
halt forward sales to remove the cap on the gold price. We should understand the situation from a traditional management 
perspective though. Producers cannot optimise resources without planning; which requires a measure of certainty. Competitive 
conditions are such that extreme volatility could sink many operations instantly. It is therefore a trade-off between the 
spectacular and the mundane but predictable - most managers would choose the safety of the latter. </p>
<p>Critics bemoan the capping effect of hedging, but I believe that we need to accept this as a market condition rather than an 
unwelcome aberration or artificial distortion. We have no way of objectively determining what the gold price would have been 
without hedging although many would maintain a slight price bias against hedging. Once again though, I would remind you of 
the significant changes in the international political economy, especially in terms of official attitudes toward gold as money. </p>
<p>Hedging most certainly has impacted on price trends, but producers cannot make normative statements about the benefits, or 
lack thereof, of hedging. All participants are subject to the vagaries of the gold market and that is, arguably, its attractiveness. 
Otherwise we could make a case for some sort of systemic intervention since surely every impact on the price could be 
construed as a distortion rather than a fact of life. </p>
<p><a name="Conclusion"><b>Conclusion</b></a> <br clear=all>
The South African mining industry as a whole is vigorously addressing the most pressing issues facing it, some of which I have 
outlined for you today. I can emphatically refute the view that the South African gold mining industry is about to be laid to rest. 
We should not forget that gold has been mined commercially in South Africa for over 500 years, and scientifically for over 120 
years. Throughout the latter period, the industry has faced numerous crises; from war to labour shortages. </p>
<p>Most importantly, South Africa has nearly 40 per cent of the world's known gold reserves. If cost and revenue constraints 
improve as they have done previously, there is every possibility that gold mining will enjoy a renaissance in South Africa. </p>
<p>To conclude, the mining industry is central to the successful socio-economic development and welfare of the country. In return, 
it requires an enabling operational environment characterised by stable political and economic fundamentals. If there is one 
abiding impression of South African gold mining, it is one of positive pragmatism - an unsentimental understanding of the 
threats tempered with in-depth knowledge of the current realities and a vision based on sound and meticulous strategic 
planning. </p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

<font size=2><b>CHAMBER OF MINES OF SOUTH AFRICA</b></font> </p>
<p align=center><img src="../images/logo2.gif" align=bottom width=102 height=64><br>
</p>
<p><b><u>Introduction</u></b> <br>
The Chamber began investigating the application of Internet technology in 1994 and we implemented a comprehensive service 
package for the core business units in early 1995.<br>
</p>
<p><b><u>Implementation</u></b> <br>
The reasons for implementing Internet services were a little different to those already dealt with today, primarily because the 
Chamber is a non-profit organisation representing private sector mining employers in South Africa. As such, our point of 
departure was to critically evaluate the range of services and simulate applications for them in terms of the day-to-day service 
operations of our organisation, carefully examining the internal and external implications of its employment.</p>
<p>The results of the simulations were mixed, largely because the technology was so unfamiliar and because of scepticism about 
the 'business value' of the net. At that point in time it was still seen as a 'nice-to-have' that would damage productivity and 
corrupt corporate morals!</p>
<p>To overcome existing and potential resistance to the technology, we evaluated its potential using very distant time horizons. We 
recognised that with innovations increasingly being directed toward Internet applications; a diffusion of technology would occur 
that would revolutionise access to, and use of, information and knowledge, which is our core competency. It was an 
opportunity that we could not afford to ignore.</p>
<p>The evaluation phase also indicated that the technology was in such a state of flux that a formal policy governing standards 
would have to be delayed until more stability emerged. Initially, the sole objective was to explore and understand the 
technology and begin moulding it to our requirements as a knowledge organisation without disregarding new developments. </p>
<p>By adopting an incremental approach, we were able to develop a comprehensive and reliable package of Internet services for 
our employees that encouraged them to utilise its potential in a creative manner geared toward maximising the Chamber's 
return on its investment and spreading information about Internet resources that were particularly valuable. <br>
</p>
<p><b><u>Application</u></b> <br>
E-mail and USENet were an immediate success, particularly because of the nature of the Chamber's work as an advocacy 
organisation which requires extensive collective and personal networking; and the collation and distribution of knowledge as a 
value-added product. </p>
<p>Our approach to the world wide web was a little more difficult to conceptualise, largely because we didn't appreciate it's 
potential for non-profit organisations. However, I must admit that once we had decided on a formula, it appeared as if the 
medium had been designed specifically for us. </p>
<p>The use of the web as a credible information resource was very limited in late 1994 and early 1995. However, we recognised 
that the Internet was a public good in the sense that it encouraged knowledge sharing and distribution - it was only a matter of 
time before the biographies of pets would be replaced by decision-making information. We had to ask ourselves what we 
could do for the Internet. </p>
<p>We felt that by developing a benchmark product, we would stimulate the growth of other sites committed to providing quality 
information that we would find valuable in a reciprocal manner. We are immodest enough to believe that our contribution has 
helped to bring a number of other mining and minerals related sites online in South Africa and throughout the world in the last 
18 months.</p>
<p>We decided to appeal to the broadest possible market, from schoolchildren to mining industry analysts. The Chamber web site 
is therefore both an educational project as well as a service to our members and local and international mining industry 
stakeholders. </p>
<p>As an educational tool, it has been impressively successful in imparting knowledge about the benefits of responsible mining 
enterprise. As a service, it has given our members and stakeholders a far better insight into the organisation that represents 
their interests at the highest level. It is now an essential component of the Chamber's advocacy strategy that is complemented 
by the depth and breadth of information being supplied by other mining and minerals related sites.<br>
</p>
<p><b><u>Content</u></b> <br>
We have consciously allowed the web site to evolve according to internal and external requirements, and those of you who are 
familiar with it, will know that it is in its seventh outgrowth. </p>
<p>We have concentrated on making who we are and what we do transparent - to the browsing public and especially our 
members. To achieve this we had to adopt the perspective of someone who is unfamiliar with the Chamber and the mining 
industry. Navigation links have to be devoid of jargon, and the structure must facilitate finding what you require easily and 
quickly.</p>
<p>We believe the single biggest success driver for the Chamber web site is its simplicity - the points of entry and layers of 
information are minimalistic, as is the use of graphics. In effect, everything of substance is accessed through a single area.</p>
<p>The second important driver is substance - we have made very effort to ascertain what our stakeholders consider to be 
required information and combined that with specific information that we would like browsers to digest. </p>
<p>Thirdly, we are fortunate to have high-demand information that can be updated regularly. Having recognised the power of 
regularly updated material, we also introduced a daily news and economic indicators service that has proved extraordinarily 
popular. However, considerable effort is also put into finding new material for publication on the web and we have a fairly 
good monthly production. </p>
<p><b><u>Assessment</u></b> <br>
Activity on our site has a pattern consistent with business users who log in once every week, usually on a Monday morning. 
We therefore ensure that new material is posted on the site by close of business on Friday to make sure that repeat browsers 
will not be disappointed. </p>
<p>We have approximately 12&#160;000 - 15&#160;000 hits per month, excluding graphics and Chamber staff activity, the highest numbers 
coming from the United States, South Africa and Canada. We believe that that is confirmation of the appeal of the site across 
a broad target market. </p>
<p><b><u>Conclusion</u></b> <br>
The future of the Internet for the Chamber lies beyond its origins - in the application of its technology to secure electronic data 
interchange between ourselves and our members. We are looking at Intranet technologies and the way that we can integrate 
our existing information systems with browser front-ends. The result will be far cheaper and more efficient client-server 
solutions than we envisaged just one year ago that will help to reduce the paper mountain we produce each year.</p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

</p>

<p>An outsider looking at the industrial and labour relations
climate in South Africa at present could not be blamed for
reaching the conclusion that things might not all be well on that
front. He would note the high level of acrimony evident at times between
business and labour, and several incidents of industrial action.</p>

<p>Whether correct or not, such perceptions colour the backdrop
against which this signing ceremony today is seen, and make it so
much greater a moment of pride to be able to sign the <a
href="/agreements/wage96.htm">1996/97 WAGES &amp; CONDITIONS OF
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT</a> between the National Union of Mineworkers
[representing some 194 000 employees on Chamber member mines] and
the Chamber of Mines [representing the bulk of South
Africa&#146;s private-sector mining interests] today.</p>

<p>It is an indication that, however great the differences
between us might be, enough commitment, dedication and
perseverance can and do deliver results in the form of an
agreement.</p>

<p>There were fewer items on the negotiating table this year, but
the negotiations proved to be protracted and difficult. This is not
only an indication that the parties faced some particularly complex
issues such as the restructuring of the Mineworkers&#146; Provident
Fund and the Mineworkers&#146; Assurance and Benefits Scheme, but
also that the parties have different perceptions about the economic
position of the industry. </p>

<p>In these circumstances it is particularly gratifying that the
parties once again were able to find each other and reach
agreement.</p>

<p>Mention should be made of the agreement regarding industrial
relations-related education and training in terms of which the mines
- at either Group or mine level -and the union will jointly develop courses
to equip shop stewards for the challenges presented by the new
industrial relations environment as envisaged within the new
Labour Relations Act and the concept of workplace forums among
others. These courses will then be financed by employers.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is the agreement that elected union
representatives serving on various tripartite forums will receive
paid leave to allow for meaningful representation of the union on
such new structures, particularly those set up under the new Mine Health
and Safety Act.</p>

<p>Several other issues were referred to working parties outside
of the wage review, and these will be pursued separately. They include:<br>
· the implementation of the agreement on restructuring the
Provident Fund and the Mineworkers&#146; Assurance <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and Benefits Scheme,<br>
· the institution of a statutory bargaining forum for Chamber
members,<br>
· the possibility of a two-year wage review cycle, and<br>
· the review of the job-grading systems in the industry -
something which was agreed to last year and which the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;parties this year have agreed should continue.</p>

<p>Productivity was a recurrent theme of the wage review, and
numerous sessions were dedicated to this matter. It is an issue which
will be pursued at either Group or mine level outside the wage review.
It is vital to the long-term viability of the industry as a
whole. During the course of the negotiations the NUM indicated
that it stood ready at all times to meet with Groups and individual mines
to discuss these and related issues.</p>

<p>The Chamber of Mines and its members pay tribute to the
negotiating team and to the representatives of the NUM in their deliberations
this year and congratulate all on reaching agreement. This
year&#146;s agreement once again underscores the impressive
levels of sophistication and maturity that characterise the
industrial relations climate within the South African mining industry
- and which, in fact, set it apart from most industry sectors in
this country.<br>

<h3>Address by MrA.J. ('At') du Plessis,<br>President, Chamber of Mines of S.A.,<br>on 16 August 1996,<br> at the Kloof Mine Recreation Club<br> to the<br></h3><h2>1996 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING<BR> of the<br> ASSOCIATION OF MINE HUMAN RESOURCE PRACTITIONERS.<br></b></h2>
<IMG SRC="/line3.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE><br><p></center>

<b>SUMMARY</b><br>
The Chamber's President, Mr At du Plessis, himself a Human Resource Practitioner (Chief Executive, Management Resources) at Gencor, equates Human Resource management to being in a "cauldron"and comments to members of the Association on the following:
<ol>
<li><I>labour unrest and impatience,</I>
<li><I>hardening of bargaining stances,</I> 
<li><I>new legislation, and</I>
<li><I>empowerment,equality and participation in the work place.</I>
</ol><br><p>
<center>
<IMG SRC="/line3.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE><br><p></center>

After making the usual introductory comments and welcoming various guests and VIPs, Mr du Plessis said:<BR><P>
It is always a pleasure to be given the opportunity to address one of the mining industrys important professional associations.  However, that pleasure is doubled when I am able to speak to a group of people who are all in exactly the same line of business in the mining industry as I am.  So therefore,  Mr President, an especially warm thank you for inviting me to attend todays proceedings.<BR><P>
Friederich Nietzsche, in one of his more lucid moments wrote: "Is not life a hundred times too short for us to bore ourselves?"  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if there is one field of endeavour in our industry which is constantly subject to change - particularly in the post democratic election period in this country - it is the field of human resource management.  Time in which to bore yourselves as H. R. practitioners is certainly a scarce commodity these days.<BR><P>
<B>LABOUR UNREST AND IMPATIENCE</B><BR>
While there are also changes taking place as far as engineering methodologies, mining techniques, survey methods, ventilation and refrigeration systems, and so forth are concerned, I would think these changes are taking place definitely not as rapidly, nor accompanied with as much violence, as in our specialised discipline.  The spate of injuries and tragic deaths during unrest at East Driefontein, or even more recently at Rustenburg and Impala Platinum for instance, were neither the result of a rock burst nor the result of a runaway locomotive - they were caused by humans to humans who were emotionally involved in human resource issues.<BR><P>
Our labour force seems increasingly to be showing signs of impatience.  It is coming across as trying its best to drive through issues that it feels its leaders in the union movement are not addressing to their satisfaction.  Due largely to misdirection and disinformation certain employees -- in fact, about 28000 employees at AMPLATS in Rustenburg -- succeeded through their actions not so long ago in undoing much of the good work their leadership had in the past fought so hard to win for them.  Despite the disadvantageous results to the employees at AMPLATS, Impala Platinum employees thereafter also embarked on a five day strike, losing in the process some 11 million Rand in wages.<BR><P>
<B>HARDENING OF BARGAINING STANCES</B><BR>
And on a macro level, it appears that harder stances are being adopted by the unions, the NUM in particular, in their annual negotiations in the Chamber of Mines.  Though, the same hardening of stances can also be said - I might add - of mine management in certain instances.  Declarations of disputes, conciliation boards and mediation seem to characterise bargaining these days and are becoming increasingly commonplace.  Most of us might say that a more level headed approach would be more in order, especially in regard to bargaining in 1996.  The question raised however is this - do we as management indeed have a more level headed approach?  And to what extent does <I>our </I>attitude contribute towards the creation of <I>their </I>attitude?<BR><P> 
Todays human resource practitioners find themselves in a position similar to the witches in Shakespeares Macbeth.  The three witches are to be found opening act four of the play chanting the following famous words around their huge cooking pot: "Double  double toil and trouble; fire burn and cauldron bubble!"  And it is right inside this cauldron, this human resource melting pot, that todays H. R. practitioners finds themselves.  Not always a comfortable place to be, but bearing in mind the rapidly changing environment around us, certainly a stimulating, if not exciting one.<BR><P>
<B>CORRECTIVE ACTION THE SALVATION OF THE INDUSTRY</B><BR>
With so much that is changing around us in the mining industry we tend to forget that these changes are not only the result of the altered political arena in our country.  Our industry has had in the past decade to take a critical look at itself.  In many ways it found itself wanting.  Fortunately it was recognised early on that the way we had done things in the past no longer applied, and if we continued along the same path our industry was doomed to failure.  The situation was critical - for the gold mining sector in particular - but signals were just as loudly being broadcast to coal, platinum, chrome, and others.  That we are all here today at this function is proof positive that we were alert to the changes and heeded the signals in time, and our corrective measures did indeed work.  That does not mean however we are off the hook yet.  Not by a long chalk!<BR><P>
<B>NEW LEGISLATION</B><BR>
In just less than three and a half years from now, we enter the 21st century.  And I would like to state quite categorically that you are going to enter this brave new century doing much of what you did last year, or are doing this year,<U> very much differently indeed</U>.<BR><P>
New legislation, such as the "Labour Relations Act" and the legislation replacing the old Basic Conditions of Employment Act, the pending "Employment Standards Act", and the Labour Market Commission Report are three cases in point which highlight what I am getting at.  Largely because of just these documents, human resource practitioners are certainly going to have their work changed for them, so I am particularly glad at this time to have been given the opportunity of speaking to you.<BR><P>
<B>'GOLDEN THREADS' </B><BR>
Today is not the appropriate time to go into the detail of the documents I mentioned a moment ago, because I would expect most of you would be familiar with at least some of their aspects and implications.  However, when I read through the documents, it became very clear to me that there are three basic concepts running like a golden thread through them all.  And the sooner we can get to grips with these concepts, the better for all concerned.  Each of the documents - though of course not spelt out in as many words - contain the common elements of: Empowerment, Equality and Participation.<BR><P>
I would say that most of you here today find these concepts alien to the way we went about our business in the past.  I know I did!  After all, we are in the mining industry and what mining management says is law and heaven help the poor soul who tries to break that law!  Just the mere idea of allowing employees any small degree of participation, never mind any sort of equality is enough to send shudders down ones spine!<BR><P>
But, whether we like it or not, dramatic change in the H. R. arena is upon us all.  The way in which we did things in the past has turned around significantly and where we once could choose to be either democratic or autocratic in our management styles, that choice has been taken away from us.<BR><P>
The new way of doing things is not a choice, it is legislation and, simply put, if you do not do it the way it has to be done, you are looking for serious trouble, resulting most likely in substantial penalties.<BR><P>
However, one choice still resides with you.  And that is the choice of whether to go with the flow or to resist the legislation changes every step of the way.  Actually, any reasonable person will see that there is not any real choice here either - unless, of course, if you want to make your lives unbearably difficult.<BR><P> 
<B>THE GOLDEN THREAD OF 'EMPOWERMENT'</B><BR>
Of the three concepts of "Empowerment, Equality and Participation", perhaps the most contentious of them is the first, namely "Empowerment."  Simply put it means that it is managements responsibility to see to it that your new management partners (for want of a better term) are real partners in decision making and not just some appointments made out of tokenism.  And if you do not have the properly qualified personnel to fill those roles, you have the responsibility to see to it that you indeed do find the right people.  This means you will most likely have to select and train the appropriate personnel if you hope to succeed.<BR><P>
Careful selection  - and I am not suggesting that you select a bunch of yes-men either - combined with the proper training will ultimately be to your benefit if you go about it in the right way.  Or to put it a little less diplomatically, screw up now and your lives will be made a misery.<BR><P>
<B>THE GOLDEN THREAD OF 'EQUALITY'</B><BR>
The next concept, namely, "Equality", in regard to the new legislation does not mean that, say, a shop steward is equal to his mine manager.   What it means is that, for example, in "workplace forums" every recognised member has equal status and an equal right to be heard and to put across their point of view.  This holds true for management as much as it does for labour and government.  Be  aware of falling into the trap of thinking along the lines suggested by the ruling powers in George Orwells famous allegory, "Animal Farm" that: "All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others." <BR><P>
<B>THE GOLDEN THREAD OF 'PARTICIPATION'</B><BR>
The final concept, that of "Participation" is, I think, self-explanatory.  Labour has for many years been griping about the lack of participation in the affairs of the mine.  They have felt excluded and have, rightfully I might add, felt extremely frustrated at their exclusion.  Now is the time to redress the situation.  In the long run, a better informed, more involved work-force will result in a smoother mining operation.  One of the positive side effects could perhaps be the diminishing of the industrial unrest that has been bedevilling our industry of late  only time will tell.<BR><P>
The role to be played in the new order of things by human resource practitioners is enormous ladies and gentlemen.  But you know this better than anyone else.  You, as members of this association, are in the firing-line of some heavy-weight legislation but I know you will face the challenges ahead of you with skill, aptitude and professionalism.<BR><P>
<B>CONGRATULATIONS TO THE ASSOCIATION'S NEW PRESIDENT</B><BR>
Mr President, congratulations on your election as president of this fine association.  I wish you good luck in your year of presidency.  Furthermore I extend to all the associations members the very best and pray that God grant you strength for the times ahead.<BR><P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B><BR>
The times before you are going to be interesting to say the least.  Frustrations will certainly abound, but there will also be dizzying successes.  Many downs will be counterbalanced by just as many, if not more, ups.  On the other hand, we should again remind ourselves of Nietzsches words: "Is not life a hundred times too short for us to bore ourselves?"  Well, if these days any H.

<p align=left><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
South Africa is mining country - no doubt about that. From 120 years ago when Cecil John Rhodes wheeled and dealed in the 
fastest growing town on the African continent - Kimberley - to today when mining takes place four kilometres below the 
ground.<br>
</p>
<p>Most people in this room have been involved with mining over their lives in one form or another. A lot of you have moved 
around the country with your families building these mines. In doing so, you have created, I believe, one of the best, if not the 
best, mining communities in the world. And I would think most would have found it an exciting, challenging even exhilarating 
career. Indeed, it is only when one stands back from the humdrum existence of everyday issues that one sees the greatness of 
our mining industry, the wealth of our deposits, their immense size, their variety and their position in the global scene. The 
words &quot;world class deposits&quot; were coined here.<br>
</p>
<p><a name="DISCOVERY"><b>DISCOVERY</b></a><b> OF 'WORLD CLASS MINERAL DEPOSITS'</b><br>
The stories of the discoveries are well-known. The strange stone picked up on the Orange River which led to the rush of 
diggers firstly to the rich alluvial deposits on the banks of the Vaal and then to the mother lodes at Colesberg Kopje and 
elsewhere. The diggers went in in their thousands, the pits were being worked faster by the syndicates and much less so by the 
individuals, resulting in the pictures we all know so well of differing heights of claims in an ever deepening hole with spider 
webs of wires fanning and criss-crossing the hole. A chaotic and indeed fragile industry.<br>
</p>
<p>After diamonds the hunt for gold was on, spurred by rumours of discoveries at Pilgrims Rest, the Blyde River and Barberton. 
As Cartwright says: &quot;Watching the events was like watching an exciting film being run through in slow motion.&quot; Early 
prospectors bumbled and stumbled around the Witwatersrand as though blindfolded, following false trails, pausing in the 
wrong places and crushing samples of the wrong rocks. In the end it fell to an Australian, George Harrison, to discover the 
Main Reef Series. And what a discovery!<br>
</p>
<p>Samples were sent to Kimberley and crushed and panned publicly, no doubt with considerable showmanship. The results 
created a sensation. Cartwright&#146;s film had been switched to &quot;fast forward.&quot; Syndicates were formed by all the famous names, 
Beit, Robinson, Rhodes, Sauer. The rush to the Rand was on - and what a rush.<br>
</p>
<p>Diamonds in Kimberley were not enough. They were discovered strewn over the desert at Luderitz by Stauch and then later, 
intermingled with oyster shells, at Oranjemund by Hans Merensky - one of the great names of mineral discoveries in South 
Africa. Wealth of untold proportions in the harshest of climates and environments - an extraordinary tale of mineral discovery.<br>
</p>
<p>Platinum - again by Merensky - in that great geological formation known as the Bushveld igneous complex - followed by 
chrome. The platinum deposits overwhelmed anything found before and after - and because of their very size have not been 
developed to anywhere like their full potential.<br>
</p>
<p>Coal had been found as early as 1880 on the farms Leeuwkuil, Rietfontein and Maccauvlei, near Vereeniging. Until then most 
coal had been imported, and it goes without saying, at considerable cost. Sammy Marks quickly grasped the significance of 
the find on the banks of the Vaal river and invested heavily in the coal mines. Marks, never short of grandiose schemes, 
planned to float loaded barges of coal down the Vaal to Kimberley. Two steel barges were built, and in typical fashion, <i>only 
once they had been built</i> was the river surveyed. The Vaal of course proved unnavigable. Ox wagons were resorted to to 
transport the coal to Kimberley.<br>
</p>
<p>Manganese, vanadium, titanium, iron - the list of the wealth bestowed on this land seems endless.<br>
</p>
<p><b>EARLY </b><a name="SYNDICATES"><b>SYNDICATES</b></a><b>/EVOLUTION OF THE CHAMBER OF MINES OF S.A.</b><br>
To exploit all this required special solutions. Each discovery brought with it immense, almost insoluble, problems. In 
Kimberley the dangerous and impossible situation of hugely differing levels of claim blocks required a drastic solution. This 
came in the form of Barnato and Rhodes and De Beers Consolidated Mines. It was the first small step towards an integrated 
mining company. Kimberley was followed by the Witwatersrand - where it soon became clear that this was no poor man&#146;s 
diggings, like California.<br>
</p>
<p>The remarkable feature here was not so much the richness of the ore but the vast extent and uniformity of the deposits. There 
was still bonanza ground about, certainly, but the average grade overall was not high. It was the continuity that made possible 
the large scale employment of machinery. Indeed the reefs could not be mined on an economic scale without this. Nor could 
such enormous expenditure be justified on a single, or even small group of claims. As a result, syndicates were quickly formed 
to acquire groups of claims. The syndicates were themselves the forerunners of today&#146;s mining finance houses, or &quot;Groups&quot;. 
The potential of the gold-field had been proved but the financing and technological problems associated with the mines were 
only beginning.<br>
</p>
<p>Part of this structural and organising process involved the formation of the Chamber of Mines of South Africa. An important 
motivation for the founding of the Chamber was the need for authoritative information about the output of the new gold field. It 
is forgotten today that the published yields of the diamond fields of Kimberley and of the Witwatersrand gold-field were 
regarded at first with scepticism because mining &#145;experts&#146; had rejected on geological grounds the possibility of major deposits 
in South Africa. The climate of opinion was also not improved by over-speculation and bogus promotion.<br>
</p>
<p>Be that as it may. After a false - though very impressive - start in 1887, a Chamber of Mines was formed - and then closed 
18 months later. Then, barely three years after the first proclamation of gold on the Rand, The Witwatersrand Chamber of 
Mines was launched. Like today&#146;s Department of Mining Engineering it too went through a number of name changes and 
added many functions as it grew. After attracting members from outside the Transvaal it eventually settled on the name it 
enjoys today.<br>
</p>
<p><b>SUPPLY OF </b><a name="WATER"><b>WATER</b></a><b> TO THE REEF</b><br>
Water, another vital commodity for the mines, was available in abundance from the Vaal river though supply was erratic. In 
1901 Lord Milner appointed a commission to &quot;prepare a scheme for the creation of an unfailing water supply to the Rand and 
the mines&quot; which led to the establishment of an enduring institution, the Rand Water Board, charged with supplying potable 
water from Randfontein to Springs.<br>
</p>
<p><b>YOUNG </b><a name="VISIONARIES"><b>VISIONARIES</b></a><b>/PIONEERS</b><br>
As rich as all these mineral deposits and reefs were, there were major riches to emerge in the people front. The pioneering 
spirit, the seemingly limitless opportunities and the need for consolidation in diamonds and gold resulted in co-operation first, 
then the formation of syndicates and finally the mining finance house system, which has served this country so well.<br>
</p>
<p>The history of the diamond rush is peppered with the names of many entrepreneurs familiar to you. Young, dynamic people 
like Rhodes who began his career there at the age of 18, while Alfred Beit, Julius Werner, Sammy Marks, George Albu, John 
Merriman, Leander Starr Jameson, Lionel Phillips and Barney Barnato were all 22 or younger. These young entrepreneurs 
who emerged at Kimberley brought with them to the Witwatersrand a gift for getting things done in the face of seemingly 
insurmountable difficulty. Not surprisingly, perhaps, they were sometimes short on patience, and sometimes short on wisdom. 
But they were rich in faith in the future greatness of South Africa. A future greatness firmly rooted in the world&#146;s single biggest 
gold field.<br>
</p>
<p>These were the visionaries who made the mines work. Certainly they rank with the greats of mining elsewhere and what they 
created stands today as a monument to their efforts. Subsequent generations have continued with this tradition.<br>
</p>
<p><b>S.A. LEADS IN MINING </b><a name="TECHNOLOGY"><b>TECHNOLOGY</b></a><br>
When difficulties were encountered people came up with solutions. Deep level mining with all its problems of shafts and shaft 
sinking, of mining and support systems, of seismic problems and breakthroughs in seismic research; heat problems overcome 
by ventilation systems and ice cooling; metallurgical breakthroughs such as CIL and CIP which kept our name high in the 
international world of mining; and geophysics and the magnetometer which had its first great success here.<br>
</p>
<p>A great deal of the strength of this great industry has been the army of people who have laboured and toiled over many years 
in the mines, the plants and the offices. These are the people who shaped the country in many ways, who made things happen 
and who developed the technology that made this industry great.<br>
</p>
<p><a name="GROWTH"><b>GROWTH</b></a><b> OF DEPARTMENT OF MINING ENGINEERING FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS</b><br>
This is where this great institution - Wits - comes into its own. None of this would have been possible without the really 
excellent tertiary education institutions in South Africa. Of particular importance was and remains Wits - for historical reasons, 
its proximity and also because of the quality of its graduates.<br>
</p>
<p>The dominant city in South Africa in 1890 was, of course, Cape Town which already had a fairly well-established university, 
the University of the Cape of Good Hope and also the home of the South African College, the leading teaching institution. The 
Council of the College proposed in 1890 to establish a school of mines in Cape Town, which proposal was opposed, wisely 
as it transpired, by Rhodes, who - by the way - became Prime Minister of the Cape in July that year. Not that he was against 
the idea of a school of mines. He believed Kimberley - where, after all, the country&#146;s mining activities were then centred - 
would be the more appropriate seat.<br>
</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the proposal was shelved - but four years later, in 1894, it was resurrected. This time with the co-operation of 
the Cape government and De Beers, but unfortunately in a flawed form:- two years of theoretical training in Cape Town, 
followed by a year of practical training in Kimberly and a further year in Johannesburg during which students would be placed 
under the care of various mine managers. After much wrangling - in the middle of which the ill-fated Jameson Raid on the 
Transvaal Republic took place which - shall we say - didn&#146;t help matters in any way - the South African School of Mines 
opened its doors in Kimberley in August 1896 to an initial student body of five intrepid youths.<br>
</p>
<p>Obviously the system of fragmented study was neither viable nor practical and the Kimberley School of Mines was, to put it 
mildly, rather unsuccessful. It was &quot;started on the worst possible basis and with the least amount of money that any school 
ever started.&quot; Throughout, the school was short of finance, staff, and students. It closed temporarily in 1899 with the outbreak 
of the Anglo-Boer war and the ensuing siege of Kimberley. But the defeat of the Boer republics provided the death knell to 
the school because, with the Boer republics now reduced to colonial status, the political incentive for maintaining a school of 
mines in the Cape collapsed.<br>
</p>
<p>With the ink on the Treaty of Vereeniging hardly dry, Lord Milner established Johannesburg as the centre for mining and 
technical education in South Africa - largely for imperial reasons. It was hoped that a university would, amongst other ideals, 
stabilise the local British population and promote the assimilation of the Afrikaner. After winning the war it seemed a good 
idea at the time, but was doomed to failure as a system of secondary education in the Transvaal capable of sustaining anything 
approaching a university was simply not there. Furthermore, there were grave doubts as to the appropriateness of 
Johannesburg as the seat of higher learning. In those days it was the haven of pimps and prostitutes, speculators and sharp 
dealers, liquor and violence.<br>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, on the recommendation of a special commission the School of Mines in Kimberley transferred to Johannesburg 
as the Transvaal Technical Institute in 1902. Its first professors were appointed in typical technical disciplines such as 
engineering, mining, metallurgy, chemistry, and geology. Interestingly enough, only the Department of Geology has survived in 
its original form.<br>
</p>
<p>Jan Smuts, who was the then Minister of Education, thought that Johannesburg was far too decadent a place for a university 
and he moved the seat of the Transvaal University College to Pretoria, later to become Tukkies. The Institute in Johannesburg 
in turn became the Applied Science Department of the Transvaal University College, which in turn became the South African 
School of Mines and Technology in 1910. All very complicated and I suppose somewhat unnecessary, but nevertheless, from 
this, somehow, a university of stature was born and was officially inaugurated as the University of the Witwatersrand in 1922.<br>
</p>
<p>Looking at how our industry has grown an prospered there is no doubt that we have been well-served by Wits in general and 
the Mining Department in particular. There have been ebbs and flows. However, the number and competence of Wits mining 
graduates - and their status in the world of mining - is testimony to this department. I know you will also agree with me that 
under Huw Phillips it has certainly regained its pre-eminent position amongst the mining schools of the world.<br>
</p>
<p><b>DEVELOPMENT OF THE 'MINING </b><a name="HOUSE"><b>HOUSE</b></a><b>' SYSTEM</b><br>
A feature of South African mining has been the development of the mining house system. Being in Africa the mining industry 
faced two critical shortages - money and skills. The mining house system made best use of both those scarce resources - by 
equity leverage and public listings on the one hand, and by enabling top technical and financial people to spread themselves 
over many mines and without losing their entrepreneurial touch.<br>
</p>
<p>The founders of these houses are legend, as are those who succeeded them over the years. While some of the mining houses 
have fallen by the way, we still have some of the largest and most successful in the world. Being forced to struggle through 40 
years of isolation and almost as long a time of exchange control has seriously limited our ability to become truly global players. 
The isolation, however, did protect us from incursions and takeovers, but this is now changing and the harsh winds are 
blowing. Nevertheless, these winds have also brought many opportunities which the houses of today are running with strongly.<br>
</p>
<p>Most of the houses still exist - but where they had a common basis for their creation, circumstances now are much more 
varied and many have already moved in diverging directions. More divergencies are likely as the debate about bundling or 
unbundling, pooling of management skills or decentralising them, national or international focus - continues. One thing is for 
sure though - South African mining houses will be around for some time yet.<br>
</p>
<p><a name="ROLE"><b>ROLE</b></a><b> OF TRADE UNIONS</b><br>
Trade unions have played a major role - not just in the industry but in shaping the country. The early white unions took on the 
big companies and forced them to make room for them. The black trade unions did much more. They mobilised their 
members in the workplace - but, more importantly, provided a political outlet - a safety valve. With hindsight we could have - 
should have - done things differently, but the mining industry was a pawn in a much greater political game. The 1970&#146;s and the 
1980&#146;s were rough years. But it may well just be that the constant - even though acrimonious - negotiations pushed the 
country politically into the realisation that there was really only one solution - negotiation for a common destiny. Thereafter the 
black trade unions provided the new government with much of its leadership. It now remains to address the labour related 
issues.<br>
</p>
<p><a name="OUTLOOK"><b>OUTLOOK</b></a><b> FOR THE FUTURE</b><br>
But what about the future? There are many challenges and serious problems facing us. To look only through rose coloured 
spectacles would be wrong. Equally, the prophets of doom and gloom will also be confounded. It is worth reflecting for a 
moment on the rich history of the mining industry, on the daunting problems faced 100 - or even 50 years ago. These have 
been overcome. We need only look back five years to see how far we have come - from such a low road. In five years time 
we will look back equally incredulously to see how far we have progressed on the high road.<br>
</p>
<p>One last thing to the students here tonight - never forget how much people like Rhodes, Barnato and Marks achieved, and 
never forget how very young they were.<br>

*	THE NEED FOR AN ENABLING & FAVOURABLE ENVIRONMENT<BR>
*	THE NEED TO BETTER UTILISE WORKING TIME<BR>
*	OPTIMAL UTILISATION OF HUMAN RESOURCES<BR>
*	CONCLUSION</B><BR><P><P>
If one over-riding message is to emerge from this, the 1996 Sub-Saharan Oil & Minerals Conference, it should be that mining in Sub-Saharan Africa in general - and in South Africa in particular - is very much alive and brimming with promise. <BR><P>
This is not a naïve denial of the reality or gravity of the challenges facing all of us. Rather it is a powerful reaffirmation of the dogged resilience of mining men and women, their consistent creativity in the face of change and their preparedness to confront all the issues of the day (no matter how unpleasant they may be). <BR><P>
In short - we are seeing today the same powerful and pervasive optimism that has characterised miners since first they gouged wealth from the earth.<BR><P>
One of the critical challenges facing the industry in South Africa today is that of implementing a new form of tripartism. This time not so much in terms of a co-operative relationship as in that between employers, employees and government - although this facet remains vitally important.   Rather it relates to the title of my presentation today - MANAGEMENT, LABOUR AND PRODUCTIVITY; a kind of <B>OPERATIONAL TRIPARTISM</B>.<BR><P>
The English writer and one-time chaplain to the king, Thomas Fuller, once remarked that "A mariner must have his eye upon rocks and sand as well as upon the North Star". The same applies metaphorically to a miner - who has to deal with the here-and-now practicalities of wresting mineral wealth from the rocks and sand that hold them,  but equally his eye must remain fixed upon the guiding objective of  long-term viability and prosperity, both for the industry and for the greater social well-being.<BR><P>
But, in this process, we need to identify and campaign for the establishment of those conditions which, like fair winds and weather were to the mariners of Fullers time, are indispensable for mining to survive and thrive. Here I am referring to the <B>ENABLING AND FAVOURABLE ENVIRONMENT</B> for both mining and mining investment. <BR><P>
While it is patently obvious that management and labour urgently need to find ways and means of pooling their resources in this campaign, the realities within the nascent and fluid democracy in South Africa are quite different. <BR><P>
It is acknowledged that managements across the board need to move away from some of the historical hierarchical structures which have served them well in, and change their philosophies, attitudes, measurements and methods for more effective approaches in todays world of work. By the same token, labour at all levels needs to jettison outdated and inappropriate ideologies, inject serious effort into productivity drives and reprioritise their agenda to reflect the complex demands of society on the threshold of the millennium.<BR><P>
At the same time as looking to what management and labour can and should be doing, we need to identify what government, the formulators and implementers of law, is doing. As far as mining is concerned, there are both heartening and dispiriting signals.<BR><P>
The new Mine Health and Safety Act holds great potential for bringing about safer and more healthy conditions on our mines.  As the<A HREF="http://www.bullion.org.za/speeches/atsubsa.htm"> President of the Chamber of Mines, Mr At du Plessis, said yesterday</A>, this Act, the result of  compromise, could well be recognised as "the most constructive legislative enactment in (our) industrys history". This point is very important, for it also helps locate other legislative developments within the greater context of the sweeping and comprehensive statutory review upon which the government has clearly embarked. Of key interest in this context will be the formulation of the Mining and Minerals Policy now in progress.<BR><P>
New bills and the regulatory environment they generate not only have direct impact on our industry, but send critical messages across the globe affecting investment decisions and colouring international perceptions about our country. No one piece of legislation can be viewed in grand isolation: the Mine Health and Safety Act and the emerging minerals policy need to be seen together with the Labour Relations Act (LRA), the Employment Standards Act (ESA) and several other possible regulatory changes.<BR><P>
In this context too it is heartening to see the steps currently being undertaken within the Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs - and especially in the Government Mining Engineers division. Building on the recommendations of the Leon Commission of Enquiry into Mine Health and Safety, many of which have been entrenched in the new Act, the entire mining industry will be looking to the men and women of this division for effective regulation and implementation of requirements and standards embodied in the Act.<BR><P>
Our industry has also seen, in rapid succession, the appointment of not only a new Deputy Minister, but a new Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs to whom management and labour will be looking for clear guidance and sound judgement in the creation and development of a new dispensation for mining in SA.<BR><P>
Simultaneously, however, the ambit of the favourable enabling environment mentioned earlier has to be cast wider since we all live and work in a greater social framework. This means crime, housing, migrancy, the general economic environment, certainty regarding taxation and discipline in monetary and fiscal policies need to be factored in as well.<BR><P>
We are encouraged by the many positive signals emerging from both national and provincial governments in this regard. Comprehensive programmes to seriously cut the unacceptably high crime rates, recent initiatives to deliver on housing promises, early signs that augur possible economic improvements, recent steps by the Katz committee on taxation to look into the vexed question of  ring-fencing, and what appear to be serious efforts by government to bring about greater monetary and fiscal discipline - are all heartening to the SA mining industry.<BR><P>
However, we need to contextualise these factors within the ambit of this presentation - the operating relationship between management, labour and productivity.<BR><P>
As we stand at the start of the annual wages and conditions of employment negotiations between the Chamber of Mines and the various unions and associations, it is valuable briefly to examine some of the pivotal issues colouring this years discussions.<BR><P>
<B><Center>THE NEED TO BETTER UTILISE WORKING TIME</Center></B><BR><P>
The groundwork was laid during last years negotiations for the establishment of methods to optimise available working time - a fundamental facet of improving productivity levels. The SA mining industry is highly capital intensive and needs to address the demands of reducing pay limits. To this end it is important that every day be utilised to its utmost, without entailing a necessity that employees work more hours than at present.<BR><P>
Central to this endeavour are the twin issues of Full Calendar Operations (or Fulco) and dealing with the not-insignificant jump in the number of public holidays with which the mining industry has had to deal in the past 18 months. By Fulco we mean the opportunity to utilise every day of the year to maintain production on mines - an opportunity which is currently denied us through the statutory prohibition of blasting or working on Sundays contained in Section 9 of the Mines and Works Act. Mines which have been able to negotiate with employees to gain their support for Fulco, have had to apply to the Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs for exemption from this prohibition. Mines which have succeeded in this have met largely with highly favourable results. <BR><P>
The central issue for the industry, however, is our belief that this restriction is wholly inappropriate for our times, not to mention the specific and serious circumstances facing especially the gold mining industry.<BR><P>
These straits are further compounded by the fact that we have to cope with no fewer than 12 statutory paid public holidays in terms of the new Public Holidays Act.  This has placed an inordinate burden on mining, which, prior to January 1 last year, only had to cope with four holidays. The situation also has an added barb in that the act stipulates that, where a public holiday falls on  a Sunday, the Monday immediately following shall be a holiday - as will be the case this coming weekend!<BR><P>
It has, therefore, become increasingly vital that management and labour co-operate with due haste to find mutually acceptable means of ensuring that each day is utilised to the fullest degree - and then to approach government to remove counter-productive and outmoded restrictions. As the Chamber of Mines, we are highly optimistic this can be achieved, and the indications from mine-level would seem to support our optimism. The agreement reached with the NUM (National Union of Mineworkers) last year regarding two-tier bargaining - and possibly substantiated by the bargaining councils envisaged in the LRA - holds great promise in support of this view.<BR><P>
<B><Center>OPTIMAL UTILISATION OF HUMAN RESOURCES</Center></B><BR><P>
Mining in SA - especially gold mining - will remain labour intensive, and we have to develop our human resources if we are to increase productivity. This is a sine qua non. It is wholly unrealistic to expect labour to achieve its side of the tripartite equation without providing each employee with every opportunity to maximise his or her potential.<BR><P>
Already, widespread and meaningful mine-level initiatives and educational programmes are being implemented to provide a wide range of skills. These efforts have been supported by industry framework agreements signed between the Chamber and NUM on Adult Basic Education and Training (ABET) last year, and Paid Education and Training Leave (PETL) this year. These programmes provide vital skills ranging from adult basic education, through career development, supervisory and technical skills training to multi-tasking and training aimed at equipping mineworkers for life outside mining in the event of retrenchment. <BR><P>
Attendant issues with human resource optimisation include the appropriate and effective implementation of  affirmative action programmes, the hands-on implementation of the provisions of the Mine Health and Safety Act (MHSA) and the development of the Mining Qualifications Authority (MQA) in the context of the larger National Qualifications Framework (NQF).<BR><P>
Of particular significance to management is the maturity and sophistication of the relationships which have been built between management and labour in our industry. We have been able to forge some of the most sophisticated agreements in the world thanks to this fact. As we face this years round of negotiations, tough though they undoubtedly will be, we can rest assured that what will emerge will be as much a benchmark agreement as were those which preceded it.<BR><P>

<B><Center>CONCLUSION.</Center></B><BR><P>
In his budget speech to the Senate last month, outgoing Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs, Pik Botha, stated the following: "South Africas gold mining sector, for long the backbone of the mineral industry and the economy, is facing major challenges. It has become a mature industry, increasingly forced to mine lower grades at greater depths and greater distances from the shafts. South African gold industry costs have consequently become the highest anywhere.<BR><P>
"Minings contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) declined from 15,4% in 1986 to 7,7% in 1995. The contribution of mining to total merchandise exports likewise declined from 60% in 1986 to 43,5% in 1995. Average employment in the mining industry fell from 828 000 to 596 000 during the same period."<BR><P>
But then he went on to say - and I venture to extend his words beyond gold mining to other sectors of the industry as well - Minister Botha told the Senate: "The gold mining industry has faced and weathered difficult conditions before. With government, management and labour pulling together, the necessary adjustments can be achieved." - and this is the point I wish to communicate today.<BR><P>
With co-operation and commitment by all three stakeholders and the joint efforts of management and labour, especially at mine level, this industry can rise to a position of even greater economic, social and internationally competitive pre-eminence in South Africa - and indeed in Sub-Saharan Africa.<BR><P>

at the <br>
1996 SUB-SAHARAN OIL &amp; MINERALS CONFERENCE<br>
Johannesburg, 10 June 1996<br>
</h3>
<p align=center><img src="/line3.gif" align=middle width=590 height=2><br>
</p>
<p align=left>Given that there remains an abundance and wide variety of unmined mineral deposits in South African soil, the single most 
important imperative for their successful and profitable future extraction will be the availability of suitably equipped people. 
That they be suitably equipped is a critical criterion because the business of mining demands a unique set of qualities and 
talents that are not the natural possession of all individuals.</p>
<p>Mining in South Africa - and particularly gold mining which will more than likely remain the country&#146;s major earner of foreign 
exchange for many years to come - is most commonly conducted in arduous conditions thousands of metres below ground. It 
has always been labour intensive and in spite of impressive capital intensive technological innovations that have been 
productively introduced over the years, there is no compelling evidence to suggest that the operational profile of south african 
mining is about to be radically changed.</p>
<p>People will continue to be the industry&#146;s pre-eminent asset.</p>
<p>That much accepted, the fundamental challenge that confronts industry leadership - if continuing viability is to be ensured - is 
to forge flexible and constructive partnerships with employees which are designed to optimise performance in a working 
environment that is both acceptable and beneficial to all industry stakeholders.</p>
<p>Much progress in achieving this objective has already been made. However, it is a broad-based, multifaceted process that 
demands ongoing attention. It will almost certainly result in considerable revision of existing work-place practices as well as 
changes to remuneration policies that traditionally have been followed.</p>
<p>The consequences of failure to co-operatively re-engineer outdated work practices and conditions are unappealing. They 
include premature mine closures and substantial job losses. But contrary to what is believed by some people, the mining 
industry&#146;s objective is to refrain from putting even one employee on the street if it can be prevented. Finding the means to 
prevent job losses will require the co-operation and participation of all role players.</p>
<p>Positive advances that have previously been effected in the endeavour to enhance the productive capacity of the mining 
industry&#146;s human resource constituent, have been the outcome of the sophisticated collective bargaining structure that has 
evolved over a period extending back to the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand more than 100 years ago. For some time 
- specifically during the 1980s - the relationship between employers and employees was diluted by the understandable 
introduction by the National Union of Mineworkers of a political dimension to the negotiation process. Political demands 
brought to the table fell outside the competence of employers to deliver. They were nevertheless regarded as an essential 
component of the process by NUM representatives who assumed the dual responsibility of articulating the political objectives 
of their disenfranchised constituents as well as their work-related demands.</p>
<p>The reason for this adulteration of the classic labour/capital relationship is well known. Apartheid era unions were the only 
legitimate institutions for the expression of a much wider range of social and political aspirations. The political intrusion was 
significant. It brought to the process - most certainly in the mining industry - a robustness and vigour which sharpened 
negotiation skills and propelled the bilateral relationship to a level of maturity that would otherwise have taken much longer to 
accomplish.</p>
<p>It is on that foundation that the existing association between mining industry employers and the NUM, by far the biggest of 
several industry unions, was constructed. With the advent of democracy in our country the political heat has been removed 
from the equation. Today&#146;s priority rests firmly in the domain of agreeing the work-related fundamentals to ensure that the 
industry continues to provide jobs for hundreds of thousands of people while simultaneously maintaining its role as a national 
creator of wealth.</p>
<p>The additional participant in determining the success of this endeavour is government.</p>
<p>While employers and employees may well negotiate mutually beneficial conditions and agreements, their practical efficacy 
could easily be inhibited by unfriendly statutory decree. South Africa&#146;s new democratic government is currently engaged in a 
comprehensive statutory review. Because it is a microcosm of South African society, there is very little legislation which does 
not impact, directly or indirectly, on the mining industry. The present review process provides useful opportunity for the 
amendment of laws which detrimentally affect the mining industry&#146;s capacity to operate at its most effective level. There are 
several such enactments and they are receiving attention in various tripartite forums.</p>
<p>The most recent and by far the most significant product of tripartite deliberations insofar as mining is concerned, is without 
doubt the new draft Mine Health and Safety Act. Predictably, because it is the creation of the characteristic give-and-take 
activity of a negotiation exercise, the proposed act does not enjoy the unconditional acceptance of all parties. It contains some 
elements clearly forged in a spirit of compromise.</p>
<p>All things considered, however, there is a belief that the provisions of the new Act - once promulgated and introduced - have 
the potential to deliver a safer working environment for mining industry employees. There is nothing more important for 
although mining - wherever it is pursued - is a potentially hazardous business, the sanctity of human life must always take 
precedence over all other objectives. If the new safety provisions significantly reduce the South African mining industry&#146;s 
fatality and injury rates - figures which it is conceded are unacceptably high - then they will most certainly earn the 
well-deserved recognition of being probably the most constructive legislative enactments in the industry&#146;s history.</p>
<p>Time will be the judge of the new Act&#146;s effectiveness.</p>
<p>Whether it works or not will also be determined to some considerable extent by the degree to which management and 
employees are prepared to commit themselves to the spirit of the Act. The new provisions give employees considerably more 
authority and say than they have had in the past to exercise a judgment on the safety of the working environment. They also - 
in their existing composition - place awesome emphasis on management&#146;s responsibility to ensure that working conditions, 
particularly underground, are not life-threatening.<br>
</p>
<p>What is clearly required to underwrite the successful implementation of the new Act is the kind of constructive partnership, or 
compact, between management and employees which I referred to earlier. There can be no doubt that democratisation of the 
workplace is the logical attendant of the democratic transition that has transformed wider South African society. Employees 
must - indeed will - become a far greater participative component in the determination of business imperatives.</p>
<p>There is, however, a <i>quid pro quo</i>.</p>
<p>In the same way that democratic society grants rights but imposes obligations, workplace democracy requires 
co-responsibility in exchange for participation. This concept - although it has extensive application potential - is particularly 
significant in the areas of safety and productivity in the underground working environment. It is imperative that employees 
exercising their right to help compose the rules governing safe work practices, be correspondingly obliged to accept 
responsibility for ensuring their own and their colleagues&#146; adherence to those rules.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is necessary for labour and employers to adopt a fully co-operative approach to improve productivity. The 
time has come, not only to reconstruct and develop our country, but through the development of people and adherence to 
their need for houses and other social infrastructure, also to reconstruct and reorganise business operations aimed at insuring 
maximum employment and optimal utilisation of ore reserves to compete internationally and create wealth for every individual 
involved in the business of mining.</p>
<p>Minimising the threat to life and reducing injuries through the creation of a safer working domain in the mining industry can 
contribute to the realisation of these objectives. Experience demonstrates that a safe working environment is more often than 
not far more productive than one perceived to be dangerous. As a result productivity profiles on mines with low accident rates 
are consistently superior to those of mines with a higher incidence of casualties.</p>
<p>What this clearly implies is that there is an association between safety, productivity and ultimately, profit. It is, therefore, in the 
interests of all mining industry stakeholders to promote the improvement of safety standards.</p>
<p>In South Africa, as well as other third-world countries on the African continent, the task of enhancing safety - and hence the 
profitability of an enterprise - is an exercise far removed from approaches adopted in first-world economies. Most mining 
industry employees in South Africa and neighbouring countries are drawn from disadvantaged communities. They have not 
been the beneficiaries of well-structured primary and secondary educational facilities. The few that have been exposed to a 
reasonable level of scholastic instruction were - in many instances - prevented from developing to their full potential by 
apartheid laws which compelled employers to retard their progress to a comparatively menial level on the hierarchical ladder. 
Senior positions were reserved for people with white skins.</p>
<p>The mining industry consistently opposed the statutes that inhibited human resource development during the previous era. They 
are now, thankfully, dispatched to the annals of history. But they have left our country - and indeed the mining industry - with 
an unfortunate legacy. There now exists in South Africa a considerable number of people - many of them working in the 
mining industry - with abundant productive potential but deprived of the developmental progression to perform at optimal 
capacity.<br>
</p>
<p>This is a condition that the mining industry will not condone. It acknowledges its responsibility to develop to their maximum 
possible potential both the educational and the operational capabilities of its employees. This is done in the knowledge that 
there is no other way to improve the quality of the lives of our employees and their dependants and to maximise the generation 
of profits for our shareholders and other stakeholders including the fiscus.</p>

The new South Africa recently celebrated its second birthday on 27 April 1996.  We call the birthday of our now-democratic state, Freedom Day.  And so it should be.  South Africa has achieved freedom:  freedom from discrimination, freedom for all to play their part in selecting who shall govern over them, and freedom for anyone to participate in that government.<BR><P>
But there are other freedoms still to be achieved.  Freedom from poverty, hunger and fear.  Freedom from the violence of crime.  Freedom from ignorance and disease.  Freedom from the hostilities, divisions and wounds of the past.<BR><P>
The mining, minerals and energy industries in South Africa have an essential role to play in increasing and expanding these freedoms.  Whatever their defects may have been, these sectors form the foundation of our economy.<BR><P>
Imagine where South Africa would be had there been no minerals, no entrepreneurs to develop them or no miners to mine them.  Imagine a South Africa without our electricity infrastructure.<BR><P>
In 1996 we will be completing South Africas minerals and mining policy process as well as our energy policy process.  As regards the mining policy process, a trilateral Steering Committee of government, the mining industry and organised labour, is managing a transparent and inclusive mining policy review.  The Committee has drawn up and distributed a discussion document on minerals and mining policy.  Later this year a first draft will be published and then a final policy position paper.<BR><P>
The position with energy is similar.  There too a discussion document has been drawn up and we are expecting a draft and then a final white paper.<BR><P>
The process is intended to provide policies in each sector that will demonstrate excellence due to the widespread sources of the inputs as well as a high degree of credibility and acceptance.<BR><P>
Major issues dealt with in the policy process include making our business and investment terms even more internationally competitive.  This will provide the resources we need to improve education, health services, combat crime and reduce unemployment.  For the same reasons we need to promote greater access to the mining industry while at the same time guaranteeing security of tenure.<BR><P>
There are many who have it as their ambition to establish small-scale mining operations.  Some of our major mining houses have taken this seriously.  They have looked through their portfolios and are prepared to identify and make available resources which lend themselves to smaller scale operations.  Others should follow their example.<BR><P>
There is in some quarters a concern that small miners will not have the capacity to comply with the prescribed mine health and safety measures or with environmental requirements.  They often lack the financial resources or the expertise to fulfil what is required.  But the basic point still remains stubbornly valid:  we need to create opportunities for as many of the smaller operators as are prepared to take them up.  We can find ways and means of ensuring acceptable standards of health, safety, environmental protection and competence.<BR><P>
Our other ambition is to provide an effective service to those from South Africa or abroad who seek to pioneer or run a substantial mining venture.  The state owes them an administrative system that speedily and effectively supplies them with what they need.  Mine promoters and managers deserve prompt and accurate advice and information from the Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs and its associated organisations.<BR><P>
South Africas mineral industry will also have to consolidate initiatives to improve working conditions as well as considering workers, their families and the communities in which it operates.  Housing, training, recreation, health services - in short the improvement of the quality of life - have all been improving in recent years.  This parliament is busy enacting a Mine Health and Safety Bill that is in line with the latest international developments.  The Bill has already passed its second reading in the other place and it will be debated here next week.  Our health and accident statistics will hopefully show that the new law and the new Inspectorate are having an effect.  It is essential that Inspectorate salaries are commensurate with those in the private sector.  We can have the best laws in the world, but unless those that police them are vigilant and effective and rewarded as such, we will remain with sterile words on a statute book.<BR><P>
South Africas gold mining sector, for long the backbone of the mineral industry and the economy, is facing major challenges.  It has become a mature industry, increasingly forced to mine lower grades at greater depths and greater distances from the shafts.  South African gold industry costs have consequently become the highest anywhere.<BR><P>
Minings contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) declined from 15,4% in 1986 to 7,7% in 1995.  The contribution of mining to total merchandise exports likewise declined from 60% in 1986 to 43,5% in 1995.  Average employment in the mining industry fell from 828 000 to 596 000 during the same period.<BR><P>
The gold mining industry has faced and weathered difficult conditions before.  With government, management and labour pulling together, the necessary adjustments can be achieved.  Improvements in technology may yet play a greater role than we anticipate.<BR><P>
In addition there are other imperfections in our mining and elsewhere.  Although the country commands good technology and skills, the base is too narrow, leading to a shortage of skilled manpower with a large supply of unskilled labour.  South Africas expenditure on research and development falls short of what is required to keep the country competitive internationally.  The high cost of capital limits development of large mechanised mines and beneficiation plants, required to achieve economies of scale and international competitiveness.<BR><P>
The mineral industrys high concentration of economic power makes it difficult for foreigners to gain meaningful access.  However, recent Japanese investments in South Africas ferroalloys industry show that joint ventures can be successful.  The limited and fragmented availability of information about South Africas mining and regulatory structure is also cited as a weak point.  This is in the process of being rectified by implementing the recently approved new structure of my Department.<BR><P>
Unrealistic demands in respect of the environment and social commitment in some cases threaten to impose financial burdens on the mineral industry in excess of those applicable to our competitors.  A balanced and pragmatic approach needs to be adopted.  Of course we need to protect the environment and provide economic and other encouragement for those who need it.  But we must be realistic enough not to destroy the source which enables us to protect our environment and care for our less privileged.  In that case our last state will be worse than our first.<BR><P>
Due to the vastness of some of our resources - manganese, the platinum-group metals, chromium, vanadium - South Africas production is not related to its reserves.  This leads some to charge that reserves are being sterilised.  But companies take these decisions on the basis of what they can sell.  Forcing companies to bring reserves to account would lead to destructive internal competition, as chrome once showed.  International markets for these minerals are generally small in relation to our resources.  Even small supply increases can destroy prices.  The whole country would lose.<BR><P>
From the above, it might seem that the industry is not doing that well.  This is an oversimplification.  South Africa remains a major producer, in world terms, of many minerals.  She dominates the worlds treasure chest in andalusite, chromium, gold, manganese, the platinum-group metals and vanadium.  The country is in the worlds top five for antimony, asbestos, coal, diamonds, fluorspar, nickel, phosphate rock, titanium, vermiculite, zinc and zirconium, with significant reserves of copper, iron, lead and uranium.  The only mineral imports of note apart from crude oil are alumina, coking coal, magnesite, potash, soda ash, sulphur and tin.<BR><P>
There are several reasons why the South African mineral sectors apparent decline is not what it may seem:<BR>
<B>Firstly, </B>77% of South Africas total mineral revenue by value comes from exports.  Even though many mineral commodity prices have recovered during the last few years, most prices have shown a long term downward trend.  Minings shrinking share of the GDP also reflects lower international prices.<BR><P>
<B>Secondly, </B>the misfortunes of the gold sector - gold production fell from 619 tons in 1993 to 522 tons in 1995 - mask the fortunes of the rest of the industry.  The contribution of gold sales to total mineral sales may have declined from 69% in 1986 to 53% in 1995, but coal production increased from 176,7-million tons in 1986 to 204,3-million tons in 1995 and its exports increased from 46,9-million tons to 59,7-million tons.<BR><P>
<B>Thirdly, </B>the decrease in employment is also a reflection of improved efficiencies.  Employment opportunities have been lost by right sizing, productivity improvements and mechanisation.  In the gold mining sector, tons of ore milled per employee increased from 202 in 1986 to 262 in 1995.  In the coal sector, tons mined per employee increased from 1 827 in 1986 to 4 128 in 1995.<BR><P>
<B>Fourthly, </B>South Africas mineral industry has been undergoing a process of adjustment.  The important question for a successful economy is how to remain a winning nation after an original competitive advantage - mining in this case - has lessened.  Much of South Africas physical and financial infrastructure and its secondary industries were developed on the back of mining.  The Physical infrastructure - roads, railways, electricity and telecommunications - is extensive and of a good standard.  The financial infrastructure, required for the development of capital-intensive mineral-related industries, is world class.<BR><P>
South Africas energy costs, due to its coal, are of the lowest in the world.  This favours energy-intensive mineral beneficiation projects.  South Africa also boasts world-calibre mineral-related research institutions - Mintek, the Council for Geoscience, the AEC and the CSIRs Miningtek.  South African minerals graduates have proven themselves all over the world.  South Africa is an international leader in mining and mineral beneficiation, as well as developing competitive related industries like mining machinery and mineral processing plants.<BR><P>
Economic competitiveness is being built increasingly on technological and skills advantages.  For decades now, the terms of trade have been in favour of producers of manufactured products rather than of raw materials.  This underlines the importance of technology development, and South and southern Africa are no exceptions.<BR><P>
Whereas the contribution of the mining industry since the 1950s has been declining, that of manufacturing has been increasing.  Much of this growth in manufacturing has been mineral-based, consisting of value-adding activities.<BR><P>
This throws a different light on the role of mining and minerals in the GDP, foreign exchange and employment.<BR><P>
As countries develop industrially, the products required change to those requiring less traditional metals and minerals.  The need for environment-friendliness and the willingness to pay a higher price for longer-lasting products has changed metal and mineral requirements.  The use of traditional metals and minerals has lessened, leading to overproduction and increased competition on world markets.  This, in turn, has caused the long-term weakening of real mineral prices.  Technology came to the rescue of mineral producers, allowing them to keep on operating profitably.  These trends are expected to continue, balanced to an extent by accelerated growth in the developing economies.<BR><P>
Current and planned investment projects in South Africa show a preponderance of mining and mineral-based undertakings.  Of these, primary mining projects amount to R15,5-billion and mineral processing projects to R22,3-billion.  Potential projects amount to another R4,9-billion and R12,2-billion, respectively.  Gold, coal and platinum mine expansions form the bulk of the primary developments, except for the Namakwa Sands and recently announced Nkomati nickel and Palabora underground copper projects.  Mineral processing projects include Columbus Stainless, Iscor Stainless, Alusaf, Hulett Aluminium, Saldanha Steel, various ferroalloy plants and the downstream processing of Sasol products.  Some exciting projects possibly on the horizon include zinc smelters, an aluminium smelter in Mocambique, offshore natural gas and oil deposits, the Gamsberg zinc deposit in the Northern Cape and various developments at Phalaborwa.<BR><P>
In the light of this and the imminent implementation of investment friendly and efficient minerals and mining policies and legislation, South  Africas mineral industry will continue to play a major role.  It will be vital in the earning of foreign exchange, the creation of employment and as a base for further industrial development.<BR><P>
This is true not only for South Africa, but for the whole of the subcontinent.  Many of the new projects announced for neighbouring and other African states also involve mineral-related developments, often with South African participation.  The synergies between us and our neighbours will lead to economic growth in the whole region.<BR><P>
Energy services are necessary to fulfil basic needs such as cooking, warmth and light, and as an input to productive economic sectors such as industry, mining, commerce, agriculture and transport.  South Africa has a modern, well-developed and intensive energy sector, employing about 250 000 people.  It is to a large extent coal-based and only 15% of energy in the form of crude oil is imported.  These imports represent nearly 10% of the value of total imports.<BR><P>
Many of our citizens still do not understand how the monthly adjustments in fuel prices are effected.  The petrol price goes up when its international price goes up - in other words when there is a greater demand for it than can be supplied.  It also goes up when our rand goes down against the dollar, because we pay for our crude oil in dollars.  So the extra money goes to those who sell the oil and the dollars to us, not to the government.<BR><P>
We can be thankful that we have a Sasol that produces about a third of our liquid fuels inside the country.  We can also be thankful that we have oil companies here who refine oil inside the country.  If this were not so, all the money we spend on liquid fuels would be sent overseas.<BR><P>
From some perspectives, the mid-1990s are a dark time for the world energy system.  Oil consumption is approaching the record levels of the late 1970s, with demand in some countries growing at rates as high as 10% per year.  Even the use of coal is still expanding in many nations, pushing emissions of carbon dioxide, the leading greenhouse gas, to more than 6-billion tons per year.  Emissions are growing particularly rapidly in China and India, but even the United States and Canada are failing to hold carbon dioxide emissions steady as they are supposed to under the Rio Climate Convention.<BR><P>
Although most energy analysts view such trends as convincing evidence that the world energy system wont change anytime soon, the reverse may be true.  Today, three major forces of change are bearing down on the world energy economy - new technologies, industry restructuring, and tougher environmental policies - all of which are likely to be intensified by the danger of climate change.<BR><P>
We are in for an interesting time as far as our national energy scene is concerned.  There is a new energy policy process which will probably result in a new Energy Act by next year, there is a restructuring of the electricity distribution sector and in a few years time there will probably be competing suppliers of electricity;  the liquid fuels sector is eagerly awaiting the report of the Lambrechts Committee on the sectors restructuring and we have to be ever-mindful of renewable energy sources.<BR><P>

</p>

<hr size="4" noshade width="90%">

<p><br>
</p>

<p>Mr Chairman, Madam Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>

<p>On behalf of the South African Council of the International
Chamber of Commerce, I would like to welcome the UNCTAD and
Africa Connect participants to our country. It is indeed an
honour for us to co-host such a prestigious event and I would urge
all of you to make the most of your visit to South Africa - in
terms of absorbing the spirit of change in the country and contributing
to our growth and prosperity by parting with large sums of money!</p>

<p>It is appropriate that this conference should be convened at
such a critical moment in South Africa&#146;s transition. We have undergone
one of history&#146;s most remarkable political transformations
that has become a global icon for democracy and conflict
resolution. The welcome political reforms have thrust South
Africa firmly into the next phase of democratic consolidation as
it begins to address the imperatives of sustainable growth and
development.</p>

<p>This phase will be characterised by South Africa&#146;s full
readmission to the international political economy and the
country&#146;s efforts to deal with the pace, depth and breadth
of change that is sweeping the globe, especially in the area of
international trade. South Africa&#146;s future will, to a great extent,
be determined by its success in re-integrating with the global
economy. However, we need to recognise that South Africa forms
part of a community, and as such, requires the assistance of a
wide range of global partners, including international
organisations and national governments. </p>

<p>Imperative for Africa, including South Africa, is the
confidence that international trade policy is being pursued in
terms of both growth and development objectives to ensure that
the trade conditions in the early part of the century are not
repeated. Indeed, it is our firm conviction that an equitable and sensible
world trade regime will contribute immeasurably to alleviating global
poverty and dissolving the artificial and harmful North-South
polarisation.</p>

<p>The liberalisation of trade and investment requires - apart
from significant tariff cuts and a reduction or elimination of quantitative
restrictions - a period of strong growth and low inflation which
should have a positive impact on external debt.</p>

<p>The WTO and UNCTAD have committed themselves to jointly
increasing technical assistance efforts. The overall objective of
this approach is collaboration between trade policy and trade promotion
experts to assist developing countries - and especially the least
advantaged amongst them - to integrate themselves effectively
into the multilateral trading system in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>The International Chamber of Commerce is committed to serving
world business by promoting trade and investment in an open
international political economy sustained by entrepreneurial
private enterprise, self regulation and the free movement of goods,
services, capital and labour. </p>

<p>The ICC was founded in 1919 and represents thousands of
companies and business associations in 139 countries. National Committees
throughout the world convey ICC views to their respective governments
and co-ordinate policy issues with ICC headquarters in Paris. The
ICC maintains close relations with international organisations,
intergovernmental and non-governmental bodies and has permanent
representatives to the UN in New York and Geneva to monitor
developments affecting business.</p>

<p>The South African Council was constituted in 1958 and
represents employer organisations as well as independent
companies. As we re-enter the global economy and grapple with the
demands of uncompromising international competition, the South African
Council will provide a vital facility for exchanging views and
addressing concerns. Most importantly, ICC-South Africa will
encourage South African business to remain sensitive to the
demands and trends of the global economy.</p>

<p>I would briefly like to touch on developments in the South
African economy and the most important issues facing Africa from a
business perspective.</p>

<p>South Africa is undertaking a comprehensive review of its
policies covering almost every aspect of commercial activity. The review
is, to a considerable extent, a consequence of the rigidities and inefficiencies
induced by Apartheid. In addition, South Africa has returned to a
markedly different global economy to the one it isolated itself
from so many years ago. As if this is insufficient, those responsible
for reforms need to mould them in a manner that gives constant
cognisance to the legacy of underdevelopment in South Africa.</p>

<p>Consequently, the task of reform is being driven by two
imperatives - the need to comply with the provisions of the Marrakech
Agreement and the need to achieve sustainable growth and development.
The world we have re-entered has reduced national policy options
amid greater demands for international compliance, especially in
terms of the global trade regime. Consequently, South Africa will
have to manage its reconstruction and development in a context of
diminished national sovereignty.</p>

<p>However, this is not a condition to be feared. Indeed, we
welcome the challenges thrust upon us. However, it is critical
that the correct decisions are taken to ensure that
reconstruction and development is meaningful and sustainable -
the margin for error in policy-making has been reduced dramatically
in the last two decades. Given this reality, we are cautiously
optimistic that the government is pursuing enlightened policy
reforms that will assist South Africa to develop into a truly world-class player,
for that should be our sole objective in the new world order.</p>

<p>South Africa&#146;s trade relations with the rest of Africa
have developed spectacularly although we should be concerned that
the direction of flows has been somewhat singular. While this is
a function of the market rather than South African hegemony, we are
acutely aware of the need to develop strong reciprocal trade
flows throughout Africa and we look forward to mutually beneficial continental
growth and development.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the current national and international
environments are not entirely conducive to that end. It is
imperative that African countries integrate themselves more
effectively into the global economy by pursuing policies that are
aligned with international trends. Similarly, Africa needs access to
new markets and improved access to existing markets. The
increasing use of informal protectionist trade measures must be
strongly condemned because of the multiple impacts on developing countries.
The world&#146;s future is a common one and the benefits that
arise from a unitary perspective will be delayed by parochial
national and regional interests.</p>

<p>It is worth reflecting for a moment on the major issues
confronting Africa which include:<br>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>poverty alleviation; </li>
    <li>commodity dependence; </li>
    <li>technology transfer; </li>
    <li>implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements, including
        mitigation of the adverse effects and benefiting from trading
        opportunities; </li>
    <li>dealing with future trade negotiations and new issues; </li>
    <li>attracting foreign direct investment and promoting
        enterprise development - FDI can be viewed as the primary
        motor of globalisation. Trade and investment are not
        merely complementary but also increasingly inseparable as
        two sides of the same coin in the process of
        globalisation; </li>
    <li>policy issues relating to debt and its management; </li>
    <li>capacity-building, including trade efficiency; </li>
    <li>economic co-operation among developing nations; and </li>
    <li>development of the service sector. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Marrakech Agreement launched wide-ranging trade reform and
will thus expose previously protected manufacturing and service
sectors to the rigours of competition.</p>

<p>UNCTAD IX provides an exceptional opportunity to pursue the
dialogue on development and international co-operation in the
spirit of genuine partnership between the relevant organisations, including
the WTO, UNCTAD, ECA and OAU to promote and facilitate the
integration of African countries in the new global economy.</p>

<p>This parallel event, &quot;Africa Connect&quot;, provides an
excellent opportunity to move the debate forward through
multilateral co-operation and first-hand participation by the
business community.</p>

<p>Global economic integration and the liberalisation of trade
affect opportunities for all countries. Technological advances,
the increased mobility of production factors, as well as the
enlargement of economic areas, following the successful
conclusion of the GATT Uruguay Round, set the basis to develop
prospects of unprecedented gains of wealth creation.</p>

<p>We trust that both the UNCTAD and Africa Connect proceedings
will be fruitful and ground-breaking. We wish you every success
in your endeavours and trust that South Africa will forever
retain a special place in your hearts.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,<p>

<A NAME="INTRO"></A>
<B>INTRODUCTION</B><br>

It is indeed a pleasure to have been invited to address such an important conference on a subject that is very pertinent to the South African mining industry and to South Africa today.  You are no doubt all aware of South Africas recent history and its transformation into a new democracy.<p>

The emergence of South Africa's new order has been miraculous for a number of reasons.  Most notable, is that it was accomplished in the space of four years, a relatively short time if one considers the widely differing political stances that had to be harmonised to reach consensus.<p>

The net result has been promising. The new political management appears to be on the right track and obstacles are slowly being overcome.  The mining industry believes that its own wide-ranging expertise, especially in the fields of housing, health care, education and training will be of great benefit to our Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), the chief objective of which is to meet basic human needs.<p>

Mr Chairman, in addressing the subject at hand, I shall present a potted overview of our experiences in financing new ventures on a large scale and some other financing methods pioneered outside of South Africa which could well become more important in the coming years.  Integrated into my summary will be some indication of the prospects for mining in the Southern part of the continent.<p>

But before I do so, let me say that for more than a century the mining industry has been the foundation of the South African economy - and will be so well into the next century.  Today, the industry, despite many serious challenges, remains robust, energetic, more innovative than ever and, despite its age and maturity, still possesses the capacity to be a reliable economic generator and wealth creator for the country and many of its neighbouring states, such as Lesotho, Mozambique and Swaziland.  Last year, for instance, the mining industry generated over 60% of South Africas foreign exchange earnings, through exports of primary and beneficiated mineral products.  We play an important role in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) and indeed, although South Africa is now classified as an emerging market, a much more accurate description would be a re-emerging market.<p>


<A NAME="NEW"></A>
<B>NEW MINING PROJECTS: PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS</B><br>

<A NAME="CENTRAL"></A>

<B>Central Questions</B><br>
Since the termination of the cold war, financing mining projects in the emerging markets has become intensely objective.  Historical bi-polar political constraints have largely been excised from investment decisions and tough market forces are now driving the new wave of mining projects.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the emerging markets, including Sub-Saharan Africa, where there have been astounding mineral code revisions in recent years in response to market pressures and the realisation that socialist policies have been a dismal failure.<p>

These revisions reflect a truism that I believe now governs mining investment, namely, the need for an adequate risk-return relationship in a market economy.  Quite simply, new mining investment is moving to those areas where the return is greater than the perceived risk.  The most successful emerging markets, in new mining investment terms, are those that have positively addressed their risk profiles.<p>

This mining investment truism might be more precisely defined by four critical questions:
<ol>
<li>Is the mineral rights policy conducive to entrepreneurial activity?
<li>Is there a secure transition from exploration to development?
<li>What is the projects comparative advantage that makes it especially attractive?
<li>Will the return on investment compensate for the risks?
</ol><p>

<A NAME="RISK"></A>
<B>Risk considerations</B><br>
The above questions will be answered by a consideration of risk.  Mining projects are perhaps unique in that they avoid trying to manage risk after the initiation of the project.  Instead, an attempt is made to reduce the apparent initial risks as far as possible.  This is rare in the sense that mining investors demand the best environment before a project can commence.  <p>

A countrys risk profile will equate to an evaluation of certain preconditions that dictate new investment decisions.  I believe we can broadly categorise mining investment risk into three distinct but interdependent aspects, namely:
<ul>
<li>socio-political risk;
<li>marketing risk; and
<li>financial risk.
</ul>

<I>Socio-political risk</I><br>
Socio-political risk is largely intangible but nevertheless central to any new project consideration.  In the past, certain countries in Southern Africa have exemplified volatile socio-political risks that have inhibited new mining investment and affected the competitiveness of the mining industry as a whole.<p>

A stable political and social order does not imply a preference for authoritarianism but rather, good governance.  Good governance will be reflected in a countrys ability to create wealth through economic growth, particularly where it attracts new foreign investment.  This will be more pronounced in the emerging markets where development backlogs must be overcome.  <p>

Indeed, the distributive prosperity of sustainable growth has become the key feature in the reduction of socio-political risk in any country.  The ability to achieve prosperity through growth depends largely on an holistic treatment of risk.<p>

<I>Marketing risk</I><br>
Marketing risk is predominantly a consideration of a countrys openness to international markets and willingness to engage in commercial exchanges.  <p>

Mining investors take cognisance of leverage abilities brought about by economies of scale.  To this end, marketing risk will examine a countrys degree of outward-oriented trade, focusing on the exchange rate and level of protection.<p>

Domestic access to international markets magnifies economies of scale and reduces input cost structures, a central consideration in any mining project.  Similarly, resource allocation and the cost of capital, labour and production is forced to respond to the stimulus of international competition in order to survive and become attractive to new investment.  There are also marked knowledge transfers in favour of developing countries.<p>

These competitive responses reduce the investors risk exposure by making product deliveries timeous and cost competitive.  A reduction in marketing risk is also likely to enhance downstream beneficiation prospects, allowing specific mining ventures to expand into value-added clusters at source.  The development and growth implications of reducing marketing risk to both emerging markets and mining investors cannot therefore be ignored.<p>

<I>Financial risk</I><br>
Financial risk is the most important determinant of the three risk areas because the other areas are dependent on its soundness and effectiveness.  Indeed, financial risk reflects the most stringent preconditions for investment generally but more especially for capital intensive mining projects.<p>

Financial risk measures macroeconomic stability from the point of view of its impact on capital costs and production efficiency.  Quoting an IMF model, "a stable macroeconomic environment is one where inflation is low and predictable, the exchange rate is near its equilibrium level, the government budget is well managed, the deficit relative to GDP is at a reasonable level and consistent with a non-increasing ratio of public debt to GDP, and the use of central bank credit to finance the deficit is kept at a minimal level" .<p>

These are not arbitrary performance measures but are significant risk indicators that impact on an investors long-term planning capacity which is imperative for capital intensive mining ventures.  As South Africa takes its place in the international community again, the Reserve Bank, in response to macro-imperatives, has shifted its emphasis from dampening cyclical upswings to maintaining domestic price stability.  This has considerably reduced planning risks in the consideration of new mining projects.<p>

Increasingly, emerging markets are conforming to the international macroeconomic standards quoted above and this is stimulating global mining investment, not least in Africa.  South African mining finance houses have expanded exploration activity in Africa substantially because of macroeconomic stability rather than just an end to sanctions.  For example, just last week one of our gold mining groups announced exploration projects underway in Burkina Faso, Mali, the Ivory Coast, Ghana and Senegal , consolidating the rapid internationalisation of our mining operations.<p>

This reiterates my observation that mining investment has shed any reliance on non-market incentives and that new projects reflect rigorous analysis and approval of a countrys risk profile.  A staggering number of emerging market countries have revised their mineral codes in the last 5 years and the benefits of doing so are abundant.  South Africa is also in the process of revisiting its minerals policy, hopefully to ensure an attractive environment to encourage new mining investment, somewhat belatedly I might add in view of the progress made by our African neighbours.<p>


<A NAME="FINANCING"></A>

<B> FINANCING MECHANISMS</B><br>

Clearly, there is no single best method of financing mining projects.  Experience shows that ventures are financed according to a broad range of factors and very often there is an amalgam of methods to produce the desired result which is to bring an orebody to profitable account.<p>


<A NAME="HOUSES"></A>

<B>Mining Finance Houses</B><br>

Financing mining projects in emerging markets is of course a problem that pertained to the South African mining industry almost from inception in 1852 when the first systematic attempts were made to recover copper in the Namaqualand region of the old Cape Colony.  The discovery of large scale deposits of alluvial diamonds along the Vaal, Harts and Orange Rivers some 15 years later added further impetus to the establishment of a stock exchange and the first rudimentary mining houses.  The mining houses developed out of sheer necessity, especially during the late 1880s and the early 1890s.  They remain in many ways peculiar to South Africa, although similar transnational institutions have and are emerging in other countries.

<p>
The mining finance houses emerged to bridge the immense problems associated with deep-level mining.  Mines and companies formed partnerships to overcome poor communications and rudimentary physical infrastructure, consolidate financial resources and make the ventures attractive to cautious foreign investors.<p>

These early partnerships and companies were the precursors of the Group System or "mining houses" as they are known today.  They continue to provide capital and expertise for the development of new mines and for the expansion, development and management of their member mines.<p>

The mining finance house flourished in South Africa largely because of our system of mineral rights.  Unlike most other countries, South African mines operate within fixed lease areas and do not enjoy blue-sky potential.  This means that each mine has finite reserves and usually cannot undertake new projects of its own accord.  Thus the mining houses play a crucial role in establishing new mining opportunities.<p>

In time, the role of the mining house has increased in importance.  Because mining is a high-risk, capital-intensive industry, mining houses have found two dependable sources of finance to open new mines - foreign capital and the re-investment of retained profits.  Local banking was, and still is, incapable alone of sustaining the industrys financial needs to any degree, the risks attached to deep level mining being too extensive.  As a consequence, large-scale mining ventures in South Africa have been equity reliant rather than debt based.<p>

The mining houses operate by absorbing all risk associated with a project in the initial stages of exploration, feasibility studies and shaft sinking.  This has the effect of minimising the risks for both individual and institutional investors.  It also serves to re-assure investors that the venture has the backing of a reputable organisation.  To this end, the houses function as their own bankers, making prospective public fund raising very attractive indeed.<p>

Once a project nears production, public funds are raised progressively to provide the additional capital required for the project.  Funds raised are usually in the form of equity finance, either directly by way of shareholders capital or by way of shareholders loans.  This is usually accompanied by a subsequent rights issue to enable completion of the project.  During the mines lifetime, the mining house reduces its share in the mining company in order to realise its original risk capital and secure profits for new ventures.<p>

Though the primary motivating force for establishing mining houses was to muster financial resources, a secondary but equally important consideration was to provide scarce managerial and technical skills.  Small mining companies simply could not afford to employ highly qualified mining engineers and other experts with specialist skills to manage the risks involved over the long lead times to production and as the gold mines became deeper and deeper, with all the inherent problems resulting from such circumstances.  <p>

Instead mining houses started using a streamlined system whereby various managerial and technical services were provided to member mines by a limited number of consultants employed by a mining house.  Even today the link between the mining company and the mining house is by way of the number of shares the latter owns and a contract to provide managerial, buying, taxation, secretarial, technical and other services; services an individual mine may well not be able to afford or would not wish to fund where such visible economies of scale are available through the mining house.<p>

The system has proved highly cost effective and efficient, as some other mining countries have found.  Many more of our marginal mines would have closed down long ago - or much sooner than they did - had it not been for the backing and expert guidance they received from a mining house.  The management contract system principally enables mining houses to buffer individual mines against unexpected external shocks which might otherwise destroy them.  The implications for a country with a vast reservoir of unskilled labour, such as South Africa, are fairly obvious.<p>

It was inevitable that mining houses, as they grew, would contribute to the creation of South Africas infrastructure on a massive scale.  Besides spawning major cities and towns in remote and often desolate parts of the country, South Africas railway system, power supplies, explosive and timber industries and its burgeoning coal mining industry can all find their roots in the demands and requirements of the gold mining industry, as can the sophisticated legal and financial institutions.  <p>

It was, I suppose, inevitable that surplus resources would be re-invested by mining houses in secondary and tertiary industries and, indeed, in major industrial undertakings.  Even in the field of health and medical care the industry has done more than its share, administering scores of hospitals, as well as innumerable clinics, first-aid posts and rescue stations strategically located on gold, coal and other mineral mines.  The Rand Mutual Hospital, an associated company of the Chamber of Mines, is counted among the best trauma hospitals in the world.  Mining houses are therefore unique South African institutions which can bridge the gap between the mature and established part of our economy, and that part of our economy which remains underdeveloped.<p>

Essentially, mining houses are no different from large companies that have characteristics related to the particular field in which they operate.  Their characteristics include:
<ol>
<li> The availability of large financial resources,
<li> A preference for large projects when making new investments,
<li>The control of investments on a centralised basis from their head offices, and
<li>The vertical integration of the operations when new investments are made, as is the interaction between the operations.
</ol>

<A NAME="SMALL"></A>

<B>Small Mines</B><br>
Equity based financing is not confined to large projects although the complexity of South African mining conditions generally mitigates against viable small mines. Historically, as Dr Willo Steer, a South African geological consultant, has pointed out, junior mining companies, by virtue of their entrepreneurial character, have an impressive international record of finding and initiating new mines. Major mining corporations, with their substantial financial and technical resources, have often been an important source of development capital for these small ventures - but usually at the expense of a large equity dilution and the loss of control by the discoverer.<p>

In South Africa, small mining companies and entrepreneurs have not enjoyed the same confidence among investors as do the large groups.  Financial institutions have been reluctant to fund smaller companies, mainly because they do not have the mechanisms to monitor such ventures.  The relatively small investments involved often also do not yield a growth rate which is attractive to interest-performance driven portfolio managers.<p>

An example of a small, independent mining venture making use of equity financing is the Amalia Gold Mine to be listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in June 1995.  Amalia is situated in South Africas Northwest Province and is exploiting a shallow orebody.  This has allowed a very favourable ratio between projected working costs and profit, making the mine a viable and attractive investment.  To illustrate the scale of operation in comparison to a typical mining house project, which requires almost £170 million  to initial production and £1 billion over a normal lifetime, Amalia will be developed from an equity issue of just £2,1 million.<p>

Such small ventures up to the present have, however, been the exception.  The available orebodies for such projects currently appear to be relatively limited in South Africa although there are inevitably exciting opportunities for entrepreneurs.  The mining houses are reassessing their mineral rights holdings in an endeavour to create viable small mine opportunities where feasible.  The state of course holds extensive mineral rights and will need to do the same.  <p>

Also, the cost of a listing is disproportionately high for small share issues and the domestic market may not have sufficient liquidity or risk capacity to support numerous small-scale ventures.  One must also take into account the exposure of small mines to external shocks from which they may not be able to rescue themselves.  The ability of small mines to generate substantial capital for exploration and development, especially simultaneous regional or international exploration, is also limited and negates self-regeneration.<p>

Another negative consequence of small-scale mining is that entrepreneurial operations may only function to extract the best ore grades, resulting in considerable waste and an unnecessary reduction in a mines ore reserves.  Mining finance houses are able to overcome this pecking out the eyes syndrome through large-scale projects that enjoy some pay-limit flexibility.<p>

<A NAME="GROUP"></A>

<B>The Group System</B><br>

In South Africa, more than 100 mines are closely linked financially and administratively to one or other of the major mining houses.  They are further linked through membership of the Chamber of Mines, a private enterprise voluntary employers organisation and the industrys central co-ordinating body.  The Chamber provides a valuable and convenient vehicle for its members to act in concert when and where they deem it both prudent and desirable.  The Chamber provides services to the mines and the mining houses but is not involved in prospecting, financing or managing mines in any way.  <p>

It formulates industry policy on matters of general concern assigned to it by its members and it serves as the advocate of that policy to the general public and at the interface with government and organised labour.  The Chamber is playing an important role in the new South Africa trying to secure for the mining industry a supportive political, economic and social environment so that it can operate efficiently and effectively.<p>

From what I have said it is clear that South Africas mining houses are well placed to assist in developing mineral resources in South Africa itself, in neighbouring states and, indeed, in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa.  They have the technical and financial expertise, know-how and experience to operate under Africas unique conditions.  They also have the financial muscle, although much of the capital needs for these developments will need to be drawn from the countries themselves, the International Finance Corporation and other international capital markets and sources.<p>

Countries in which South African mining houses are already involved include Zambia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Angola, Tanzania, Congo, Zaire, Kenya and in West Africa, in particular Ghana and the Ivory Coast.  Much of the basic exploration has already been done, or is being done, with South African-based companies well to the fore and international investors are bound to take this into account when expanding their investment portfolios into Africa.<p>

<A NAME="GOLD"></A>

<B>Gold loans and hedging</B><br>

Australian banks pioneered the shift away from equity based finance to gold loan finance in the 1980s.  This was as a result of the then high cost of capital.  Typically, real interest rates in this period exceeded 10 per cent whereas gold could be borrowed at below 5 per cent.  Gold loan financing was dramatically encouraged by the collapse of the stock markets in 1987 and the inability thereafter for some time to raise large sums of equity finance.  This came at a time, too, when Central Banks were seeking opportunities to obtain some income from their extensive gold reserves.<p>

Gold loan financing is categorised by two typical processes: physical gold loaned is sold at spot prices to finance immediate exploration and development costs while future production is sold forward to underwrite the cost of the loan and the interest attracted.  Im sure that the analogy to a share and rights issue will not escape you.  Gold loans reached their apogee in 1988 when former RTZ analyst Jessica Jacks estimated that almost 4.8 million ounces of gold were loaned .  To date, it is estimated that 260 contracts involving 12.9 million ounces have been brokered.  <p>

The advent of gold loans provided a window of opportunity for the banks involved and many of them became de facto mining finance houses providing almost identical services to such companies.  This was extremely beneficial to entrepreneurial mining ventures who were able to access tailored, off-the-shelf packages.  In some cases, Australian open pit gold mines were in production within six months.  A massive boom in gold loan financed mining ensued in Australia and the United States although this was tempered by the availability of cheaper capital in the early 1990s and a decline in interest rates.<p>

The most interesting derivative, if you will forgive the pun, of gold loan financing was the formalised use of hedging which the bullion banks insisted on to reduce their risk exposure.  The effect of hedging forward sales from gold loans was initially to depress prices in the physical gold market as companies sought to counter their exposure to possible lower prices over the long term.  Hedging, in its many forms, has helped certain companies to realise higher returns than the prevailing average prices.<p>

Today, there are few world-class mining companies without a hedging programme in their treasuries.  Although critics regard the paper gold market to be partially responsible for the sideways movement in the gold price in recent years, hedging has provided the means for certain ore bodies to be brought to profitable account and to sustain marginal mines through low-price and high-cost cycles.<p>

<A NAME="JOINT"></A>

<B>Joint Ventures</B><br>

Newly revised mining codes have paved the way for state-owned mines to be privatised.  This is taking place all across Africa and Latin America with considerable success.  Usually, projects are existing mines that were nationalised after independence or initiated by the state under the tutelage of foreign advisors.  Invariably the ventures became unproductive and were sustained through subsidisation in the form of grants or aid.<p>

Privatisation typically involves the sale of a state-owned project, or portion thereof, to a private interest.  Financing is then raised using a combination of methods.  An interesting approach has been a combination of debt and equity financing which is used to rejuvenate the mine and return it to profitability.  In terms of debt financing, a low-interest loan was secured from the International Finance Corporation and the State was also persuaded to put up some of the required funds.  Equity financing was achieved by an international share offer to investors.  The net result has been unusual co-operation between private sector interests, the State and international organisations such as the IFC.<p>


<A NAME="OPPORT"></A>

<B>MINING OPPORTUNITIES IN SOUTH AFRICA</B><br>

South Africas mineral reserves, other than gold, are enormous.  To name but a few:
<ul>
<li>Almost 59 000 metric tons or 88% of the worlds platinum group metals,
<li>Almost four billion tons or 83% of manganese deposits,
<li>Over three billion tons or 72% of chrome ore,
<li> Over 12 million tons or 44 % of vanadium,
<li> Still 44% of the worlds recoverable gold,
<li> Almost 51 million tons or 37% of alumino-silicates,
<li>Some 80 million tons or 40% of vermiculite, and
<li>Over 15 million tons or 26% of zirconium minerals.
</ul>

And these figures do not include our recoverable coal deposits of 55 billion tons - enough to meet our domestic needs for 300 years!  Or our five million tons of lead, almost six billion tons of iron ore and 13 million tons of copper.<p>

Coming back to gold, according to geological estimates there is an equivalent amount of gold left in South African soil as has been mined to date - about 44 000 tons.  Subject to the market price, the most conservative projections suggest that at least 18 000 tons of refined gold can still be viably recovered at present, unless, of course, new and more cost effective systems are developed.  A number of new gold mines - estimates of up to 15 have been mentioned - in excess of 4 000 metres deep with estimated 30 year life spans, have been identified for development if circumstances are advantageous.<p>

<A NAME="CAPITAL"></A>

<B>CAPITAL EXPENDITURE</B><br>


Business confidence has, not unexpectedly, soared since South Africas return to the "real" world.  Investor confidence is reflected in the recovery of Gross Domestic Fixed Investment, dominated by investment in new capacity for exports, and in the strength of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.  A secondary tax on companies, intended to encourage re-investment of corporate profits, has also promoted the fixed investment cycle.<p>

Projects valued at some R95 billion (£16,4 billion) have been identified for expenditure by the end of 1996.  No doubt there are many more. Some 22 per cent or R20 billion (£3,4 billion) - R11,8 billion (£2,0 billion) already announced and another R8,6 billion (£1,5 billion) on possible projects - has been earmarked for mining projects.  Of this, R12 billion (£2,1 billion) has been directed at gold mines, R2,3 billion (£396 million) at platinum mines and R6,2 billion (£1,1 billion) at "other" mining ventures, such as coal, mineral sands and vanadium, among others.<p>

The gold mining industry has projects already underway totalling some R7,6 billion (£1,3 billion).  With one exception, these projects involve expansion programmes on existing mines, although in the case of Vaal Reefs gold mines Moab expansion, an entirely new mining lease area is being developed.  Gencors Oryx gold mine, which started in 1988, is the only "new" gold mine and has already absorbed some R1,3 billion (£224 million) in capital expenditure.<p>

Most of the R2,3 billion (£396 million) earmarked for platinum mining is regarded as replacement spending.  The announcement recently of a new platinum-based catalyst for controlling vehicle exhaust emissions will no doubt be a tremendous boost for the industry.  The effect has already been felt on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.<p>

Of the R2,2 billion (£379 million) to be spent on "other" mining, R560 million (£96,5 million) has been earmarked for expansion of Khutala Colliery, a major domestic utility supplier and exporter, R110 million (£18,9 million) in a phlogopite plant, a form of mica rich in magnesium, and R1,4 billion (£241 million) for the development of the Namakwa Sands project mining zircon, ilmenite and rutile.<p>

<A NAME="STATE"></A>

<B>STATE OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN MINING INDUSTRY
</B><br>
Public policy is currently a central issue which is being vigorously addressed by the Chamber of Mines.  The Chambers main purpose is to engage influential organisations and individuals, particularly from the executive and legislative arms of government, in debate to emphasise the mining industrys role in the national economy and its capacity to create wealth.  In our view, the industry should be as free and unfettered as possible to deliver the assets that will help enrich the whole country and all its people.<p>

We are sure of a reasonable degree of success, especially as the advantages of a free market become more apparent - and appreciated. In fact, we are extremely encouraged by the way the Government of National Unity is using modern business methods to carry out its Reconstruction and Development Programme.  In the end, economic prosperity, unlike economic ruin, cannot be achieved through legislation; social progress, unlike social decline, cannot be created by regulation.<p>

The mining industrys requirements are simple: a sound, market-based economic system, a stable political environment, meaningful efforts to combat crime and lawlessness, a steady and predictable system of taxation which reflects the fact that we turn to account non-renewable assets, incentives to advance technology and a sufficient portion of distributable profits to be returned to shareholders.  We think these are eminently reasonable requirements.<p>

There are now sufficient signs that we are well on our way to achieving these needs.  As far as the central government process is concerned, there have been important improvements, especially in regard to the transparency of, the accountability by, and the accessibility to, those who govern.  Parliamentary Portfolio Committees now sit in public and have commenced their efforts with wide interpretations of their briefs and have created a dynamic policy-making environment in which there are seemingly no holy cows.<p>

The new political management is, in my view, on the right track and the obstacles are being overcome.  We are able to engage policy-makers meaningfully and we are delighted at the degree to which stakeholders, such as business, labour and others, are encouraged to participate in shaping policy.  Participative management has become the central theme of our Government of National Unity.<p>


<A NAME="CONCLUSION"></A>

<B>CONCLUSION</B><br>

Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I trust that I have sufficiently whetted your appetites for the detailed perspectives to be given by my fellow speakers whom I have no doubt will provide not only critical but fascinating insights into their specialist fields.<p>

I also hope that I have conveyed to you my sense of optimism about South Africa generally and our mining industry particularly.  South Africans have demonstrated a remarkable resilience and determination to resolve problems throughout our current and past history.  No other country has achieved what we have and I believe that we will remain a unique global icon for democratic transformation.<p>

This same resilience and persistence is apparent in our mining industry.  Although we face significant challenges in the years ahead, none are insurmountable or unresolvable.  We believe that mining is the flywheel of South Africas Reconstruction and Development Programme and we are committed to eradicating the distortions and inefficiencies that plagued us in the past.  Indeed, South Africa has responded vigorously to its new international status and we are in the process of a comprehensive review of our competitive standing in the world.  Potential investors can be assured that South Africa is fast becoming a choice location with an ever improving risk profile.<p>

Thank you.<p>

<A NAME="over"></A>
BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE SA COAL MINING SITUATION<BR>
Henry Ford, as we know, was famous for introducing the motor vehicle production-line from which initially rolled many thousands of the now legendary Model-T automobile.  He was also famous for rolling off his tongue certain sayings, with perhaps the most famous of them being: "History is more or less bunk!"<BR><P>

History, whether "bunk" or not, is not always pleasant.  There are notable exceptions however, such as the complete turn-around of an industry like ours in the short space of 18 months.  It is particularly pleasant  when one is able to stand in front of a group of delegates such as yourselves and report that the positive historical trend has continued, and moreover, continues to exceed predictions.<BR><P>

Despite fierce competition on the international market, South African coal exports grew to a record level of some 60 million tons in 1995.  Contract and spot prices levelled after the initial strong 63 per cent growth in spot prices.  Our exports last year realised over 6 billion Rand in foreign exchange.  Coal, after gold and the platinum group metals, remains South Africas largest export.  South Africa was the second largest exporter of seaborne steam coal in 1995 after Australia with us continuing to supply our traditional markets in Europe and the Far East.  Of concern however is that though for 1995 our contract prices were negotiated up by 23 per cent on 1994 levels in US dollar terms, in real Rand terms the contract price for 1995 remained lower than 1992 levels.   (These contract price figures are historically based on the benchmark contract prices paid by ENEL, the giant Italian power utility.)  Spot prices in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp market were the highest they have ever been since 1990.<BR><P>

<A NAME="prod"></A>
PRODUCTIVITY<BR>
On the other hand, in 1995 the industry was hard-pressed to improve productivity and I believe that there still remains considerable potential for productivity improvements in our industry when you consider that productivity, based on tons mined per employee per annum.  Other countries, like Australia and the USA are leading the way.<BR><P>

<A NAME="gaz"></A>
SOME CRYSTAL BALL GAZING<BR>
Mr Ford did however not let his indictment of history stand on its own ... he expanded somewhat on his theme.  The full text of what he said reads as follows: History is more or less bunk.  Its tradition.  We dont want tradition.  We want to live in the present and the only history that is worth a tinkers damn is the history we make today.  I agree with Henry Ford ... we dont want tradition, we want change - but not change for the sake of change but to improve!  I would go so far as to say that what matters even more than the history we make today is where we are going in the future.  And we are to a degree fortunate in having a pretty good idea of what lies ahead of us, at least in the short- term and I would like to expand on this right now.  I will however not deal with prices and markets as you have your ideas about the future.<BR><P>

The government  views coal mining as being very important to South Africa and this was emphasised in no uncertain terms by government in the last four weeks when, as President of the Chamber of Mines, I met with senior parliamentary personalities, particularly the Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs, Minister 'Pik' Botha, and vice-president Thabo Mbeki.  We laid our cards on the table and they were equally frank with us and in discussion certain issues were identified as being critical to mining in the years to come.<BR><P>

Prime amongst these was the issue of a revised minerals policy.  Though it would be dangerous to predict its outcome, what we do know is that there is certainly lots of sympathy at present for the small mining concept.  Of particular significance was governments desire to attract black investors to this sector and also its aim of encouraging greater black investment into the existing sector.<BR><P>

What we however fight against is not the concept of small mines but the idea expressed in some circles to ease environment and safety regulations for the small miner.  The security of mineral rights and prevention of the implementation of a minerals right tax were also high on our list.<BR><P>

Increased exports are seen as being critical and government is fully aware that our existing export facilities are already under pressure.  These facilities will have to expand and there is a distinct possibility that this will take place with the probable assistance of overseas investment.  Here again Minister Pik Botha indicated to us on Monday that he is busy with discussions on this issue.<BR><P>

Significant decreases in job opportunities and foreign income capacity will also lead to the interference of government in our business in future.<BR><P>

<A NAME="trust"></A>
TRIPARTISM AND TRUST<BR>
Of greater significance to you all at todays conference however is governments increasing emphasis on health and safety issues in the mining industry.  It was made abundantly clear to me during my visit to parliament, that if we want to get it right we have to include all role players, which in mining terms means, government, management and labour.  Or in other words, tripartism.  Some Ministers are even making noises that they are not willing to see employers alone (for example, through the Chamber of Mines), but only to agree to meetings where employers and employees are together.<BR><P>

For tripartism to work properly though, it has to rest firmly on four pillars, namely trust, participation, reason and compromise.  If one of these pillars is shaky, tripartism itself will wobble and eventually fail. This brings me back to what I said when I opened the Mine Safety and Health Congress at the end of November last year.  I stated then that it was of the utmost importance that parties do not adopt fixed and immovable positions.  The tripartism pillar of compromise should not be threatened.  However I am glad to say that there have been positive moves already in this direction as we have heard today.  By the same token, parties that publicly and destructively attack each other during tri-partheid discussions will break down trust.  Trust is, I contend, perhaps the most important of the tripartism pillars.  I heard Anthony Gill of the Mine Safety Division saying something similar earlier.<BR><P>

I make specific reference to a rather contentious clause in the Mines Health and Safety Bill.  This clause we argue conflicts not only with the recommendations of the Leon Commission but also with the basis of our legal system, and may even be deemed unconstitutional. Essentially, it deals with the reversal of onus - or being assumed guilty until proved innocent.  When this issue was first raised it was made very clear to me that if something went wrong on a mine the responsible people would have to face the consequences, and added to this was the rider that "if the unions dont get you, government will."  What worth tripartism if this is the level of trust?<BR><P>

REASONABLY PRACTICAL MEASURES<BR>
Let me hasten to add that mine management has however not been altogether unfairly treated in this regard.  It falls squarely on your shoulders to make sure that you have taken all reasonably practical measures - and the Bill refers specifically to measures having to be adjudged reasonably practical - to protect the health and safety of your employees.  Negligence, if it is proved that you did not take reasonably practical steps to prevent a negative occurrence, will - as it should - be dealt with severely.<BR><P>

<A NAME="other"></A>
OTHER ISSUES<BR>
There are of course other issues facing the industry, such as the new Labour Standards Act which replaces the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, and the introduction of full-time safety stewards.  The mining industry will have to deal with these and many more issues in the near future.  The introduction of these proposed changes if contained in the new Acts will definitely lead to an increase in costs.<BR><P>

<A NAME="red"></A>
REDUCTION OF CASUALTY RATES<BR>
As already said, mining remains the mainstay of South Africas economy and therefore whatever we do - or dont do for that matter - will come under the spotlight.  We cannot afford to be anything but squeaky clean in whatever we do. The fact remains that our casualty rates, rather than the measures being taken to bring them to zero, receive prominence.  The media takes pleasure in publicising our less than flattering safety record, and the only way we can prevent being caned like this is by dramatically improving our safety record.<BR><P> 

However, you have already begun taking the right steps, adopting the right attitude and what you have learned today I am sure will result in further improvement.  You have set as your goal "Zero Fatalities".  After all, if you hope to achieve something worthwhile there is no point in taking a half-hearted stab at getting there ..... you have to go all out, to go for broke, in that way making your chances of getting there so much better!  Or, as your newly adopted slogan puts it so neatly, "Go for Goal."<BR><P>

Attaining that magical, but so elusive, zero fatality rate - is a goal certainly worth getting.  I am confident that just as on the football field your chances of scoring are increased the more often you shoot at the posts, or you Go for Goal, the more often you shoot for a zero fatality target, the better your chances are of hitting it.  If last year 31 coal mines managed to achieve zero fatalities, I see no reason why the rest of the 44 collieries that participate in the Chamber of Mines safety competitions cannot follow their example.<BR><P>

<p><a name="PREAMBLE"><b><u>PREAMBLE</u></b></a><b><u><br>
</u></b>WHEREAS the NUM sent to the Chamber a letter dated 2 May 1996 containing the NUM's proposals for the 1996 review 
of wages and other conditions of employment for members of the NUM employed in recognition units for which the NUM is 
recognised by gold mines and collieries that are members of the Chamber (&quot;the 1996 review&quot;); and<br>
</p>
<p>WHEREAS meetings have subsequently taken place between representatives of the NUM and the Chamber and the parties 
have reached agreement on the 1996 review<br>
</p>
<p><b>THE PARTIES THEREFORE AGREE AS FOLLOWS:<br>
</b></p>
<p>1. <a name="APPLICATION"><b><u>APPLICATION</u></b></a><b><u> OF AGREEMENT<br>
</u></b>1.1 Subject to 1.2, this Agreement shall apply to all members of the NUM employed in recognition units for which the NUM 
is recognised by gold mines and collieries that are members of the Chamber. <br>
</p>
<p>1.2 Annexure B4 hereto shall apply to Durban Roodepoort Deep Limited. <br>
</p>
<p>2. <b><u>RESTRUCTURING THE MINEWORKERS PROVIDENT FUND (</u></b><a name="MPF"><b><u>MPF</u></b></a><b><u>) AND THE MINEWORKERS 
ASSURANCE AND BENEFITS SCHEME (MABS)<br>
</u></b></p>
<p>2.1 <b><u>Preamble<br>
</u></b>The parties acknowledge and recognise that there are historical disparities in the provision of retirement, death and funeral 
benefits within the mining industry. Retirement funds for the majority of white miners have long been established with 
membership of such funds restricted in terms of the job reservation policies of the day. The closed shop enjoyed by the former 
whites-only unions also resulted in exclusions. Racial inequalities have been and are being addressed. These inequalities cannot 
be addressed without the implementation of practical steps to correct the past by changing the future.<br>
</p>
<p>2.2 <b><u>Equity<br>
</u></b>The parties recognise and acknowledge the need to restructure all existing industry retirement funds (Mine Officials Pension 
Fund, Mine Employees Pension Fund, Mineworkers Provident Fund). In the context of the restructuring of the MPF and 
MABS, the parties agree to the following principles of equity which should be worked towards: <br>
</p>
<p>2.2.1 Contribution levels for the various restructured defined contribution funds within the mining industry should be on parity. <br>
</p>
<p>2.2.2 Equity should prevail with regard to the basis of calculation of contributions to the restructured retirement funds in the 
industry. <br>
</p>
<p>2.2.3 The restructured MPF/MABS fund should be opened to all permanent workers of participating employers of the Fund.<br>
</p>
<p>2.2.4 Membership of the Chamber should not be a pre-condition of the restructured MPF/MABS fund. The trustees of the 
Fund will consider each application on a case by case basis in order to protect their fiduciary responsibilities.<br>
</p>
<p>The parties further agree that they will endeavour to achieve 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 above by July 1997.<br>
</p>
<p>2.3 <b><u>Restructuring of MPF/MABS</u></b></p>
<p>The MPF and MABS require urgent restructuring and consequently the parties agree as follows:<br>
</p>
<p>2.3.1 MPF and MABS will be merged by 1 July 1997, with the longer term objective of minimising the cost of death and 
funeral benefits, and enhancing retirement benefits. Hence the contribution allocation for retirement benefits will be a minimum 
of 75% of each of the total employer and total employee contributions respectively. <br>
</p>
<p>2.3.2 The merged Fund will be a defined contribution fund for retirement, death and funeral benefits. The trustees of the Fund 
will restructure the benefits accordingly.<br>
</p>
<p>2.3.3 The combined contribution level to the merged fund should be 20% calculated on the current basis applicable to MPF 
at the date of this agreement. This will not apply in cases where an agreement on higher contribution levels is in existence at the 
date of this agreement or where additional voluntary contributions are made by employees.<br>
</p>
<p>2.3.4 The parties accept that in the interim, the increase of 0,610% in contributions to MABS on 1 August 1996 will be paid 
for as set out in Annexure A.<br>
</p>
<p>2.3.5 The contribution levels for 1996 and 1997 are set out in the schedule attached as Annexure A.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b>3. </b><b><u>FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT ON INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RELATED EDUCATION AND 
</u></b><a name="TRAINING"><b><u>TRAINING</u></b></a><b><u><br>
</u></b>3.1 The parties agree in principle to the joint development at Group or mine level, or in the case of Gold Fields, mines at a 
Group co-ordinated level, of industrial relations training relating to the new Labour Relations Act, health and safety legislation, 
workplace efficiency and mine level industrial relations procedures. The target population for such education and training 
should be formally elected union representatives. Such education and training should be jointly reviewed.<br>
</p>
<p>3.2 The parties agree that the development, presentation and running costs of the jointly agreed Education and Training 
Programmes will be financed by individual employers. It is the intention of Anglo American (Gold Division) to utilise the 1987 
Strike Settlement Fund for this purpose.<br>
</p>
<p>3.3 The modules of the education and training should as far as possible be accredited.<br>
</p>
<p>3.4 All information relevant to the discussions between the parties on the development and presentation of courses will be 
disclosed between the parties.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>4. <a name="PATERNITY"><b><u>PATERNITY</u></b></a><b><u> LEAVE<br>
</u></b>In regard to paternity leave, the parties agree that the number of days of unpaid leave to which employees are entitled shall be 
increased from three days per annum to seven days per annum. All other conditions relating to paternity leave as agreed upon 
in the 1994 Wage Review shall remain unchanged. </p>
<p>5. <b><u>PAID LEAVE FOR REPRESENTATIVES ON </u></b><a name="TRIPARTITE"><b><u>TRIPARTITE</u></b></a><b><u> FORUMS<br>
</u></b>5.1 The parties agree in principle that duly appointed principal representatives on the tripartite bodies enumerated in clause 
5.2 should be granted paid leave for the purpose of attendance at meetings of those bodies, provided that:<br>
</p>
<p>5.1.1 the NUM undertakes that its representation on the bodies referred to will be such that no undue burden for the 
provision of leave to representatives will be placed on any one mine;<br>
</p>
<p>5.1.2 application for leave shall be made to management in respect of each specific meeting to be attended and approval shall 
be granted subject to operational requirements; and<br>
</p>
<p>5.1.3 the implementation of this agreement shall be subject to existing arrangements at the applicable level.<br>
</p>
<p>5.2 The bodies referred to in paragraph 5.1 are the following: <br>
</p>
<p>5.2.1 Mine Health and Safety Council.<br>
</p>
<p>5.2.2 Mining Regulation Advisory Committee (MRAC).<br>
</p>
<p>5.2.3 Safety in Mines Research Advisory Committee (SIMRAC).<br>
</p>
<p>5.2.4 Mining Occupational Health and Safety Committee (MOHAC). <br>
</p>
<p>5.2.5 Mining Qualifications Authority (MQA).<br>
</p>
<p>5.2.6 Minerals Policy Steering Committee.<br>
</p>
<p>5.2.7 Mining Industry Engineering Trades Training Board (MIETTB). <br>
</p>
<p>6. <a name="SICK"><b><u>SICK</u></b></a><b><u> LEAVE<br>
</u></b>The parties confirm the agreement relating to sick leave concluded by them in 1995. The NUM undertakes to inform its 
members of the importance of not abusing sick leave entitlements. The parties agree that management may require assistance 
from the NUM's mine level structures to address possible abuse of sick leave entitlements, in which case the NUM's 
structures will take all reasonable steps to rectify the problem in line with employees' obligations in this regard.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>7. <b><u>COMPENSATION FOR PRE-</u></b><a name="1977"><b><u>1977</u></b></a><b><u> INCAPACITATED WORKERS<br>
</u></b>The parties agree to address in writing a joint request to the Board of Directors of the Rand Mutual Assurance Company 
Limited that it give favourable consideration to the provision of further benefits to ex-employees of member mines who before 
1977 were permanently incapacitated with less than 100% incapacity, provided that relevant surpluses be utilised for this 
purpose.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>8. <a name="LUMP"><b><u>LUMP</u></b></a><b><u> SUM BENEFIT APPLICABLE TO EMPLOYEES WITH STATUTORY OCCUPATIONAL 
DISEASES AND INJURIES SUSTAINED ON DUTY</u></b><u> <br>
</u></p>
<p>8.1 <b><u>All Groups except JCI Ltd Gold mines and mines currently associated with Randgold<br>
</u></b>All employees whose services are terminated due to occupational injuries and diseases in accordance with the terms of the 
1992 Agreement on the Principles and Values Applicable to Employees with Statutory Occupational Diseases and Injuries 
Sustained on Duty, shall receive a lump sum benefit calculated at 5% of the medically incapacitated employee's basic pay 
earned during the period of Group service prior to 1 July 1989.<br>
</p>
<p>This lump sum is separate from and in addition to the Chamber of Mines Long Service Award Scheme.<br>
</p>
<p>8.2 <b><u>JCI Ltd Gold mines<br>
</u></b>Lump sum benefits will be provided in terms of the Gold division agreement between the parties signed on 25 June 1996.<br>
</p>
<p>8.3 <b><u>All groups except mines currently associated with Randgold <br>
</u></b>In respect of employees who started employment on or after 1&#160;July 1989, the parties agree that the existing working party 
which is charged with the restructuring of the MPF/MABS should look into providing a lump sum benefit in the restructured 
fund as a supplement for such employees, in order to address the union's concerns about their position.<br>
</p>
<p>8.4 <b><u>Mines currently associated with Randgold<br>
</u></b>East Rand Proprietary Mines Limited, Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mining Company Limited and Harmony Gold Mining Company 
Limited already have mine level agreements in place dealing with this issue.<br>
</p>
<p>Buffelsfontein Gold Mining Company Limited and Grootvlei Proprietary Mines Limited are prepared to explore this issue at 
mine level. <br>
</p>
<p>8.5 <b><u>All Groups<br>
</u></b>The parties agree to amend the 1992 Agreement on the Principles and Values Applicable to Employees with Statutory 
Occupational Diseases and Injuries Sustained on Duty appropriately.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>9. <b><u>SUB-</u></b><a name="CONTRACTING"><b><u>CONTRACTING</u></b></a><b><u><br>
</u></b>9.1 The parties agree upon the need for effective implementation of the 1995 agreement on sub-contracting regarding, 
amongst other matters, advice to the NUM's mine level structures of new sub-contracting plans and disclosure to the NUM 
on a regular basis of information relevant to sub-contracting.<br>
</p>
<p>9.2 The Chamber undertakes to bring to the attention of its gold and coal members which recognise the NUM the need to 
fulfil their obligations under the terms of the 1995 sub-contracting agreement. <br>
</p>
<p>10. <a name="RIOT"><b><u>RIOT</u></b></a><b><u> AND MINES AUXILIARY FORCES POLICY<br>
</u></b>10.1 The parties note the existence of a &quot;Riot and Mines Auxiliary Forces Policy&quot;, which is an insurance policy offered by the 
Rand Mutual Assurance Company Limited to its members.<br>
</p>
<p>10.2 The Chamber undertakes to make known to its gold mine and collieries members which recognise the Union the 
existence, provisions and terms of the above-mentioned policy.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>11. <b><u>INSTITUTION OF A STATUTORY </u></b><a name="BARGAINING"><b><u>BARGAINING</u></b></a><b><u> FORUM<br>
</u></b>11.1 The parties are in agreement on the principle that it is desirable for a statutory bargaining forum to be instituted by the 
Chamber and its collective bargaining partners.<br>
</p>
<p>11.2 The parties agree to the establishment of a working party to consider and make recommendations to the parties on the 
manner in which the agreement recorded in clause 11.1 should be given effect.<br>
</p>
<p>11.3 It is agreed that all trade unions and employee associations which are recognised by the Chamber for the purposes of 
collective bargaining should be invited to be represented on the working party referred to in clause 11.2.<br>
</p>
<p>11.4 The parties agree that the terms of reference of the working party referred to in clause 11.2 should include consideration 
of the NUM's proposal relating to representation rights, with a view to the making of recommendations to the Chamber and 
the NUM.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>12. <b><u>WORKING PARTY ON A</u></b><u> </u><a name="TWO"><b><u>TWO</u></b></a><b><u>-YEAR WAGE REVIEW CYCLE <br>
</u></b>12.1 The parties note the NUM's proposal that an agreement be negotiated for a two-year wage review cycle which cycle 
would operate until 30 June 1998.<br>
</p>
<p>12.2 Noting that the NUM's proposal has been under consideration in a working party of the wage review, the parties agree 
that the working party should continue with its deliberations with a view to submitting recommendations to the parties.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>13. <b><u>MINE </u></b><a name="SPECIFIC"><b><u>SPECIFIC</u></b></a><b><u> AGREEMENTS<br>
</u></b>Agreements, as recorded in Annexures B1 to B6 hereto, have been reached between the mines listed below and the NUM, 
viz.:<br>
</p>
<p>13.1 Agreement in respect of Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mining Company Limited (Annexure B1);<br>
</p>
<p>13.2 Agreement in respect of East Rand Proprietary Mines Limited (Annexure B2);<br>
</p>
<p>13.3 Agreement in respect of Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (Annexure B3);<br>
</p>
<p>13.4 Agreement in respect of Durban Roodepoort Deep Limited (Annexure B4);<br>
</p>
<p>13.5 Agreement in respect of Douglas Colliery (Annexure B5); and <br>
</p>
<p>13.6 Agreement in respect of gold mines administered by JCI Limited (Annexure B6).<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>14. <b><u>WORKPLACE AND ORGANISATIONAL </u></b><a name="RESTRUCTURING"><b><u>RESTRUCTURING</u></b></a><b><u><br>
</u></b>14.1 Recognising that changes in the workplace and in the organisation of work require that attention be given to job grading 
systems, the parties agreed during the 1995 Wage Review to a review of job grading systems applicable on mines to be 
undertaken by a committee set up for that purpose. The review must take account of restructuring and re-organisation taking 
place on mines, as well as progress already made on several member mines.<br>
</p>
<p>14.2 Noting that the committee was unable to meet the objective of submitting its report to the parties by December 1995, the 
parties agree that the committee should continue with its deliberations and should complete its mandate of submitting 
recommendations to the parties as to how current job grading systems on mines might be improved to meet current and future 
needs.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>15. <a name="BROADBANDING"><b><u>BROADBANDING</u></b></a><b><u><br>
</u></b>15.1 The parties agree that the issue of broadbanding is being addressed as part of the job grading committee referred to in 
Clause 14.1 above.<br>
</p>
<p>15.2 <b><u>Mines in the Gold Fields Group<br>
</u></b>15.2.1 New Employees and Sheltered Employment Posts<br>
</p>
<p>15.2.1.1 Employees in sheltered employment posts and, for an initial training period of three months, new employees who do 
not possess the requisite skills and experience will be paid at a rate of 87,5% of the Category 2 minimum rate. The provisions 
for service increment will apply.<br>
</p>
<p>15.2.1.2 With regard to sheltered employment posts, the parties agree that this provision will not derogate from the terms of 
the Income Security Agreement and the 1992 Medical Separation Framework Agreement (&quot;The Principles and Values 
Applicable to Employees with Statutory Occupational Diseases and Injuries Sustained on Duty&quot;).<br>
</p>
<p>A sheltered employment post is a post requiring very limited skills which, where available, an employee with very limited 
ability can choose to take up and thus continue in employment.<br>
</p>
<p><u>Note:<br>
</u>Employees who are disabled at work are, as part of rehabilitation, trained to the level of their ability. When employed 
following training, they are employed in and paid at the level of the job. Mines in the Gold Fields Group have always been and 
remain committed to such rehabilitation and training.<br>
</p>
<p>15.2.2 All Category 1 employees who do not fall into the above and who have completed 3 months' employment in that job 
will be paid at the Category 2 minimum rate.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>16. <a name="MINIMUM"><b><u>MINIMUM</u></b></a><b><u> WAGES<br>
</u></b>The increases in minimum wages that have been agreed to between the Chamber and the NUM in respect of staff and 
non-staff members of the NUM in recognised bargaining units are reflected in Annexure C (gold mines), Annexure D 
(Randgold Associated mines) and Annexure E (collieries) to this Agreement.<br>
</p>
<p>17. <a name="BASIC"><b><u>BASIC</u></b></a><b><u> CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT ACT<br>
</u></b>The NUM undertakes to inform the Department of Labour by letter of the NUM's support for the exemption of gold mines 
and collieries, members of the Chamber, from sections 7, 9, 10 and 12 up to and including 16 and 19 of the Basic Conditions 
of Employment Act, or similar provisions in any legislation which might replace that Act, for the period 1 October 1996 to 30 
September 1997. The NUM shall send a copy of the letter to the Chamber for its records. <br>
</p>
<p>18. <b><u>FULL AND FINAL </u></b><a name="SETTLEMENT"><b><u>SETTLEMENT</u></b></a><b><u><br>
</u></b>18.1 This Agreement constitutes full and final settlement of all proposals made by the NUM and the Chamber in the 1996 
review of wages and other conditions of employment for all members of the NUM in recognised bargaining units on gold 
mines and collieries, members of the Chamber.<br>
</p>
<p>18.2 The parties agree that any dispute that may arise from the implementation of Clauses 1.2, 2.3, 3.2, 8.3, 8.4, 11 and 12 
of this agreement or the implementation of the agreements recorded in Annexure B hereto shall not detract in any way from 
this agreement and should any dispute arise in respect of <br>
</p>
<p>18.2.1 Clause 2.3, 8.3, 11 or 12 hereof it shall be between the NUM and the Chamber and<br>
</p>
<p>18.2.2 Clause 1.2, 3.2 or 8.4 or Annexure B it shall be between the NUM and the individual mining company concerned.<br>
</p>
<p>18.3 This agreement shall amend the terms and conditions of employment of the employees concerned and no demand with 
cost implications for the employer shall be made before the next wage review.<br>
</p>
<p>19. <a name="IMPLEMENTATION"><b><u>IMPLEMENTATION</u></b></a><b><u> DATE<br>

the Annexures hereto shall be implemented with effect from 1 July 1996.<br>

<p><b><u>AGREEMENT BETWEEN INGWE COAL CORPORATION LIMITED AND THE NATIONAL UNION OF 
MINEWORKERS IN RESPECT OF DOUGLAS COLLIERY<br>
</u></b>It is agreed that the wage rates of staff employees at Douglas Colliery will be aligned with the staff wage rates applicable at 
other Ingwe mines which are party to the Chamber of Mines labour agreements. The alignment will be implemented as 
follows:<br>
</p>
<p>1. Staff employees at Douglas, surface and underground, will receive an increase equal to the difference between the 
employee's current wage and the revised 1996 minimum wage rate for staff employees at Douglas.<br>
</p>
<p>2. The alignment will include the re-classification of certain staff occupations at Douglas as non-staff occupations in cases 
where such staff occupations are not classified as staff occupations at other Ingwe mines which are party to the Chamber of 
Mines labour agreements.<br>
</p>
<p>The following will be applicable regarding the classification: <br>
</p>
<p>2.1 <u>Guarantees<br>
</u></p>
<p>The following guarantees will apply to employees who will be re-classified: <br>
</p>
<p>2.1.1 No employee will receive a lower wage after the re-classification than he/she is receiving at present.<br>
</p>
<p>2.1.2 The re-classification of positions will be the subject of discussion between the NUM and the mine at mine level to 
ensure that fairness prevails.<br>
</p>
<p>2.1.3 The 1995 alignment exercise for non-staff employees at Douglas will also be applicable to staff employees to be 
re-classified as non-staff employees (i.e. the re-classification of employees should not create anomalies in non-staff 
categories).<br>
</p>
<p>2.1.4 Employees to be re-classified as non-staff employees will receive an increase equal to the agreed increase for their 
non-staff position.<br>
</p>
<p>2.2 <u>Process<br>
</u></p>
<p>The classification exercise will be executed as follows, prior to any increase being implemented for Douglas staff employees: <br>
</p>
<p>2.2.1 The Douglas management will submit a list containing the positions to be re-classified as non-staff occupations to the 
Ingwe/NUM Co-ordinators for consideration.<br>
</p>
<p>2.2.2 Once the list referred to above has been finalised, the employees concerned and who will be re-classified as non-staff 
employees, will be informed of their re-classification and of the increase they will receive.<br>
</p>
<p>2.2.3 The increase for the remaining staff employees will thereafter be implemented as per the agreement.<br>
</p>
<p>3. It is the intention of the parties to this agreement that the re-classification process be completed by 20 September 1996.<br>

<A NAME="preamble"><U><B>PREAMBLE<BR>
</B></U>WHEREAS the NUM sent to the Chamber a letter dated 24
April 1995 containing the NUM's proposals for the 1995 review
of wages and other conditions of employment for members of the
NUM employed in recognition units for which the NUM is recognised
by gold mines and collieries that are members of the Chamber ('the
1995 review'); and<BR>
</A>
<P>
WHEREAS meetings have subsequently taken place between representatives
of the NUM and the Chamber and the parties have reached agreement
on the 1995 review; and<BR>

<P>
WHEREAS during the course of the 1995 review the parties have
considered certain arrangements with regard to restructuring the
mining industry towards productivity improvements on gold and
coal mines;<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>THE PARTIES THEREFORE AGREE AS FOLLOWS :<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<A NAME="applic"><B>1. <U>APPLICATION OF AGREEMENT<BR>
</U></B></A>
<P>
1.1 This Agreement shall apply to all members of the NUM employed
in recognition units for which the NUM is recognised by gold mines
and collieries that are members of the Chamber. <BR>

<P>
1.2 It is recorded that negotiations have taken place separately
between the NUM and Harmony Gold Mine, Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mine
and ERPM. A separate agreement on the 1995 review, annexed hereto
as Annexure F, has been concluded between the NUM and these mines.
Each of the mines concerned shall be subject to all the provisions
of this agreement except where a provision of the agreement between
the NUM and a mine deals with a particular matter in which case
the provision of the latter agreement shall apply and not the
relevant provision of this agreement.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="broadbanding"><B>2. <U>BROADBANDING<BR>
</U></B></A>
<P>
2.1 The mines that are members of the Chamber undertake to implement
initiatives set out in Annexure A.<BR>

<P>
2.2 Clause 2.1 does not apply to Gold Fields. The NUM reserves
the right to pursue Gold Field's exclusion from Clause 2.1 after
conclusion of this agreement.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="restructuring"><B>3. <U>WORKPLACE AND ORGANISATIONAL
RESTRUCTURING <BR>
</U></B></A>
<P>
3.1 The parties agree that, in the interest of the long term viability
of the mining industry there needs to be ongoing workplace and
organisational restructuring, which must occur in collaboration
with individual employees and their unions at mine level.<BR>

<P>
3.2 Critical issues in this regard relate to job design towards
the optimal utilisation of human and capital resources. <BR>

<P>
3.3. Changes in the workplace and in the organisation of work
on mines require that attention be given to job grading systems.
The parties agree to a review of job grading systems applicable
on mines. This review will be undertaken by a committee which
has equal representation of both parties. It will be chaired by
an independent person to be agreed by the parties, and assisted
by two assessors who may be experts. Each party will bear its
own costs, and any common costs will be shared equally, unless
otherwise agreed between the parties.<BR>

<P>
3.3.1 The committee would be mandated to review the current job
grading systems on mines that are members of the Chamber, to receive
representation from parties and to make recommendations as to
how systems might be improved to meet current and future needs.
The review must take account of restructuring and re-organisation
taking place on mines, as well as progress already made on several
member mines.<BR>

<P>
3.3.2 The committee must endeavour to submit its report to the
parties by December&nbsp;1995. The recommendations of the committee
could be the subject of discussions between the parties in 1996
and be used to supplement<B> </B>progress in terms of the 1994
agreement.<BR>

<P>
3.3.3 Mines undertake to deal, in terms of mine level procedures,
with problems currently experienced with certain individual occupations.
These problems will therefore not form part of the committee's
brief.<BR>

<P>
3.4 Workplace redesign at mine level should take cognisance of
the need for effective and efficient supervision structures in
order to enhance productivity and safety performance. <BR>

<P>
3.5 To the extent that mine level investigations result in general
industry consensus regarding the need for legislative changes
for more effective supervisory structures, the parties will discuss
such changes centrally in order to develop joint approaches to
the relevant authorities.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="subcontracting"><B>4. <U>SUB-CONTRACTING<BR>
</U></B></A>
<P>
4.1 The parties acknowledge that it is custom and practice in
the mining industry throughout the world that aspects of the mining
process and other matters associated with the operating of mines
are sourced out or contracted out by mining companies to other
persons. Whilst this practice of out-sourcing or subcontracting
offers various advantages to mining companies and supports the
development of small business enterprise, it might contain threats
for employees and members of trade unions operating in the mining
industry.<BR>

<P>
4.2 Therefore, the parties agree that when considering subcontracting,
the company shall adhere to the following principles and procedures
and have due regard to the factors contained in this agreement.
The provisions of this agreement shall not apply to tasks which
require special skills, equipment and/or resources and for which
tasks mines do not ordinarily employ category 1 - 8 employees,
provided that from time to time, the NUM will be informed of the
type of tasks which are outsourced on this basis. <BR>

<P>
4.2.1 Within thirty days of signing this agreement, the NUM shall
be advised of existing subcontracting agreements. <BR>

<P>
4.2.2 Mines undertake:<BR>

<P>
4.2.2.1 to advise the NUM's mine level structures of new sub-contracting
plans;<BR>

<P>
4.2.2.2 to disclose to the NUM on a regular basis information
relevant to subcontracting, subject to the law and applicable
agreements; and<BR>

<P>
4.2.2.3 where the employment of subcontractors might lead to the
retrenchment or downgrading of an existing employee, the NUM's
representatives will be involved in discussions in respect of
such retrenchment or downgrading.<BR>

<P>
4.3 To facilitate the implementation of this agreement the question
of contracting out will be a subject for discussion in management/NUM
meetings.<BR>

<P>
4.4 The parties agree that the purpose of this agreement is to
promote harmonious relationships and in this regard commit themselves
that where incidents of conflict arise between mine employees
and employees of contractors, all parties will become involved
to defuse the situation.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
4.5 A subcontractor is required to comply with applicable legislation,
including the Aliens Act, Labour Relations Act, Basic Conditions
of Employment Act, Minerals Act, Unemployment Insurance Act and
the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act.<BR>

<P>
4.6 It is acknowledged that mine management cannot interfere with
the contractual relationship between the contractor and his employees,
but good practice dictates that there should be sound employment
practices.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="fulco"><B>5. <U>FULL-CALENDAR OPERATIONS<BR>
</U></B></A>
<P>
5.1 The parties agree that Section 9 of the Mines and Works Act
imposes a restriction on the better utilisation of labour and
capital resources, that this restriction needs to be addressed
urgently and that they will enter into negotiations at industry
level on the review of this law to facilitate the introduction
of full calendar operations (FULCO).<BR>

<P>
5.1.1 The parties agree that such negotiations should take place
in a working party and that they will invite all other recognised
unions and mining companies not members of the Chamber to participate
fully in this working party. The parties shall endeavour to conclude
such negotiations by December&nbsp;1995. The parties agree further
that arising from these negotiations they will enter into an agreement
for the amendment of Section 9.<BR>

<P>
5.2 Pending the amendment of the relevant section of the legislation
and the outcome of the negotiations in the working party, the
parties undertake to negotiate in good faith and without delay
at mine level on such mines that may wish to work FULCO, the details
of shift and other arrangements regarding FULCO;<BR>

<P>
5.2.1 The parties agree that:<BR>

<P>
(a) there is the need for the better utilisation of human and
capital resources;<BR>

<P>
(b) it is the intention that both the company and the employees
benefit from FULCO and to this end mutually acceptable arrangements
for FULCO will be negotiated at mine level;<BR>

<P>
(c) applications for exemptions from Section 9 should have the
support of those unions and/or associations representing the majority
of employees at the mine;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
(d) there will be disclosure of relevant information to the NUM
on FULCO, subject to the law and applicable agreements; <BR>

<P>
(e) mechanisms to monitor the effect of FULCO will be developed
at mine level; and<BR>

<P>
(f) any arrangements made should strike an appropriate balance
between the rights and interests of employers, employees and those
of the NUM.<BR>

<P>
5.2.2 Subject to agreement being reached on the items in 5.2,
the NUM agrees to support applications to the Minister to grant
exemptions to individual mines where agreement has been reached,
and such applications will be jointly made, by the NUM and the
mine. <BR>

<P>
5.3 For purposes of this agreement full calendar operations shall
mean that normal operations on a mine may be conducted on 7 days
a week, and that each day of the week shall be regarded as an
ordinary working day. This definition will be subject to the provisions
of the Public Holidays Act, 1994.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="tiers"><B>6. <U>TWO-TIER BARGAINING<BR>
</U></B></A>
<P>
6.1 The parties agree that they require a single, co-ordinated
and orderly collective bargaining system, and to this end agree
on the following:<BR>

<P>
6.1.1 that bargaining on basic wages and conditions of employment
shall take place at Chamber level, provided that by mutual agreement
between the parties special circumstances may necessitate negotiations
on these issues to take place at mine or Group level;<BR>

<P>
6.1.2 that bargaining on organisational, operational and workplace
issues, shall be at the level of the mine or company, provided
that this does not preclude matters of industry concern being
raised at Chamber level, in which event negotiations at mine or
company level will take place within any applicable framework
agreed to at Chamber level;<BR>

<P>
6.1.3 that issues which are bargained at Chamber level not be
bargained again at mine or company level, unless a framework agreement
has been concluded at Chamber level which specifies that the details
are to be negotiated at the appropriate level; and<BR>

<P>
6.1.4 that the levels of bargaining need to be co-ordinated within
an industrial relations framework that is orderly but capable
of change to meet new circumstances by agreement between the parties.
<BR>

<P>
6.2 The parties affirm their commitment to enter into Chamber
and mine or company level bargaining in terms of these principles
and objectives in good faith.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="capacity"><B>7. <U>CAPACITY BUILDING<BR>
</U></B></A>
<P>
7.1 The parties acknowledge that the building of union capacity
is important for the functioning of the NUM. In this regard arrangements
have been agreed to with regard to the release of recognised shaft
stewards and some branch committee office-bearers on full pay
for training purposes.<BR>

<P>
7.2 The parties acknowledge that in addition to the above, it
may be necessary to develop capacity at mine level, in order to
facilitate meaningful engagement on specialised topics. On occasions
when such topics are under discussion management will consider
releasing certain shaft stewards for additional specialised training
in such topics. The nature, content and duration of such training,
together with the number of people, will be agreed at mine level.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="housing"><B>8. <U>HOUSING AND ACCOMMODATION<BR>
</U></B></A>
<P>
8.1 Recognising that policy development in the field of housing
and accommodation should take place in consultation with stakeholders,
the parties agreed in 1994 on a Framework of Principles on Housing
Forums and Hostels (attached as Annexure B).<BR>

<P>
8.2 The 1994 Agreement set up the structure for Housing Forums,
which would be located at mine or company level so that regard
could be had to the specific circumstances or philosophy of the
individual mine or company, including operational circumstances.
It was envisaged that the primary function of such bodies would
be to discuss the broad parameters, or framework, of the mine
or company's policy or approach to housing, including the issue
of hostels and the improvement of living conditions.<BR>

<P>
8.3 It is recorded that even though discussions within the framework
set up by the 1994 Agreement have been initiated in respect of
the mines of certain mining houses, they have not yet commenced
in respect of all mines.<BR>

<P>
8.4 The parties agree to amend the 1994 Framework of Principles
on Housing Forums and Hostels and replace the second sentence
of clause 2.4 with the words:<BR>

<P>
&quot;While recognising that the fundamental responsibility for
the running of and maintenance of good order in the hostels rests
with management, the parties <BR>

<P>
agree that it is desirable that there be joint decision making
on issues agreed to between the parties at the appropriate level&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="safety"><B>9. <U>SAFETY REPRESENTATIVES<BR>
</U></B></A>
<P>
9.1 Mines that are members of the Chamber agree in principle to
full time safety representatives subject to discussions at mine
or Group level, or in the case of Gold Fields, Group co-ordinated
level with all unions and associations on a comprehensive agreement,
which will include the number and duties of such representatives.
The effectiveness of such representatives is to be reviewed from
time to time.<BR>

<P>
9.2 Clause 9.1 does not apply to Duiker. The NUM reserves the
right to pursue Duiker's exclusion from Clause 9.1 after conclusion
of this agreement.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="discrimination"><B>10. <U>NON-DISCRIMINATORY EMPLOYMENT
PRACTICES <BR>
</U></B></A>
<P>
10.1 The parties agree to the following:<BR>

<P>
10.1.1 Regardless of citizenship status and country of domicile
the industry enters into permanent employment relationships with
its employees, and whilst employees are on leave their employment
status remains intact;<BR>

<P>
10.1.2 Employees in the category 1 to 8 bargaining unit from foreign
countries shall not have different conditions of employment from

<CENTER><U><B>FRAMEWORK OF PRINCIPLES ON HOUSING FORUMS AND HOSTELS
<BR>
</B></U></CENTER>
<P>
<U><B>Preamble<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
The Chamber of Mines and the National Union of Mineworkers, (hereinafter
referred to as &quot;the parties&quot;) have reached agreement
on the following framework of principles and guidelines with regard
to housing and hostels<B> </B>in respect of members of the National
Union of Mineworkers in recognised bargaining units on gold mines
and collieries subject to the agreement between the parties on
the 1994 review of wages and other conditions of employment<B>.
<BR>
</B>
<P>
In the knowledge that hostels and accommodation are important
to employers and employees, this framework has as an objective
the establishment of housing forums at mine or company level in
order to discuss the approach to housing and hostels.<BR>

<P>
1. <U><B>Housing Forums<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
1.1 The parties agree to the establishment of Housing Forums at
mine or company level.<BR>

<P>
1.2 Housing Forums will serve to discuss the broad parameters,
or framework, of the mine or company's policy or approach to housing
which could lead to agreements on housing policy having regard
to the individual circumstances or philosophies of individual
mines or companies with regard to a variety of factors including
operational circumstances.<BR>

<P>
1.3 The functions and specific role and activities of Housing
Forums will be discussed at the level set out in clause 4 below
and could inter alia include surveys, liaison with housing regulatory
authorities where necessary, and discussion on housing arrangements
and the possibilities of improving living conditions.<BR>

<P>
The parties acknowledge that those persons serving on the Housing
Forums should be knowledgeable and properly informed so as to
facilitate the proper functioning of the Housing Forums.<BR>

<P>
1.4 Recognising that this framework agreement is between the Chamber
of Mines and the National Union of Mineworkers, each Housing Forum
will be inclusive of all parties affected.<BR>

<P>
2. <U><B>Hostel principles<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
2.1 Private sector hostels are best regulated between employers
and employees in the interests of constructive employer/employee
relationships. However, consideration could be given to accessing
state resources for marginal mines.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
2.2 The policy approach by mines or companies to the issue of
hostels and the improvement of living conditions will be addressed
in Housing Forums to be established at each mine or company.<BR>

<P>
2.3 Hostel residents, together with representatives as agreed
to by each Housing Forum, will be involved in the consideration
of improvements in living conditions in hostels.<BR>

<P>
2.4 The parties agree that it is desirable that residents in hostels
should participate in decision making processes in hostel affairs.
However, the fundamental responsibility for the running of and
maintenance of good order in the hostels rests with management.
Participation should take place in accordance with the following
guidelines:<BR>

<P>
The system for participation will be agreed at mine level;<BR>

<P>
The agreed system should not discriminate against residents on
the basis of their ethnic origin, language, national origin, creed
or union affiliation or political affiliation;<BR>

<P>
The system should secure equity, justice and the protection of
the human dignity of all residents;<BR>

<P>
The system should strive for just, acceptable and decent living
conditions for all residents;<BR>

<P>
The system should strive to enhance the social welfare and health
and safety of all residents;<BR>

<P>
The system should strive for peace and harmony;<BR>

<P>
Residents should regularly elect their representatives independently,
democratically and without interference;<BR>

<P>
Clear functions, powers and resources for elected representatives,
should be agreed to.<BR>

<P>
2.5<I> </I>The physical circumstances of hostels will necessarily
vary from one company to the next, with regard to a variety of
factors including operational circumstances.<BR>

<P>
3. <U><B>Implementation<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
3.1 This framework forms part of any settlement on the 1994 review
of wages and other conditions of employment. Discussions at the
level referred to in clause 4 will commence within 3 months of
the conclusion of such a settlement.<BR>
<BR>

<center><U><B>FRAMEWORK OF PRINCIPLES ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION <BR></center>
<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
<U><B>Preamble<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
The NUM had included in its 1994/95 demands to the Chamber the
issue of Affirmative Action.<BR>

<P>
The Chamber and the NUM have agreed that the implementation of
Affirmative Action at member mines represented at the 1994/95
Wage Negotiations will be informed by the following framework
of principles and concepts.<BR>

<P>
1. <U><B>Principles<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
1.1 This framework agreement forms part of the 1994/95 negotiations
and the implementation process at the relevant mine/company level
will immediately follow the conclusion of these negotiations.
<BR>

<P>
1.2 This framework agreement has as an objective implementation
of an Affirmative Action programme as agreed to and appropriately
monitored at the relevant mine/company level. <BR>

<P>
1.3 For the purposes of this framework agreement Affirmative Action
would mean:<BR>

<P>
&quot;A set of procedures aimed at a progressive human resource
policy which maximises the potential of all employees and pro-actively
addresses the disadvantages experienced by sections of the workforce
in the past. &quot;<BR>

<P>
2. <U><B>A Framework of Concepts<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
It is understood that Affirmative Action will encompass among
others, broadly the following concepts which will serve as points
of reference. It is around these that an Affirmative Action programme
at mine/company level can be agreed upon within its proper context:
<BR>

<P>
2.1 <B>Employee Advancement<BR>
</B>
<P>
It is a programme designed to redress the past disadvantages experienced
by employees, and underpinning the concept is the principle of
merit.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
2.2 <B>Equal Opportunity <BR>
</B>
<P>
Is a concept which surmises that each individual has an equal
opportunity to advance and does not take cognisance of past practices.
<BR>

<P>
2.3 <B>Consultation<BR>
</B>
<P>
The process whereby one party seeks views, feelings and ideas
of another party before it makes a final decision.<BR>

<P>
2.4<B> Negotiation<BR>
</B>
<P>
The process whereby at least two independent parties endeavour
to settle a matter between them in a mutually acceptable manner.
<BR>

<P>
2.5<B> Quotas<BR>
</B>
<P>
A quota is a quantitative value which is either self or statutorially
imposed and relates to the number of placements of specific employees
or groups of employees.<BR>

<P>
2.6 <B>Promotions<BR>
</B>
<P>
Promotions are a form of transfer usually involving a shift to
a higher position in the hierarchy, normally associated with increased
responsibility, wages, status and authority.<BR>

<P>
2.7 <B>Recruitment<BR>
</B>
<P>
Recruitment is concerned with developing a pool of job candidates,
in line with the human resources plan. Candidates are located
through newspapers, professional journal advertisements, employment
agencies, word of mouth and visits to college and university campuses.
Recruitment may also be done within an organisation utilising
the current pool of employees.<BR>

<P>
2.8 <B>Training<BR>
</B>
<P>
The process aims at increasing the ability and skills of individuals
and groups to contribute towards organisational effectiveness.
<BR>

<P>
2.9 <B>Conditions of employment<BR>
</B>
<P>
Basic pay, overtime, annual leave, job category, medical aid,
pension, insurance, working hours, sick leave and other benefits
and conditions associated with employment.<BR>

<P>
2.10 <B>Recognition of prior learning<BR>
</B>
<P>
Is the process of recognising training and experience which has
been derived at the workplace.<BR><p>

<p align=center><font color="#800040"><font size=5><b>EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMME</b></font></font><br>
</p>
<p align=center><font color="#0080FF"><font size=6><strong><tt>POLICY</tt></strong></font></font></p>
<p align=left>The Members of the Chamber of Mines demonstrate their concern for the emotional and social well-being of their employees 
through the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP).</p>
<p align=left>The primary function of the EAP is the prevention and treatment of psychological and social malfunctioning (such as alcohol 
and drug dependency, marital, family, emotional and behavioural malfunction) which has a negative impact on job satisfaction, 
as well as the efficiency and quality of work rendered by the employees members of the Chamber of Mines.</p>
<p align=left>The Chamber of Mines, on behalf of its members, believes that the success of the EAP depends on the degree to which mine 
management, employee organisations, individual employees and the Chamber support the implementation of the following 
EAP principles:</p>
<p align=left><font color="#FF0000"><strong>NEUTRALITY</strong></font>: the programme should not become enmeshed in the traditional interface between management and labour 
and should not clash with existing administrative procedures and contractual agreements.</p>
<p align=left><font color="#FF0000"><strong>ACCESSIBILITY</strong></font>: all employees should have reasonable access to a decentralised service.</p>
<p align=left><font color="#FF0000"><strong>TIMEOUS INTERVENTION</strong></font>: Efforts should be made to ensure early identification and treatment of problems thus 
facilitating a good prognosis.</p>
<p align=left><font color="#FF0000"><strong>VOLUNTARISM</strong></font>: participation in the programme should be voluntary without, however, denying management the 
prerogative of recommending employees for assistance.</p>
<p align=left><font color="#FF0000"><strong>IMPARTIALITY</strong></font>: participation in the programme should not prejudice an employee's job security or chances of promotion.</p>
<p align=left><font color="#FF0000"><strong>EQUAL AND DIGNIFIED TREATMENT</strong></font>: employees treated should receive the same consideration as those with 
medical problems.</p>
<p align=left><font color="#FF0000"><strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</strong></font>: personal information of employees utilising the programme should be treated in a confidential 
manner.</p>
<p align=left><font color="#FF0000"><strong>PREVENTION OF ABUSE</strong></font>: the programme should not be abused by any employee or participating party.</p>
<p align=left><font color="#FF0000"><strong>A BALANCED PROGRAMME</strong></font>: a healthy balance between rehabilitative and preventative services should be maintained.</p>

<A NAME="object"></A>
<B>OBJECTIVE</B><br>
The objective of this agreement is to provide industry level guidelines:<br>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> to minimise the effect of HIV in the mining industry;
<li> to prevent the spread of HIV infection; and
<li> for the management of HIV infection in the employer/employee relationship.
</OL>
<p>

<A NAME="policy"></A>
<B>POLICY</B><br>
<OL>
<LI><B>GENERAL PRINCIPLE</B><BR>
Whilst recognising that there are circumstances unique to HIV infection, the fundamental principle to be applied is that HIV infection and AIDS should be approached on the same basis as any other serious condition.<p>

<A NAME="rights"></A>
<li><B>RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE</B>
<OL TYPE=i>
<LI> <B>Rights of employees who are HIV positive </B><br>
HIV positive employees will be protected against discrimination, victimisation or harrasment.<p>

<li><B>Testing</B><br>
No employee should be required to undergo an HIV test at the request, or upon the initiative of management or an employee organisation, provided that where HIV testing is intended in specified occupations on medical grounds, the employee will be required to undergo testing where this has been supported by the independent and objective medical assessment of a medical pratitioner, mutually agreed to by the parties.  Failing agreement, the Medical Bureau for Occupational Diseases will be requested to select such a practitioner.<p>

<li><B>Employment opportunities and termination of employment</B><br>
No employee should suffer adverse consequences, whether dismissal or denial of appropriate alternative employment opportunities which exist, merely on the basis of HIV infection.<p>

<li><B>Counselling</B><br>
Appropriate support and counselling service will be made available to employees.<p>

<li><B>Benefits</B><br>
Employees who are clinically ill or medically unfit for work will enjoy benefits in terms of the relevant conditions of employment as negotiated from time to time between the parties.
</ol><p>

<A NAME="test"></A>
<li><B>EPIDEMIOLOGICAL TESTING</B><br>
<OL TYPE=i>
<LI>Testing programmes for epidemiological purposes will be the subject of appropriate consultation with recognised employee organisations, and will be subject to independent and objective evaluation and scrutiny.<p>
<li>The statistical results of testing programmes will be shared with employees and recognised employee organisations.<p>
<li>The results of epidemiological studies will not be used as a basis for discriminating against any class of employee in the workplace.<p>
</ol>

<A NAME="standards"></A>
<li><B>TESTING STANDARDS</B><br>
<OL TYPE=i>
<LI>All testing will comply with generally accepted international standards (on pre- and post-test counselling, informed consent, confidentiality and support).<p>
</ol>

<A NAME="aware"></A>
<li><B>AWARENESS AND EDUCATION PROGRAMMES</B><BR>
<OL TYPE=i>
<LI>In the absence of vaccine or cure, information and education are vital components of an AIDS prevention programme because the spread of the disease can be limited by informed and responsible behaviour.<p>

<li>Appropriate awareness and education programmes will be conducted to inform employees about AIDS and HIV which will enable them to protect themselves and others against infection by HIV.<p>

<li>The involvement of employees and their recognised representatives is of key importance in awareness, education and counselling programmes to prevent the spread of AIDS as well as in the support for HIV positive employees.<p>

<li>The employers will consult with employees and their recognised representatives on current and future programmes (referred to in clause 5.3) and their implementation, at mine level.<p>
</ol>

<A NAME="life"></A>
<li><B>LIFE-STYLE CHANGES</B><BR>
<OL TYPE=i>
<LI>It is acknowledged that it is the role of each individual to prevent the transmission of HIV through informed and responsible behaviour and the parties also recognise that socio-economic circumstances can influence disease patterns in communities.<p>

<li>The parties agree to consider at mine level the socio-economic environment and life-styles in relation to the effective prevention of HIV infection.<p>
</ol>

<A NAME="work"></A>
<li><B>HEALTH CARE WORKERS</B><r>
<OL TYPE=i>
<li>The policy recognises the professional and ethical guidelines for health care workers as stipulated by the relevant statutory bodies.<p>

<li><B>AMENDMENT TO AGREEMENT</B><BR>
<OL TYPE=i>
<li>The parties jointly undertake to assess and review the efficacy of the provisions of this policy one year after its implementation, or at any stage thereafter.<p>

<A NAME="partie"></A>

<dl>
<dt><B>1. PARTIES AND SCOPE </B><BR>
1.1. It is recorded that this framework agreement is entered into by the Chamber on behalf of gold and coal mines, members of the Chamber, which recognise the NUM and by the NUM on behalf of its members employed in recognised bargaining units on such gold  and coal mines.<p>

<A NAME="recog"></A>
<dt><B>2. RECOGNITION OF IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING</B>
<dl>
<dt>2.1. The parties recognise that :<p>
<dl>
<dt>2.1.1.Employees seek to overcome illiteracy and improve learning skills in order to address past educational disadvantages.<p>

<dt>2.1.2.In order to achieve the goal of workplace efficiency and safety in the light of increasing pressures on viability and international competition, organisations need competent workforces with focused skills, and the flexibility to adapt to new work practices and technology.<p>
</dl>
<dt>2.2. Against this background the parties recognise that education and training in the industry is important in order to achieve relevant competencies and higher standards of performance subject to the operational requirements of each mine, and also to employees to facilitate access to opportunities in the workplace.<p>

<dt>2.3. The parties acknowledge that<p>

<dd>2.3.1. the right to education is a fundamental human right; and <p>

<dd>2.3.2. the primary responsibility for the provision of education lies with the State<p>

<dt>2.4. The parties accept that while the provision of training and education by employers must be directed by mine circumstances the discussions detailed in clause 4 will be informed by international standards and practice, including ILO Convention 140.<p>

<dt>2.5. The parties agree to review the practical implications for the mining industry of ILO Convention 140 following discussions detailed in clause 4 and in the NEDLAC Labour Market Chamber. <p>

<dt>2.6. In the event that the State formally ratifies ILO Convention 140 the parties agree to meet as part of the process of review set out in 2.5. above.  At the meeting the parties will discuss implementation by the State of the guidelines set out in the Convention and the implications for the mining industry.  This will take place in the light of the mine discussions taking place or having taken place at the appropriate level in terms of paragraph 3.1. as well as the process through Nedlac. <p></dl>


<A NAME="guide"></A>
<B>3. GUIDELINES</B><br>

<dt>3.1. In consideration of the above the parties agree that joint discussions should take place at the appropriate level identified in clause 4 below, on paid education and training in accordance with the following framework of guidelines : <p>
<dl>
<dt>3.1.1. Education and training within the industry aims to ensure that the employee has the necessary competence to perform his or her job effectively. <p>

<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Geology"><font size=3><b>Geology</b></font></a><font size=3><b><br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>The Bushveld Igneous Complex (BIC), which extends for 400 kilometres in the Northern Province, contains the world's largest known 
deposits of platinum group metals (PGMs) - platinum, palladium, rhodium. ruthenium. iridium and osmium. It is a large igneous (volcanic) 
intrusion through the earth's crust which having been tilted and eroded new outcrops to surface around what appears to be the edge of a 
great geological basin. <br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>The BIC system is divided into an eastern and western lobe with a further northern extension: it is believed that all three sections of the 
system were formed around the same time -some 2 billion years ago -- and are remarkably similar. Vast quantities of molten rock from the 
earth's mantle were brought to surface through long vertical cracks in the earth's crust creating the geological intrusion known as the BIC. The 
effects of these injections of molten rock over time, combined with the crystallisation of different minerals at different temperatures, resulted in 
the formation of a structure rather like a<i> </i>layered cake consisting of distinct mineral strata, including three PGM-bearing reefs. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Reserves"><font size=3><b>Reserves</b></font></a><font size=3><b><br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>The unique BIC contains estimated PGM reserves of some 50 000 tons (excluding the potentially huge Platreef deposits) some 69 per cent 
of the world total. So far, the Merensky<i> </i>Reef has been the source of most of South Africa's PGMs, It is estimated to contain some 17 000 tons 
of PGM, reserves. In the western<i> </i>BIC, where the major platinum mines are<i> </i>situated, the reef occurs in a narrow<i>, 25- </i>centimetre-wide PGM rich 
band bounded by two thin chromite layers. This pattern falls away in other areas resulting in the reefs diverging<i> </i>between the chromite bands<i> 
</i>until it is many metres wide The Merensky Reef is characterised by its high PGM grades and the high ratio of platinum to the other PGMs, 
especially those of major importance like palladium and rhodium. <br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>The UG2 Reef, which is more consistent throughout the BIC, is rich in chrornite but lacks the Merensky's gold, copper and nickel 
by-products, though its PGM reserves may be almost twice as large as those of the Merensky Reef. In the past it was thought difficult to 
process because of its high chromium content. These uncertainties now appear to have been resolved, and it is estimated that increasing 
exploitation of the UG2 Reef will lift its<i> </i>contribution to South Africa's platinum output<i> </i>from some 15 per<i> </i>cent in 1988 to<i> </i>nearly 30 per cent by 
1996. The Crocodile River mine was the first devoted entirely to exploiting UG2 ore. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>In the northern extension of the BIC the Platreef is found. Whereas the platinum palladium ratio in the Merensky and UG2 reefs is close to 
three to one, the two metals are found in equal measure in the Platreef deposits.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Production"><font size=3><b>Production</b></font></a><font size=3><b><br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>South African mines are the world's only primary producers of PGMs. In 1989 it was estimated that the Republic's mines produced 2,6 
million ounces out of a total global output of 3.4 million ounces of the metal. The country supplied just over 1,1 million ounces of palladium, 
against total primary supplies of 3,2 million ounces, and 56 per cent of total rhodium supplies of 330 000 ounces. Almost 90 per cent of 
ruthenium and iridium supplies emanated from South Africa. Finally, the rare metal, osmium, is converted in the Republic to value-added 
osmium tetroxide for export. Production of PGMs is dominated by the 'big two' - Amplat's Rustenburg Platinum and Gencor's Impala Platinum 
which estimates suggest, together accounted for nearly 80 per cent of the Western world's newly mined platinum in 1989. Several new South 
African mines, however, are due to add to supply in the near future. <br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Mining"><font size=3><b>Mining</b></font></a><font size=3><b> platinum<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>The mining of platinum ores is similar to gold mining inasmuch as the orebody is a thin, tabular reef covering an extensive area. This 
enables a progressive method of mining - the reef is drilled and blasted to advance the face, support being installed for local control of the 
hanging wall. As in gold mines, platinum mining is incorporating the increased use of mechanisation and trackless-mining methods in stopes 
little more than one metre high. <br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Platinum mining, however, differs from gold mining in several ways. Unlike gold reefs, which are sedimentary deposits resulting from the 
settling of granular particles on the bed of an inland lake and subjected to great pressure, platinum reefs are igneous rocks. They were 
intruded into the Bushveld area as molten volcanic magmata rising from below the earth's crust, later cooling and solidifying. This 
phenomenon created a strata control environment differing markedly from that of gold mines. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Platinum mining is also affected by a further geological feature - the occurrence of parboils in the plane of the reef. Varying in diameter 
from some 30 to 500 metres, and causing rapid sinking or rising of the reef, these potholes disrupt stoning operations, often requiring the 
re-establishment of stone faces.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Occurrence"><font size=3><b>Occurrence</b></font></a><font size=3><b> of PGMs<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>The Merensky Reef is the source of over 80 per cent of the platinum mined in South Africa This has been successfully exploited since the 
late '2Os by Rustenburg Platinum. The reef has been treated by Impala Platinum from 1969 and Western Platinum since 1971<br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>More PGMs are found in the chromatite reefs of the BIC. The highest PGM values are associated with the UG2 Reef which lies about 200 
metres below the Merensky. Since the mid-'70s increasing tonnages of UG2 ore have been mined and treated by the established producers. In 
1989, Crocodile River Mine was brought into operation on UG2 reef. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Smaller quantities of PGMs are found in the middle- and lower group chrome seams which are mined for their chrome content. Recently, 
some of these PGMs have been recovered by re-treatment of chrome mine railings. Other similar schemes are planned, though the quantities of 
precious metals from this source will never be very large<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>The PGM-bearing Platreef occurs in the northern portion of the BIC. Mining of this reef was discontinued in the early '30s owing to 
treatment difficulties and patchy values. Exploration and test-work have continued and at least one new mine is now planned for the Platreef.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Mineralogy"><font size=3><b>Mineralogy</b></font></a><font size=3><b><br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>The pattern of values in different ore samples can vary widely. The precious metals occur in a variety of forms. One or more of the metals 
may be present in combination with sulphur, arsenic, selenium or tellurium metallic particles of PGMs or of PGMs alloyed with base metals are 
also found. Additional PGMs are found in solid solution in base metal sniphide particles <br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Chromite crystals form a large part of the volume of UG2 and other chrome ores. Base-metal sulphides are much more prevalent in 
Merensky and Platreef ores than in the UG2 or chrome ores. The grain size of mineral particles varies widely but is coarsest in Merensky ores. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>The difficulty in recovering PGMs from any particular ore is determined by the ore's mineralogy. Although Merensky ores are often easier 
to treat, it is not easy to generalise. Ore from different areas of the same mine can have quite different characteristics.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Recovery"><font size=3><b>Recovery</b></font></a><font size=3><b> processes<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>PGM recovery processes for UG2 and Merensky ores are generally similar. However, the disparity in base metal contents is responsible 
for differences in the relative scale of some unit operations. Processes can be grouped into the four stages of concentration, smelting, base 
metals removal, and precious metals refining.<br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Concentration"><font size=3><b>Concentration</b></font></a><font size=3><b><br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>In concentration. the ore is ground to liberate mineral particles. These are then recovered in the form of a concentrate by froth flotation. 
The ore mineralogy dictates both the fineness of grind required for liberation and the ideal flotation conditions. Very fine particles are difficult 
to recover, so two or even three milling and flotation stages may be used to minimise losses caused by over-grinding.</font> </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>There are minor differences in the details of the equipment and operations employed by the various producers. In Merensky processing a 
metallic concentrate rich in PGMs is sometimes produced in addition to the flotation concentrate. This concentrate can be sufficiently rich to 
by-pass the smelter and be sent straight to base metal removal. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>In UG2 processing there are a number of options regarding by product chromite recovery and blending with the Merensky ore before 
milling. At present, though, only one South African producer is recovering chromite: this is done after primary milling, with the chromite 
crystals being liberated at their natural grain size. UG2 ores require finer grinding than Merensky are for optimum PGM recovery. Blending of 
the two before milling therefore gives lower recoveries and is to be avoided where possible.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Smelting"><font size=3><b>Smelting</b></font></a><font size=3><b><br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>The concentrate is melted in an electric furnace. Large units with six electrodes in line are used for smelting Merensky or mixtures of 
Merensky and UG2 concentrates. Smaller circular furnaces are used to smelt unblended UG2 concentrate. On melting, the concentrate 
separates into two layers. The upper layer is a silicate/oxide slag which is tapped off and then either discarded or returned to concentration. 
The lower layer is a sulphide motto which is sent for converting. <br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>The flotation-concentrate composition must be suitable for smelting. its rock mineral content should produce a fluid slag at the desired 
temperature. At the same time, it must contain enough sulphides to form a reasonable quantity of matter. To compensate for minor problems 
with chemical composition, various fluxes are added. Typically, the main addition is burnt lime or limestone but other materials such as 
carbonaceous reductants, sulphides, oxides or silicates are used as necessary. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Higher temperatures are required to melt UG2 concentrates owing to higher contents of chromium and magnesium oxides. More turbulent 
smelting conditions are also preferred to avoid build-up of chrome spinel in the furnace hearth. Crocodile River Mine was the first operation to 
be dependent on smelting unblended UG2 concentrates. Other operators have been able to feed their furnaces with a blend that includes 
Merensky concentrate.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>The furnace matte is further processed by converting. Excess sulphur and iron are oxidised in a refractory lined vessel. Fluxing agents are 
added to form an iron-rich slag that is skimmed off and returned to the furnaces. The converter motto is then sent for base-metal removal.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Base"><font size=3><b>Base</b></font></a><font size=3><b>-metal removal<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>Base metals are removed from the converter matte either by leaching or by a combination of magnetic separation and leaching processes. 
Problem elements such as selenium, arsenic and tellurium are also removed. The concentrate which results is sent for further processing into 
refined precious metals. <br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Base metals are a valuable by-product of PGM extraction. Their further refining by the various producers is largely dictated by economies 
of scale. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="Precious"><font size=3><b>Precious</b></font></a><font size=3><b>-metals refining<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>Precious-metals refining processes have developed considerably in recent years. The older or 'classical' process involved first roasting 
the PGM concentrate. This made the rhodium, iridium and ruthenium insoluble in aqua regia. The platinum, palladium and gold were then 
dissolved and separated by a series of sequential precipitations, The remaining residue was then upgraded by pyro-metallurgical and leaching 
processes before being separated into individual metals. Final purification of all metals was by repeated dissolution and precipitation.<br>
</font> </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Improved separation and refining procedures have become available for all of the precious metals. These commonly involve operations 
such as solvent extraction or ion exchange. They' are being introduced either to replace procedures in the classical process or as part of 
completely new refining processes. Advantages such as improved precious metals recovery, lower refining costs and shorter processing 
times are being claimed.<br>

<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"><b><i>Autocatalysts<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></i></b></font><font size=2>Motor vehicle exhaust systems are fitted with catalytic converters to reduce the polluting effects of exhaust emissions. The converter's 
main component is a ceramic honeycomb, the surface of which is coated with platinum and rhodium, to which palladium is sometimes added. 
The main form of autocatalyst is a three way converter, so called because as engine exhausts pass through the converter at around 300&#176;C, 
these precious metals convert nitrogen oxide, unburnt hydrocarbons and deadly carbon monoxide into harmless nitrogen, water and carbon 
dioxide.<br>
</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Autocatalysts, which account for more than 40 per cent of total demand for platinum alone, are the major demand sector for PGMs - and 
for the next few years this market is unlikely to see any economically viable substitutes for these metals. It is believed that total autocatalyst 
demand for platinum was some 1.5 million ounces in 1989. Palladium supplies to the industry in 1989 amounted to 265 000 ounces. In the same 
year record amounts of rhodium, a rare metal, far more expensive than platinum, were used in autocatalyst manufacture: autocatalysts 
accounted for 79 per cent of total rhodium demand of 330 000 ounces, around 56 per cent being supplied by South Africa.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>The major industrialised countries of the world - spearheaded by the United States, Japan and, most recently, the European Community 
member states are enacting legislation to apply increasingly stringent auto emission standards, in spite of developments like lean-burn engine 
technology (which aims at complete petrol combustion), and Ford's claims (subsequently shown to be exaggerated) regarding a new type of 
platinum-free, palladium oxidation catalyst, for the foreseeable future platinum/palladium/rhodium catalysts are likely to be the overwhelming 
choice of motor manufacturers worldwide. Autocatalyst demand, and especially that for the three way converters with their higher unit 
loadings of precious metal, continues to be encouraging. As a result of the European Parliament's series of votes in favour of tighter emission 
controls, 80 per cent of European cars were required to carry three way catalytic converters by 1993. </font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"><b><i>Jewellery<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></i></b></font><font size=2>Today, around 38 per cent of the world's platinum finds its way into jewellery. Japan, which accounts for almost half of total free market 
demand for the metal, is by far the world's largest consumer of platinum for jewellery fabrication - its off-take approaching 1,4 million ounces in 
1995 represented around 85 per cent of the entire weight of platinum used in jewellery in the non-communist world. Japan has traditionally 
favoured the metal over gold or silver. Else-where in 1995 sales of platinum appear to have improved in other countries in the Far East and 
climbed steadily in the two major European markets, Italy and Germany.<br>
</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"><b><i>Investment<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></i></b></font><font size=2>In 1995, investment demand was approximately 380 000 ounces or 8 per cent of gross Western platinum demand. Platinum has established 
a recognition for itself as a legitimate, complementary holding to gold and silver, primarily in that country, and also the United States and 
Western Europe. As growing evidence of this Johnson Matthey (UK marketing agents for Rustenburg Platinum), as well as the Chinese, 
Australian, Canadian and former USSR governments, all launched platinum coins and medallions on to the market, with the Canadian Maple 
Leaf, the Isle of Man Noble and the Australian Koala dominating the legal tender coin investment sector.<br>
</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"><b><i>Industry<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></i></b></font><font size=2>In this sector, demand essentially arises out of the servicing of platinum requirements to make up losses incurred in use and through 
recycling. Any growth, therefore, is largely dependent on the establishment of new capacity, although new applications for PGMs continue to 
be discovered in a widening range of industries.<br>
</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>PGMs continue to maintain their long association with the electrical and electronics industry, which accounts for 50 per cent of annual 
palladium and ruthenium demands. Although traditional usage of PGMs in electrical contacts has declined, the 'micro-chip' era opened up a 
wide range of novel electronic applications. The use of iridium crucibles at very high temperatures for growing single crystals of specialised 
electronics materials is but one example demonstrating that PGMs are proving indispensable in many facets of electronics technology<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>In the chemicals industry, the most important area of application for PGMs is in the production of nitric acid, essential for fertilizer and 
explosives manufacture and a host of other chemical uses. In the electro-chemical sector, ruthenium and iridium are used to coat electrodes for 
the production of chlorine, while iridium is employed in petroleum refining and other catalysts. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Platinum is essential to the petro-chemical industry. It is used as a reforming catalyst in the production of higher-octane fuels and the 
more complete exploitation of the various fractions of crude oil World demand for oil is recovering. which is resulting in more platinum and 
other PGMs such as iridium being needed to top up considerable stocks of reforming and isomerisation catalysts, while upgrading of refining 
capacity and construction of new isomerisation capacity will lead to greater demand. In addition, as the petroleum industry has pruned much 
excess capacity, the resultant sale back to the market of platinum recycled from spent catalyst has slowed down. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>PGMs are used in the glass industry in two principal fields - glass fibre, and other optical and high-performance glass. in glass-fibre 
product/on, the fibres formed as molten glass are extruded through fine bushings. These are invariably made of rhodium/platinum alloys [n the 
case of optical and high-performance glass used in camera and instrumentation manufacturing, video equipment and television, there is still 
no substitute for platinum. In 1995, estimated demand for platinum by glass producers was some 220 000 ounces or 4,7 per cent of total 
demand, and it is expected that the glass fibre industry will continue to grow steadily owing to increases in the use of glass reinforced plastics 
in the US and Europe and the fast-growing market for electronic printed circuit boards in the Far East. <br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Other areas of growth for platinum include catalysts for air pollution control, water purification and electrodes for cathodic protection 
against erosion.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><font size=2>Finally, motor manufacturers are introducing platinum-tipped spark plugs that offer longer life and improved combustion and fuel 
efficiency.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"><b><i>Medicine<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></i></b></font><font size=2>Palladium is rapidly supplanting gold in dentistry. In 1995 about 1,2 million ounces was used in dentistry worldwide. Platinum is used in 
the treatment of certain types of cancer. In the future PGMs may play a role in fighting viral. bacterial and parasitic infections: they may also 
come to be used as diagnostic tools.<br>
</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"><b><i>Fuel cells<br>
<font FACE="Arial"></i></b></font><font size=2>The clean and efficient fuel cell of the future, in which platinum catalysts are used to convert the chemical energy of a fuel into electrical 
energy, has for some time been seen as the next new major demand sector in the industrial area. Two problems plague further moves to 
achieve wide commercialisation of fuel-cell systems which utilise a platinum catalyst. Firstly, the current high capital cost of the 
pro-production units makes them uncompetitive: secondly, proof of reliability can only be achieved through demonstration of the generating 
plants. In Japan, however, projects have passed the research-and-development stage and it is hoped to launch phosphoric acid fuel cells as 
commercial products in 1993. It is forecast that there will be an increasing call for these types of cell in specialist applications, such as in the 
aerospace, defence and leisure industries.<br>
</font> </font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><font FACE="Arial"></font></font><a name="South"><font size=3><b>South</b></font></a><font size=3><b> African mining developments <br>
<font FACE="Arial"></b></font><font size=2>In recent years prospecting for PGMs and actual mining developments in South Africa reached unprecedented levels and several new 
platinum mines were announced. GFSA's Northam and Gencor's Messina are under development, while the Crocodile River Mine and Lonrho's 
Karee and Eastern Platinum mines started production in the late 1980s. There has been some expansion at JCI's Lebowa Platinum Mines' Atok 
Section, while a new shaft was sunk at Rustenburg Platinum's Amandelbult Section and production was expanded at Union Section. On the 
Platreef, Southern Witwatersrand Exploration discovered a substantial nickel/platinum deposit. Lastly, AAC's proposed Uitkomst nickel mine 
in Mpumalanga was set to produce 30 000 ounces of platinum and 80 000 ounces of palladium from 1993.<br>

IT'S JOBS, STUPID <I>(Business Day Editorial Comment)</I><BR>
Of all the targets contained in government's Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy, the employment goals seem the least credible.  Less convincing are the targets for jobs growth - rising to 409 000 jobs, or a 4,3% increase in employment, in 2000.  Indeed latest figures show virtually stagnant employment figures for 1996, as compared with GEAR's projected 126 000 jobs, or 1,3% employment growth.<BR><P>
MANUFACTURING DROPS AGAIN <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The manufacturing sector's profitability ratio - net profit as a percentage of turnover - was 4,6% in the third quarter of 1996, 1,2 percentage points lower than a year earlier and the fifth consecutive quarterly decrease, Central Statistical Service said yesterday.<BR><P>
RED TAPE ENTANGLES DEMOCRACY BILL <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

BLACKS BEING 'USED TO WIN CONTRACTS' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The insistence by the government that companies bidding for state tenders have black shareholders or be joint ventures was not benefiting black business, a senior official of the National African Chamber of Commerce said yesterday.  A few black individuals were getting rich in return for lending their faces to white firms which used their presence to gain contracts.<BR><P>

WARNING ON AMAZING AIDS CLAIM <I>(The Star, Jhb.)</I><BR>
The University of Pretoria last night warned that a new Aids treatment announced by a team of its researchers yesterday still had to be properly tested. In a late-night statement after a meeting between university authorities and the researchers, the university warned that the promising results from early trials still had to be tested in clinical experiments. But that did not stop the announcement shooting around the world.<BR>
<B><I>... meanwhile ...</I></B><BR>
PRETORIA UNIVERSITY SCIENTISTS PRESENT AIDS DRUG <I>(Business Day, Jhb.)</I><BR>
The cabinet decided yesterday to consider funding further research into a medicine against AIDS that South African researchers claimed had produced far better results than any other drug.

SA LABOUR COSTS HIGH, PRODUCTIVITY LOW - LATEST US DATA <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The US Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Affairs (BEA) has just released preliminary country-by-country data on the performance of US companies' foreign operations in 1994.  Some points jump out.  First, there is the one about SA's labour costs.  A South African worker cost his US employer $16 000 in 1994, while generating $6 000 in net income.  A Malaysian cost $9 600 and generated $12 000.<BR><P>
OPTIMISM IN SA DROPS 6% BUT STILL BEATS PESSIMISM <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
South Africans are more pessimistic about the year ahead than they were 12 months ago, according to Markinor International's annual optimism index.  But optimists still constitute the majority and SA is the 13th most optimistic nation out of 49 surveyed.<BR><P>
FIRMS' INERTIA BLAMED FOR LACK OF PRODUCTIVITY <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Corporate inertia is the prime cause of the lack of "world class practice" in SA, and also the pervasive international pessimism about the country's ability to compete, says Competitive Strategy MD Laurance Kuper.  Kuper said executives had the choice of either drastically revitalising their companies and repositioning them to learn the way to efficiency fast, or "shoring up comfort zones and securing a low to no profit position right at the tail end of global competitiveness".  He claimed the majority of SAs businesses chose the latter course.<BR><P>
GENCOR RIDES ON ALUMINIUM'S HIGH <I>(Business Report, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Gencor shares moved up smartly over the Christmas holidays and are continuing to ride high on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.  Even senior Gencor executives are puzzled by the rise, as are most analysts on Diagonal Street.<BR><P>
GOLD PRICE MAY AFFECT TERMS OF JCI DEAL <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
The continued weakness in the gold price during the coming weeks could result in Anglo American having to renegotiate the terms of the sale of 34,9% of JCI to the African Mining Group, analysts said yesterday.<BR><P>
BLACK MOUNTAIN ON UPWARD TREND <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Gold Fields of SA's Black Mountain base metal producer could see earnings growth continue if the recent recovery in lead prices continued, following the icy weather which has hit the northern hemisphere over the last few weeks.<BR><P>
MINERS KILLED <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Two miners were killed in an underground locomotive accident yesterday at Anglovaal Hartebeestfontein Division near Klerksdorp, southwest of Johannesburg.<BR><P>
EU NEGOTIATORS ARRIVE 'TO LISTEN TO SA' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
European Union negotiators who arrive today for the resumption of co-operation talks with SA tomorrow are hoping to work out a programme of action that will put the stalled discussion firmly on track, sources say.<BR><P>
RAND ON UPWARD MARCH <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
The rand's strength continued unchecked yesterday as the currency improved more than 2c against the dollar to reach a seven-and-a-half week high of R4,6325 in late trade, from R4,6545 late on Tuesday.<BR><P>
STALS IN NO HURRY TO CUT MONEY-MARKET SHORTAGE <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>

US TO TRADE IN RAND FUTURES (Business Report)<BR><P>
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange has applied for approval to trade futures and options on the rand, it said yesterday.<BR><P>
GOLD SLIDES AS US INFLATION THREAT RECEDES <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
US central bank chairman Alan Greenspan's remarks appearing to play down the threat of inflation reverberated around world markets yesterday, depressing the gold price and making the rand and capital markets firm sharply.  The gold price slipped below $350/oz, its lowest level since September 1993.<BR><P>
MANUEL MAY ACHIEVE A RARE FEAT <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
On March 12 Finance Minister Trevor Manuel could achieve a rare feat.  He could table a Budget in parliament which impresses the financial markets and also pleases taxpayers.  The markets may well be impressed that he stuck to his promise to bring the deficit before borrowing down to 4% of gross domestic product (GDP), and there may well be a collective sigh of relief from taxpayers because Manuel managed it without increasing taxes.<BR><P>
1997 MAY SURPRISE ECONOMIC FORECASTERS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Optimistic economists got their forecasts wrong in 1996.  Now they are gloomy about 1997 - With a bit of luck, and political ingenuity, 1997 might well display the same perverse pattern as 1996;  notably that of running counter to forecasts by economic soothsayers.  Cast your mind back a year and remember the prosperity predicted, and then remember the bitter pill that characterised our new democracy's mid-term.  Now glance back just a few weeks and recall the doom and gloom that has permeated the latest predictions. Therefore, could it be that 1997 will in fact turn out to be a good year - or at least stabilised enough to provide a foundation for improved prospects?<BR><P>
EASTERN CAPE'S GOVT <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The Eastern Cape's government is discussing with German consultants an industrial development scheme which would facilitate an injection of up to R28bn into the struggling regional economy.<BR><P>
DEREGULATING LABOUR NOT PATH TO SUCCESS, ILO TOLD <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Deregulated labour markets in some African countries did not necessarily result in successful integration into the global economy, the Southern African Multi-advisory Team director Peter Peet said in Harare yesterday.<BR><P>
'LACK OF LAW, POOR SERVICES HURTING SA' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Government must act and stabilise state services whose deterioration, and the insecurity resulting from the lack of law and order, are causing a brain drain that could diminish the country's competitiveness, says Stocks & Stocks chairman Reg Edwards.<BR><P>
US EXPERTS TO ASSIST WITH BORDER CONTROL <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
A team of US experts on border control arrived in SA yesterday to help bolster the national crime prevention strategy.  Border control was "a critical factor in crime prevention", said Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi yesterday.  His department requested, and will co-ordinate the 10-day visit.<BR><P>
MOVE TO MONITOR FOREIGN BANKS IN SA <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The Registrar of Banks in SA is to begin monitoring the financial position of foreign banks' representative offices from March this year in a move to ensure they do not break the rules when competing with local banks.<BR><P>
GOVT SET TO CLASH WITH UNIONS OVER RETRENCHMENTS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

No decision would be taken on the controversial R3bn Syrian arms deal until Deputy President Thabo Mbeki had considered a host of issues, including the technology involved and US legislation, cabinet secretary Jakes Gerwel said yesterday.<BR><P>
LIBYAN DIPLOMAT IN SA <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

Black executives should guard against accepting single non-executive directorships offered as a way of elevating their status, key businessmen have cautioned.  National Empowerment Consortium chairman Mashudu Ramano said there was a misconception that the more directorships one held the more importance it added to one's stature.<BR><P>
INVESTMENT AGENCY GETS R5,6M <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Investment SA, the investment promotion agency formed by the Trade and Industry Department, has received R5,6m for its first year of operation to attract foreign investment.  Chief Executive Rafig Bagus said these funds would be used for special development initiatives to attract foreign direct investment (such as the Maputo Corridor) and cluster studies identifying sectors which needed to attract investment.<BR><P>
MOTORISTS PAYING R140M A YEAR EXTRA BECAUSE OF OIL COMPANIES <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
SAs motorists are paying the domestic off-shore gas exploration group, Mossgas, about R140m a year to make up for the pricing shortfall resulting from the oil industry's refusal to pay Mossgas the prices their members get for their own fuel.<BR><P>
RACISTS WANT TO KICK MANUEL OUT <I>(Sowetan, Jhb.)</I><BR>
White racists are running a campaign - under the guise of markets - to have Finance Minister Trevor Manuel removed from his position, says ANC economic policy adviser Don Mkhwanazi. "The markets are supposed to be colour blind, but in SA the reverse is true. A white finance minister inspires confidence whereas a black one does not," he said.<BR><P>
DECISION BEFORE END OF YEAR ON LOCATION OF PARLIAMENT <I>(Cape Times, Cape Town)</I><BR>
A decision on the location of SA's Parliament will be made before the end of this year, National Assembly Speaker Frene Ginwala said yesterday.  The ANCs national executive committee would conduct a study and release a discussion document on the matter in the next few months.  This document would form the basis of a discussion on the subject by the ANCs national conference later this year.  Also in the pipeline is the streamlining of co-ordination between government and Parliament, by dropping the position of Leader of the House and replacing it with the Leader of Government Business. <BR><P>
GREEN GROUP MAY TAKE STATE TO COURT <I>(Cape Times)</I><BR>
The government has been threatened with court action unless it withdraws new environmental law proposals which have been described as "big-business friendly".<BR><P>

Robert Schormann, a Pretoria entrepreneur who runs a company whimsically entitled Megabucks Marketing, has issued a new "banknote" that is sure not to lose any of its value in these inflationary times.

Just a few years ago, JCI's HJ Joel gold mine in the Free State was on the point of closure after a series of bad decisions on exploiting the mine's reserves.

incidence of reported rape in the world.<br>
</p>

<p>RIGHTS ACTIVISTS REJECT OMAR&#146;S NO-BAIL PLAN <i>(Cape
Times, Cape Town)</i><br>
The way in which magistrates apply legislation governing bail -
and not the law itself - has come under fire as the row over easy
and cheap bail escalates. This emerged after Justice Minister
Dullah Omar yesterday said he intended lobbying political parties
for support on drastic legislation to compel courts to refuse
bail in all serious crime cases. The proposed new law would
require a change to the Bill of Rights.<br>
<b><i>... and ...</i></b><br>
PRESUMED INNOCENT <i>(Business Day Editorial Comment)</i><br>
Justice Minister Dullah Omar has been overhasty in promising to
change the law so that bail will be refused for people accused of
serious crimes. In an emotional response to two particularly
distressing double rapes in Johannesburg, he said he would get
the law tightened up even if this meant changing the bill of
rights in the new constitution. Omar seems to have overlooked the
consequences of such an action on the law's essential function in
protecting the innocent, whether this refers to a possible victim or
a falsely accused person. The right to bail is entrenched in the
new constitution, and there is now a stronger onus on the police
to show why bail should be denied, and this is as it should be.<br>
</p>

<p>BLACK-OWNED FIRMS GROWING <i>(Business Day)</i><br>

and Industry Department official said yesterday.<br>

Settlements (BIS), the central banks' central bank.<br>
</p>

SA MUST GEAR ITSELF FOR WINDS OF CHANCE <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The amber lights are flashing for government's macro-economic strategy.  Fairly or otherwise, the markets continue to reflect scepticism which, to some extent, is echoed by the local business community.  The fact that it was necessary to raise the Bank rate again at the tail end of the economic upturn speaks volumes about the negative perceptions of financial markets about implementation of the Growth, Employment and Redistribution strategy and macro-economic policy generally.<BR><P>

1997 THE YEAR TO BITE THE BULLET <I>(F&T Weekly, 10 Jan. 1997)</I><BR>
It seems that employers and unionists alike would be well advised to make the most of the festive season. The 1997 return-to-work may herald one of the toughest years they will face since the chaotic mid-Eighties. Employment levels in the formal sector have declined for six successive years and - in the face of an<I> <B>accelerating </B>economic <B>slowdown </B>[my italics!! - Ed.]</I>, rising inflation and wage costs, punitive interest rates and a weak currency - the level of employment is bound to decline at an even faster rate in 1997. This, in turn, is likely to make retrenchment issues a key focus of the collective bargaining debate in many companies this year, a topic unlikely to dilute the adversarial nature of industrial relations interaction.<BR><P>
PESSIMISM ON SAS ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE <I>(Sowetan, Jhb.)</I><BR>
The nominal economic growth experienced at the end of 1995 and the beginning of 1996 is unlikely to be repeated this year, economists agree. Contrary to what they predicted at the beginning of 1996 - real growth rates of four to five percent for 1996, a fall in interest rates and a strong currency - economists are pessimistic about prospects in 1997.<BR><P>
SA WARNED OF PITFALLS <I>(Sowetan)</I><BR>
If SA wants to improve its economy and realise its social upliftment programmes, free enterprise is the answer. This is the advice of former German federal minister of economics, Count Otto Lambsdorff. Lambsdorff said an economic system based on a social partnership between government, labour and business would not only be detrimental to the economy, but to the unemployed as well. Lambsdorff said the idea of a social partnership was good in principle, but was full of problems in reality. "The idea of underlying conditions set by the state for the process of negotiating wages is full of snags," he told a business breakfast in Johannesburg last week.<BR><P>
EDUCATION APPOINTMENTS: QUALIFICATIONS COUNT LITTLE <I>(Beeld, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Qualifications are going to count for less and less in appointments in the Department of Education. This is as a result of concept policy for a more representative personnel corps which, in practice, will make it impossible for whites to be appointed in the Department in the coming two years. They will also not be promoted easily.<BR><P>
GROWTH RATE OF 2,19% EXPECTED <I>(Beeld)</I><BR>
Economists taking part in <I>Beelds </I>Economist of the Year competition agree in their consensus projections that SA achieved a 3% growth rate last year. The actual growth rate will only be announced later this year. A growth rate of 3% would be considerably better than the slightly more than 2% economists expect for this year.<BR><P>
JORDAN UNDER FIRE FOR STATEMENT <I>(Beeld)</I><BR>
CAPE TOWN - The racist remarks about white investors made by Pallo Jordan, Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, were strongly rejected by chambers of commerce on Friday. According to an SABC radio report Jordan said during the ANCs 85th anniversary that most investors were white and unwilling to support the government with projects to create employment. <BR><P>

LONDON - Gold seems set for further punishment in 1997 after a price slide of 3,3% in the first few trading days, bullion analysts say.  Investors and consumers dont want to touch it.

Diagonal Street's gold share bloodbath of the past 10 days has been indiscriminate, with sellers unaccountably hitting the high graders as hard as the marginals.

MORE SA MINES TURN MARGINAL AS GOLD SLUMPS <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>
Bullion's tumble to three-and-a-quarter year lows has increased the number of marginal mines operating in SA and dampened the outlook for gold shares this year, industry analysts said on Tuesday.  But, although the gold price was seen sliding further, most mines were not expected to trim production in 1997 as a weak rand was cushioning them from the full effect of the slump in dollar terms.  Roger Baxter, senior economist at the Chamber of Mines, said marginal mines, those with a working profit to working revenue ratio of less than 7%, had risen to nine from six during the third quarter.<BR><P>
SA MINERALS BUREAU SEES GOLD AT $415 IN 2001 <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>

A road traffic management strategy, which proposes on-the-road courts, a points demerit system for repeat offenders, improved breathalyser tests and the issuing of traffic safety aids was released by Transport Minister Mac Maharaj in Pretoria yesterday.<BR><P>
FURTHER DROPS IN GOLD PRICE COULD PUT SHARES UNDER PRESSURE <I>(Sake-Beeld, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Most South African gold mines are still profitable against the current lower gold price because, despite the lower gold price, they still earn a reasonable rand-price for their gold, but the industry is faced with serious difficulties should the gold price experience further drops. Analysts say this means the price of gold shares could come under increased pressure if the gold price does not stabilise soon.<BR><P>
TOWNSHIP GROUPS HIT BACK AT CRIME <I>(Cape Times, Cape Town)</I><BR>
Vigilante South African street committees are turning away from taking the law into their own hands - and have formed neighbourhood watches that conduct special crime-prevention operations with police.

Manuel raised eyebrows last year with statements - which commentators described as "naive" - about international markets, and which lead to questions being raised about his competence to occupy the post. - Ed.]</I><BR><P>

If 1996 was the year the honeymoon ended and market cynicism sent the currency crashing, forcing government to take the tough policy choices required to restructure the economy, 1997 must be the year of consolidation and implementation.

1997 LIKELY TO PROVE WATERSHED YEAR FOR ECONOMY <I>(The Star, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Much scope for debate exists as to whether or not SAs economic transformation has kept pace with the countrys political transformation. The trends of the two cornerstones destined to determine the nations future are evolving rapidly (though some say not rapidly enough), with 1997 slated to be a watershed year for development of the economic front. Looming crucial issues, hopefully capable of resolution during the course of the year, are the abolition of foreign exchange controls, significant moves in the privatisation arena, a national Budget which signals real (inflation-adjusted) cuts in government spending and $2-billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. Even should all this materialise, economic growth seems unlikely to match the 3% expected for 1996, in spite of predictions of a stronger intentional economy. Consumers face a tough 12 months as the economy stalls in the face of high interest rates, a chronically weak currency, rising inflation, foreign competition, intransigent labour, a manufacturing sector which has not followed through on 1995' buoyancy and the continuing inadequacy of RDP (Reconstruction and Development Programme) delivery.<BR><P>

MANDELA PROMISES FASTER RATE OF DEVELOPMENT <I>(The Star, Jhb.)</I><BR>
President Mandela has expressed satisfaction with progress made by the government since 1994 and has pledged that more emphasis will be put on speeding up implementation of development programmes. In an optimistic New Years message - in stark contrast to that of National Party leader F W de Klerk - Mandela said solid foundations for reconstruction and development had been laid, and hailed the signing in to law of the new constitution and other events as milestones in 1996. However, De Klerk said the ANC/SA Communist Party/Congress of SA Trade Unions alliance had, by "their rejection of a consensus model for the new constitution", assumed the responsibility of governing SA on its own. "The alliance has subsequently failed in all areas. The distressing development with regard to education, the ongoing erosion of health services, the failure of the Reconstruction and Development Programme, the bungling of foreign affaiars and, above all, the surging crime wave are some of the most glaring examples of the failure of the governing party. The impression of a ship drifting downstream, apparently rudderless, is constantly compounded. In short, the ANC displays a lack of vision for the country and for itself, and it is in the grip of an identity7 crisis which is harming the country."<BR><P>
BUSINESS WITH EUROPE IS BOOMING <I>(The Star)</I><BR>
The value <I>[to South Africa]</I> of imports from Europe has doubled over the past four years, while trade with Asia is expected to reach record levels this year. Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo says in a review of his departments activities during 1996 the opening up of relations with Europe has had a direct effect on patterns of trade. Trade with Asia has incraesed 30% and it is now the countrys second largest trading bloc.<BR><P>
A BETTER YEAR FOR ALL <I>(The Star Editorial Comment)</I><BR>
The New Year stretches ahead of SA replete with both danger and opportunity. What are the nations priorities, its resolutions , its hopes and its fears at the start of 1997? Two-and-a-half years into democracy, SA faces much the same tasks as before: to maintain political stability, economic growth and development in the full sense of the word.<BR><P>
THE WEAK SHAL INHERIT BONDAGE<BR>
by Colin Douglas, parliamentary affairs manager of the SA Institute of Race Relations <I>(The Star)</I><BR>
President Nelson Mandelas government might be showing signs of authoritarianism, but it is exercising remarkable restraint, given a society so complacent even Mother Theresa would be tempted to tyranny if she were in charge. SAs main problem is not its government. The problem is civil society that, with few exceptions, is so warty of engaging in open criticism, so devoid of vision and so desperate not to be different that often it may as well roll over and play dead.<BR><P>
GLOBAL TRADE PORTENTS LOOKING GOOD<BR>
by Garth le Pere, executive director of the Foundation for Global Dialogue <I>(The Star)</I><BR>
The conclusion of the Singapore meeting of the World Trade Organisation and its 120 members trade ministers provides an opportune moment to reflect on the challenges of liberalising global trade. There is great optimism about international economic integration through freedom of trade and open markets. Perhaps not for a century have political ideas and economic trends come together in happy coincidence. <BR><P>

HERE FOLLOWS A SUMMARY OF HOW THE MAJOR NEWSPAPERS REPORTED THESE DEVELOPMENTS TODAY ...</I></B><BR><P>
MANUEL TAKES UP FINANCE POST <I>(Business Day, Jhb)</I><BR>
Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg resigned yesterday, sparking the scrapping of the Reconstruction and Development Programme department and a host of other changes which will consolidate the African National Congress power in the government of national unity.<BR><P>
MIXED RESPONSE TO CABINET CHANGES <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The appointment of a new Finance Minister and the accompanying Cabinet reshuffle drew a mixed reaction from business last night.  Anglo American said it had confidence in Trevor Manuel as Finance Minister and Alec Erwin as Trade and Industry Minister, but the SA Chamber of Business warned that Finance Minister Chris Liebenbergs departure came at an unfortunate time.<BR><P>
SHOCK WAVES OVER LIEBENBERG<I> (Beeld, Jhb)</I><BR>
Pres. Nelson Mandela yesterday caused a surprise with his first far-reaching Cabinet reshuffle, after the unexpected resignation of Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg.  The financial markets fell sharply when the news of Liebenberg's resignation leaked out.  He is being replaced by Trade and Industry Minister Trevor Manuel, the first ANC incumbent of this key position.<BR><P>
FINANCIAL MARKETS RESPOND VERY NEGATIVELY TO MANUEL <I>(Beeld)</I><BR>
The financial markets responded extremely negatively after the news of Trevor Manuel being appointed Finance Minister leaked out.  Reuters sent out an incorrect report yesterday afternoon that Alec Erwin, not Manuel, had been given the post.  The markets then immediately firmed.  Manuel and Erwin found this amusing when they heard about it at a news conference last night.<BR><P>
LIEBENBERG'S RESIGNATION PUTS PRESSURE ON MARKETS<I>(Beeld)</I><BR>
The news of Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg's resignation placed financial markets under pressure yesterday, but there were no signs of a large-scale collapse.<BR><P>
BUSINESSMEN REGRET LIEBENBERG'S RETIREMENT<I>(Beeld)</I><BR>
It was a pity there had to be a change in the Cabinet's finance portfolio so soon again, SA Foundation president Conrad Strauss said in response to the news of Chris Liebenberg's retirement.  The Foundation felt, however, that Trevor Manuel and Gill Marcus identified themselves fully with the Government's fiscal policy.<BR><P>
THE RIGHT TIME TO LEAVE:  LIEBENBERG<I> (The Citizen, Jhb)</I><BR>
"I believe now is the right time for me to leave," Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg said in his farewell speech delivered to the National Assembly yesterday evening.  "I came in here with the view that it should not be long-term," he said.<BR><P>
DEDICATED ERWIN A GOOD BACK-UP MINISTER<I> (Cape Times, Cape Town)</I><BR>
Newly appointed Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin had a long involvement with labour before he became Deputy Finance Minister in May 1994.  Erwin was viewed as a "very good back-up minister" who was completely dedicated to his task, said Ms Jenny Cargill, director of Businessmap SA, a policy information service.<BR><P>
<B><I>... IN OTHER NEWS ...</I></B><BR><P>
INCIDENT-FREE MARCH IN CENTRAL JOBURG <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
A massive security force presence, coupled with a deal between authorities and march organisers, disspelled widespread domestic and international fears of bloodshed and led to a largely incident-free march through central Johannesburg yesterday by about 8 000 Zulus commemorating the 1994 Shell House shootings.<BR><P>
GOVT, LABOUR AND BUSINESS TO TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Government, labour and the private sector will meet today to thrash out a framework for investment in economic and social infrastructure, a move which could see billions mobilised for infrastructure spending.<BR><P>
SAS BALANCE OF TRADE IN R1,27BN SWING TO BLACK <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
South Africas trade balance swung R1,27bn into the black last month, following heavy diamond exports and a sharp drop in key imports.<BR><P>
MORE WORKING DAYS LOST IN FIRST QUARTER <I>(Beeld)</I><BR>
About 175 000 working days were lost in the first quarter of 1996 as a result of strikes, according to labour consultants Andrew Levy & Associates.  This is approximately three times more than in the first quarter of last year.  The National Union of Mineworkers was responsible for 28% of the working days lost.<BR><P>
NUM LASHES OUT OVER LAYOFFS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The National Union of Mineworkers has reacted strongly to the retrenchment of 1 800 workers in Gengolds Winkelhaak gold mine near Evander.<BR><P>
STRIKES COST SOUTH AFRICA 1,6-MILLION WORKING HOURS<I>(Beeld)</I><BR>
A total of 1,6-million working hours was lost as a result of strikes last year, compared with the average of 3,6-million working hours per year for the previous four years, Labour Minister Tito Mboweni said in reply to a question in the National Assembly.<BR><P>
ANALYSTS SAY JOEL WILL NOT PAY DIVIDENDS UNTIL 2001<I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
JCIs gold mine, HJ Joel would withhold dividends until 2001 when the brunt of its capital expenditure programme was over, analysts said yesterday.<BR><P>
NEW LEASE ON LIFE <I>(Citizen)</I><BR>

UNBUNDLING NO LONGER A DIRTY WORD  <I> (Beeld) </I><BR>
Unbundling, once a politically sensitive subject not taken up lightly in the corridors of monolithic South African corporations, soon abandoned its political mantle as shareholders exerted pressure to loosen the iron grip of a small number of giants.  Among the large mining houses, Gold Fields is the following possible candidate for unbundling.<BR><P>
ASS. MANGANESE DISTRIBUTES INTERIM DIVIDEND OF 250c <I> (Beeld) </I><BR>

The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) intends proposing that undertakings should be forced to spend 4% of their "profit" on the training of workers.  The proposal will be contained in Cosatu's own growth report, to be issued next week, in reply to the SA Foundation's recent growth proposals.<BR><P>
BE CAUTIOUS OF DIAMONDS AS INVESTMENTS<I> (Finansies & Tegniek)</I><BR>
There is often a great temptation to invest in diamonds or other tangible assets, but these are not investments in the true sense of the word - they should rather be regarded as collector's items, and as such require expert knowledge to ensure a satisfactory return.  One who wishes to invest in a tangible asset would be better advised to put his money into gold.<BR><P>
NO HIGHER PRICES FOR INGWE<I> (Finansies & Tegniek)</I><BR>
The view that the peak of the coal sector's cycle on the stock exchange has passed received confirmation this week by the news that Japanese buyers had refused to increase contract prices, and in fact tried to negotiate lower prices.  Local producers had been hoping for an increase of about 4%.  Ingwe Coal MD David Murray feels, however, that too much should not be read into the group's failure to negotiate higher prices.<BR><P>

	The job losses are part of a larger downsizing plan, CE Tom Main tells us."The chamber will continue to adapt its organisational structure. This is the only way the chamber will be able to satisfy its members requirements in a dynamically changing national environment."<BR><P>

COSATU GEARED FOR NATION-WIDE PROTEST <I>(Business Day, Jhb)</I><BR>
Cosatu members country-wide take to the streets today in support of labour's demand for the exclusion of the lockout clause from the final constitution - amid uncertainty regarding the outcome of NP-ANC negotiations.<I>[See also <A HREF="http://www.bullion.org.za/releases/worksame.htm">media release from the Chamber of Mines]</A></I><BR><P>
ANC, COSATU AT ODDS OVER WORKER LOCK-OUT RIGHT<I> (Beeld, Jhb)</I><BR>
Cosatu and the African National Congress were at odds yesterday over employers' constitutional right to lock out striking workers, following a draft agreement between the ANC and the NP recognising employers' internationally accepted rights.  Cosatu general-secretary Sam Shilowa said yesterday they would accept no compromise or reformulation of the lock-out right, it had to scrapped from the constitution.<BR><P>
IS COSATU OR THE ANC GOVERNING SA, FW ASKS <I>(Beeld)</I><BR>
The question should be asked whether Cosatu or the ANC is governing South Africa, because the ANC still listens to everything Cosatu says, deputy president F W de Klerk said yesterday.  He added that the NP had done nothing to contribute to the fall of the rand, but its weak performance was brought about by mistakes on the part of the ANC and its allies.<BR><P>
MORE STRIKES POSSIBLE - COSATU BOSS<I> (Cape Times, Cape Town)</I><BR>
Brushing aside Democratic Party claims that todays strike is illegal, the Congress of South African Trade Unions vowed to continue with its plans to protest against a proposed lockout clause in the new constitution. Todays planned action was endorsed yesterday by ANC MP Mr Cameron Dugmore and SA Communist Party member Mr Phillip Dexter, an ANC MP.<BR><P>
THE STRIKE <I>(Editorial Comment, The Citizen,Jhb)</I><BR>
Cosatu is going ahead with its nation-wide strike today, which will cost the country millions in manhours lost.  With tomorrow's public holiday, the effect on productivity will be doubly bad. Even if the strike is the exercise of workers' rights, we cannot accept the fact that it is being held to blackmail the Constitutional Assembly to meet Cosatu's wishes.<BR><P>
WITH NO APOLOGIES<BR>  
by Zwelinzima Vavi, Cosatu's assistant general-secretary <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
"While millions of people support today's Cosatu-led stay-away, others have voiced outrage.  Cosatu has been accused of "bullyboy" tactics and attempting to ride roughshod over the consensus-seeking style which has characterised the constitutional negotiations. The strike is also claimed to have caused the value of the rand to plummet and to have put off potential investors. Cosatu rejects these spurious attacks and defends the legitimacy of the stayaway."<BR><P>

HIGHER INTEREST STABILISES RAND <I>(Beeld)</I><BR>
The rand recovered initially yesterday after the increase in the bank rate over the weekend, but later fell back somewhat again.  Johannesburg Stock Exchange investors had to pay a high price, however, because share prices fell sharply in response to the bank rate increase.<BR><P>
NEW LABOUR LAW NO LONGER IN OPERATION TOMORROW <I>(Beeld)</I><BR>
The Labour Relations Act, which was supposed to come into operation tomorrow, will now probably only come fully into operation by August because the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration has not been formed yet.  The success of this very sensitive piece of legislation will depend to a large extent on the effectiveness of this commission.<BR><P>

CONSTITUTION ACCORD FAILS TO AVERT STRIKE<I> (Cape Times, Cape Town)</I><BR>
The African National Congress and National Party yesterday agreed in principle on three of the four main outstanding constitutional issues, including a formulation on a lock-out clause in the final constitution, but unionists insist tomorrows national strike is still on.<BR><P>
WHY COSATU REALLY WANTS TO STRIKE <I>(Finansies & Tegniek, weekly 26/4/96)</I><BR>
The Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) apparently intends having the lock-out provision amended out of the new Labour Relations Act next year, and that is why they are striking against it being included as a right in the constitution.<BR><P>
ECONOMY POISED ON A KNIFE-EDGE<I> (Business Day, Jhb)</I><BR>
The economy is poised on a knife-edge, with another plunge in the rand likely to destroy economic growth and jobs while fuelling inflation.  However, if calm returns to the market, SA will be able to avoid paying a massive price for the depreciation.  Economic growth will remain positive and inflation will probably stay in single digits if the currency stabilises.<BR><P>
POLITICS BEHIND RAND'S MOST RECENT FALL, ECONOMISTS<I> (Business Report, Jhb)</I><BR>
A snap survey of economists on Friday confirmed that politics was the main culprit behind the rand's most recent setback when it dropped to a record low of R4,58 early on Friday.<BR><P>

LONRHO MERGER A 'QUANTUM LEAP' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Impala Platinum believed its merger with Lonrho's platinum interests represented a quantum leap for the company, but it was not vital to its future success.<BR><P>
RANDGOLD WANTS TO SPREAD WINGS <I>(Finansies & Tegniek)</I><BR>
It was striking with what confidence Randgold's top management presented the quarterly reports of the group's four gold mines this week, as well as the half-yearly report.  And indeed the central message of this group, which was nearly down and out 2½ years ago, is that it is now on the takeover path.<BR>
<B><I>... and Business Day reports today ...</I></B><BR>
RANDGOLD MOVES TO ACQUIRE MINES<BR>
Randgold's expansion plans moved up a gear at the weekend as the mining house announced talks to buy two listed marginal gold mines worth nearly R85m.

ECONOMISTS: ROSY INFLATION IN MARCH, COULD WITHER IN APRIL<I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
While the rest of the world is writing inflation's obituary, SA is girding its loins for a new attack. But last month's figures, due for release today, will not yet provide evidence of the assault on the rand.<BR><P>
EDITORIAL COMMENT <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
The rise in interest rates announced by Chris Stals, the Reserve Bank governor, late on Friday night is an admission of defeat for a government that has lost its way in economic policy.  It would make sense only as a precursor to an imminent lifting of exchange controls.<BR><P>

MINING INDUSTRY COULD FACE BILLIONS IN PAY-OUTS OVER OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE <I>(Saturday Star)</I><BR>
Hundreds of thousands of ex-miners could be suffering from occupational disease, and compensation payable in terms of the law could run into several billion rands.  This disturbing evidence of the high burden of mining-related disease in SA rural areas has emerged from a recent scientific study in the former Transkei.<I>[The Sunday Independent ran a similar story yesterday, and todays daily Star runs the first of three feature articles on the Epidemiological Research Units study in the Libode district in Transkei - Ed.)</I><BR><P>
SA RATE HIKE SEEN SPUR TO GOLD HEDGING <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>
SA gold producers were holding back from locking in a higher rand gold price, believing a likely rise in interest rates could offer a more attractive contango, analysts said on Friday.<BR><P>

CONCERN OVER LABOUR LAWS<I> (Finansies & Tegniek)</I><BR>
Evidence before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour has revealed that there is considerable concern among employers over the way labour legislation is being dealt with, among other things because the Labour Market Commission has not yet commented on important legislation now being formulated.<BR><P>
ANGLO WANTS TO RULE THE ROOST <I>(Finansies & Tegniek)</I><BR>
Anglo American's recent moves around the Lonrho group are considered by informed sources as only the beginning of a strategy which will eventually ensure the South African giant the role of undisputed leader of mining in Africa.<BR><P>
THINGS LOOKING BRIGHT - DE BEERS  <I>(Finansies & Tegniek)</I><BR>

FOR EUROPEANS VIOLENCE, CRIME A PROBLEM<I> (Rapport, Sunday)</I><BR>
Poor labour relations, low productivity and the continuing wave of violence and crime have brought South Africa down in a recent survey by the Investor Responsibility Research Centre, in which it was found that Europeans in particular are uncertain about South Africa.<BR><P>

ALLAY FEARS OF INVESTORS - SEXWALE <I>(The Citizen, Jhb)</I><BR>
The labour movement had a right to strike, but it was necessary to allay foreign investors' fears of an unstable labour force, Gauteng Premier Tokyo Sexwale said in Midrand yesterday.<BR><P>
MANDELA'S REASSURANCES DON'T HELP, RAND FALLS <I>(Beeld, Jhb)</I><BR>
An attempt by President Nelson Mandela to reassure the exchange markets did not prevent the rand falling dramatically to new lows yesterday.  The main reason for the fall is the Congress of South African Trade Unions' (Cosatu) planned strike on Tuesday, which is causing concern among foreign investors.<BR><P>
TEMPORARY WORKERS CAN HELP<I>(Beeld)</I><BR>
The Confederation of Employers of South Africa has arranged with labour agencies for more than 100 000 temporary workers to be available during Cosatu's planned strike next week to help businessmen and industrialists continue with production.<BR><P>
COSATU'S REACTION TO THE RAND IS NAÏVE <I>(Beeld)</I><BR>
According to a statement yesterday, Cosatu says the weakening of the rand is a propaganda move by business to hit out at the labour movement.  It is tragic that an organisation with so much influence can issue such a naïve statement, commentator Curt von Keyserlingk writes.<BR><P>
ANC CLINGING TO COSATU SKIRTS<I> (BD pg 10 - by Thami Mazwai, editor of Enterprise, a business magazine aimed at black business)</I><BR>
Can somebody out there please inform the ANC that it is the political party in power? It cannot endorse mass action <I>(by Cosatu</I>) as it did when it was still operating from the bush. Governments do not do this. It is like passing a motion of no confidence in itself.<BR>

The rand plunged almost 4 percent to a record low of R4,4375 against the dollar yesterday amid concern about the governments support of international pariah states like Libya and as the dollar strengthened globally.<BR><P>
MINES' INCOME UP 3,5% TO R5,8bn <I>(Beeld, Jhb)</I><BR>
Gold mine managements must start accepting the reality of the new political dispensation, and not put the blame on labour, politics and public holidays for bad performances.  This is the opinion of brokers approached by <I>Beeld </I>for their opinions on the major mining groups' reports for the quarter to 31 March.<BR><P>
GOLD TRADERS UNIMPRESSED BY RALLY <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>
NEW YORK - Gold prices rallied strongly Thursday, giving gold bugs their first good news in weeks as investors and traders who had bet on a continued slide in prices were forced to cover their short positions.<BR><P>
RAND CAN FALL FURTHER<I>(Beeld, Jhb)</I><BR>
The rand exchange rate, which yesterday virtually went into free fall to its lowest level ever, is expected to continue its downward trend today, although perhaps not at the same rate.  Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said  the markets may leave him no choice but to increase interest rates to support the unit.<BR><P>
GOLD SHARES ASSISTED, CAPITAL MARKET HIT <I>(Beeld, Jhb)</I><BR>
The sharp fall in the value of the rand gave the  Johannesburg Stock Exchange share prices a massive boost yesterday, however capital market investors suffered heavy losses.  Gold shares in particular benefited, and the rand gold price rose to a new record R1 746 per fine ounce.<BR><P>
MANUEL MAY HAVE TO WAIT TO PROVE HIS CRITICS WRONG<I> (Business Report)</I><BR>

ANC FORMALLY PROPOSES LOCKOUT CLAUSE BE KEPT OUT OF CONSTITUTION
<I>(Business Day, Jhb)</I><BR>
The African National Congress yesterday formally proposed exclusion of a clause in the constitution giving employers the right to lock out striking workers.<BR><P>
COSATU WARNS ON LOCK-OUT CLAUSE<I> (Sowetan, Jhb)</I><BR>
The Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) has given constitutional negotiators five days to drop the controversial lock-out clause from the final constitution before it goes ahead with a general strike next Tuesday.  "There could be no compromise,"  its general-secretary Sam Shilowa said yesterday.<BR><P>
ISSUES WILL BE RESOLVED IN TIME TO AVERT STRIKE<I> (Cape Times, Cape Town)</I><BR>
Cosatu general-secretary Sam Shilowa says he is willing to discuss calling off Tuesdays general strike if his organisations demands are met.<BR><P>
CALL FOR LOCKOUT AFTER COSATU STRIKE<I> (Business Day)</I><BR>
A Pretoria company, Silk & Textile Industries, has called on other companies to join it in a planned lockout of Cosatu-affiliated union members on May 3.<BR><P>
COSATU WARNS WORRIED INVESTORS ABOUT FURTHER STEPS<I> (Beeld, Jhb)</I><BR>
Investors who are worried about Cosatu's country-wide strike and protest action planned for next Tuesday should also be worried about what Cosatu is planning after this, its general-secretary Sam Shilowa said yesterday.<BR><P>
MUSCLE-FLEXING, AGAIN <I>(Financial Mail - weekly 26/4/96)</I><BR>
The rights to strike and to lock out are generally accepted as creating a fair balance and mutuality in industrial conflicts. If the right to lock out is dropped and the right to strike entrenched, it will put off the growing number of foreign and local businesses which already view the new Labour Relations Act as too union-friendly and a bar to investment. (Cosatus strike called for late last year) achieved nothing.

STORM AROUND THE RAND <I>(Finansies & Tegniek, 19/4/1996)</I><BR>

    JOHANNESBURG April 18 SOUTH AFRICAN PRESS ASSOC.<BR>
   JUDGE SAYS VAAL REEFS SHOULD BE CHARGED FOR MINING DISASTER<BR>
   An inquest and inquiry into a disater at Vaal Reefs gold mine which
killed 104 people last year on Thursday recommended the mining company
be prosecuted for culpable homicide.<BR>
   Justice Ramon Leon who headed the inquiry and joint inquest into
the disaster in No 2 Shaft near Orkney on May 10 last year also found
acts and/or ommissions by five employees amounted to culpable homicide.<BR>
   Delivering his report in Johannesburg, Leon said the Vaal Reefs
Exploration and Mining Company was liable for prosecution for culpable
homicide.<BR>
   He said the mine manager at the time, I K Muir, had been negligent
in his duties but this did not amount to culpable homicide.<BR>
   Soon after the report was delivered National Union of Mineworkers
president James Motlatsi said Leon's judgment was straightforward and
had clearly found the mine guilty.<BR>
   He said the mineworkers named in the report as being liable for
prosecution for culpable homicide had been following instructions.<BR>
   "In the mining industry the worker has to follow instructions at
all times even if there is danger ...," he said. "He has no option but
to report the faults at a later stage.<BR>
   "We are going to wait for the outcome of the criminal charge
against the company and we will then lodge a civil case where the
families of victims will be included."<BR>
   Motlatsi said he hoped by court action to obtain more compensation
for the families of the deceased.<BR>
   In a report in terms of the Minerals Act released at the same time
as the Leon report, the chief regional mining engineer for the Free
State region, A J McKenzie, said the five workers operating a
locomotive on the day of the accident were responsible for culpable
homicide.<BR>
   The 104 miners were killed when the locomotive was sent driverless
down the shaft, crushing a cage lift carrying the miners to their work
stations.<BR>
   McKenzie, who was an assessor in the Leon inquiry, said Vaal Reefs
were liable for prosecution for culpable homicide.<BR>
   Leon named the five as Ndwandwe Frank Khoza, Victor Cako, Mlindeli
Quluba, Hendrik Jacobus Wood Sr and Marthinus Wessel Jansen van
Rensburg. He found they had contravened Minerals Act regulations.<BR>
   Leon described the disaster as "a dreadful accident" resulting in
"terrible deaths."<BR>
   In a summary of the events on the day of the accident he said a man
carriage and a locomotive had passed through a prohibited area on 56
level and plunged down No 2 shaft. At the same time a cage carrying 104
workers had been travelling down the shaft.<BR>
   "The man carrriage and the locomotive fell down, striking steelwork
in the shaft, both vehicles breaking into several parts."<BR>
   He said some parts had collided with the cage, detaching it from
its cables and causing it to fall to the bottom of the shaft.<BR>
   Dealing with the cause of the accident the Leon report said it
could not be attributed to a single cause but a series of events caused
by negligence.<BR>
   These included;<BR>
   -- The locomotive had been standing in a prohibited area;<BR>
   -- The locomotive's electic circuit had been damaged to such an
extent that it would run away at the slightest touch;<BR>
   -- The driver had continued to operate the locomotive despite it
being defective;<BR>
   -- No inspections had been made of the locomotive before use; and<BR>
   -- The absence of an adequate safety device to prevent the
locomotive entering the shaft.<BR>
   The report said there were also many indirect causes that had
contributed to the accident. These were;<BR>
   -- Failure to comply with the procedures for the parking of
locomotives;<BR>
   -- The poor condition of the electrical components of the
locomotive;<BR>
   -- Failure to monitor the maintenance of electrical connections;
and<BR>
   -- The need for better communication between staff and the clearer
demarcation of duties.<BR>
   Leon said in his report there appeared to be a perception among
miners they should accept the industry was inherently dangerous. He
said even senior managers had put forward this argument.<BR>
   "The evidence, however, suggests that his perspection is erroneous.
The accident of 10 May 1995 was not caused by inherent problems such as
the instability in the rock mass but by poor practice and controls."<BR>
   He said it was possible to improve the situation through active
intervention.<BR>
   A similar accident had ocurred in 1992. A locomotive had fallen
down a shaft but not caused any deaths. This should have alerted the
relevant officials of the possibility of a recurrence.<BR>
   "No proper steps were taken to install an adequate safety device
which would have prevented this accident."<BR>
   Steps had ultimately been taken, but in a "leisurely fashion".<BR>
   The report will be submitted to the attorney-general for his
decisions on the prosecution of the mine and the employees named in the
findings.<BR><P><P>
   
   OFFICIALS TRIED TO HIDE EVIDENCE ABOUT MINE DISASTER<BR>
   Soon after a locomotive plunged down a mine shaft killing 104
people a group of mine officials met at a midnight meeting to try to
conceal evidence about the dangerous condition of the locomotive, it
was revealed in a report on the disaster released on Thursday.<BR>
   The report is the result of a joint inquest and inquiry into the
disaster at Vaal Reefs gold mine on May 10 last year, headed by Justice
Ramon Leon.<BR>
   The report said that shortly aftr the accident electrician Nwandwe
Khoza had told a a group of mine officials the locomotive had been in
poor working order.<BR>
   At a midnight meeting the officials conspired to withhold the
information about the poor condition of electrical circuits on the
locomotive.<BR>
   "Those gentlemen concealed this information from senior management,
the police and from officials of the Department of Mineral and Energy
Affairs," the report said.<BR>
   "While such conduct was undoubtedly reprehensible, it does not show
any that of those present, save for Khoza, had knowledge of this before
the accident."<BR>
   Leon recommended in the report that Khoza be charged with culpable
homicide.<BR>
   He said the locomotive had been in a highly dangerous state at the
time of the accident as a result of Khoza's actions. He had known the
locomotive's electrical circuits were "bridged out" and it would run
away at the slightest touch of the control lever.<BR>
   "He knew it was highly dangerous but sent this potentially lethal
instrument back into the work place ... .<BR>
   "Such a person would appreciate that that the locomotive could well
behave in a highly dangerous, erratic and uncontrollable fashion and
would therefore see the possibility of death."<BR><P><P>

MANUEL TAKES STEPS TO TRY TO SALVAGE RAND<I>(Business Day, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Economic policy-makers launched a major damage control exercise yesterday as the bottom fell out of the rand.  The currency nose-dived from its opening level of R4,02 to the dollar to its worst close on record of R4,14 amid talk that a major US investment bank had taken a massive speculative position against it.  A huge import order for dollars was also still affecting the market yesterday, spurring other importers to scramble for cover and adding to the panic.<BR><P>

MEDIA SHOULD AID IN CHANGE<I> (Cape Times)</I><BR>

Cosatu (SA's biggest labour federation, the Congress of SA Trade Unions) affiliates appear divided on the establishment of union-controlled investment companies, especially because such companies have been bidding for radio stations and this could undermine the broad opposition of labour to privatisation.<BR><P>

RAND 11,5% UNDERVALUED, SAY US BANK <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

MARKET MAKERS <I>(Business Day Editorial Comment)</I><BR>

SUNTER: SA FACES PLAGUES, ECONOMIC HARDSHIP, WARLORDS (Cape Times)

AIRLINES TO RESIST HIGH FUEL PRICES <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

<B>THE ECONOMIC WEEK AHEAD: </B><I>(Business Report, Jhb)</I><BR>
CAPITAL & MONEY MARKETS ARE AT MERCY OF RAND<BR>
The attention of capital- and money-market participants this week will be focused on the foreign-exchange market, where the rand will fight for its life against speculation and importers scrambling for cover.

SA faces huge tasks, most notably where the economy and crime are concerned, if it is to emerge as one of the world's successful nations.  It would be foolish to underplay them.

FACING UP TO DECLINING RAND <I>(The Star, Jhb., Editorial Comment)</I><BR>
The punches can no longer be pulled. SA now faces a straight choice - it either takes a strong stand against militant labour unions or faces the bleak prospect of a chronically weak currency. Economists ascribe the rands slide to several factors, among them labour opposition to governments macro-economic policy; recurring rumours that Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals plans to resign; and slow progress on privatisation and the removal of exchange controls. <I>[Despite President Mandelas reassurances regarding Stals post]</I> At the end of the day, however, there is little room for argument that the major reason foreigners are selling rands is disillusionment with a nation which displays a marked unwillingness to work for its living. This goes hand in hand with their doubt about the governments ability to deliver effective economic management. The government must contain the strike epidemic from which the country is suffering.<BR><P>

The R10m budget allocation to the Public Enterprises Department for advice from privatisation consultants would probably be insufficient in the long term and the Cabinet would be approached for an increase after all, a Departmental source said at the weekend.<BR><P>
DEVELOPING NATIONS DECIDE ON NEW ATTITUDE TO G-7 <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
WASHINGTON - The G-24 group of developing countries decided at the weekend to drop its traditionally confrontational attitude towards the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations.

SA NEEDS TO WEIGH OPTIONS CAREFULLY BETWEEN CHINA AND TAIWAN <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The recent visit by Hsu Li-the, vice-premier of Taiwan, has brought to a head what is for SA a particularly vexing problem.

PSYCHOTIC POLITICIANS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
A British Psychological Society research report says politicians often have "the same personality profiles as criminal psychopaths".

<I>RECENT VIOLENT INCIDENTS ON SOME S.A. MINES ...</I><BR>
SOWETAN EDITORIALCOMMENT <BR>
"What is it about the mines that people from different ethnic groups are kept in separate accommodation?<BR>
 "It was understandable for the apartheid regime to force people from different ethnic backgrounds into different townships and separate bantustans. Mining houses furthered the policy by keeping workers in separate living quarters at the mines and made them work different shifts. <BR>
"We expected that rubbish from people who did not have the interests of the majority of South Africans citizens at heart. 
"Today this is no longer acceptable. It is no longer politically correct. It stinks of apartheid.<BR>
 "Some mining houses integrate their workers and at such mines, there has been little or no ethnic violence. 
"Other mines are guilty of iniquitous acts against humanity for continuing with apartheid. <BR>
"When people are forcibly kept apart and told that they are different, and suspicions are cast on other groups there will be trouble. That trouble has manifested itself many times in the form of violence. <BR>
"This week more than 20 people were killed in clashes between Xhosa-speaking and Sotho-speaking people.<BR> 
"The mining houses that practise apartheid among their workers have to answer to South Africa. There is a lot of blood on their hands as a result of practising apartheid."<BR><P>
<I>[The following letter, under signature of the President of the Chamber, has been sent to Sowetan:</I><BR>
<B>27 September 1996<BR>
The Editor<BR>
Sowetan<BR>
Dear Sir,<BR><P>

The Chamber of Mines of South Africa, representing the bulk of this countrys mining interests, wishes to voice its objection to the ill-informed and unhelpful editorial on "mine violence" published in your edition of Friday, 27 September 1996.<BR><P>

At a time of highly sensitive and charged human relations on our mines, editorial comments such as yours neither contribute towards finding workable solutions to very real problems nor help in building a climate of reconciliation so necessary in our country. It is both naïve and simplistic to suggest, as you do, that so-called segregation of mine hostels is the single cause of the recent deplorable and wholly unacceptable incidents of violence on some mines. This point has been supported by none other than Labour Minister Tito Mboweni. In fact, one of the mines on which violence recently occurred has fully integrated hostels.<BR><P>

A judicial Commission of Inquiry, appointed by President Nelson Mandela and under Judge President of the Labour Court Mr Justice John Myburgh, is currently conducting a serious and intensive investigation into recent violent incidents on three mines. Its findings are due to be made known within a few days. We await the outcome in the belief that it will provide a far better explanation than the superficial and ill-informed one you have put forward.<BR><P>

The Chamber of Mines and all its members unequivocally condemn all incidents of violence, be they on mines or in the broader community. The mining industry has given its uncompromising support to the new South Africa and the democratic principles upon which it is founded. In the present emotionally charged atmosphere your inflammatory and ill-conceived accusations will more likely fan the flames of violence than quell them. They will also more likely exacerbate divisions between people than reconcile them. <BR><P>

Yours sincerely,<BR>
At du Plessis<BR>
President<BR>
Chamber of Mines of South Africa</B><BR><P>

MINE PEACE IS SHATTERED  <I>(The Citizen, Jhb.)</I><BR>
A precarious peace in Stilfontein mine hostels was again shattered on Wednesday night with the killing of another three miners in an ethnic-based conflict. Three more employees of Buffelsfontein Gold Mine were injured in the clash between Xhosa and Sotho workers, while a man who had been severely  slashed in the face during a previous incident died in the intensive care unit at the Tshepong Hospital in Klerksdorp at 5 am yesterday.<BR><P>
NUM PROTEST FANNED MINE VIOLENCE - OFFICIAL <I>(Business Day, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Premature industrial action by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) during wage negotiations played a part in the recent outbreak of violence at Gold Fields'  East Driefontien mine, chief personnel officer Victor Raison said yesterday during an inquiry into mine violence.<BR><P>
FEARS MOUNT OVER MINE INQUIRY  <I>(Mail and Guardian, weekly on Fridays)</I><BR>
In the week when at least 24 mineworkers were slain, fears are mounting that a major judicial inquiry into mine violence will be torpedoed by the absence of the United Workers Union of South Africa (UWUSA) from the proceedings. The commission of inquiry is concentrating on the spate of killings at [three] Goldfields mines in recent months which has left 48 workers dead. The battle, mainly between Uwusa and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), has stripped almost R70-million from Goldfields profits.<BR><P>
WEST RAND CONSOLIDATED MINES <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

MBEKI DODGES THE CRUCIAL QUESTION <I>(Business Report, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, guest speaker at the Numsa fifth conference on Wednesday night, spoke of 350 years of colonialism and how difficult it was to transform an animal which had serviced a white minority.  He spoke of how political emancipation was achieved with President Mandela's inauguration, but not economic equality.  He promised 400 000 new jobs a year within four years.  The applause was courteous, probably two or three claps by two thirds of the audience.  The sound that lingered longest was a statement tagged on to the end of a privatisation question:  "We keep on being told that we are not free.  When are we going to be free?"  Unlike May 10 1994, there was no date forthcoming from Mbeki.<BR><P>
GOLD KNOCKED BY HINT OF IMF SALES <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The rand and the gold price came in for a drubbing yesterday with the currency breaking through the critical R4,5250 level and the metal losing $1,60 on news of <I>[possible]</I> International Monetary Fund gold sales.<BR><P>
IMF GOLD SALE PLANS IRK WORLD'S BIG GOLD PRODUCERS <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>

IMF IS MODESTLY UPBEAT ABOUT SA <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
WASHINGTON - While it is worried about inflation, fiscal imbalances, the weakness of the rand and unemployment, the IMF sounds a modestly upbeat note about SAs short-term economic prospects in the latest release of its semi-annual publication, World Economic Outlook.<BR><P>
STALS, IMF BEG TO DISAGREE <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
In the latest World Economic Outlook publication, the IMF distances itself from central bankers who, like Stals, aim to bring inflation down to zero.  The IMF heaps praise on central bankers who set official inflation targets, something Stals has refused to do.<BR><P>
MANDELA PROMISES TIGHT BAIL CONDITIONS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Legislation to tighten bail conditions would go ahead despite threats by 'idealists' to take the government to the Constitutional Court over the matter, President Mandela said yesterday.<BR><P>
UNIONS MODERATE DEMANDS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

SA-EU TRADE AGREEMENT UNLIKELY BEFORE 1998 <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
SA was unlikely to conclude the proposed free trade agreement with the European Union before 1998, given delays in resuming formal negotiations, Brussels sources said yesterday.<BR><P>
ERWIN TO ADDRESS IDC TO CLARIFY GOVT EXPECTATIONS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin is to meet the board and staff of the Industrial Development Corporation to outline the parastatal's mandate - a move designed to reassert government's control of state-owned enterprises.<BR><P>
WORKERS WEIGHED DOWN BY LEGACY OF COLONIALISM, APARTHEID <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Some are questioning whether the preconditions for corporatist-type decision-making exist in SA.  It is argued labour lacks the capacity to participate effectively in these "social democratic-type institutions".  Furthermore it is argued government and employer associations have not demonstrated political readiness to accept union participation in policy making.<BR><P>
SA TO RECEIVE US DEVELOPMENT AID <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
SA will receive R250m in development aid from the US under a formal agreement to be signed on Monday by Gill Marcus, Deputy Finance Minister, and James Joseph, US Ambassador to SA.  The aid will be used to finance housing, healthcare, education and economic development, among other things.<BR><P>
STEEL LOAN 'ON HOLD' <I>(Business Mail - with Mail & Guardian)</I><BR>
The European Commission has not blocked a $74m loan to the Saldanha Steel project, merely reserved judgement.  The EC has sent the file back to the European Investment Bank for further consideration, says Erwan Fouere, EU's Ambassador to SA. <BR><P>
PRIVATE FINANCE GROWS <I>(Business Mail)</I><BR>
The World Bank's private sector financing organisation approved a record $3,2b in loans for the fiscal year ended June 30, reflecting the increasing emphasis placed by the bank on private sector aid.<BR><P>
POSITIVE PROSPECTS <I>(Business Mail)</I><BR>
Developing countries will post growth of more than 6% this year and next in response to economic recovery in Mexico and Argentina, stronger momentum in Africa and a more sustainable pace in Asia, the IMF said this week.<BR><P>
BRITAIN IS SQUEEZING THIRD WORLD DEBTORS <I>(Business Mail)</I><BR>
Britain is squeezing cash out of the world's poorest countries by demanding levels of debt repayment far outweighing new loans or aid, according to figures published this week.  As representatives of the world's richest creditor nations met in Paris on Monday to discuss initiatives intended to reduce the debt burden on the developing world, aid agencies say the first comprehensive analysis of lender countries undermines the British government's claim to be at the forefront of the campaign to help the world's poor.<BR><P>
DONT LEAVE SA, URGES MANDELA  <I>(Citizen)</I><BR>
President Mandela yesterday renewed calls on skilled South Africans not to leave the country, saying their expertise was vital to transformation. Reacting to reports linking emigration to crime and violence, he said in Pretoria his appeal applied especially to those who had enjoyed education and other opportunities which the majority had been denied.<BR><P>
JOBS AND ECONOMY ARE MAIN CONCERN IN SA  <I>(Citizen)</I><BR>

POLICE SEIZE MINING EXPLOSIVES, WEAPONS  <I>(Sowetan, Jhb.)</I><BR>
A large quantity of mining explosives and traditional weapons were seized during a police swoop at a mine hostel in Stilfontein in North West yesterday following three days of violence in which 21 people died. Police spokesman Captain Louis Jacobs said yesterday the explosives were found in rooms at the Scott hostel at the old Stilfontein mine.<I> [During SAfms morning talk-show, "Talk at Will" today, Labour Minister Tito Mboweni said a pressing issue was to determine how access to the explosives had been gained. He went on to say "many tensions - some not directly related to working conditions or language" were behind the recent incidents of violence on some SA mines, and "it is too superficial to say it is just tribalism". - Ed.]</I><BR>

THIRD FORCE IS FANNING MINE CONFLICT <I>(Business Day, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Investigations of recent violence at Goldfields SA's East Driefontein mine pointed to the possibility that a 'third force or criminal interest' was fanning ethnic conflict, SA Police Service Captain Eugene Potgieter said yesterday.<BR>
<B><I>... and furthermore ...</I></B><BR>
ETHNIC UPHEAVALS <I>(Business Day Editorial Comment)</I><BR>
The sudden upsurge of ethnic violence on the mines in recent weeks may seem surprising, given larger moves towards national reconciliation and the forging of one SA identity.  It is less disconcerting if one considers that certain contributory factors remain unchanged, and the ethnicity may mask deeper, economically based conflicts.<BR><P>
BID TO RESOLVE FIVE-WEEK NAMIBIAN STRIKE <I>(Business Report, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Mediation efforts started yesterday morning to try to resolve a five-week-old strike at Tsumeb in Namibia, Gold Fields Namibia, the owner, said.

PHILANTHROPY MAKES GOOD BUSINESS SENSE <I>(by Nick Segal, JCI, Business Day)</I><BR>
Business has to be concerned about the quality and potential of its workforce, as well as those factors that go to shape that quality.  Getting  involved in education, housing, environmental improvement and other community projects makes good business sense if it results in a more stable, motivated and productive work force<I>.[an edited version of a recent speech by Nick Segal, JCI Limited's director of Strategy and Corporate Affairs. Dr Segal is also one of two vice-presidents of the Chamber of Mines - Ed.] </I><BR><P>

PACIFIC RIM EXAMPLE FOR SA <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
DURBAN - Government had to get moving with privatisation and exchange control relaxation to retain foreign investment levels, McCarthy Group chairman Brian McCarthy said in his annual review. He also said government, business and labour had to co-operate if targets set out in the macro-economic strategy were to be met.  "Look no further than the Pacific Rim countries whose economic growth rates have been the envy of the western world and whose hardworking management and staff accept that a market economy brings both sacrifices and benefits at different times", he said.<BR><P>
A 'COMPETITION TRIBUNAL' MIGHT POLICE BUSINESS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

NEIGHBOURS BEAT SA FOR INVESTMENT <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
WASHINGTON - Worldwide, foreign direct investment by trans-national companies reached a record $315bn last year, but only $4m landed in SA, says the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) in its 1996 World Investment Report. The flow to SA was negligible even in comparison with that to its neighbours. Swaziland, for example, received $54m, Mozambique $36m, Zambia $66m, Zimbabwe $40m and Lesotho $23m.<BR><P>
PROSPECTS DIM FOR EARLY SOLUTION TO CONSTITUTIONAL DIFFERENCES <I>(Cape Times, Cape Town)</I><BR>
Prospects for an early resolution to constitutional differences between political parties dimmed on the first day of new talks yesterday when the IFP postponed a return to the process and the NP demanded a thorough review of disputed provincial powers.  The negotiators were meeting at Parliament to correct 10 defects in the draft adopted by the Constitutional Assembly on May 8.  The parties met last week and gave themselves until October 11 to remedy the defects the Constitutional Court ruled were reasons for its refusing to certify the draft.<BR><P>
POVERTY GAP TAKES CENTRE STAGE AT UN <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

CRIME, VIOLENCE SPURS BRAIN DRAIN  <I>(The Citizen, Jhb.)</I><BR>

IMF GOLD SALE CAN HURT SA, SAYS DP  <I>(Citizen)</I><BR>
International Monetary Fund proposals to sell off its gold reserves to help impoverished countries could result in jobs being lost and mines closing in South Africa, Democratic Party leader Tony Leon said yesterday. He called on the government to "make the most strenuous effort " at the IMF meeting in Washington to oppose any proposal on the sale of IMF gold reserves.<BR><P>
NEDLAC GIVES R3-M TO LABOUR MOVEMENT  <I>(Sowetan)</I><BR>
The National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) has spent R3-million towards education programmes on the new Labour Relations Act (LRA). The money was divided among the countrys three major trade union federations and small businesses according to size.<BR>
<B><I>... also on the LRA ...</I></B><BR>
NEW LABOUR ACT SPELLS END FOR FREE RIDERS  <I>(Sowetan)</I><BR>
The new Labour Relation Act is bound to change the face of industrial relations for the better, but workers will soon discover the ironies of democracy in the agency shop agreement clause. The clause is aimed at protecting trade unions against "free riders" and it entails that workers who choose not to belong to unions will now have to pay contributions equivalent to union members subscriptions.<BR><P>
SA MOVING TO PROVIDE SKILLS  <I>(Sowetan)</I><BR>
South Africa is trying hard to address a skills crisis attributed to policies of the past which ignored people development . Director-general of the Department of Labour Sipho Pityana says the problem is being addressed through the National Training Strategy initiative. A Green Paper on training and development is expected to be completed before the end of this year.<BR><P>
DONT MISJUDGE COSATUS WILLINGNESS TO ENTER NEW ERA  <I>(The Star, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Cosatus (the Congress of SA Trade Unions) acceptance last week of the partial privatisation of some parastatal companies is a cautious but crucial step towards a new labour relations compact that can help South Africa cope with the formidable challenges of global competition. Some elements of the business press have described the policy shift as a sign that the labour federation is going soft. One headline said so in as many words. It was an observation as harmful as<I> [it was]</I> inaccurate. The decision in fact required considerable courage. Both business and unions have to move away from old, fixed positions if the accord is to be reached, and given our history of racist exploitation of labour, that is particularly difficult for union leaders.<BR><P>

BLOOD MIXES IN TROUBLED WATERS <I>(Business Report, Jhb.)</I><BR>

NO SPACE TO BREATHE ON THIS TRACK <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Despite complaints from some captains of industry about the pace of change, the programme to place the SA economy on an internationally competitive footing appears to be bearing fruit.  Since 1994, the Trade and Industry Department has reduced tariffs on imports and scrapped excessive export subsidies.  The programme has exposed those industries that compete with imports - textile, motor, tyre and chemical - to foreign competition and world markets.  It has meant that local industry and the economy has had to adjust to lower levels of tariff protection.<BR><P>

The National Council of Trade Unions (Nactu) yesterday said it supported partial privatisation provided jobs and the use of local material were guaranteed.

ANGLO DIGS DEEPER TO SURVIVE  <I>(Citizen)</I><BR>
Anxious to compete globally and to disprove talk of its imminent demise, South Africas gold mining industry is seeking new ways to survive - even if it means sending men five km underground.

ZAMBIA - EMERALDS BOOM FOR SMALL FIRMS   <I>(Africa Focus)</I><BR>
A year after temporary closure, locally incorporated Kagem Mining Limited remains Zambias most productive emerald mining company. In 1995 Kagem was closed for alleged illegal mining activities. It has since resumed production, selling about $1-million worth of rough emeralds from stock in 1996. Most of the 66 companies involved in the mining of precious minerals are small. However, heavyweights including Western Mining (a private Australian company) Anglovaal, Phelps Dodge and Tan Range Exploration of Canada are prospecting for gold silver and emeralds.

<B>INTERVIEW</B> - SA MINING MINISTER LOOKS TOWARDS EMPOWERMENT AND INDUSTRIALISATION <I> by Barry Baxter (Africa Focus)</I><BR>
<B>BAXTER: </B>Penuella <I>[sic] </I>Maduna says the major challenge the new South African government faces from the mining industry is how to bring blacks into [the] industry; not as purveyors of cheap labour but as owners of equity.<BR>
<B>MADUNA: </B>The legacy of apartheid is still in the <I>[mining] </I>industry. Blacks must be managers at critical levels - decision-makers. At those levels, mining in SA is still very much a white-only business. The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) wants its members on the boards of the mining houses within 10 years, but that is too long. I would be much happier if there were signs of it beginning to happen now. "Im not talking about good Samaritans <I>[acting] </I>out of sheer altruism, or the goodness of their hearts, throwing money at blacks. Im talking about creating opportunities for blacks to come on their own initiative and through the front door. I dont want any little black token at the top."<BR>
<B>BAXTER </B>:The Chamber of Mines has expressed concern over proposed new legislation providing worker forums at mine level and bargaining councils with regional and national responsibility.<BR>
<B>MADUNA: </B>"They must wait and see how things crystallise. We are still at the preparatory stages [of a white paper]. Luckily for them and all the key players, we started this legislation in a different way. Normally a white paper is published as government policy, and that is that. What has happened here is, from the very word go, a decision was taken that all players must be brought together so they could help in formulating the new policy. They are very lucky, the policy will be formed with input from all of them. The best and broadest interest of this country will form part of the final policy. There is still a lot of room for discussion and debate."<BR>
<B>BAXTER:  </B>On oft-repeated comments by the gold mining industry that refining to 99,99 is beneficiation enough, Maduna said,<BR>
<B>MADUNA: </B>I am not sure what they mean when they say further beneficiation is a non-starter. We think that some of our resources must have value added. We need to develop a better jewelry <I>[sic] </I>industry. If it makes sense for Europeans to buy our gold and then make jewels out of it there, why cant we do it here?"<BR>
<B>BAXTER: </B>With the gold industry admittedly declining, what is your scenario for the future?<BR>
<B>MADUNA:  </B>"Some of us are advocating that this country must embark on industrialisation on a scale we have never seen before. The economy has been skewed in favour of mining, but mining is based on wasting assets. If we develop industry and technology, we will begin to focus on other areas and the country will survive."<BR><P>
PROJECT LAUNCHED TO STUDY MIGRATION <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
CAPE TOWN - A joint research and policy formulation project by the Institute for Democracy in SA (Idasa) and a Canadian university dealing with cross-border migration in southern Africa was launched last night. The three-year Southern Africa Migration Project has the financial backing of the Canadian International Development Agency acting through Queens University in Kingston. Acting project manager Vincent Williams said yesterday the project would focus on both legal and undocumented migrants (illegal aliens), examining which countries they came from and what sectors they entered when they arrived in SA.<BR><P>

<p align=left>MINES BACK TRAPS TO FIGHT GOLD THEFT <em>(Business Day, Jhb.)</em><br>
South Africa's mines yesterday called for the revision of a draft law to ensure that police could continue to use traps in their 
fight against gold theft costing the country an estimated R1,5bn a year.<br>
<br>
SA'S FINANCIAL JOURNALISTS FAIL TO CARRY OUT THEIR DUTIES <em>(Business Day)</em><br>
SA&#146;s economic journalists confirm the truth of the bitter joke that an economist thinks the long-term began last week, a print 
journalist thinks the long-term started yesterday and a television journalist thinksusiness iayrted this morning. Nowhere is this 
better reflected than in the reporting of the decline in the rand since February this year.<br>
<br>
SPEND YOU LOSE, SAVE YOU LOSE <em>(Business Report, Jhb.)</em><br>
The South African Reserve Bank's annual report has shown that increases in the government's consumption expenditure are 
being financed by poor people getting deeper into debt, while business surplus have risen, benefiting the rich.<br>
<br>
CALL TO DELAY CHANGES <em>(Business Day)</em><br>
Affirmative action in the criminal justice system should be delayed until crime was under control, Democratic Party leader 
Tony Leon said yesterday. Efforts to make the system more representative of the population were leading to the loss of 
competent staff.<br>
<br>
MANUEL HONOURED BY IMF AND WORLD BANK <em>(Business Report)</em><br>
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have asked SA Finance Minister Trevor Manuel to act as one of two 
vice-chairmen at the ordinary plenary sessions of their yearly meetings in Washington from October 1 to 3. A Finance 
Department spokesman said Manuel would co-chair the plenary sessions with the Chilean Finance Minister if the chairman, 
Eritrea's Finance Minister, could not attend.<br>
<br>
THE UNION PROBLEM <em>(Business Day - Editorial Comment -</em><em><u> full text</u></em><em>)</em><br>
A couple of developments in the past week suggest, once again, that SA&#146;s much-lamented &quot;union problem&quot; is not nearly as 
intractable as local and foreign conventional wisdom would have it. Those developments also suggest, however, that dealing 
successfully with the unions takes a degree of skill and enlightenment (of the self-interested type) that often seems in short 
supply.</p>
<p align=left>The first development is, of course, Cosatu&#146;s <em>[the Congress of South African Trade Unions is SA's largest labour 
federation, staunchly socialist and a close alliance partner with the ruling African National Congress- Ed.] </em>new 
official stance on privatisation. This policy has been in the making for some time. Even as Cosatu&#146;s public platform rhetoric 
vowed to fight this manifestation of the evil neo-liberal agenda, leading union officials - seeing the fiscal and market pressures 
their ANC allies were under - were creating space to facilitate a change of direction.</p>
<p align=left><br>
Cosatu&#146;s conversion is neither graceful nor wholehearted. It is a matter of acknowledging economic realities rather than a new 
conviction that privatisation is inherently &quot;a good thing&quot;. The semantics suggest that Cosatu has only <em>[now]</em> reached the stage 
that the ANC did around 1993 when it began preparing to govern. And the policy statement is vague, and peppered with &quot;ifs&quot; 
and &quot;:buts&quot; that the purist will find distasteful. <br>
</p>
<p align=left>This all suggests that there is a lot of fighting ahead over detail. Nevertheless, the shift signals that the issue is no longer 
&quot;whether&quot; but what, when and how. To an appreciable extent, it moves consideration of SA&#146;s economic future off the streets 
and into the debating chamber.<br>
</p>
<p align=left>The other important developments occurred in the mining industry. They go to the heart of labour market flexibility, and 
suggest progress is possible in the new labour framework if handled sensibly on both sides. It gives substance to some of the 
ideas contained in the Labour Market Commission&#146;s recommendations regarding the relationship between centralised 
bargaining and the need for flexibility in this highly competitive era. <br>
</p>
<p align=left>The significance of the <a href="/Welcome.htm">Chamber of Mines</a>/<a href="http://www.anc.org.za/num/">NUM</a> <em>[the National Union of Mineworkers] </em>wage settlement lies in its 
decentralised nature. Its unifying features address such areas as retirement funds, a training policy framework, sick leave, 
occupational disease and injury compensation. Those are issues where national industry standards can be useful and 
constructive. But where the bulk of direct costs are concerned , particularly wages, the agreement provides for differentiated 
settlements for individual groups and, in some cases, individual mines. The agreement recognises the existence of different 
needs and priorities of individual operations, which is what modern labour market policy demands.<br>
Beyond that the NUM and Anglo American&#146;s gold and uranium division were able to negotiate a framework for productivity 
enhancement. This innovation could well set a benchmark for South African labour relations at a time when creative 
union/management efforts to enhance efficiencies are critical to economic development.<br>
</p>
<p align=left>South African managers and union leaders, instead of spending their time shaking fists at their adversaries, would do well to 
look at the example set by their counterparts in the mining industry.<br>
<br>
FIRST STEP TODAY IN REVISING CONSTITUTION <em>(Cape Times, Cape Town)</em><br>
The Constitutional Assembly meets in plenary session today for the first time since May to address defects in the constitution, 
but work will begin in earnest next week in producing a revised document for the Constitutional Court.<br>

<p align=left>SKILLS EXODUS RAISES BUDGET CONCERNS <i>(Business Day, Jhb.)</i><br>
The Finance Department has suffered a 'brain drain' of its budget team which has left it with only one of the original nine

economist Boyce Lloyd, who started work at a blue chip company in Johannesburg this month. Former colleague Murto 
Wickens landed a job with the International Monetary Fund in Washington. Finance officials have acknowledged the

technicians.<br>

COSATU STILL AGAINST WHOLESALE PRIVATISATION <i>(The Citizen, Jhb.)</i><br>
Cosatu has reaffirmed its opposition to wholesale privatisation, and reasserted its position that &quot;strategic nationalisation&quot; 
be considered where appropriate in restructuring state assets. At its two-day meeting which ended on Friday, Cosatu&#146;s 
decision-making body, the Central Executive Committee, said the restructuring debate should consider all forms of 
ownership.<br>

HIGHEST COURT FINDS COSATU WAS RIGHT AFTER ALL - by John Gomomo, Cosatus president <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
"Those wanting to undermine the will of the people, and two years of hard negotiations in the Constitutional Assembly, by using legal action to pursue what they could not achieve through the democratic process, have been dealt a severe blow by last Fridays judgement of the Constitutional Court.  A number of key issues raised by ourselves, together with the ANC, were in effect endorsed by the court.  These include recognition of the right to strike as a fundamental human right; rejection of constitutional entrenchment of the right to lock out; and the right of the central government to set national norms and standards should not be undermined by powers of the provinces." <BR><P>

<BR><P>MINING AGREEMENT MAY BE LAST DEAL IN TRADITIONAL FORUM <I>(Business Day, Jhb)</I><BR>
The <A HREF="http://www.bullion.org.za/releases/wages96.htm">mining industry wage deal</A> signed yesterday between the Chamber of Mines and the National Union of Mineworkers could represent the last agreement signed between the parties in the traditional bargaining forum.  Both parties indicated that in the current circumstances the overall package agreed on was honourable.  However, it became evident during the protracted and very tough negotiations that the bargaining system within the Chamber would have to change as it could not accommodate growing differences between the mining houses and between gold and coal mines<I>.[Click <A HREF="http://www.bullion.org.za/speeches/96wagsgn.htm">here </A>for the full text of the address by the President of the Chamber of Mines at yesterday's signing ceremony - Ed.]</I><BR><P>
TAXPAYERS TO FOOT BILL FOR FAILED AIDS PLAY <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The taxpayer is to foot the bill for the failed AIDS awareness musical <I>Sarafina 2</I> following a secret donor's withdrawal yesterday of a R10,5m government bale-out.  President Mandela has blamed the withdrawal on a "media uproar" over the donor's identity. The <I>Cape Times</I> reports that Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma told a Press conference yesterday the R10,5m would now be regarded as "unauthorised expenditure" and be dealt with in the normal way.<I> [This debacle has already been called "a national scandal" and various media reports tell of mounting anger among ordinary citizens who feel they have been lied to or "kept in the dark" by government - Ed.]</I><BR><P>
SHELL HOUSE ISSUE RAISED AGAIN <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

PROBE INTO MINE CARNAGE <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Labour Court judge-president John Myburgh has been appointed to head a commission of inquiry into mine violence at three Gold Fields mines over the past two months, the Labour Ministry said last night. <I>[Several media have presented a misleading picture of the terms of reference of the commission saying it would probe "violence on SA mines" - implying its ambit would cover all SA mines. This is incorrect. Labour Minister Tito Mboweni said during a radio interview this morning the commission would only focus attention on the recent events at East Driefontein, Leeudoorn and Northam. No reports of violence on other mines have been received. He did add he was in favour of a wider ranging investigation to include all mines, and that the Myburgh Commission might thus serve as a "precursor" to such a probe - Ed.]</I><BR><P>
MANUEL 'DOING PRETTY GOOD JOB' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and his team are actually doing a pretty good job, says the Inkatha Freedom Party.

GOLD FIELDS FOUNDATION MAKES IMPACT <I>(Sowetan:Mineral Wealth survey)</I><BR>
In line with a new policy, the Gold Fields Foundation has become much more selective, focusing on specific projects rather than spreading resources too thinly. Consequently, a more substantial impact has been made in a number of key areas, including tertiary education, primary health care, environmental education and welfare. The Foundation supports tertiary education to get a greater number of appropriately qualified people into the workplace and the economy.<BR><P>
GOLD FIELDS COMMITS TO NATURE   <I>(Sowetan:Mineral Wealth survey)</I><BR>

MBEKI ATTACKS INDUSTRIAL CONGLOMERATES <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
WASHINGTON - The unwillingness of SA's biggest industrial conglomerates to compete was a greater obstacle to increased inflows of foreign direct investment than crime or fears about the country's prospects after President Mandela's departure, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said in an interview published in this week's international edition of <I>Newsweek.</I><BR><P>
A TEMPTING BUT TREACHEROUS MORSEL<I> (Business Report, Jhb.)</I><BR>
For many investors, SA started to look like a tempting target after the multiracial elections of more than two years ago.  In the meantime, lack of confidence in the state of the nation has been expressed through the battering of the currency in the capital markets.  While the new government is grappling with the vicissitudes of governance, corporate SA is wanting a world-class, quality-orientated characteristic reminiscent of the better performing countries in the world.  Signals sent to the market are those of a bungling leadership lacking a basic grasp of global economic events and unable to solve domestic problems such a crime and unemployment.<BR><P>
THEORY AND REALITY <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
One of the latest theories circulating around SA's financial markets explaining why the government is so painfully slow in relaxing exchange controls is that the Reserve Bank wants to get all the money that would flee the country swapped before economic freedom follows in democracy's footsteps.<BR><P>
SHORTAGE IN MONEY MARKET SHOOTS UP <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The money market shortage shot up R850m this week to breach the R9bn mark as foreign exchange outflows resumed, traders said yesterday.<BR><P>
MEASURING BOTH PROFILES OF THE DRAGON <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

The department has embarked on a transformation process, he said.  Commercialisation of some activities could enable it to reduce staff from about 8 000 to 3 000.<BR><P>

De Beers producer in Botswana, Debswana, is locked in a tussle with labour - centred on shifts - over the proposed introduction of continuous operations at Orapa Diamond Company, which would increase the mine's annual ore throughput about 15% to almost 9-million tons.<BR><P>
UNION MINES LIKELY TO BE LIQUIDATED DESPITE COMPROMISE OFFER <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Union Mines, the embattled manganese operation that was provisionally liquidated earlier this year, is teetering on the edge of final liquidation.  If creditors accept an offer of compromise to be made next week, however, the mine could be saved.  Sources said the offer would be about R1,5m, which would not meet the company's debt of more than 
R6-million.<BR><P>
SA TO STORE IRANIAN CRUDE AT SALDANHA BAY <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
SA would be storing and trading Iranian crude oil at Saldanha Bay, north of Cape Town,  by March next year, the Central Energy Fund said in its 1995/96 annual report.

SHAKE-UP INEVITABLE IN SA POLITICS <I>(Cape Times, Cape Town)</I><BR>
A regrouping of political parties has become inevitable - even though the process might be restricted by the anti-defection clauses in the constitution, and the ethnic support base of political parties.  Despite these restraints, former minister Pik Botha could be correct in his prediction that "theres a new movement coming into being which will undo the divisions of the past" according to political writer, Barry Streek.<BR><P>

CHAMBER TABLES FINAL OFFER TO NUM <I>(Business Day, Jhb.)</I><BR>
The Chamber of Mines has tabled a final wage offer ranging between 6% and 10% for gold mines and between 8,5% and 13% for collieries during tough negotiations with the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).<I> [There is little new in this report since the Chamber tabled final offers some two weeks ago - Ed.]</I><BR><P>
STRONG NUM ESSENTIAL TO MINE PEACE <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Mine violence since the 1980s had become about <I>[sic]</I> maximising union solidarity - punishing those who refused to collaborate and resisting management attempts to destabilise the union by using scabs, vigilantes or "the Russians", NUM president James Motlatsi said yesterday. Faction fighting divided and weakened the work force.  "Mine mangers know this and, not surprisingly, over time they have often instigated tribal conflicts by using various devious tactics to divide us. Over the past 10 years the ethnic composition of the labour force had changed, with the foreign complement falling from 80% to more than 50%.  This has created a greater ethnic awareness among foreign ethnic groups.  The NUM had a role to play in resolving violence.  The union had to ensure the removal of tribalism from the organisation and had to impose its own non-racial morality in the mines.  This could be achieved only if the union fully organised the work force".<BR><P>
INQUIRY AT MINES WELCOMED <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

Gold broke through its resistance level of $385 an ounce yesterday to a London afternoon fix of $384,60 with brokers expecting further falls.

Analysts predicted that gold could fall to $382,50 an ounce or even $380 in the short term.<BR><P>
EMU COULD WEAKEN DOLLAR AND GOLD  <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>
BRUSSELS - The creation of a single European currency could prompt participating national central banks to sell excess dollar and gold reserves, a new study by Goldman Sachs in London showed on Monday.  At the expected start of economic and monetary union in 1999, a European Central Bank will likely be saddled with far more foreign exchange and gold reserves than it needs for trade or currency management purposes, the study argues.<BR><P>
ASHANTI GETS FINANCING PACKAGE  <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Lonrho-controlled Ghanaian gold mine, Ashanti Gold Fields, has arranged a Z$400m financing package, based on a seven-year forward gold sale, to provide working capital and cut debt.<BR><P>

EU LIST OF BARRED ITEMS 'NOT FINAL'  <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The list of 'sensitive' products excluded from the European Union's negotiating mandate for the proposed free trade area agreement with SA was not the final word on the matter, as it contained a number of 'soft spots' open to negotiation, European Commission director-general of development Steffen Smidt said yesterday.<BR><P>
NZO SAYS THERE IS A DRASTIC NEED TO RESHAPE SA'S FOREIGN POLICY <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

Can it be that US Aid is finally getting the idea that SA is not a place to dump the US's technical assistance surplus and practise extraterritorial affirmative action?

LABOUR NAMES FIVE PRIVATISATION ADVISERS <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
After the recent high-stakes race by international investment houses to advise the government on privatisation, SA's main labour federations named a team of largely unknown consultants to advise them on the restructuring of state assets:  Patrick Bond, a senior researcher at the National Institute for Economic Policy, to advise on housing; Tessa Marcus, an academic at Durban Westville, on agriculture;  Patrick Brennan, principal researcher at Cape Town-based firm Builder's Design Matter, on trade and industry; Simon Roberts, an economics lecturer from Wits University, on transport; and Michael Schwemmle, a German citizen advising trade unions on the restructuring of German telecommunications, on telecomms. in SA.<BR><P>

<I>TIME </I>COMMENDS SA, BUT WARNS ON ECONOMY  <I>(The Star, Jhb.)</I><BR>
<I>TIME </I>magazine has commended the African National Congress for "trying to get it right" after the 1994 election, but has warned the SA needs to boost its economy faster if it is to survive in an aggressively competitive world and not fall to poverty. In a 10-page special report on SA in next weeks edition, titled "After The Miracle", correspondent Peter Hawthorne looks at all aspect of SA society after the transition.

Penuell Maduna, Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs, says state regulation - retail price fixing, controlled wholesale margins and restrictions on competition - was introduced as an incentive to secure the international oil companies' services during apartheid and guarantee them a return on their investment.

Deputy Finance Minister Gill Marcus said the incentives would be granted on the basis of criteria that were weighted in terms of labour intensiveness and training, and special steps would be taken to ensure all projects were monitored. Some concern has also been expressed that the incentives would divert the economy from a labour-intensive to a capital-intensive path.

WELCOME TO DISNEYRAND <I>(Business Day Editorial Comment)</I><BR>

Finance Department on the 1997/98 Budget amid indications of high

<p>ERWIN CALLS FOR RAPID OPENING OF SA MARKETS TO AFRICA <i>(Business
Day)</i><br>
HARARE - SA would have to open its markets more rapidly to the
Southern African Development Community than to trading blocks
like the European Union, Trade and Industry Minister, Alec Erwin

<p>PRIVATISATION PROCESS GAINS MOMENTUM <i>(Business Day)</i><br>
Almost a year since the privatisation initiative was announced by
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and organised labour accused
government of &quot;betrayal&quot;, there are clear signs that
the process is moving ahead. Nonetheless, market perception is that
too little action is taking place and that the process is bogged
down, in part at least, by consultation and negotiation. When
labour and government reached a National Framework Agreement on
state asset restructuring, big business and some political
parties accused government of conceding to labour demands and
effectively placing privatisation on the backburner. Recent
events regarding Telkom and Sun Air, in particular, should go
some way to placating these elements. Yet there remains a
perception at local and international level that government and
particularly the Public Enterprises Ministry - is unfocused and unprepared,
and has yet to spell out policy on the restructuring of state
assets.<br>
<b><i>... however ...</i></b><br>
OLD HABITS DIE HARD <i>(Business Report)</i><br>
Stella Sigcau, Minister of Public Enterprises, has launched a new
communications strategy to convey her ministry's progress in the
restructuring of public assets to the world at large. At a privatisation conference
this week, Sigcau said the new strategy sought to remedy wild speculation
in the media about what her ministry was up to. &quot;It's a
great pity that so far our efforts have gone unnoticed. Very often
we see wild speculation by the media about our programmes and
this can lead to a distortion of facts&quot;, she said. The move
might well have been spurred by what she called &quot;unnecessary
and negative publicity&quot; that arose from the revelations
about Transnet's pension fund and directors' salaries last week.<br>
</p>

<p>DIVERSITY 'KEY TO STAFF UPLIFTMENT' <i>(Business Day)</i><br>
Affirmative action in the US had not completely levelled the
playingfield for minorities and women, General Motors' human resources
director Elmer C Jackson yesterday told delegates at the Institute of
Personnel Management convention at Sun City. Jackson, who has
been in human resources for 34 years, said he had witnessed the
US journey from segregation and legally sanctioned discrimination
to civil rights legislation, affirmative action plans and
diversity programmes. And, although they had made progress since
then, &quot;we are far from finished&quot;, he said.<br>
</p>

<p>NAFCOC LASHES OUT AT RACIAL IMBALANCES <i>(Business Report)</i><br>
Exploding population growth allied to high unemployment could
overtake all efforts to create a viable economy unless SA achieved
acceptable participation by blacks in corporate structures within
a reasonably short period, Joe Hlongwane, the national president
of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce (Nafcoc),
warned at the annual congress of the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut
yesterday.<br>
</p>

<p>ANC'S SUPPORT DROPS, NP STATIC <i>(Business Day)</i><br>
The ruling African National Congress has recorded a 10% loss in
support since the general elections, while the National Party support
was at the same level as in 1994, a Human Sciences Research
Council survey has found. The survey said ANC support had dropped
from 63% in May 1994 to 53%, but no other party had picked up the
10% in lost voters. &quot;This may be an early indication that
dissatisfied ANC supporters may decide not to vote, rather than
vote against the ANC (in 1999)&quot;, the HSRC said.<br>
</p>

<p>REPORT CITES BORDER CHAOS <i>(Business Day)</i><br>
A national agency should be created to oversee control of SA's
borders, stemming the flood of illegal immigrants and the escalating
cross-border crime, an SA Police Services report recommends.<br>
</p>

<p>SMUGGLING JEOPARDISES SAA FLIGHTS <i>(Business Report)</i><br>
SAA may be forced to cut the Johannesburg-to-Cape Town leg of 13
international flights a week if the SA Revenue Services insists
on stopping it from taking on domestic passengers during the hour-long
stop the flights make at Johannesburg, a spokesman said
yesterday.<br>
</p>

<p>BRAZIL STILL SEEN COMPETING FOR MINING INVESTMENTS <i>(Reuters)</i><br>
BRASILIA - Brazil has come a long way in removing barriers to
foreign investment in its mining sector, but must still compete fiercely
against numerous other countries, said the designated chief economist
for the concern.<br>
</p>

<p>GOLD REFINERS NEED TO ADD VALUE <i>(Reuters)</i><br>
PERTH - Australia's largest gold refiner, GoldCorp, said on
Wednesday it must provide value-added services if it is to compete
in an increasingly overcrowded marketplace. <br>
</p>

<p>ARGENTINE FOOTHOLD FOR LONRHO <i>(Reuters)</i><br>
BUENOS AIRES - British mining group Lonrho Plc has taken a small
foothold in southern Argentina and is set to start exploring at
an abandoned mine site in the next few weeks, the firm's local
partner said.<br>
</p>

<p>19% RISE IN EMIGRATION FIGURES <i>(The Star, Jhb.)</i><br>
CAPE TOWN - Emigration in the first six months of this year was
up by almost 19% compared to the same period last year. Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, the Minister of Home Affairs, told the National Assembly
yesterday that 2 599 economically active people left the country
between January and June. In the same period there were 751
immigrants, a 2,5% drop compared to the first six months of last
year.<br>

JCI BUCKS TREND WITH 30% LEAP IN PROFITS<I> (Business Day, Jhb.)</I><BR>
JCI bucked the downward trend in gold mining quarterly results yesterday, posting a 30% rise in aggregate operating profit in the September quarter to R129m from R99m in the June quarter.<BR><P>
HJ JOEL TURNS IN A WELCOME PROFIT <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
JCI's gold mines boosted their aggregate operating profit 28% to R116m as increased gold production and an improved gold price overshadowed the 9,6% rise in working costs.  The best news was HJ Joel turning in another of its rare profitable quarters, although this looks set to change.  The mine's operating profit of R29m was more than double September's level (R12,7m), and there was money left after capital expenditure.<BR><P>
MINES DEAL COULD UNLOCK LAND VALUED AT R100M <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Randgold & Exploration could unlock land valued at about R110m in a deal which will see four of its mines sell unused property to foreign-owned Rand Leases Properties.<BR><P>
GENCOR, AUSTRALIAN FIRM IN INDONESIAN DEAL <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Gencor and an Australian base-metals company have signed a letter of intent to conduct a preliminary evaluation of an integrated nickel and cobalt resource in Indonesia.<BR><P>
MINE SHAREHOLDERS TOLD TO EXERCISE CAUTION <I>(Business Report, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Durban Roodepoort Deep, East Rand Proprietary Mines, Rand Leases Properties and Stilfontein Gold Mining said they were involved in talks about their property interests.  Shareholders were advised to exercise caution in their share dealings, the companies said.<BR><P>
ANC, MINING HOUSES FIND COMMON GROUND ON FUTURE <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
SA mining houses and the ANC have found areas of agreement on the future of mining in a green paper that was delivered to Penuell Maduna, Minerals and Energy Affairs Minister, last Friday.  The paper was produced by a tripartite steering committee comprising industry, labour and government, a source close to the negotiations said yesterday.<BR><P>
MBOWENI CALLS FOR MODERATE WAGE RISES <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
SUN CITY - Labour Minister Tito Mboweni called for moderate wage increases yesterday, saying this would increase the net wealth of the national economy and ensure that all had a fair and equal chance at creating and benefiting from that wealth.<BR><P>
MBEKI WANTS HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO DRIVE MACRO-ECONOMIC PLAN <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Distinct differences of emphasis emerged yesterday between Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki on macro-economic strategy and human development.  During a parliamentary hearing on reducing poverty to mark the international day for the eradication of poverty, Mbeki called for a "comprehensive strategy for growth and development".  This comprehensive strategy could include a "coherent and comprehensive macro-economic framework" and also a human development strategy which should "influence the design of macro-economic policies at the outset".  Earlier, Manuel scorned suggestions that the macro-economic strategy should be amended to include RDP social goals.  He repeated his frequently propounded explanation that the plan was a framework into which other important aspects of government policy would fit.  The plan specified the parameters within which other aspects of government strategy would be contained - not the other way around.<BR><P>
CONFIDENCE 'KEY TO SA GLOBAL SUCCESS' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Confidence needed to be instilled in SA's business and labour organisations for SA to compete successfully in the global market, Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said yesterday.  "We are in a tough world where there is a high degree of competition and if we do not compete with them, we will be left behind", Erwin said at the annual SA International Trade Exhibition yesterday.<BR><P>
SLOWER SA GROWTH PREDICTED <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
SA's economic growth could slow to 2.5% next year from an expected 2.9% this year as sustained high interest rates and negative business confidence started to take their toll, insurance group, Sanlam economist Johan Louw said yesterday.<BR><P>
STATE ASSET RESTRUCTURING 'VITAL TO INVESTOR CONFIDENCE' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The restructuring of state assets had to show significant progress over the next three years if government's macro-economic strategy was to succeed as envisaged, government economic policy consultant André Roux said yesterday.  Roux, who played an integral role in drawing up the strategy, said that while privatisation was unlikely to have a big effect on economic variables in the short-term, it was vital to boost investor confidence in the longer term.<BR><P>
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES MUST INSIST ON FREE AND FAIR GLOBAL TRADE <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
At the heart of the phenomenon of globalisation is a massive experiment in economic restructuring;  a process spearheaded by the Western powers.  This "gamble" is being executed under the rubric of better living standards for all.  But there is no guarantee that this noble goal will be the end product.  On the contrary, globalisation may very well exacerbate gaps between rich global blocs and poor regions.  This is already the reality in many parts of the world.  Yet the dividend of international "free" trade is taken as given by the architects of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).  Such trade is ostensibly the be-all-and- end-all of the problems of global poverty.  A country's "comparative advantage" is seen as the only root to prosperity.  SA and others should, therefore, beef up their "comparative advantage edge" if they are to survive in this self-help post-Cold War era.<BR><P>
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION COULD ERODE HUMAN RIGHTS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The anti-discrimination provisions in the new Labour Relations Act, the equality clause in the final constitution and the proposed employment equity legislation are based on the principle of equal treatment.  But what does equal treatment mean in the context of employment?  "Legal scholars argue that a job applicant does not have the right to a particular position just because other applicants are appointed or employed", says JD Verster, a labour lawyer at Webber Wentzel Bowens.  "But a job applicant does have the right to be treated in the same manner as any other applicant", he says.  No constitutional rights to affirmative action exist, and employment equity legislation will have to comply with the equality provisions in the Constitution.  But while affirmative action is commonly accepted as essential to equality, there is a danger that its application could make inroads into the human rights or other protected rights of individuals.  "Retrenching white males to achieve employment equity could, for example, constitute unfair discrimination," says Verster.<BR><P>
SA'S ROLE TOPS AGENDA AT SOUTHERN AFRICAN SUMMIT <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
HARARE - SA's role in the region will top the agenda of the two-day southern African trade and investment summit conference which starts in Harare today.  The conference hopes to capitalise on regional developments like the end of apartheid in SA and the start of peace in Mozambique and Angola.  It also hopes to attract foreign investment and boost trade.<BR><P>
COMMUNICATION REPORT DUE <I>(Cape Times, Cape Town)</I><BR>
The Task Group on Government Communications will hand over its report to Deputy President Thabo Mbeki next week.  It is expected to recommend the disbanding of the R50-million-a-year SA Communication Service and its replacement with a leaner body.<BR><P>

NORTHAM CONCESSIONS <I>(Business Day, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Northam Platinum Mines made concessions on a minimum wage to the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) yesterday, bringing the parties closer to an agreement, a union official said.  About 96% of NUM members voted in favour of a strike last week.<BR><P>
LEEUDOORN MINE DEATHS NOT LINKED TO CLASHES BETWEEN UNIONS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Alcohol, and not clashes between unions, appeared to be the cause of two unrelated deaths at Gold Field's Leeudoorn Gold Mine at the weekend, police said.  Police did not view the incidents as serious enough to warrant a presence on the mine, West Rand SA Police Services spokesman Sergeant Patrys Greyling said.  They were  investigating the deaths, which did not seem to be the result of clashes between NUM and United Workers' Union of SA (Uwusa) members.<BR><P>
LONRHO WELCOMES LABOUR LAW <I>(Business Report, Jhb.)</I><BR>
SUN CITY - Tony Frost, the human resources director of Lonrho, yesterday welcomed SA's new Labour Relations Act, which will come into effect later this year.  Frost said the legislation was in line with international trends.  The most significant aspect of the new Act was its provision for tripartism through workplace forums, he said.  "This country has no chance unless we learn to live with each other", he said.  "The most important way of managing our people is through getting their agreement on how they should work".  But Frost warned against "half-hearted attempts at co-determination that could back-fire on management". <BR><P>
ANOTHER 48 HOURS FOR NEC MEMBERS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The National Empowerment Consortium's deadline to raise funds for Johnnic has been extended a further 48 hours to cater for those members who have yet to secure financing.<BR><P>
RAND STAGGERS TO ANOTHER RECORD LOW <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The rand crashed to yet another record low against the British pound yesterday, reaching R7,2727 as currency traders warned that sterling's ascent was far from over.  Local traders said SA's beleaguered currency was suffering from the double blow of a strong dollar and even stronger pound on international markets.  "It is the worst of both worlds, as the pound is the only currency to beat the dollar", one said.<BR><P>
HIGH REAL INTEREST RATES 'HERE TO STAY' <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
SAs real interest rates might be high, but they were lower than those of some other emerging economies, and of the developed New Zealand economy, JP Morgan, a US bank, said in an emerging-market report released at the weekend. The bank said a cut in interest rates was unlikely in SA until after next year's Budget was released in March.<BR><P>
MAPUTO CORRIDOR IS 'JUST A START' <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Individual spatial development projects like the Maputo Corridor, aimed at making the SA economy more adaptable to global trade trends and more sensitive to events in regional  trade blocs, are on the cards, Alec Erwin, Trade and  Industry Minister, said at the Durban Metro Business Conference yesterday.  He said these projects would dwarf the Olympic initiative and the $4-billion corridor development itself. <BR><P> 
GOVT IDENTIFIES IDC AS ENGINE FOR BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Black economic empowerment has been identified by government as one of the main goals of the Industrial Development Corporation.  In a state document outlining a reshaped IDC mandate, government says other key objectives should be a focus on job creation and exports, rather than "growth for its own sake".  The document, which is seen as providing a strategic vision for the organisation as it begins to shed its image as an "Afrikaner economic empowerment vehicle", says additional policy-based lending should be considered for black economic empowerment, for medium-sized firms facing defined opportunities and constraints, cluster development and training.<BR><P>
GOVT TO ADD RDP GOALS TO ITS GEAR PROGRAMME <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
The government plans to amend its Growth, Employment And Redistribution strategy (Gear) <I>[also known as the macro-economic strategy - Ed.]</I> by adding the RDP's social goals to it.  That will put job creation and the reduction of poverty back on the agenda, after the closure of the RDP office earlier this year.  A spokesman in the office of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said yesterday these goals would be added to those of Gear as an addendum.  The spokesman said the government would decide on the content of the addendum "as a matter of urgency".  Sources said yesterday the government appeared to be trying to appease the labour movement by marrying the RDP goals with those of Gear.  The labour movement has criticised the Gear strategy since it was tabled in parliament in June, to acclaim from the local and international business sectors and the International Monetary Fund.<BR><P>
IMF "MUST RECOGNISE SA TRADE UNIONS" <I>(Sowetan, Jhb.)</I><BR>
The relationship between the SA government and the International Monetary Fund will spell doom for the country if organised labour is not involved in all discussions between the two parties. This warning was sounded by assistant general secretary of the Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu), Zwelinzima Vavi yesterday. <I>[And yet]</I> Cosatu and the SA National Civics Organisation (Sanco) rejected two invitations to meet IMF MD Michel Camdessus when he visited the country last week.<BR><P>
EMPOWERMENT FUND TO PLAY PRIVATISATION ROLE <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The Public Enterprises Ministry has approved the creation of a national empowerment fund to allow disadvantaged communities to play a role in the privatisation of SA's parastatals.  Initial proposals are to establish the fund as a loan vehicle which will avoid the "onerous conditions and high interest rates" that disadvantaged communities are facing when dealing with financial institutions.<BR><P>
INERTIA PERVADES OUR BUSINESS CULTURE <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
If corporate inertia is the persistence of existing business practices regardless of their relevance in the new world, then you stumble over it all the time in SA companies today.  Past and present inertia is the prime reason for our lack of "world-class practice" and the pervasive pessimism about our ability to compete.  Not that there aren't good reasons for such inertia.  But good reasons for bad performance never improved anyone's bottom line.  It's like not taking control over your own fate, and blaming others for your "bad luck" or saying, "What else could we do?"  The hostile world of global competitiveness gives executives two options: drastically revitalise your company and reposition yourself in your industry so as to learn your way to efficiency faster;  or shore up your comfort zones and secure your low-to-no profit position right at the tailend of global competitiveness.<BR><P>
SA TIGHTENS VISA RESTRICTIONS FOR ZIMBABWEANS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
HARARE - The SA High Commission has been forced to tighten the issue of visas after more than 90 000 Zimbabweans violated the terms of six-month permits to cross the border in 18 months.  Many market "shoppers" who earn a living buying goods in SA for resale on the informal market now find their livelihoods in jeopardy.  The 90 000 visa violators are in addition to unknown tens of thousands who crossed the border illegally, joining an estimated 500 000 Zimbabweans putting additional strain on SA's already inadequate urban housing, health and policing infrastructure.<BR><P>
COSATU HAS TOO FEW WOMEN LEADERS <I>(Sake-Beeld, Jhb.)</I><BR>
CAPE TOWN - Although more and more women are entering the SA labour market and joining unions, they still do not occupy positions of leadership in their unions, especially in Cosatu. An article on glass ceilings in the latest edition of the <I>SA Labour Bulletin</I> says women do not easily become workplace representatives because of a lack of faith in them. However, the major reason is rather that "women are not available for elections". <BR><P>
PRESS WARNED TO PURSUE TRUTH <I>(Sowetan)</I><BR>
Top Zimbabwean editor, Trevor Ncube last night warned the South African Press not to repeat the mistakes of media in other African countries, including Zimbabwe. Speaking at the <I>Sowetan/New Nation</I> media banquet in Johannesburg, Ncube, who is editor of the<I> Zimbabwe Independent</I> said it was critical the Press in SA did not shy away from asking the authorities all the awkward questions in pursuit of the truth.<BR>
<B><I>... and ...</I></B><BR>
SA MEDIA MUST WORK WITH GOVT. <I>(Sowetan)</I><BR>
SAs media industry should form a partnership with the government in building a non-racial democracy that should be people-centred and guard against the erosion of basic human rights. Speaking during the Media Freedom Day, Broadcasting and Telecommunications Minister Jay Naidoo called on the media not to bury good stories under negative aspects of the "slow and painful" transformation.<BR>
<B><I>... and ...</I></B><BR>
ROW OVER MANDELAS CRITICISM OF SOME SENIOR BLACK JOURNALISTS <I>(Cape Times, Cape Town)</I><BR>
The ANC yesterday sprang to the defence of President Mandela - under fire from the new South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) for remarks he made about some senior black journalists.  Sanef "wondered" in one of its first resolutions at the weekend why Mandela, in his criticism, made to a University of the North audience a fortnight ago, "indirectly cast suspicion on all senior black journalists".  Mandela told the <I>Cape Times</I> at the weekend that some senior black journalists seemed not to want to be part of the transformation.  "They seem to regret that we destroyed white supremacy, and are very hostile to us - you cant expect us to keep quiet and not respond," he said.<BR><P>

STRIKE THREAT AT LEBOWA MINES OVER <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Anglo American Platinum said the threat of a strike at Lebowa Platinum Mines had been averted.  "A settlement was reached and production has not been affected", the company said, without giving details of the agreement.  It said earlier that wage talks had deadlocked and the union had proceeded with a strike ballot.<BR><P>
MINE FUNDS LIFT RETURNS TO 28,7% <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

IMF BOSS SAYS SA PLAN FOR GROWTH IS SPOT ON <I>(Business Times, with the Sunday Times)</I><BR>
International Monetary Fund head Michel Camdessus on Friday pledged support for South Africa's macro-economic plan, saying it was the right strategy for the country.  "We in the IMF consider that the strategies for growth, employment and redistribution which the government announced on June 14 are exactly right", Camdessus said after a meeting with President Nelson Mandela.<BR><P>
EU URGES GOVT, LABOUR SYNERGY <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The SA labour movement and government had to address development challenges together, European Union (EU) ambassador Erwan Fouéré said on Friday.   Speaking at the launch of the Labour Development Trust, funded by the European Union, Fouéré said SA was facing key internal and external challenges that required the development and building of skills.<BR><P>
EMIGRATION FIGURES RING WARNING BELL <I>(Business Times)</I><BR>
The exact cost of crime is imponderable, but its effects are increasingly evident.  The most damaging consequence of crime is the exodus of skilled South Africans, skills which the economy has not been able to replace.  According to the Central Statistical Services, 5 627 people emigrated from South Africa in the first six months of this year, a 24% increase on the first half of 1995.  The majority of emigrants cited crime as their main reason for leaving.<BR><P>

<p>PHYSICAL GOLD MARKET IN EQUILIBRIUM <i>(Reuters)</i><br>
The physical gold market has reached a state of equilibrium around current price levels, Anglo American marketing director 
Kelvin Williams said on Thursday.<br>
</p>
<p>TEPID GOLD MINING CONTINUES AT ANGLO <i>(Business Day, Jhb.)</i><br>
The uninspiring September gold quarterlies season continued yesterday, with Anglo American Corporation's gold mines 
reporting a 3% fall in aggregate earnings to R312,3m, in spite of a 4% rise in the average gold price received, to R54 919kg.<br>
</p>
<p>ANGLO'S STANCE ON LONRHO DENIED <i>(Business Day)</i><br>
Lonrho said it saw no foundation in a newspaper report saying that Anglo American declined to exercise an option to give it a 
25,7% stake in the British group. &quot;There is no foundation whatsoever in that report&quot;, a Lonrho spokesman said.<br>
</p>
<p>GOLD FIELDS CLAIMS IGNORANCE OF STRIKE VOTE <i>(Business Report, Jhb.)</i><br>
Gold Fields management yesterday claimed complete ignorance of Wednesday's overwhelming union vote for strikes at their 
Northam Platinum mine. The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) informed management in writing late on Wednesday that 
about 4 000 union members at the mine voted by 96,8% in favour of industrial action, Mahlakeng Mahlakeng, the NUM's 
Rustenburg co-ordinator said yesterday.<br>
</p>
<p>IMPARTIALITY QUERIED <i>(New Nation, weekly on Fridays)</i><br>
Government&#146;s judicial inquiry into violence at three Gold Fields mines is coming up against a serious credibility challenge with 
questions being posed about aspects of the commission&#146;s report. When released earlier this week, NUM cautiously welcomed 
some of the commission chairperson Judge John Myburgh&#146;s recommendations. However, the Congress of SA Trade Unions 
(Cosatu), in a preliminary response expressed extreme concern at the impression that &quot;holding peaceful demonstrations and 
marches of necessity leads to violence&quot;. <i>[Judge Myburgh's, who is also President of the Labour Court, report was 
critical of both labour and management in the underlying causes for the violence which claimed 43 lives - Ed.]</i><br>
<b><i>... and ...</i></b><br>
COSATU CALLS OFF MEETING WITH IMF HEAD OVER TIME ALLOCATION <i>(Business Day)</i><br>
Cosatu called off a meeting yesterday with International Monetary Fund MD Michel Camdessus, saying that 30 minutes was 
insufficient time to discuss a range of issues. Cosatu media officer Nowetu Mpati said Cosatu reiterated its dislike of both the 
IMF and World Bank because of their record in developing countries and the conditions imposed on impoverished countries 
in terms of their policies which, [Cosatu] said, undermined such countries&#146; sovereignty. Meanwhile, a group of protesters 
representing the National Progressive Primary Healthcare Network stormed the VIP lounge at the airport yesterday. They 
were protesting against Camdessus&#146; visit to SA because of the IMF's influence on government policy.<br>
</p>
<p>MBOWENI SEES A REVOLUTION IN LABOUR RELATIONS <i>(Business Day)</i><br>
A major revolution is taking place in SA labour relations which is moving away from an adversarial system towards one of 
greater co-operation, says Labour Minister Tito Mboweni. Addressing a National Business Initiative seminar yesterday on 
proposals for an employment and occupational equity statute, Mboweni said the intense confrontational approach traditionally 
adopted by the parties was subsiding.<br>
</p>
<p>BANK REPORT FINDS HOPE OF SUCCESS FOR SA ECONOMY <i>(Business Day)</i><br>
LONDON - SA may yet deliver an economic surprise that matches its recent political feats, UBS Global Research says in its 
latest quarterly report on the SA economy. Compiled for the Union Bank of Switzerland, the report painted a much more 
positive picture of the country's prospects than previous statements, which some analysts have identified as the trigger for the 
rand's collapse earlier in the year.<br>
</p>
<p>EU BOOSTS LABOUR DEVELOPMENT <i>(Business Day)</i><br>
The building of skills and resources within the labour movement will be given a boost when the Labour Development Trust, 
funded by the European Union, is launched in Johannesburg today. The EU said yesterday it would provide a R23,6m grant 
towards the establishment of the trust, whose board would consist of union representatives, two observers from the EU and 
the Labour Department, the National Council of Trade Unions, Cosatu and the Federation of SA Labour Unions( Fedsal). 
The trust formed part of the EU's programme for reconstruction and development which had agreed to grant SA between 
R500m and R600m a year until 1999.<br>
</p>
<p>GOVT REGULATION &#145;SCARES INVESTORS&#146; <i>(Business Day)</i><br>
Excessive government regulation in the business sector could scare off foreign investors, losing offshore investment which was 
the single biggest driver of economic miracles, life insurer, Old Mutual's, senior economist Terence Moll said yesterday. He 
told an Institute for Futures Research seminar that foreign investors were both selective and discriminating. About 90% of the 
developing world's $90bn in direct foreign investment last year was directed to only 15 countries; SA received a mere 0,4% of 
last year's foreign investment pie. He said government should be taking its own growth, employment and redistribution polices 
more seriously, with a priority being to modify the economic environment to boost business.<br>
</p>
<p>LEADERS DISCUSS CORRIDOR PLANS <i>(Business Report)</i><br>
A high-level delegation of Cabinet ministers from SA, Mozambique and Swaziland conducted an aerial survey yesterday of 
Swaziland's northern and eastern regions through which the proposed Maputo corridor routes from SA to Mozambique's 
southern Maputo province will be constructed.<br>
</p>
<p>ERWIN SLAMS LOAN CRITICS <i>(Business Mail, with the Mail &amp; Guardian on Fridays)</i><br>
Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin this week dismissed suggestions that the proposed $70m World Bank loan signalled a 
deviation from stated government policy. &quot;This is not a new borrowing initiative. We have set borrowing limits for this financial 
year and coming years, sourced from the domestic capital market, the international market and international financial 
institutions (IFI). This is merely the first slice of the IFI component.&quot; The World Bank doesn't just hand out money; funds have 
to be targeted towards certain projects. So this particular programme seemed the perfect starting point, being a scheme 
designed to promote export competitiveness, worked out in close co-operation between the departments of Finance and 
Trade and Industry.<br>
</p>
<p>WHERE THERE IS SMOKE, THERE ARE BOUND TO BE MIRRORS <i>(Business Report)</i><br>
In a world where the political left seems in general retreat and the globalisation of capital holds sway, SA is in a unique 
position. It is the only country which contains in government a trade union federation with a recent and militant history and a 
communist party, both of which remain committed to &quot;socialism&quot;. This gives rise to a situation where sometimes fierce debate is 
inevitable. It also means that, while the government will continue to govern, it will also continue to face criticism, pressure and 
debate from within its own ranks. Such pressure is about to intensify over coming weeks. Despite declarations about its 
general non-negotiability, the government's macro-economic GEAR (Growth, Economy, And Redistribution) strategy remains 
the focus of sharp argument. Much of the debate has been raging within the SACP. It is about to spill into the public arena 
which should have a considerable ripple effect throughout the trade union movement from which the SA Communist Party 
draws the bulk of its support.<br>

CHAMBER PREDICTS DROP IN GOLD OUTPUT <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>
ISTANBUL - Gold miners of SA, the world's main gold producing country, said yesterday they were expecting output for this year to fall to about 500 tonnes from 522 tonnes last year in line with a decline in productivity and pressure from prices and costs.<BR><P>
DEVELOPING WORLD SET TO TAKE LEAD IN MINING <I>(Business Day, Jhb.)</I><BR>
ISTANBUL - Gold production in Latin America, Asia and the former Soviet Union is growing more rapidly than in SA, the US, Australia and Canada, Gold Fields Mineral Services CE Stewart Murray said yesterday.<BR><P>
DEFT MANAGEMENT MAKES DUIKER A STAR <I>(Business Report, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Duiker Mining, which recently celebrated its 50th anniversary, has been one of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's star performers over the past five years and, judging by the upbeat mood of its executives, it seems there is more to come.<BR><P>
JCI RESTRUCTURES TO FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
JCI Ltd has announced a plan to hive off nine of its internal non-core business units, affecting a third of the company's strategic focus.  About 250 people would be affected by the move, including members of the company's head office security and organisational development. Chairman Bill Nairn said this would focus the group on its core business and further growth strategy ambitions. Options open were to out-source non-core services or establish the service as a free-standing business unit.<BR><P>
BLYVOOR BUYS INTO ANGLO MINE <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Randgold's Blyvooruitzicht has bought part of Anglo American's Western  Deep Levels mine for R25,5m in an area where the companies already co-operate.  The area lies in the Carbon Leader Reef where the two mine operations almost touch.  Anglo finds it expensive to mine the tribute because of a geological fault on its side, but has allowed Blyvoor to work the area since 1992, splitting costs and revenues.<BR><P>
WAGE STRIKE LOOMS AT NORTHAM <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) voted overwhelmingly to strike at the Gold Fields-owned Northam platinum mine yesterday.  About 4 000 union members at the mine, 3 400 paid-up and 600 signed-up members, carried the vote by 96,8% in favour of industrial action over Gold Fields' pay offer.<BR>  
<B><I>... and ...</I></B><BR>
WALKOUT COULD PRECIPITATE MINE MERGER <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
A strike by unionised workers at SA's troubled Northam Platinum Mine could hasten a merger with neighbouring Rustenburg Platinum Mines, analysts said yesterday.  NUM said 96,8% of its 3 300 members at Northam had voted in favour of strike action over wages .<I>[These two reports, one under the other, are by different reporters - hence the numbers discrepancy. Although, in fairness, NUM seems to have been the source in both cases... - Ed.]</I><BR><P>
<A HREF="http://www.bullion.org.za/releases/myburgh2.htm">CHAMBER BACKS MINE INQUIRY</A> <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
The Chamber of Mines, the umbrella organisation for SA's mining houses, has pledged its 'unreserved' support for the extension of the terms of reference of the Myburgh commission of inquiry into mine violence.  Judge John Myburgh was appointed by President Nelson Mandela to investigate the violence at three Gold Fields-owned mines after the death of 42 miners and injuries to 203 others.<I> [The Citizen, Business Day and Sowetan carried this story, from a Chamber media release, yesterday. - Ed.]</I><BR><P>
SA (PTY) LTD SUFFERS AS ASSETS DRIBBLE AWAY <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
SA's biggest asset is widely regarded as its abundant mineral wealth.  All assets, however, require to be turned to account. Further reflection, therefore, points to the nation's skills base as an even more important asset.  SA's untapped mineral resources exceed those that have thus far been tapped.  They are there and they are not going away.  In alarming contrast, the nation's other major asset is dribbling away fast - and precious little is being done about it.<BR><P>
JOB NEEDS WILL BE THE SOLE TEST, SAYS CONTRACTOR <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Rehiring 1 700 sacked workers on the Lesotho Highlands Water Project would be based solely on operational requirements and not on personalities, Peter Streng, the contractors' industrial relations manager said yesterday.<BR><P>
EU CALLS FOR REALISTIC WATER PRICE <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
The European Union should only fund water projects in SA if the government's long-term aim is to sell water at a price that would cover its true costs, Manfred Vohrer, a consultant to the EU, said yesterday.  Vohrer said the scarcity of water, in both clean water supply and sanitation, should be reflected by its price to consumers.<BR><P>
CHASM BETWEEN POOR AND RICH NATIONS WIDENS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Poverty has soared despite unprecedented growth in the world economy in the past 50 years, with the gap between rich and poor nations becoming even starker, the UN Development Programme said yesterday.  The programme released the figures to mark World Anti-poverty Day today, and used the symbolic day to urge rich nations to boost their development aid contributions to poorer countries.<BR><P>
LETS RID SA GOLD MINES OF FINITE HORIZONS <I>(Mining Weekly, 11/10/96)</I><BR>
South African mining companies are duty-bound to improve the worth of their assets to international investors. Failing to do so could seriously under-capitalise SAs mining effort at a time when it needs optimum investment. There are regular complaints about the lack of labour productivity in SA. But what about poor investment productivity implicit in outdated company structuring?<BR><P>

FALLING SA GOLD OUTPUT TO CAUSE WORLD SHORTAGE <I>(Business Report, Jhb.)</I><BR>
ISTANBUL - A sharp squeeze on global gold supply can be expected, mainly because of an expected decline in the output of SA, the world's largest producer of the precious metal, Alan Mackie, a gold specialist at the London-based Economic Intelligence Unit said yesterday.<BR><P>
OUTLOOK POSITIVE FOR GOLD DEMAND <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>
LONDON - The many influences which will decide gold demand as the market moves into its five months of peak consumption are "fairly benign and possibly even positive", says the chief executive of Gold Fields Minerals Service.<BR><P>
RANDGOLD & EXPLORATION  TAKES OVER BHP <I>(Business Day,Jhb.)</I><BR>
Randgold & Exploration's Randgold Resources formally took over BHP Minerals Mali, renamed Randgold Resources Mali, after settling the $30m cash component of the deal, the group said yesterday.<BR><P>
AVMIN HURT BY LOW PRODUCTIVITY, RISING COSTS <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Anglovaal Minerals gold mining companies reported a 34% drop in taxed profits to R49,1m for the September quarter after experiencing rising costs and low productivity.<BR><P>
ET CONS TAKES A SLIDE INTO THE RED AFTER TWO DECADES <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Eastern Transvaal Consolidated (ET Cons) provided the low point in Anglovaal Minerals' September quarter as the annual negotiated wage increase and lower productivity took their toll, the group said yesterday.<BR><P>
GENGOLD OUTLINES PLANS FOR BETTER MINE SAFETY <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Gengold was hoping to improve productivity and safety on its mines through its policy of promoting black workers to leadership positions, Gengold MD Tom Dale said yesterday.  The fatality rate in deep-level SA gold mines was unacceptable, Dale said.<BR><P>
ANGLO UNBUNDLING A POSSIBILITY <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
On the face of it, there was nothing new to the restructuring of Anglo American's assets referred to by Anglo's Michael Spicer in an interview with the <I>Financial Times</I> last week.  In his June chairman's statement, Julian Ogilvie Thompson stressed that Anglo was not about to unbundle.  "We have said before that within Anglo's broad South African portfolio there are interests that may not be core holdings if circumstances were to change".  However, he said, there are two material considerations:  exchange controls would have to be abolished, "new mining opportunities, for instance, are more likely to be found elsewhere in Africa and internationally", and alternative investment opportunities, at least matching returns from existing assets, would need to be identified.<BR><P>
NORTHAM COULD FACE MORE TROUBLE <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
The result of a National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) strike ballot expected today will determine whether Northam Platinum mine begins the fourth quarter in the same grim vein in which it finished the past quarter.<BR><P>
GOLD FIELDS' QUARTERLIES  <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
The atmosphere at Gold Fields' quarterly results conference earlier this week was crypt-like:  a dark room and gloomy faces giving out some of the worst results for a gold mining house in SA for some time.  Mine violence and underground fires had slashed earnings, and the impression was that the new SA had passed them by.  Zulus were  basically interested in earning money and working rather than joining unions, said one senior board member.<BR><P>
JOHNNIC FUNDRAISING UNDERMINES DEAL'S OBJECTIVES <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Members of the National Empowerment Consortium (NEC) are planning to approach Anglo American to persuade it to interfere in a divisive fund-raising exercise that threatens to undermine many of the objectives of the company's sale of its stake in Johnnic to the NEC.<BR><P>
NEDLAC LAUNCHES LABOUR WORKSHOP PROGRAMME <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
The National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) announced in Johannesburg yesterday that it had launched a R2m programme of labour-management workshops to meet the challenge of SA's workplace.  The aim was to enhance co-operation between workers and management to boost the country's competitiveness, and employment creation by improving industrial performance and productivity, the council said.<BR><P>
EU TRADE OFFER DELAYED TO PROTECT REGION <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Government had taken months to respond to the European Union's offer because it wanted to ensure that the EU was not granted generous market access at the expense of SA's neighbours, Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said yesterday.<BR><P>
SYFRETS ECONOMIST PREDICTS INTEREST RATE CUTS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Slowing consumer demand, a shift in investment spending and the improvement in export earnings were likely to ease pressure on the balance of payments, paving the way for at least three interest rate reductions next year, Syfrets chief economist Sandra Gordon said yesterday.<BR><P>
UNION LETTER ON RESTRUCTURING 'IS REAL' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The Federation of SA Labour Unions (Fedsal) yesterday denied claims by the SA Railway and Harbour Workers' Union that a letter signed jointly by Cosatu (the Congress of SA Trade Unions) and Fedsal representatives and sent to transportation parastatal, Transnet, SA Airways and rail company, Spoornet management was fictitious.  The letter in question accused Spoornet and SAA of breaching and circumventing the process outlined in the national framework agreement on state asset restructuring.<BR><P>
HOW FOREIGN AID CAN DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Nobody concerned with SA's future economic welfare can question the desirability of genuine foreign investment.  We need access to foreign savings to fund enterprises that will be profitable to borrower and lender alike.  Such investment, however, should be distinguished from, on the one hand, foreign aid for Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) purposes and, on the other, soft loans for foreign countries whose own interests may conflict with ours.<BR><P>
PRESS FREEDOM A COMPLEX ISSUE, SAYS CHASKALSON <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Rights were never absolute and Press freedom was no exception, Constitutional Court president Justice Arthur Chaskalson said yesterday.  "Press freedom does not entitle journalists to trample upon the dignity and privacy of others - a constraint that some journalists and newspapers are reluctant to acknowledge", he told a Commonwealth Press Union conference in Cape Town.<BR><P>
TREVOR MANUEL <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Trevor Manuel has being growing in confidence ever since he became Minister of Finance earlier this year, but unfortunately he has elected to become more hard-nosed with the media as his confidence grows. On Monday he again reacted aggressively in front of the nine ministers of finance of the provinces to a reporter's question, saying that what was discussed in a meeting of the budget council in parliament "has nothing to do with" the journalist, and warned that "there will be big trouble if anything said in the meeting is to leak out".  At the same time, the Press is berated by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki for not reporting on government activities and pronouncements.<BR><P>
ASSETS CANNOT BE NATIONALISED <I>(Sake-Beeld, Jhb.)</I><BR>
CAPE TOWN - The new Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs, Penuel Maduna, told the standing committee on mineral and energy affairs that legislators who try to make mineral rights available to blacks must be realistic. Nationalisation of mineral rights was an option which could not be considered and mine companies could not be expected to make mineral rights available to the state free of charge.<BR><P>
SOUTH AFRICA: HOW WRONG IS IT GOING? <I>(The Economist - 12/10/96)</I><BR>
Following on <I>TIMEs </I>recent cover report on the "post-miracle phase" in South Africas development, <I>The Economist</I> has published a three-page cover piece which, while not as broad-ranging as <I>TIME, </I>offers greater perspicacity and is more critical. It lists lawlessness, unemployment and political accountability as the three "new anxieties" in SA. It says "lawlessness feeds the feeling that the government is not in control" and that "part of the solution must be political will". Turning to unemployment, the weekly says: "SAs unresponsive labour market is not the result only of strong unions and labour protection. True, there are government-imposed non-wage costs, and it is costly to hire and difficult to fire. So companies look for capital-intensive, not labour-intensive, ways to grow. But the markets stickiness is also a product of apartheids inferior education for blacks; unskilled black labour is cheap, but unproductive; skilled is scare, and costly." In the short-run, joblessness will probably worsen since foreign investments have been mostly in existing companies, and "not in greenfield investments creating immediate jobs". Finally, <I>The Economist</I> lists the new constitution, the fact that the Western Cape and KwaZulu/Natal are not governed by the ANC, the rise of informal organisations and a vigilant Press as the best safeguards against SA going the way of Zimbabwe - "a supposed multiparty democracy ruled as a de facto one-party state, with a government that rides in limousines, periodically clamps down on the Press, and blames white ownership of the economy for the countrys ills". The report concludes: "Asia-like economic success or stagnant African disappointment? Mundane reality will surely lie in between". <I>[summarised by Editor]</I><BR><P>

FIRES, VIOLENCE TAKE TOLL AT GOLD FIELDS <I>(Business Day, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Violence and underground fires took their toll at gold mines managed by Gold Fields of SA in the September quarter, reducing pre-capex profit 23% to R275m. Operating profit was one-third lower as all but one mine failed to sustain or increase gold production. This contrasts with Gencors gold division, Gengold, which kicked off the quarterly reporting period with earnings growth of 1,8% to R57,4m.<BR>
<B><I>... and ...</I></B><BR>
GENGOLD MINES' EARNINGS OFFSET 9% WAGE INCREASE <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Gengold took a 9% mid-year wage increase on the chin in the September quarter by lifting bottom-line earnings for the five Gengold mines 1,8% to R57,4m after increased output and a higher average gold price.<BR><P>
NUM MEMBERS BALLOT FOR STRIKE AT NORTHAM <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The National Union of Mineworkers began balloting for a strike at Gold Fields' Northam Platinum mine yesterday after a dispute over wages that was declared before the outbreak of violence at the mine in August.<BR><P>
UNION WASHES ITS HANDS OF LETTER <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The SA Railway and Harbour Workers' Union yesterday distanced itself from a document allegedly written jointly by the Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) and the Federation of SA Labour (Fedsal) representatives, accusing SA Airways and rail company Spoornet of breaching the national framework agreement (NFA) on state asset restructuring. <BR><P>
GOVT SWITCH ON INFRASTRUCTURE POLICY <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Government was steering away from its R60bn-R90bn "grand 10-year plan" for the provision of municipal infrastructure, towards a year-on-year spending programme, Constitutional Development Department director-general Andrew Boraine said yesterday.<BR><P>
SA 'MUST LURE LONG-TERM INVESTMENT <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The volatility of capital movement over the past two years was a stark indication of the need for SA to attract long-term direct investments rather than portfolio and short-term capital, Reserve Bank economic adviser Ernie van der Merwe said yesterday.<BR><P>
DAIMLER-BENZ HEAD MAKES CASE FOR BELIEF IN SA <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Daimler-Benz AG chairman Jurgen Schrempp has reaffirmed his company's commitment to SA's economic future, saying opportunities associated with investing in SA far outweigh the risk.<BR><P>
NOT A RECIPE FOR PEACE AND GOODWILL <I>(Business Report, Jhb)</I><BR>
The Reserve Bank recently expressed its concern about the low level of net personal saving.  It has been low before.  In 1990 it amounted to about 1% of personal disposable income.  Then it made a welcome revival to about 5% in 1993, but has fallen again to 0.9% in the second quarter of this year.  This is not a tenable situation.<BR><P>
SA UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS NOT AS BAD AS IT SEEMS, ILO REPORT SHOWS <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
The SA unemployment rate is not as high as figures usually show, the International Labour Organisation said in a government-requested report published in Geneva yesterday.  The 500-page study said unemployment was substantial, but the generally suggested unemployment rate of 33% was probably exaggerated and a rate of 20% was closer to reality.  It stressed the risk of loss of international confidence that might result from an erroneous view of the labour market.<BR><P>
LABOUR STANDARDS 'VITAL TO SUSTAIN ECONOMIC GROWTH <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
A set of minimum and socially acceptable labour standards and re-distributive policies did not compromise economic growth as suggested by critics, but were necessary for sustainable and long-term success, Labour Minister Tito Mboweni said yesterday.<BR><P>
LABOUR READY TO REOPEN TALKS ON SOCIAL PACT <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Fresh attempts would be made to negotiate an overarching social accord on growth, despite major differences between key social partners at the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac), labour sources said yesterday.  Efforts to hammer out an accord hit a snag earlier in the year following the release of two contrasting documents, first by business and then by labour.<BR><P>
PLAN AIMS TO CUT POPULATION GROWTH <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Government yesterday published a draft programme to cut population growth, but without the controversial targets set by the previous government.  The document lists 24 strategies for population development, ranging from improved data collection and analysis to interdepartmental co-ordination of legislation.  It identifies poverty as 'one of the most formidable enemies of choice' and highlights the need to take medical services to rural women.<BR><P>

WEAK RAND WILL AID SA'S STRUGGLING GOLD MINES <I>(Business Day,Jhb.)</I><BR>
Rising costs and a weak dollar gold price will be key factors in the performance of SA's gold mines, due to report on the September quarter from today, analysts said at the weekend.  However, the continued slide in the value of the rand against the dollar, currently about R4,55, would come to the aid of struggling mines as in the previous quarter, they said.<BR><P>
ANGLOVAAL FOLLOWS MINING INDUSTRY TREND <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The decision by Anglovaal to cancel its management contracts with its group mines has invited comparison with similar decisions by Randgold and Gengold, amid rumblings from overseas investors about the way some of these contracts have been valued.<BR><P>
UNIONS TAP FUNDS FOR STAKE IN JOHNNIC <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The labour component of the National Empowerment Consortium will form a new investment vehicle to finance the unions' 17,5% stake in Johnnic, raising capital from union-linked institutions by offering Johnnic shares at a discount.  The unions would essentially tap their members' pension and provident funds to fund their shareholding in Johnnic.<BR><P>
COSATU TEAMS UP TO MAKE BID FOR PROTEA <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The Congress of SA Trade Unions', the country's largest union federation, investment trust Kopano Ke Matla, has put together a consortium with other black groups to submit a bid for a controlling stake in Protea Assurance, owned by UK group Royal Sun Alliance.<BR><P>
UNION INVESTMENT UNDER FIRE FROM LABOUR BULLETIN <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Trade union investment companies surrounded by confusion and secrecy would force unions to decide whether they were in the business of business or of trade unionism, an article published in the latest <I>SA Labour Bulletin</I> suggests.  The article, "union investment new opportunities, new threats", written by an unnamed <I>Labour Bulletin</I> special correspondent, questions whether labour's foray into the companies was an appropriate way for unions to invest their money.<BR><P>
PARTIES POSITIVE ON CONSTITUTION <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The adoption of the revised constitution by the Constitutional Assembly on Friday was without the pomp and ceremony of the first time, but parties were more confident about the Constitutional Court certifying it this time.  Assembly Chairman Cyril Ramaphosa cautioned though against premature celebration as happened in May when the first draft was adopted.<BR><P>
SLOW SPENDING OF JAPANESE AID FUNDS COULD HARM TALKS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Government has been slow in spending the $1,3bn two-year Japanese programme awarded in 1994 - a delay that could undermine development officials when they lobby for an extension of the package.  In London, Japanese Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund chief representative Nobuo Hazeyama said at the weekend the reasons for the slow pace at which the official aid component was being drawn included SA officials' cautiousness <I>[sic]</I>.  "They say they don't want to make mistakes', he said.<BR><P>
JUDGE FINDS MULTIPLE CAUSES FOR MINE VIOLENCE <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Mine violence has to be viewed in the context of factors such as continuing political conflict between ANC and IFP supporters, fear of job displacement  and the migrant labour and single-sex hostel system, a commission of inquiry into mine violence has concluded.  Chairman of the inquiry into violence at Gold Fields' East Driefontein, Leeudoorn and Northam mines, Judge John Myburgh said in his report released at the weekend that these and other factors influenced developments on the three mines.<BR>
<B><I>... but ...</I></B><BR>
NUM WARY OF STRONGER WITNESS PROTECTION PLAN <I>(Business Report, Jhb.)</I><BR>
The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) rejected immediate implementation of a witness protection programme at the weekend because it was inappropriate to conditions in the mine hostel environment.  The programme seeks to protect witnesses to the violence which left 42 Gold Fields miners dead and 203 injured earlier this year:  Judge John Myburgh recommended that the programme be strengthened in his commission of inquiry into violence.<BR><P>
TELKOM PRIVATISATION STAKE MAY RISE <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The sale of 10% stake in Telkom, SA's telecommunications parastatal, to a black economic empowerment group could boost the total stake government would sell to 40%, a Posts and Telecommunications Ministry spokesman said at the weekend.  Government had previously indicated that between 20% and 30% of Telkom would be sold to a strategic equity partner.  The latest development would not only boost the stake, but could also increase the amount of funding government would receive as a result of the sale.<BR>
<B><I>... and ...</I></B><BR>
PHONE CONNECTIONS <I>(Business Day Editorial Comment)</I><BR>
Telkom's decision to make 10% of its equity available to black economic empowerment groups and worker organisations displays a pragmatic understanding of political and social needs.  There has never been any question that SA state assets could be sent along the privatisation route based on price alone.  Political realities have to be taken into account.  And this is where the word empowerment is significant.  Empowerment does  not and should not equate to enrichment.  There would be little point in selling state assets preferentially to black interests if those assets are merely sold on promptly at a quick profit.<BR>
<B><I>... and, also ...</I></B><BR>
PRIVATISATION WILL BE A KEY THEME OF TONY BLAIR'S VISIT <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Tony Blair, the leader of Britain's Labour Party, is visiting SA this week.  Economics will occupy an important role in his agenda, especially given its importance by the recent visit to SA of the Lord Mayor of London, who officially opened the British consulate-general's new offices in Dunkeld, Johannesburg.  While opinions differ as to which country is SA's largest trading partner, because of the way the statistics are derived, Britain claims this distinction with last year's exports to this country of £1,8b and imports of £1,1b.<BR><P>
INDUSTRY ACCEPTS PROTECTION IS NOW PAST <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
SA has until recently been notorious for its complex tariff structure.  The complexity stemmed in part from the high degree of protection given to the country's industries, a direct legacy of the apartheid past.  However, with the country's offer to GATT - the ambitious global project to liberalise trade - SA committed itself not only to breaking down its high tariff walls, but also to simplifying the 8 000-item tariff structure.<BR><P>
SA'S DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS UNDER FIRE <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
SA's foreign policy has again come under fire following the disclosure that diplomatic relations have been established with more countries that have poor human rights records.  In reply to a parliamentary question from opposition National Party MP Boy Geldenhuys, Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo gave a list of countries with whom full diplomatic relations have been established since January last year.  The most controversial on the list are Myanmar (formerly Burma) and Burundi.<BR><P>
R10M LOST IN LESOTHO STRIKE <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
The cost of the month-long standstill at the Lesotho Highlands Water Project since an illegal strike brought operations to a halt early last month is estimated at R10-million, David Darcy, the contractors' project director, said at the weekend.<BR><P>
ESKOM TO SPEND R5BN OVER FIVE YEARS TO EXPAND ELECTRICITY NETWORK <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

GOLD USE IN COINAGE UP 32% IN 1995 <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>
NEW YORK - World-wide use of gold in coinage rose 32% in 1995 to more than 3.3-million ounces, up from 2.5-million ounces in 1994, according to a report published annually by the Gold Institute.<BR><P>

ANALYSTS SCEPTICAL OF AVGOLD TARGETS <I>(Business Day, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Mining house Anglovaal's proposed new gold mining company, Avgold, hopes to lower its average gold working costs from about $285 at present to $200 an ounce 'beyond 2005" - but some analysts are sceptical.  The house believes an average working cost of $200 an ounce would place it high in the international rankings, comparable to some of the best on offer to overseas investors in countries such as the US and Australia.<BR><P>
TELKOM STAKE SET ASIDE FOR BLACK GROUPS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Ten percent of the telecommunications parastatal, Telkom's, equity would be sold to black economic empowerment groups and worker organisations, in addition to the 20% to 30% stake which would be sold to a 'strategic equity partner', Telecommunications Minister Jay Naidoo said yesterday.<BR><P>
GOVT TO BOLSTER FUNDS OF AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LOAN FACILITY <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Government had agreed to contribute funds to replenish the African development fund, the African Development Bank's soft loan facility, the Finance Ministry said yesterday.  The Ministry could not say how much the contribution would be, but it was likely to be made in the next financial year.  Earlier this year, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said at the bank's annual meeting that SA intended to become the first regional member to contribute to the fund.<BR><P>
PROPOSED TOURISM TAX DRAWS CRITICISM <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Increased revenues flowing from the introduction of a dedicated tourism exit tax would be offset by increased administration costs and fewer tourists to SA, the Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry said yesterday.<BR><P>
PARLIAMENTARY BODIES GRAPPLE WITH EU'S FREE-WHEELING PARANOIA <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Three parliamentary committees held a joint meeting this week to hear submissions on the European Union 'negotiating mandate' for a free trade area, ahead of formulation  of SA's response.  Like many parliamentary hearings, it was unsatisfactory because so few politicians attended.  Nevertheless, despite the media and submitters outnumbering politicians three to one, the hearings provided a useful opportunity to gather a wide spread of opinions about the EU's proposal and to generate some new ideas.<BR><P>
ESTIMATED BUDGET DEFICIT IN SIGHT <I>(Business Report, Jhb.)</I><BR>
The government is on track to reach the estimated budged deficit of 5,1%, before borrowing, of estimated GDP, the Finance Department said yesterday.  Government expenditure, as measured by requests to the exchequer from spending agencies and provinces, for the first half of this financial year reached R85,5b, or 49% of budgeted spending for the year, the Department said.<BR><P>
INDIFFERENCE TO CRIME THE DANGER <I>(Cape Times, Cape Town)</I><BR>
The efforts of the People Against Gangsterism And Drugs to stop crime had to be channelled in a legitimate direction so that the community worked with the police and not against them, the Western Capes attorney-general Frank Khan, SC, said yesterday.  He said "indifference" by a community to crime was a bigger threat to the stability of the country than efforts by Pagad to bring gangsters to book.  For this reason controlled community policing, using Pagads "emotion" had to be encouraged.<BR><P>

Visiting Lord Mayor of London Sir John Chalstrey was confident UK investment in SA would reach about £55bn from the present £10bn, he said yesterday.

TUTU CHAMPIONS FREE PRESS <I>(Cape Times, Cape Town)</I><BR>
South Africas new democracy would be stillborn without a vigorous and free press, chairperson of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Archbishop Desmond Tutu said last night.

A broad Western Cape grouping - concerned with the extent to which coloureds in the region have been politically marginalised - are to launch a new "broad social movement", the "December 1st Movement".

ASSET SWAP DEALS ARE 'FULLY LEGAL'<I>(Business Report, The Star, Jhb.)</I><BR>
SA fund managers said yesterday that the asset swaps into which they had entered did not contravene US legislation, following Wednesday's disclosure that the US Securities and Exchange Commission was unhappy with quid pro quo asset swaps concluded between SA and US institutions.<BR><P>
A PROMISED LAND OF "PAP 'N VLEIS", WITH GRAVY, FOR ALL  <I>(Business Day, Jhb.)</I><BR>
SA's trade union movement is, by general admission, facing a time of massive uncertainty.  Born out of struggle as much against the state as the employers, it now finds itself part of an alliance in the govt and  a partner with business in forums such as Nedlac.  Here it is charged with policy formulation in a global economic environment of intense competition.<BR><P>
EMPLOYMENT FALLS ACROSS THE BOARD IN JUNE<I>(Business Report, The Star, Jhb.)</I><BR>

RATE CUT COULD TRIGGER BULL RUN ON JSE<I>(Business Report, The Star, Jhb.)</I><BR>

DOUBTS GROW OVER LRA  <I>(Business Mail, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Business and labour are worried that the new Labour relations act (LRA) could trip up before it even gets off the starting blocks on Nov 11.

AT HOME WITH A MACROPLAN<I>(Business Report, The Star, Jhb.)</I><BR>
The labour movement ha not yet declared its acceptance of the macroplan, as it had done with the state's programme for state asset restructuring.  The ingrained mistrust by the labour movement of everything which emanates from the IMF and World Bank (and certain circles in parliament) may become an obstacle in the way of general acceptance of the macroplan.  But many of the IMF principles should be acceptable to labour, and it would be unwise for the unions to stand in the way of a plan which has become the model for others in the world, just because labour dislikes aspect of it.<BR><P>

EASING OF EXCHANGE CONTROLS BOOSTED INVESTMENT<I>(Business Day, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Washington - Moves to ease exchange controls had allowed SA companies to make foreign direct investments of more than R9bn over the past three years, Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals said yesterday.  He told a conference arranged by the economics dept of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that SA had pulled off "major relaxations" in exchange controls.<BR><P>

MOOD IS UPBEAT IN WARDS OF DOCTOR DEBT <I>(Business Day, Jhb.)</I><BR>
The IMF and the bank say the world is reaping the benefits of their policy prescriptions.  But those policies, and the two organisations' modus operandi, have often been at the centre of controversy because of their effect on the poor and on the environment.  To their credit, the two organisations appear to have responded to the criticism.  Nowhere is that more obvious than in the initiative to provide debt relief to poor countries - a move that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.<BR><P>

LABOUR, GOVT STRATEGY TALKS ON TRACK <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Negotiations between labour and government on the macro-economic strategy released in June could move into top gear following the endorsement by the Congress of SA Trade Union's (Cosatu) second largest affiliate at the weekend of an economic vision for transformation.  The economic policy consisted of strategies to effect the implementation of a social welfare system and a trade and industry policy.

IFP RETURNS TO SUB-COMMITTEES DRAFTING CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES <I>(Cape Times, Cape Town)</I><BR>
The Inkatha Freedom Party said yesterday it had decided to end its 18-month boycott of the drafting of the countrys final constitution.  Senior IFP official Walter Felgate said this did not amount to a decision to return to the full Constitutional Assembly, which is composed of all members of Parliament.  Clauses referred back to the assembly by the court include those dealing with the powers of provincial administrations, one of the main sticking points between the IFP and the ANC.  The IFP wants a great deal of autonomy for the provinces in a federal-type arrangement, but the ANC wants the central government to wield most power.<BR><P>
SOMEBODY COULD GET HURT IN LATEST CONSTITUTIONAL FREE-FOR-ALL <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Cosatu and the ANC complained volubly - and not without justification - last week that the Democratic Party and National Party (and, they may have added, Business SA) were sneakily trying to reintroduce a lockout clause through the back door as the Constitutional Assembly seeks to redraft the constitution.  What the left-of-centre allies failed to mention is that they, equally sneakily, are trying to reinforce constitutional support for centralised bargaining.  So here we are in a situation where business and labour and their respective political allies are all rushing headlong for the back door, doing their best to elbow their adversaries out of the way so they can get in first and slam the door shut.<BR><P>
SA RESIDENCE DEADLINE EXTENDED  <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

WASHINGTON - SA is taking part in discussions of the IMF's most important policy making committee after Finance Minister Trevor Manuel's election as an alternative member of the powerful interim committee.

THE CHINA OPTION <I>(Business Day Editorial Comment)</I><BR>
President Nelson Mandela's announcement that SA is to cut diplomatic relations with the Republic of China in favour of the mainland is surprising and even bewildering because it constitutes such a marked departure from almost every-thing he has said before on the subject.  His repeated assertions that it would be immoral to make the change now appear to have been a string of empty promises.<BR><P>
STRANGE BEDFELLOWS IN BUSINESS <I>(Business Mail, Fridays with the Mail & Guardian)</I><BR>
It could be the most unlikely of marriages, both in terms of historical differences and future ambitions.  Yet the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut [organisation representing predominantly white Afrikaans businesspeople] and the National Federated Chamber of Commerce [predominantly black] have agreed to begin working towards a single body representing business in SA.<BR><P>
PUBLIC INFORMATION ACCESS TO BE UPGRADED <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
A new cabinet committee chaired by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki should be established to provide top-level guidance and co-ordination in all matters related to the development of communications and information in SA, Mbeki's task group on government communications, Comtask, has recommended.<BR>

TASK GROUP CALLS FOR PROBE OF PRINT MEDIA OWNERSHIP <I>(Cape Times, Cape Town)</I><BR>
The concentration of ownership in the print media should be referred to the Competition Board for investigation, the Task Group on Government Communications recommended yesterday.  In its report, presented to Deputy President Thabo Mbekis office, Comtask also slammed South Africas "impoverished" journalistic standards, saying that "the apartheid years have damaged the profession of journalism".<BR><P>

THREE DEAD, 37 MISSING AFTER MINE MUD SLIDE <I>(Business Day, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Rescue workers from Bloemfontein rushed to the Rovic diamond mine in the western Free State yesterday after a mud slide trapped at least 42 miners in a shaft.   Three miners were killed and two were injured while about 37 were unaccounted for.  The missing miners were thought to be trapped about 500m underground.<BR><P>
MINE DEATHS: 26 ARRESTED <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Twenty-six North West mineworkers were arrested yesterday in connection with violence at two Stilfontein gold mine hostels in September in which 26 people died.<BR><P>
ANGLO WILL PROCEED 'WITH CARE' IN ZAIRE <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Anglo American would proceed cautiously in war-torn Zaire, where the company was considering investments in the country's substantial base metal resources, chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson said.<BR><P>
ANGLO TAKES POSITIVE VIEW ON SA'S FUTURE <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Anglo American Corporation is leading an initiative to counter government and public perceptions that business is unduly negative about the country's prospects.  Anglo chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson told a media briefing this week that there "remains much to be positive about in SA  - the levels of private sector investment are high, delivery in crucial socio-economic areas is beginning to be evident and the institutions of our market democracy remain vibrant".<BR><P>
AFRICAN MINING GROUP TO CONSIDER BRINGING FOREIGN INVESTORS TO JCI <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The African Mining Group could use mining house JCI - in which the consortium has bought a 34,9% stake from Anglo American for R2,8bn - to launch a global mining fund and is considering bringing international investors into JCI.  Sources said yesterday that a number of other black empowerment groups had teamed up with the African Mining Group, including Tiego Moseneke's Khotso Investments, Corridor Investments, and Northern Corporation Investment Holdings, which represented some of the interests of the Bafokeng clan.<BR><P>
JCI'S PRICE WAS TOO HIGH, SAY ANALYSTS <I>(Business Report, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Analysts expressed some concern yesterday about the size of the premium African Mining Group (AMG) has agreed to pay Anglo American for a 34,9% stake in JCI.  They said yesterday's market price of R50,50 represented a fairer value for the share than the R54,50 being paid by AMG.<BR><P>
COSTS AND OPPORTUNITIES <I>(Business Day Editorial Comment)</I><BR>
The premium Capital Alliance paid Anglo American for a 34,9% interest in JCI highlights the deal's importance and that it is not a token black empowerment exercise.  It contrasts with the discount to market at which Anglo sold control of Johnnic to the National Empowerment Consortium.  The reason for the apparent price discrepancies is clear.  Johnnic is a holding company largely owning  investments it does not manage, which means the NEC's opportunities to influence the operating companies' direction may be comparatively restricted.<BR><P>
TECHNICAL SNAGS ALLOW ONLY 30 MINUTES' TRADING ON JSE <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Unrelenting problems with the electronic trading system, or Jet, brought the Johannesburg Stock Exchange to a halt for the third consecutive day yesterday.  The market opened for just 30 minutes frustrating traders who forecast heavy losses for their firms and putting a black mark on the JSE's reputation in global financial markets.<BR><P>
JCI TO SELL INDONESIAN GOLD PROJECT STAKE <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>
SYDNEY - Lone Star Exploration NL said on Thursday it had bought out its partners in the Awak Mas gold project in Indonesia for a total of about US$41-million.  Lone Star, which is listed in Australia and Canada, said it would acquire the 45% interest of Gascoyne Gold Mines NL and the 10% stake held by SA mining house JCI Ltd.<BR><P>
CANADA'S BARRICK TO LEAD GOLD PRODUCERS <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>
TORONTO - Canada's Barrick Gold Corporation appears set to become the world's biggest gold producer under an unusual deal that will give it a majority share in Indonesia's rich Busang gold discovery.<BR><P>
MINERS BLAST INDONESIAN MOVE ON BUSANG <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>
JAKARTA - The Indonesian government's attempt to force a settlement over the spectacular Busang gold find was criticised by local miners on Wednesday, who said the move could hurt investment in mining.<BR><P>
YEAR-END SUPPORT TO PUSH 96 WORLD GOLD DEMAND TO RECORD <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>
NEW DELHI - Strong last-quarter support for gold will push up 1996 demand for the precious metal to match the all-time high of 2,725 tonnes achieved in 1995, an official of the World Gold Council said on Thursday.<BR><P>
GOLD CONTINUES FALL <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Gold continued to fall yesterday, trading as low as $372,60 an ounce late in the afternoon, with a quieter period expected today because the US markets are closed for a holiday. <BR><P>
DEALER WANTS STATE TO RETURN GOLD <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
A Greek gold dealer arrested on charges of unlawfully possessing unwrought gold two years ago and later released has asked the Rand Supreme Court to order the Finance Ministry to return 15kg of gold worth R700 000.  After charges were withdrawn pending further investigation last year, he was told the gold had been forfeited to the state in terms of exchange control regulations.  Should the ministry fail to return his gold, he wants the matter referred to the Constitutional Court to have the exchange regulations declared invalid.<BR><P>
RAND SHOULD STABILISE BY END OF NEXT YEAR <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Further falls in the rand are likely to be short-term and the currency should be stable at R4,70 to the dollar by the end of next year, Sandra Gordon, group economist at Syfrets, said at a seminar yesterday.  Gordon said the rise in interest rates had made her revise her growth forecasts for next year and 1998 downwards, "given its likely impact on consumer and investment spending".  She now expected a growth rate of only 1,8% next year instead of her previous forecast of 2,3%.  This was likely to strengthen to 3,2% in 1998, below her previous forecast of 3,6%.<BR><P>
RAND RECOVERS GROUND AGAINST DOLLAR <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The rand hit its best level against the dollar for more than five weeks yesterday as demand rose when offshore banks developed a healthy appetite for South African bonds.<BR><P>
SA DROPS TAIWAN IN FAVOUR OF CHINA <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
President Mandela announced yesterday that SA would cut formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, recognising China instead.  The surprise decision, following a series of  statements in support of Taiwan, means SA might lose some large Taiwanese investments.  It will, however, bring SA in line with the international trend of recognising China.  <BR><P>
MANDELA SAVES FACE AND SOLVES THE CHINESE PUZZLE <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Financial considerations kept the ANC-led government sweet with Taiwan.  It was  money that finally talked when President Mandela decided to cut political ties with the island and recognise the People's Republic of China.  There will be a price to pay for this decision announced by Mandela yesterday - but it will not be as high as Taiwan officials have been threatening.  The benefits of bringing SA in step with the rest of the world will far outweigh the negative implications.  Taiwan's development assistance for SA, now running at about R228m spread over projects involving vocational training for SANDF members, a vegetable farmers' training project, a special forestry project and educational assistance, might well dry up.  But the R1,6bn worth of Taiwanese investment in SA is unlikely to be removed.<BR><P>
BENEFITS OF GROWTH MUST BE SHARED BY ALL <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
It is often assumed that, for all practical purposes, economic growth and development are synonymous.  In fact they are not and the distinction between them is critical.  Growth is a narrow measure of economic performance expressed in terms of increases in output.  Development is a broader concept and refers to upgrading of the skills and knowledge pool, distribution of national resources and spread of the benefits of economic activity through society, in such a way as to improve welfare and living standards.  It is a measure of how society can benefit from economic growth.<BR><P>
SA HAS A 'DISCOURAGED WORKFORCE' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
SA was saddled with about 1,5m "discouraged workers" - one of the highest rates in the world, Rand Afrikaans University economist Elsabe Loots said yesterday.<BR><P>
NEDLAC TALKS DEADLOCK OVER JOB CONDITIONS <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Negotiations between the government, labour and business in the Nationa Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) for a new set of minimum standards for employment have broken down, and negotiators have resorted to bilateral meetings to break the deadlock.<BR><P>
FEARS ON NEW COMPETITION LEGISLATION <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>

SA OIL INDUSTRY VOICES CONCERN ABOUT MINISTER'S LACK OF AVAILABILITY <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The South African oil industry has appealed for an urgent meeting with Minerals and Energy Minister Penuell Maduna amid mounting concern about the industry's prospects.  Sources said industry representatives have been seeking a meeting since Maduna took office in July, hoping to discuss key issues affecting the future structure of the industry, including price rises for diesel and petrol.<BR><P>
EU AID TO SA 'SHOULD BE STREAMLINED' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The R600m-a-year European Union aid package to SA should be streamlined to focus on a few development programmes to facilitate its implementation, a senior EU official said last night.  <BR><P>

<p>ANGLO CONFIRMS TALKS WITH EU OVER STAKE IN LONRHO <i>(Business
Day, Jhb.)</i><br>
Mining group Anglo American confirmed that it was in talks with
the European Union over a tie-up with Britain's Lonrho conglomerate.
It was reported at the weekend that the European Commission was
investigating the Lonrho deal over concerns about reduced
competition in the platinum market.<br>
</p>

<p>STOCKS FALL AS GLOOMY VIEW TAKES HOLD <i>(Business Day)</i><br>
Stocks tumbled on the Johanesburg Stock Exchange yesterday as
players adopted a negative outlook on interest rates, and disappointment
over further delays to the abolition of exchange controls and an
investigation into foreign exchange forward cover affected
sentiment.<br>
</p>

<p>BUSINESS SET TO TRAIN GOVT OFFICIALS <i>(Business Day)</i><br>
The National Business Initiative has launched a programme to
engage its 140 member companies in training local government officials
in vital aspects of financial management and administration.<br>
</p>

<p>LABOUR RELATIONS ACT 'MARKS THE BEGINNING OF NEW JOURNEY' <i>(Business Day)</i><br>
Politicians, labour and business pronounced themselves satisfied
with the new Labour Relations Act which took effect yesterday,
describing the occasion as the dawn of a new era. The Act was drafted to
create conditions for a mature industrial partnership that would
allow sustained economic growth and remove adversarial relations.<br>
</p>

<p>NEITHER HELL NOR HEAVEN <i>(Business Day Editorial Comment)</i><br>
Labour Minister Tito Mboweni may or may not agree, but it seems
symbolically appropriate that the new Labour Relations Act into
operation on Armistice Day rather than May 1, Labour Day, his original
target day. May Day originated with the intense 19th century
struggles of organised labour for very rudimentary forms of
workplace justice. SA is now some way beyond that. The philosophy underpinning
the new Act has more in common with cessation of hostilities
symbolised by the November 11 commemoration. If the Act achieves
its purpose, industrial conflict will become less adversarial and
more institutionalised.<br>
</p>

<p>RACIST UNIONS TOLD TO CLEAN UP THEIR ACT <i>(Business Report,
Jhb.)</i><br>
Labour Minister Tito Mboweni relegated discriminatory trade union
and employer bodies to the annals of history yesterday, and
warned that bodies which maintained discrimination in their constitutions
would not be registered under the new Labour Relations Act.<br>
</p>

<p>EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION OUTCOME DOUBLE-EDGED FOR SA BUSINESS <i>(Business
Day)</i><br>
The die is cast. Despite considerable financial and economic
obstacles, key European nations are determined to introduce European
monetary union by the end of the millennium. And the implications
for SA business people will be considerable. Forward planning is
thus essential, even though there is considerable debate among
European central bankers and economists who are concerned that
several nations will not meet the tough economic requirements for
a unified currency.<br>
</p>

<p>GERMANS REMAIN UNIMPRESSED BY MBEKI'S ASSURANCES <i>(Business
Day)</i><br>
If SA is to gain the status it so keenly seeks among Europe's
superpowers and their investment communities, some fast and fancy
footwork is necessary. Despite the interest among German companies
to move into new markets, there are several factors in SA which
are causing concern among potential investors. Leading them are
high levels of crime and violence, followed by trade union
militancy and the unions&#146; clear political alliances. And
many German business people are wary of the long-term
effectiveness of the aggressive affirmative action policies being
implemented.<br>
</p>

<p>SA DESPERATELY NEEDS A VISION OF ITSELF <i>(by commentator
Maja Mokoena, Business Report)</i><br>
There is no doubt in my mind that SA is judged more harshly than
many emerging market countries which are far from being as
democratic and having as free a market system as we do. Given
these conditions, there is no better advice SA can get than that
given recently by German industrialists - that the country should
look forward to lifting itself with its own bootstraps <i>[sic] </i>instead
of waiting for foreign redemption. The Germans have rightly urged
SA to take a fresh look at domestic economic polices and
investment strategies to enhance the country's attractiveness to investors.
One is tempted to say how uncouth for the Germans to tell us to
carry our own weight, at a time when SA needs foreign aid. Well,
effective bitter medicine is better than flattery.<br>
</p>

<p>SPEEDY EUROPEAN TRADE DEAL WITH SA UNLIKELY <i>(Business
Report)</i><br>
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki will be told this week that SA has
thrown away the chance of a speedy trade accord with Europe.
Mbeki is in Brussels on a tour of the European Union's capital to discuss
the offer of a free trade area made by the EU to SA. SA is
unhappy with this approach because about 40% of its farm exports
will be excluded from the accord. The approach will also leave
the South African industry vulnerable to cut-throat competition
and her neighbours will suffer.<br>
</p>

<p>US RESENTMENT OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION RISES <i>(Business Day)</i><br>
Americans are losing patience with blacks demanding special
treatment in compensation for past injustices, and this puts in context
a race row which has erupted at oil company Texaco. Texaco, America's
14th largest company, is in deep trouble. Senior executives of
the oil company, which does business in SA as a co-owner of
Caltex, have been caught on tape plotting to destroy evidence
which might have proved incriminating in a racial discrimination
suit filed by black employees. The plaintiffs allege they have
been subjected to a pattern of racist behaviour ranging from
abusive language, including terms such as &quot;orang-utang&quot;
and &quot;porch monkey&quot;, to a statistically palpable failure
of white managers to recruit or promote black staff.<br>
</p>

<p>RUSSIA HOPES TO LIBERALISE GOLD MINING - MINISTER <i>(Reuters)</i><br>
MOSCOW - Russian officials have agreed to end the state's
monopoly on mining for gold, but there can be no swift move to a
free market, Finance Minister Alexander Livshits said on Monday.<br>
</p>

<p>DEMOS LAW TO COME INTO FORCE ON FRIDAY <i>(Cape Times,Cape
Town)</i><br>
The national law controlling marches and demonstrations and
requiring organisers to apply for permission is to come into force
on Friday. It could affect the proposed Pagad demonstration at the Waterfront
this weekend. The Regulation of Gatherings Act, the so-called
&quot;Goldstone Act&quot;, would be published in the Government
Gazette on Friday, Maxwell Mulaudzi, a spokesman for Minister of Safety
and Security Sydney Mufamadi, said yesterday.<br>
</p>

<p>CABINET FOR RESHUFFLE IF MODISE, NZO RETIRE <i>(Cape Times)</i><br>
A cabinet reshuffle is on the cards as Defence Minister Joe
Modise and Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo may retire. With the
imminent retirement of Eastern Cape Premier Raymond Mhlaba and
the resignation of ANC secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa, a
change in the ANC&#146;s senior ranks is also inevitable. <br>
</p>

<p>CALL TO CURB MARKETS&#146; CLOUT <i>(Cape Times)</i><br>
The SA Communist Party does not want to abolish the markets, but
merely to reduce their power, which is wielded mainly by conservative
whites, its deputy secretary-general, Jeremy Cronin, says. Cronin
told the Institute for Defence Policy yesterday that the balance
of forces needed to be changed by using the new Labour Relations
Act to strengthen the powers of workers, consumers and the public
sector.<br>

<p>MINER STILL MISSING <i>(Business Day, Jhb.)</i><br>
Rescuers were still trying to locate the driver of a machine who
disappeared on Saturday when the machine cut into an accumulation

<p>MINES CANNOT AFFORD LAY-OFFS <i>(Business Report, Jhb.)</i><br>

<p>TITO MBOWENI DEFENDS NEW COMMISSION <i>(Business Report)</i><br>
Labour Minister Tito Mboweni dismissed as &quot;absolute
nonsense&quot; the concerns of business about the quality of the commissioners
on the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. &quot;Anybody
from business who says that is talking utter nonsense&quot;,
Mboweni said after an ANC national executive committee meeting
over the weekend. &quot;If it is white business, perhaps this scepticism
is that darkies can't organise anything. It makes me very
upset&quot;, he said.<br>
</p>

<p>STALS ENDS ALL HOPES FOR EARLY DEATH OF CONTROLS <i>(Business
Times, with the Sunday Times)</i><br>
Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals has put an end to hopes that
exchange controls may be lifted early. Instead, he has announced
a four-to-five-year timetable on the phasing out of exchange restrictions.
By ruling out a &quot;Big Bang&quot; or once-off scrapping of
controls, Stals resisted calls by the local business community
and foreign investors for their rapid dismantling.<br>
</p>

<p>NEW REFINERY MAY HELP FREE UP SA GOLD MARKET <i>(Reuters)</i><br>
SA could launch its own bullion market once the Reserve Bank

all their own gold, said Mike Brown, research head of broker Frankel
Pollak.<br>
</p>

<p>DEFICIT NOW MANUEL'S MANTRA <i>(Business Day)</i><br>
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel has staked his credibility on the
Budget deficit. Like a stuck record, he keeps repeating that government
will meet its deficit targets this fiscal year and next. Figures
due for release on Thursday evening should indicate whether he
has something to sing about or not. The monthly statement from
the Finance Department on the course of the Budget can be difficult
to interpret, as spending and revenue numbers are volatile.
However, it is possible to draw conclusions about the revenue
figures now that more than half the fiscal year has passed.<br>
</p>

<p>IMF LOAN POSSIBLE 'TO SUPPORT RAND' <i>(Business Day)</i><br>

</p>

<p>SA WILL NOT WALK AWAY FROM EU TALKS - OFFICIALS <i>(Business

SA would not walk away from impending trade talks with the

<p>ILO WARNS OF BACKLASH AGAINST GLOBALISATION <i>(Business Day)</i><br>
Rapid advances fostered by globalisation of the world economy
could be undermined and lead to a backlash over rising unemployment

Hansenne warned on Friday. Addressing delegates at an ILO
workshop dealing with &quot;promoting social progress and

there could be a &quot;backlash&quot; against globalisation.<br>

<p>COSATU 'MAY BECOME MORE FRAGMENTED' <i>(Business Day)</i><br>

<p>FIRST PORT OF CALL FOR BLACK COMPANIES COMING TO THE JSE <i>(Business Day)</i><br>
If Emmanuel Lediga could recruit every black stockbroker in town,
his new firm would boast two qualified staffers. However, the
29-year-old CE of Legae Securities, SA's first black-run stockbrokerage,
is not deterred by the scarcity of black professionals at the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange. &quot;I am an irrepressible
optimist. In 10 years we will be right up there with the top
guys&quot;. Legae is the only brokerage in SA owned and managed
by blacks, an achievement made more remarkable by the fact that
Legida qualified as a stockbroker only four months ago. A former business
reporter for <i>The Star</i>, he became the first black dealer on

MINING PRODUCTION REMAINS THE SAME (Business Report, Jhb)
Central Statistical Service data released yesterday shows mining production has remained at nearly the same level since the middle of 1994, with the downward trend in gold production counteracted by an upward trend in non-gold production .

'Black empowerment may still leave a major gold mine under white control'.  -  Anglo American is lifting its stake in JCI's gold mine Western Areas - a move which could ensure it remains the mine's largest shareholder after JCI's planned sale to black business.<BR><P>
JOEL - BACK FROM THE DEAD WITH CONTINUOUS OPS <I>(Business Mail)</I><BR>
The introduction of continuous operations at JCI's HJ Joel gold mine played a major part in pulling the Free State operation back from the brink.<BR><P>
FULCO FAILS TO STRIKE GOLD <I>(Business Mail)</I><BR>
Continuous mining operations, long mooted as a lifeline for the mining industry, have proved less successful than hoped.  The principle that mines would move to seven-day operations - or full calendar operations (Fulco) - was finally agreed between management and unions last year, after years of negotiations. <I>[This article, unfortunately, indicates a superficial grasp of the realities surrounding Section 9 of the Mines & Works Act, which prohibits blasting on Sundays, and the laborious process involved in securing exemption in terms of government's requirements. The Chamber's view is quite simply that archaic regulations such as Section 9 dating back to the apartheid era have no place on statute books in the environment in which we operate today. Refer also to the <A HREF="http://www.bullion.org.za/speeches/1996/PresidentialAddress_1996.htm">Presidential address</A> (paragraph 26) given at the Chamber's AGM on Tuesday this week. - Ed.]</I><BR><P>
RANDGOLD TO GO AHEAD WITH HARMONY GOLD REFINERY <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>
Randgold and Exploration said on Thursday that the board of its Harmony Gold Mining Co. had given the go-ahead for the establishment of a commercial-scale gold refinery, only the second in SA.<BR><P>
INTEGRATED FINANCING <I>(Business Day Editorial Comment)</I><BR>
This week's separate integrations of Anglovaal's and Gencor's Evander gold mining interests need to be seen in perspective, not simply by investors, but by everyone responsible for SA's economic and fiscal planning.  Integration of gold mines and prospects is not consolidation for the sake of size, it is part of an industry-wide trend towards creating attractive investment vehicles for world capital markets.<BR><P>
NEW LABOUR ACT 'CONTAINS UNWORKABLE ASPECTS' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Aspects of the German industrial relations system, which was proving to be unsuitable to ensure Germany's  continued competitiveness, had been incorporated in the new Labour Relations Act, an employer said yesterday.<BR><P>
LABOUR COMMISSION TO BE SET UP ON MONDAY <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Labour, business and the government have pledged their support for the new commission that will try to solve SA labour disputes from next week.  The Commission on Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, set up under the new Labour Relations Act, will be established on Monday.<BR><P>
STRIKE COULD PARALYSE ECONOMY <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
An expected strike over wage increases by seven transport unions in the R8-billion-a-year road freight industry later this month threatens to bring the economy to a standstill.<BR><P>
PRECARIOUS BALANCE FOR THE RAND <I>(Business Mail)</I><BR>
The rand's latest fall will push inflation higher, demanding the restrictive monetary policy which has previously forced up interest rates, Reserve Bank Governor  Chris Stals warns.  In an exclusive interview with the Mail & Guardian, Stals also says it is anyone's guess where the embattled currency will settle.  "Any person willing to predict at which level the rand will stabilise, under the present circumstances, would be very brake", he says.<BR><P>
GERMANS NOT LIKELY TO HEED SA TRADE PLEA <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The European commission has welcomed next week's visit by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki to the EU's executive arm, but Brussels observers say the Pretoria delegation is unlikely to come back home with anything more than sympathy.<BR><P>
PRIVATISATION 'HAS CRUCIAL ROLE' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
State Enterprises were inherently inefficient and privatisation was crucial to productivity and sustainable regional growth, Southern African Development Community executive secretary Kaire Mbuende said yesterday.<BR><P>
SURPRISE RISE IN FOREX AND GOLD RESERVES <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
The value of the gross gold and foreign exchange reserves held by the Reserve Bank rose to R10,2b last month from R10b in September, even after a foreign credit line of R612m was fully repaid, Central Bank figures released yesterday show.<BR><P>
MORE BLACKS TO BALANCE THE BOOKS <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
The crusade to introduce more black accountants into the SA economy is gaining momentum.  Among those at the forefront of the initiative is Coopers & Lybrand SA, whose new national chairman, Arthur Kidson, is approaching the challenge with single-minded dedication. <BR><P>
LONGER STRIKES IN 1997 <I>(The Citizen, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Longer and possibly more disruptive strikes, as well as a rash of disputes relating to the provisions of new labour legislation, are like to dominate the industrial relations arena in 1997, says Pierre Wolmarans, professional head: industrial relations, at FSA-Contact. "Labour is increasingly looking to business to deliver on the upliftment promises of the government which, so far, have not made a significant impact on the life of the average worker. At the same time, economic realities dictate that, from a business point of view, wage settlements will have to be more moderate," he said.<BR><P>
UNION ACTS ON MINE HOUSING <I>(Sowetan, Jhb.)</I><BR>
SAs mining industry can provide housing for the millions of black migrant workers at a very low cost, if mine bosses are willing to work together with the workers. National Union of Mineworkers general secretary Kgalema Motlanthe says, contrary to belief, it will not cost mining houses billions of rands to put up family housing for their employees. "NUM has proposed that workers will use public holidays to work into a fund which will finance decent housing," he says.<BR><P>
FREE PRESS ESSENTIAL TO DEMOCRACY - NAIDOO <I>(Cape Times, Cape Town)</I><BR>
In an open letter to the Press yesterday, Jay Naidoo, Minister of Posts, Telecommunications and Broadcasting, said he was horrified at the treatment of journalists by Pagad leaders at the Gatesville mosque on Wednesday night.  Naidoo wrote, "I consider it a humiliation not experienced even at the height of apartheid repression - to parade journalists before a hostile crowd and make threats against them and their newspapers.  The freedom of the Press is a foundation of a democracy".<I> ["Pagad" = People Against Gangsterism And Drugs is a so-called vigillante group begun in the Cape and was recently involved in a clash with police - Ed.] </I><BR><P>

AVGOLD GOES GLOBAL AFTER SHAKE-UP <I>(Business Day, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Anglovaal's gold division, Avgold, has launched itself on the international stage as a focused company with its long-term resources secured and the mines' frequently criticised management contracts at an end.<BR><P>
JCI IN BID FOR BIG STAKE IN AUSTRALIAN MINING GROUP <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
JCI has signed a letter of understanding to buy an option on a $250m stake in an Australian mining house, which would give the SA group 30% of a Russian gold resource, one of the biggest outside SA.<BR><P>
SA FIRMS 'SHOULD EXAMINE THEIR MOTIVES FOR GOING GLOBAL' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
South African companies need to focus on creating joint venture alliances, particularly with offshore companies, in order to extend their market share - but they also have to examine their motives for moving into the global market.<BR><P>
FOREX OUTFLOWS SQUEEZE BANKS' MARGINS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Foreign exchange outflows have triggered increases in money market interest rates and put pressure on banks' margins as they scramble for cash.
ALL PACKED UP WITH NOWHERE TO GO <I>(Business Report, Jhb.)</I><BR>
There was a time when the slightest wobble in the finrand or rand caused a rush on any equity that had even the vaguest claim to being a "rand hedge".  Not any more.  Since the finrand was abolished and for most of this year, when the rand has experienced the most volatile period in its history, investors on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange do not appear to be interested in adopting a strategy that would reap some benefit from the rand's downward trajectory.<BR><P>
RAND'S DECLINE 'EXCESSIVE' <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
The rand will stabilise at between R4,50 and R4,60 to the dollar towards the end of the year, Karin Schoeman, a Southern Life economic analyst, predicts in Southern's fourth-quarter Economic Comment.  Schoeman said the currency's level was "excessively" undervalued.<BR><P>
PAVING THE WAY <I>(Business Day Editorial Comment)</I><BR>
Reserve Bank governor Chris Stal's views on the conjunction of factors needed before exchange controls can safely be removed need consideration by a still non-committal Finance Ministry.  Last week when the market expected an announcement on controls, the rand firmed.  It weakened this week in the confusion of conflicting signals from the ministry and the Bank.  The dangers of official indecision are clear to corporate SA which has presumably conveyed its concerns to the governor and the minister.<BR><P>
TIME TO RETHINK THE METHOD OF LIFTING EXCHANGE CONTROLS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
There is something enviable about the glibness with which people in the financial markets are able to call for the scrapping of exchange controls.  They trot out their mantra with all the faith of devout worshippers, and display impatience with the agnostics around them.  But the need for a big bang to remove controls is not as obvious as it seems to the believers, and government and the Reserve Bank's delays are not as ridiculous as they might seem.  It is, quite simply, not as easy a decision as it might seem to the people who want to take their money out of the country.<BR><P>
RAMOS SPELLS OUT PLANS TO PROTECT CASH SAVINGS <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
The Finance Ministry is discussing measures with the Financial Services Board to protect savings after the abolition of foreign exchange controls, Maria Ramos, the director-general of the Finance Department, said yesterday.<BR><P>
MORE THAN HALF OF COSATU'S CONGRESS DELEGATES MISSING <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
While SA's largest labour federation, the Congress of SA Trade Unions' (Cosatu) KwaZulu-Natal congress at the weekend highlighted the need for strong organisational structures, the federation's Witwatersrand region had to adjourn its congress when 1 000 of the 1 677 delegates failed to turn up.  It is understood that representatives from 18 of the 20 Cosatu affiliated did attend.  However, in terms of the federation's constitution the delegates present did not represent a quorum.<BR><P>

BLACKS HOLD FUTURE OF SAS ECONOMY <I>(Sowetan, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Blacks should be actively involved in the mainstream economy for SAs new democracy to succeed. This the view of National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) general secretary Kgalema Motlanthe, who argues that the current changes will collapse unless blacks play an active role in the economy.<BR><P>

CHAMBER CHANGES ITS FOCUS <I>(Business Day, Jhb.)</I><BR>
The Chamber of Mines of SA had been restructured to focus on its new primary function as a lobbying organisation for the mining industry, outgoing president At du Plessis said yesterday.  The remodelled organisational structure was "effectively equipped to engage government, labour and other significant protagonists in the national public policy arena.  What has evolved is a modernised entity competently positioned to represent the interests of its members in contemporary SA", said Du Plessis. <BR><P>
MINISTER UPBEAT ON FUTURE OF MINING <I>(Business Report, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Minerals and Energy Minister Penuell Maduna said the green paper on the future of mining in SA presented to him last month will be published this month and will culminate in a white paper next year.<BR><P>
SA CHAMBER SEES 1996 LOW FOR GOLD OUTPUT <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>
SA's gold mining industry is set for another substantial drop in output this year, but 1996 should prove to be the trough, outgoing president of the Chamber of Mines At du Plessis said on Tuesday.  Speaking at the Chamber's 106th annual general meeting he said there was likely to be a further "substantial reduction" in production in 1996 to around 500 tonnes.

The restructuring of Anglovaal's mining interests will be debated by shareholders of its listed companies today, amid claims that Hartebeestfontein is being sacrificed for uncertain gains at the group's Oribi and Sun gold explorations.<BR><P>

Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin appointed two outspoken critics of conglomerates and monopolies to the Competition Board yesterday in a move that could bring about a radical change in the way competition policy is treated.<BR><P>
FALLING RAND 'NEED NOT DETER INVESTORS' <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
The rand's nearly 30% fall in value against the dollar so far this year was not necessarily a deterrent to long-term foreign investment in SA, Jeffrey Griffin, the principal investment officer of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), said yesterday.<BR><P>
REWORKED CONSTITUTION STILL DRAWS OBJECTIONS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The Democratic Party and KwaZulu-Natal province have asked the Constitutional Court not to certify the amended constitutional text adopted by the Constitutional Assembly last month, on the grounds that various provisions still do not comply with principles enshrined in the interim constitution.<BR><P>
GOVT TO BE GIVEN PROGRESS REPORTS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Labour, government and business representatives negotiating the draft legislation on employment standards will have to decide soon whether they will complete negotiations this year.  Sources close to the negotiations indicated government hoped the process would be completed by the end of this month so that a draft Bill could be ready for tabling in Parliament at the start of the first term next year.  Government will hold separate meetings with labour and business today to review progress.<BR><P>
STALS SPEAKS OUT ON FOREX 'BIG BANG' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals has spelled out the measures that would have to be in place for SA to contemplate a "big bang" lifting of exchange controls.  Stals said yesterday he welcomed the debate about the abolition of controls, although people did not seem to realise that "if you take the plunge, you have to take the consequences too.  I like to say it is like riding a tiger - it can be more dangerous to get off, because the tiger might eat you".<BR><P>
BLACK EMPOWERMENT 'A SHAM' <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Black empowerment initiatives in SA were only serving to enrich a small group of about 300 black people, Lawrence Mavundla, president of the Micro Business Chamber, said yesterday.  Speaking at the chamber's launch, Mavundla said private business in SA was "taking people who are already rich and making them richer" in the name of black empowerment.  He said business had targeted a small group of black people with whom it was prepared to do business.<BR><P>
MANUELS EQUIVOCATION MAKES MARKETS NERVOUS <I>(Sake-Beeld, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Minister of Finance Trevor Manuel yesterday again caused jitters in financial markets with his apparent equivocation on exchange control. Although markets still performed steadily, most dealers described the mood as "negative". What unnerved many people was an aside Manuel made during a Press conference in Cape Town. He said SA still had to finally decide whether all exchange controls would be abolished as is the case in Mexico, or whether SA would retain certain restrictions as in Chile. Analysts sharply criticised this statement saying it was contrary to the governments macro-economic strategy which clearly set the abolition of exchange controls as a goal.<BR><P>

SA GOLD MINES WONT MAKE 500-TON MARK <I>(Business Day, Jhb.)</I><BR>
SA's gold mines would fail to produce the 500 tons of gold forecast for the year, mining analysts said yesterday.  The Chamber of Mines said the industry had produced only 39,6 tons of gold in September, less than August's 41,2 tons.<BR><P>
LEADING ECONOMIST PREDICTS A R6,90/DOLLAR BY 2004 <I>(Business Report, Jhb.)</I><BR>
The rand could depreciate to about R6,90 a dollar by 2004, Rudolf Gouws, the chief economist for Rand Merchant Bank said, scotching speculation that Cape Town's 2004 Olympic bid presumed an exchange rate of R22 to the dollar.  Gouws' estimate was based on five assumptions, according to a report on the SA economy released this month.  The first assumption was that SA's inflation rate would track estimates in the government's economic plan released in June, the report said.<BR><P>
FALLING RAND EXPECTED TO BOOST AMCOAL'S EARNINGS <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
The weak rand was expected to fuel Anglo American Coal's half-year earnings, analysts said yesterday.  They said the sharp decline in the rand's value against the dollar since mid-February had done much to boost export prices and increase Amcoal's earnings for the half-year to September 30.<BR><P>
ABANDONED COPPER MINE TO BE REOPENED <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
NDOLA, ZAMBIA - The Bwana Mkubwa mine, on the outskirts of the copperbelt town of Ndola, is set to become one of the first privately operated mines since Zambia's mineral resources were nationalised in the 1960s, when it goes into production in December next year.<BR><P>
LEON ATTACKS INABILITY BY GOVT TO MANAGE THE BUDGET <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Democratic Party leader Tony Leon lashed out at government last night for its inability to manage the Budget and warned that, unless radical steps were taken to bring the Budget under control, a further slide in the value of the rand was "inevitable and inexorable".  Leon told a public meeting in Johannesburg that government attempts to control public service spending were "awkward and potentially disastrous" and would lead SA into a "head-on-collision with global economic principles".<BR><P>
MBEKI TO LOBBY FOR BETTER DEAL FROM EU <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

Free State province's premier Patrick Lekota, his entire cabinet and the ANC provincial executive would be removed from office, the party's national leadership said in Johannesburg yesterday.  The move follows months of internal warfare which paralysed the provincial government and saw the party's Free State membership plunge.<BR><P>
SA HEALTH REVIEW PAINTS BLEAK PICTURE OF RURAL HEALTH SERVICES <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
This year's SA Health Review, released yesterday, shows that nearly half the clinics in the eastern Cape do not have adequate water supply, 52% have no electricity and 38% have no phone.  The situation is hardly better in the Northern Province, the Northwest and KwaZulu-Natal.  <BR><P>
SA WEIGHS PRIVATE SECTOR FUNDING FOR WATER <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>
SA might set up a national water corporation in partnership with private investors to manage the funding of capital projects, Water Affairs and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal said on Monday.  Asmal told reporters in Cape Town that future water supply projects would be determined by human need rather than political expediency and ultimately would have to be paid for by consumers.   His department was not authorised, however, to borrow money for capital projects that would be paid back by user charges over a prolonged period.<BR><P>
PEACEKEEPING FORCE 'ALREADY IN TRAINING' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Efforts to have a 10 000-strong SA National Defence Force contingent ready for peacekeeping duties in central Africa were being accelerated and it was expected that the "lakes states" would help determine SA's role in the troubled region, Deputy Defence Minister Ronnie Kasrils said yesterday.<BR><P>
SA MAY HAVE TO IMPORT PETROL <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
After years of almost total self-reliance, SA is set to become a net importer of petrol over the next year, industry sources said yesterday.

MUGABE TELLS DIPLOMATS TO 'GO TO HELL' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
HARARE - President Robert Mugabe appears to be heading for a crisis with donors after telling diplomats representing four Western donor countries to "go to hell" when they questioned his plan to sell Malaysians a 51% stake in the R3bn Hwange Thermal Station for a bargain R217m.  Mugabe fired the entire board of the parastatal Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority when its members warned that the deal would upset Western nations whose electrical conglomerates' tenders were ignored.<BR><P>

Over the past 10 days a growing number of commentators called on

should be taken away in big-bang fashion. Speculation about an

Although food price increases of 10,4% are largely blamed for the

nearly 1 percentage point to 8,4% since August, Chamber of Mines
economist Richard Grant says excessive growth in MO money supply
last year will push inflation over 10% before April. The
inflation figures exceeded most economists' expectations, which
were clustered around 8,1%. &quot;The rise in food prices is not
itself a cause of inflation, but rather an effect enhanced by
inflation, which is caused by the growth in MO money
supply&quot;, says Grant. <br>

EDITORIAL MISINTERPRETED MINING REPORT <I>(Business Day, Jhb. - written by Guy Mhone, chief director of labour market policy, Department of Labour)</I><BR>
<I>Business Day</I> has every right to interpret documents as it sees fit, but it owes it to its readers to at least give a faithful exposition of the contents of a particular document so that readers can make their own judgements on particular issues.  I refer to the editorial titled Mining Gold on Dec 19, which I do not believe lives up to the high standard we have come to expect from <I>Business Day</I>.  The editorial focuses on the issues of wage determination and the perceived interpretation of the views expressed in the paper as implying the need for the state to exert more control in their determination irrespective of the rights of the parties to do so through collective bargaining, and without regard of the economic consequences of doing so for the viability of marginal mines.<I> [The Department of Labour commissioned the report - Ed. Click <A HREF="http://www.bullion.org.za/releases/deplabor.htm">here</A> to see the Chamber's response to the report OR click <A HREF="http://www.bullion.org.za/news/mining~1/ bd1296.htm">HERE </A>to read the Business Day editorial which has so irked Dr. Mhone. ]</I><BR><P>

ALTHOUGH MANY WOULD SAY IT IS, SA IS STILL FAR FROM FREE <I>(Beeld, Jhb.)</I><BR>
SA claims to have a free economy. However, economists have a completely different view on this. According to the authoritative Heritage Foundation of America the SA economy is everything but free. In its most recent survey on the most free countries in the world, SA is placed in the category of countries classified as "mostly not-free". This penetrates to the core of the problem of low economic growth in SA because it has been proven again and again that the freer a countrys economy is, the faster its growth rate.<BR><P>
DE BEERS MONOPOLY WILL SHRINK - WSJ <I>(Beeld)</I><BR>
LONDON - The diamond war between De Beers and the Russian government will come to a climax next week. Last week De Beers announced that its sales had risen by 7% and that demand in America and Asia was healthy, but that the Russian "sabotage" of its market was seriously worrying. The Wall Street Journal then wrote that De Beers would follow the same path as other once-mighty monopolies like the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and would also shrink.<BR><P>

When the economic history books are written 1996 will go down as the year that began with so much hope, but ended with business morale at its lowest ebb since economic recovery began in 1993. <BR><P>
96 - GOOD YEAR FOR SA LABOUR RELATIONS <I>(Sowetan)</I><BR>
1996 can be described safely as the best year in the transformation of the labour market disfigured by years of apartheid. Although the changes in the new Labour Relations Act, implemented on November 11, favour workers to an extent, little has changed in the treatment of blacks in the workplace and in white attitudes towards black people.<BR><P>
THEY SPEND THEIR LIVES DIGGING GOLD AND THEN DIE <I>(Sowetan)</I><BR>
James Nxele (57) has six children - and tuberculosis. For 36 years he worked as a driller for the Freegold Mining Company. In September he was dismissed unceremoniously on health grounds and paid R6 000 in recognition of his long service. Filing a complaint with the National Union of Mineworkers, Nxele describes the money he had been paid for his years of service as "next to nothing" and an insult. Recently he was hospitalised for a month and his family had to foot the bill.<BR>
	Fluer <I>[sic] </I>Plimmer, NUMs health and safety officer, says mineworkers who contract TB or other lung diseases are hospitalised for only two weeks and are not compensated. "Only workers with a permanent disability are compensated. The industry pays 75% of the workers wage as compensation. It is not really a good scheme because the less you earn, the less compensation you get," he <I>[sic] </I>explains. <BR>
	The failure of the mining industry to ensure optimum dust control standards has left thousands of mineworkers suffering from lung diseases. While employed, the miners live in mine compounds, but once they outlive their worth, they are immediately packed off home with meagre amount of compensation money. At home they struggle to earn a living, eventually to die from a lung disease. <BR>
	The extent of health problems suffered by ex-mineworkers is difficult to determine as no follow-ups are conducted once the workers leave the mine. While there are clear indications that the prevalence of lung disease among miners is high, government institutions monitoring these problems remain seriously underfunded. <BR>
	"Once a disabled or sick mineworker is repatriated to his home, he gets no support. Some cases are so severe that we cannot guarantee that they will last even five years after leaving the industry. Nobody follows up on them, neither the government nor the industry," says Dr M Berry, a medical practitioner experienced in dealing with mine diseases.<BR>
	The new Mine Health and Safety Act, to come into effect next year, is the only breakthrough for mineworkers in recent years. It is the product of nine months of consultations between government, the labour movement and mine owners. The Act accords workers the right to be informed of any risk assessment made on a mine, formulate and live by a mine code of practice, have the4 right to be t5rained and represented in health and safety regulations and, most importantly, the right to refuse dangerous jobs. - <I>Africa Information Afrique</I>. <BR>

SA GOLD HEDGING NOT HEAVY - ANGLO OFFICIAL <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>

CRIME AND HIJACKING FAIL TO STOP IMMIGRANTS ARRIVING <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
For the first time in nearly three years the number of foreigners moving to SA outnumbered people leaving the country, a Central Statistical Service report said yesterday.

CAPITAL'S PATH IS NOT WITHOUT HAZARDS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Capital Alliance Holdings might have led negotiations for the African Mining Group's R2,8bn purchase from Anglo of control of JCI.  But the group - only a couple of months old in its present form - intends to grow in financial services, not mining.<BR><P>

The World Trade Organisation's ambitions to advance global liberalisation and enhance its own authority face their biggest test this week when the two-year-old institution holds its first ministerial meeting in Singapore.  WTO director-general Renato Rugiero hopes the meeting will forge a broad political consensus to strengthen multilateral trade and galvanise efforts to tackle a demanding liberalisation agenda stretching into early next century.<BR><P>
LET'S HEAR THE VICTIMS' VOICES <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
South Africans are tired of promises, analyses, strategies and initiatives by the Government on crime.  People want visible success in the crime war.  Victims particularly demand their voices be heard.  They are trapped between the devil and the deep-blue sea, being doubly victimised, first by the criminals and then by a justice system which seems to cower before the needs of criminals without any regard for the needs of victims.  According to Professor Lawrence Schlemmer, 46% of South Africans say they personally, or through their families, have been the victims of crime in the past six months.  It is time for the criminal justice system to acknowledge the crucial role of the victim in reporting crime, furnishing evidence, identifying the offender and in acting as a witness in court.  What is required is that the system's agencies adopt policy measures capable of providing support mechanisms and a safety net for the victims.<BR><P>
PRIVATE SECURITY GROUPS A 'VIABLE OPTION' FOR AFRICAN CONFLICTS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The use of private security groups such as Executive Outcomes may be one of the few remaining options to bring stability to conflict-plagued African countries until such time as an African or international "fire-fighting squad" became a reality.<BR><P>

STEEP RISE IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The Reserve Bank's holding of gold and foreign exchange reserves rose sharply in November, signalling that the balance of payments has turned the corner.  Figures released by the Bank on Friday showed total gold and foreign assets were up R651m to R10,9mb.  The rise reflected forex inflows, as the gold component was down.<BR><P>
TAIWAN LISTS SUSPENSION OF PROJECTS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Taiwan yesterday announced it was suspending projects in SA worth $842m, including a plan for two commercial banks to deposit $500m with the Reserve Bank as "balance of payments support".

EXPORTERS COMING TO THE PARTY, AT LAST <I>(Business Times, with the Sunday Times)</I><BR>
Amid the general economic gloom of increased interest rates, high credit spending and a low gold price, SA's exporters are finally grasping the opportunity presented by the slump in the rand.  A R4b surge in exports to almost R15m in October and a more modest rise in imports from R10,3b to R11b pushed the trade surplus during the month to a record high of R3,9b.<BR><P>

TOTAL MINING PRODUCTION <I>(Business Day, Jhb.)</I><BR>

CAPITAL FLOWS OUT AGAIN AS DEBT REPAID <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
SA experienced its first capital outflow since the 1994 election when about R200m left the country in the third quarter of this year. The figure is tiny compared with the billions that left SA quarterly before it became a democracy.  The capital outflow related to large payments falling due on debt previously caught in the standstill net.  <BR><P>
CONFIDENCE LEVELS PLUMMET TO 15-MONTH LOW <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

RUSSIAN BANKS HUNGRY TO FINANCE GOLD PRODUCTION <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>
MOSCOW - Russia is trying to shift financing of its tarnished gold sector to commercial banks while keeping control of exports, putting it on a collision course with the banks who say sales abroad are what interest them.<BR><P>
RUMOURS OF CENTRAL BANK SALES ROCK GOLD MARKET <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>
LONDON - Rumours that a central bank has been selling gold from its reserves increased in intensity on Thursday after heavy sales rocked prices in the Far East and early European markets.<BR><P>
OIL PRICE, WEAK RAND CATCH UP WITH PPI <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The surge in oil prices and the rand's weakening had at last caught up with producer inflation, lifting the rate of increase in October to 8,3% from 7,6% in September, Central Statistical Service figures released yesterday showed.<BR><P>
RAND'S FALL OVERSTATED, SAYS ECONOMETRIX <I>(Business Report, Jhb.)</I><BR>
The rand's fall of between 25% and 30% this year has been exaggerated and rand watchers should not labour under the illusion that the currency cannot fall further, Econometrix, the economic forecasting unit, said yesterday.<BR><P>
CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT SHRINKS AS RAND PLUMMETS <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
One benefit of the diving value of the rand showed up in the nation's current account for the third quarter this year as its deficit shrank from a revised R4,7bn in the quarter to June 30 to R3,5b for the quarter to September 30, the Reserve Bank said yesterday.<BR><P>
EXCITING, DEREGULATING, METAMORPHIC <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Many will reflect on this year as a disappointing year of mixed fortunes in which expectations were not realised.  The year began with promises of massive foreign investment, a buoyant stock exchange and imminent exchange control abolition.  Sadly, this<I> [presumably "these"]</I> never eventuated.  The stock exchange was stagnant, the currency suffered a marked collapse, foreign investors did not show the confidence expected, and inflation and interest rates tended up as economic growth began to stagnate and the harsher-than-anticipated conditions for the man in the street manifested themselves.<BR><P>
NEW TRADE THEORY?  BAH, HUMBUG <I>(Business Mail, Fridays with the Mail & Guardian)</I><BR>
Is there such a thing as international competitiveness?  Paul Krugman thinks many of the arguments are bunk. Debates about international trade are, Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggests, "a study in confusion and misconceptions, in which the 'experts' are usually misinformed about the most basic facts and concepts".  He goes on:  "The idea that the economic success of a country depends on its international competitiveness took hold in the late 1970s.  The World Economic Forum began issuing its World Competitiveness Report in 1980, and the rankings in that report soon became a major criterion by which national performance was judged.  By the 1990s, the concept was no longer even controversial.  Competitiveness was the key:  the only question was how to achieve it".  Krugman argues that people who use the term believe "nations compete for world markets in the same way that corporations do, that a nation which fails to match other nations in productivity or technology will face the same kind of crisis as a company that cannot match the costs of products of its rivals".<BR><P>
RESERVE BANK CALLS FOR HIGHER LEVEL OF SAVINGS <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
In its latest quarterly bulletin released yesterday, the Reserve Bank has reiterated that one of the key brakes on the South African economy is still the nation's low level of saving.  But whether savings or economic growth comes first is still subject to debate.<BR><P>
COURT CHIDES ASSEMBLY OVER BILL OF RIGHTS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The Constitutional Court has gently chided the Constitutional Assembly for not doing more to protect and entrench the Bill of Rights - although it concedes that the safeguards provided by the new constitutional text meet the requirements for certification.<BR><P>
INCREASE IN POLITICAL VIOLENCE EXPECTED <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
At least 27 people were killed in political conflict in KwaZulu-Natal last month, and the death toll was expected to rise during the festive season, Human Rights Committee violence monitor Makubetse Sekhonyane said yesterday.<BR><P>
<B><I>... and ...</I></B><BR>
NAME STANCE MAY TRIGGER CRISIS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
IFP-aligned traditional leaders are set to trigger a crisis in KwaZulu-Natal by pushing for the province's name to be changed to <B>Kingdom </B>of KwaZulu-Natal, despite opposition from other parties in the legislature.<BR><P>
SA TO EXPORT CATTLE TO SENEGAL <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
SA would export cattle to Senegal in west Africa for the first time this week, effectively breaking into a market traditionally served by France and Germany, exporter Zais International director Pieter Louw said yesterday.<BR><P>
EU AND SA SIGN RESEARCH PROJECT CO-OPERATION PACT <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The European Union and SA signed a co-operation pact yesterday allowing their researchers to take part in joint projects.  The move will allow researchers to co-operate on projects agreed within the bloc's $16bn research programme from 1994 to 1998.<BR><P>
EU APPOINTS DEVELOPMENT SPECIALIST TO LEAD TALKS ON FREE TRADE <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
BRUSSELS - Philipp Soubestre, the deputy director-general of the European Commission's development division, has been appointed as the European Union's chief negotiator in trade talks with SA, a Brussels official said yesterday.<BR><P>
BATTLE FOR LEADERSHIP HOTS UP WITHIN PAC <I>(Cape Times, Cape Town)</I><BR>
Pressures to revamp the Pan Africanist Congress, including new leadership, at its congress next week, are mounting as the party faces electoral obliteration in 1999 unless it reverses its fortunes.  PAC president Clarence Makwetu, who narrowly held on to his position at the partys congress in Bloemfontein last year, will almost certainly be challenged, probably by Methodist Bishop Stanley Magoba.<BR><P>

The devaluation of the rand against the dollar would outweigh the recent decline in the dollar gold price - which plunged to a $368/oz three-year low this week - and support South African gold mines' December quarterly revenues, industry sources said yesterday.<BR><P>
THE OFFICIAL MANUAL ON GOLD <I>(Business Report, Jhb.)</I><BR>
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel will not have endeared himself to the gold industry by calling gold a "diminishing commodity".  Speaking at an Australian finance conference, he said "the short-term prospect for the gold price is certainly not very encouraging for gold-producing countries like ourselves  it's pretty scary".<I> [see also yesterday's news - Ed.]</I><BR><P>
LACK OF INVESTMENT 'FAULT OF THIRD WORLD GOVTS' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
MELBOURNE - The World Bank yesterday blamed developing nations' governments for the disappointing level of private-sector involvement in infrastructure projects.  "We are still not seeing regulatory frameworks from governments that allow investors to come in and feel comfortable to operate over the 20- to 30-year live span of the projects", said World Bank private-sector development group chairman Richard Frank.<BR><P>
IDC TO INVEST R20BN IN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>

IMPALA'S SOUL-SEARCHING LEADS TO NEW VISION <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The European Community's decision to reject the proposed merger of Impala Platinum and Lonrho Platinum inspired a period of soul-searching for the South African company - a period from which it has since emerged with a new vision.  MD Steve Kearney says Impala Platinum, in which Gencor has a 45,5% stake, still wants to unlock the value of its stake in Lonrho, but that it recognises its future success lies in developing its own resources at more economic levels.<BR><P>
<B>SOUTH AFRICA'S NEW CONSTITUTION:</B><BR>
CONSTITUTION WINS COURT'S APPROVAL <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The Constitutional Court yesterday unanimously approved the revised Constitution, which will be signed by President Mandela in Sharpeville on Human Rights Day next week.<BR>
CONSTITUTION READY FOR PRESIDENTS SIGNATURE <I>(Cape Times, Cape Town)</I><BR>
South Africas new constitution is to come into force in February before the new Parliamentary session, political sources said.  President Nelson Mandela will sign the constitution at a ceremony at Sharpeville on Tuesday.  <BR>
THE LAW ENSHRINED <I>(Business Day Editorial Comment)</I><BR>
When the Constitutional Court confirmed the Constitution yesterday, it did so more in an atmosphere of relief than of celebration, even though a celebration is clearly called for.  The judgement brings to an end an arduous, six-year political process, during which SA's political ship was buffeted by extremism and threatened by chaos.  But it held its course and emerged with its principles intact and its structures strengthened beyond expectations.<BR>
PARTIES WELCOME START OF 'NEW ERA OF DEMOCRACY' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The certification of the Constitution signified the end of a unique process begun during the most trying times in SA, President Nelson Mandela said yesterday.<BR><P>

In the first eight months of the year, the economy (excluding agriculture) shed about 60 000 jobs.  On the basis of current trends, the job loss will be even bigger by the end of the year.<BR>

SA IMPERATIVES CALL FOR STATE INTERVENTION <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
According to a recent study by Hay Consultants, the salary-to-wage ratio between the wealthiest and the poorest has grown significantly since the elections in 1994.  Further, gross domestic product growth of about 3% has resulted in actual loss of jobs in manufacturing and other sectors during this period.<BR><P>
BLACK SA INVESTORS MOVING INTO NEW PHASE <I>(Reuters)</I><BR>
MELBOURNE - Black South African investment executives said on Wednesday their empowerment strategy was now seeking to build skills and employment through greater management involvement and greenfield operations.<BR><P>
MANDELA CONFIRMS DECISION ON TAIWAN <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
President Mandela reaffirmed government's decision to break diplomatic ties with Taiwan during a meeting yesterday with that country's Foreign Minister John Chang, who is understood to have asked for a two-year extension of the phase-down of formal relations.<BR>
<B><I>... and ...</I></B><BR>
DITCHING TAIWAN WAS THE RIGHT MOVE <I>(Business Report)</I><BR>
Betrayal, appeasement, kow-towing to the communists.  Some of the damning comments following President Mandela's decision to switch diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China have been stronger than this, and even unpublishable.  All of these are wrong, though.  In fact, Mandela took the wisest and most courageous choice.  The "why" question answers itself with numbers.  China will be spending $1-trillion over the next 10 years on infrastructural projects alone.  Its 1,2-billion people make it the world's largest emerging market.  To have denied SA an opportunity to get a piece of this would surely have amounted to economic treason.<BR><P>
SA TO TAKE OVER DEBT <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
The cabinet officially approved an agreement yesterday to take over Namibia's pre-independence SA government-guaranteed debt.  The debt take-over had been agreed to by President Mandela and Namibia's President Sam Nujoma. <BR><P>
EUPHORIA SOURED AS TRADE HOPES DASHED <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
HARARE - Euphoria over last week's progress in the latest round of Zimbabwe-SA trade talks evaporated yesterday, apparently as a result of dashed hopes that SA would drop its 90% tariff on Zimbabwe's textile and clothing exports by year end.<BR><P>
INDIA AND SA SIGN 3 AGREEMENTS <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
NEW DELHI - India and SA signed three agreements, including one on defence co-operation, on the first day of SA Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's four-day visit to India yesterday, Sapa reports.<BR><P>
PRETORIA 'PRETTIEST' <I>(Business Day)</I><BR>
Pretoria has been named the world's most beautiful garden city, the city council said yesterday, beating 300 other cities in an international garden city competition held in Bangalore, India.<BR><P>

In an opening address to a board meeting of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, he said, "The world seems to be at the mercy of the ungovernable phenomenon of the international financial market," and suggested it be regulated in some way.

Environmental Affairs and Tourism Minister Pallo Jordan, highly critical of the way in which the historical and cultural experiences of a large section of the South African population have been ignored, maintains that the countrys tourist potential is not being fully exploited.

There are more dimensions to tourism in SA than only flora and fauna and beautiful beaches that are indistinguishable from the beaches of Majorca and Laguna."  Jordan said the country had "so much more to offer".  Its rich diversity of cultural and historical experiences could become a unique selling point internationally.<BR><P>

MEASURING PROGRESS <I>(Business Day Editorial Comment)</I><BR>
In years ahead, the Central Statistical Service's annual October household survey should become as important a document as government's annual budget.  They are, after all, the two sides of the same coin.  Taken over time, the survey is as comprehensive a measure as we are likely to find of the improvement or deterioration of the material aspects of our citizens' quality of life.  Those are, ultimately, the end to which government and society's efforts are directed.  The Budget, on the other hand, is the fiscal mechanism which determines - directly and indirectly - in large part how those ends are to be prioritised and financed.<BR><P>

<TITLE>Chamber of Mines of South Africa Mining and Minerals Policy</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff" TEXT="#000080">

<A NAME="resource"></A>
<B>3. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT</B><P>

<b>General Comment</B><P>

This section, in focusing on mineral rights and security of tenure, is central to policy on mining and mineral rights.  The great majority of employers who are familiar with the current system or who have invested heavily on the strength of the security of tenure assured by the current system support the arguments raised below for its retention.<P>

<B>3.1 	MINERAL RIGHTS</B><P>

<dl>
<dt><b>3.1.2	iii)</b><br>	<dd>It is misleading to speak of an international trend towards the 	public ownership of mineral rights.  There is a discernible 	international trend towards a reduced role for governments in 	economic activities, as evidenced by the reduction of the role of 	government in the mining industry, often by the privatisation of 	State controlled mineral lands and enterprises.<P>

	We disagree that private rights should be passed to the State. It has not been demonstrated that private as opposed to State ownership of mineral rights discourages mining.<P><br>

<dt><B>3.1.3	ii)</B><BR>	<dd>On the contrary, in South Africa private ownership has supported 	the development of one of the worlds most significant mining 	industries.  Despite the nature of South Africas geology there is a 	vibrant small-scale mining sector.  In many cases the small-scale 	mining enterprises are themselves the owners of mineral rights, 	which ownership has contributed to their success. It is not evident 	that the transfer of mineral rights to the State will result in 	successful exploration and mining;  the contrary is true where poor 	administration by the State impedes rather than promotes 	development.<P>


<dt><B>3.1.3	iv)</b><br> 	<dd>Agreed.  Nor has private ownership done so in South Africa.  	Although it is recognised that a system of State-held mineral rights 	has not prevented high-cost, long-term mining projects in countries 	such as Chile and Australia, it must be noted that neither country 	possesses the same degree of dominance that South Africa does in 	any one vital commodity. Any mineral rights dispensation in South 	Africa must recognise the countrys unique position of possessing 	vast resources of several critical commodities such as manganese, 	chrome, platinum/rhodium and vanadium resulting in South 	Africas ability to produce at a level far exceeding the worlds ability 	to consume. Countries usually suggested as models for a new South 	African mineral rights dispensation such as Chile, Australia, 	Canada etc., have no comparable position of dominance in even one 	such vital commodity. Private mineral rights owned by mining 	companies are largely related to deposits unsuitable for small-scale 	exploitation and are held as part of current or long term large-scale 	mining plans.  Local owners should be judged on their outstanding 	track record not only in terms of expanding production from their 	privately owned mineral resources in line with the growth in 	demand but also in the investment of substantial funds in long 	term market development and promotion to create such market 	growth. This track record clearly demonstrates that the exploitation 	of their privately held mineral rights represents the responsible 	husbanding of a commodity in line with market demand and not a 	dog in the manger sterilisation of mineral resources.<P>

<dt><b>3.1.3	vi)</b><br>	<dd>The majority of employers dispute the basis for the criticism 	referred to.  It is their view that under current South African law 	security and continuity of tenure derive from security of ownership 	and from a system of State authorisations to prospect or mine.  The 	system of private ownership is consistent with a free market in 	which rights may be held, acquired, encumbered and disposed of in 	a variety of ways within a regulatory framework that specifies 	appropriate standards for example on safety, health and the 	environment.<p>

	The point noted in the third sentence of paragraph 3.1.3 vi) is specious - South African companies exploring and mining in other states must operate in accordance with the laws applicable there<P>

<dt><B>3.1.4	iii)</B><br>	<DD>One should distinguish between the existing legal framework - 	which is adequate for small-scale mining - and the need to improve 	administration of the law.  A unique legal framework for micro-	scale mining suggests untenable distinctions between the 	health 	safety and environmental standards applicable to such mining and 	those applicable to small scale and large mines. Artisanal mining 	has created major problems elsewhere in the world. Whether or not 	to promote this sector in South Africa requires much further debate.<p>

<DT><B>3.1.4	iv)</B><br>	<DD>Joint ventures should be the product of business decisions.  Access 	to mineral rights currently held by the State should be improved.  	The reference to unused mineral rights is far too broad and would 	encompass rights acquired or held for future use.<P>

<DT><B>3.1.4	v)</B><BR>	<DD>The great majority of employers disagree. In their view, the 	statement in paragraph 3.1.4 v) presupposes that State ownership 	of mineral rights is superior to the current mixed system in which 	the majority of mineral rights are owned by the State and the 	minority by various private owners, including mining companies.  	The location of rights within the private sector places them nearer 	to the market and less immediately within discretionary powers 	available to the State.<P>


	The fact of significant private ownership of mineral rights within the current system of mining and mineral rights has attracted particular criticism.  Two lines of reasoning are implicit in this criticism, namely that the arrangement currently in place has -<p>
<ul>
<li>	not been conducive to the optimal exploration and exploitation of mineral resources;<p>

<li>	supported a maldistribution of the benefits derived from mining.<p>
</ul>
	The first of these lines of reasoning appears to ignore the enormous success achieved both in mining and the expansion and growth of the mining industry in South Africa.  The second line of reasoning is distorted and superficial because the distribution of benefits from mining is the product of a very complex interaction of factors such as past job reservation, conditions of employment, taxation, mining lease consideration, shareholding and investment in mining companies (whether directly or indirectly through pension funds) and so on.  It is therefore a mistake to suppose that had a system of State ownership of mineral rights existed in South Africa, it would have caused any different distribution of the benefits derived from mining.  It is not the system of mineral rights ownership that determines the distribution of benefits.  The State's policy towards encouraging the security of mining will affect the creation of wealth from mining and, if that policy is successful, result in a distribution of benefits through jobs, taxation, dividends and so on.<P>

	Private ownership of mineral rights makes it possible for mineral rights to be traded and exchanged.  A system of formal titles brings these assets into the market economy and affords sufficient security of tenure to allow the active participation of mining companies.  This security has also benefited the junior companies and individuals as the title to mineral rights can be pledged to obtain development finance.  The existence of private ownership of mineral rights within South African mineral law is consistent with a market economy and is part of the balance struck between private enterprise and State control.  The private ownership component of the system cannot be unscrambled on an equitable and efficient basis.  Expropriation of the relevant property rights would require payment of compensation not only in view of constitutional law but also because any taking of such rights by the State without compensation is likely to wipe out foreign investment interest.  The burden of compensating holders for their investment in acquisition and exploration and for the market value of their mineral rights would be enormous and have a high opportunity cost.  Furthermore, there would be no certainty that any compensation paid would be reinvested in mining.<P>

	There exists a very active market in the acquisition and disposal of mineral rights.  The relationship between a market economy and mineral rights goes far beyond any mechanism for transactions in mineral rights between private individuals, however.  The South African mining industry must also be competitive in world markets.  In order to be competitive in world markets minerals should not be exploited unless there is demand for them on those markets and not necessarily when they are discovered or because their presence has been proven.  The right to defer exploitation of mineral resources in the interests of optimal utilisation is one of the advantages of the South African system where the holder of a mineral right is a participant in a market system vis-a-vis a system ruled by the commercial judgement and political priorities of the State.  A market in which several individuals can participate freely on the basis of differing views offers opportunities for balance that would not be equally available if the State were to play the dominant role as sole owner.  Under conditions of private ownership the views taken by holders of mineral rights are frequently different from one another and are responsive to a wide range of factors including, for example, different perceptions amongst separate bodies of shareholders.<P>

	If one compares without prejudice the South African system of mining and mineral rights with foreign systems based upon licences granted by the State as the sole owner of all rights to minerals in the land, it becomes apparent that the South African system is not the only workable one.  The point to be made here is that the South African system provides the security of tenure that has enabled mining houses to take a very long view and bear the risk inherent in turning the minerals to account.  The South African system of mining and mineral rights has developed to suit South African geological conditions.  Other systems may work well in other countries.  There is no guarantee that they will work here.  One cannot entirely recast the South African system in the mould of a theoretical alternative system without enormous cost, risk of damage to and dislocation of the South African mining industry.<P>

	It must be noted that any move towards a system of coercive transfer of privately owned mineral rights to the State will almost immediately result in the cessation of market development and promotion programmes by the affected owners.  The consequence will be to change the emphasis of such industries from enhancing profit margins by expanding the market for the main benefit of South Africa to one of focussing only on maintaining market share through cost cutting.<P>

The State, where it is the 	mineral right holder, has the capacity to promote mineral 	exploration and exploitation (including by foreign, domestic, and 	small-scale operators) by granting rights to prospect, rights to mine, 	and even alienating the mineral rights themselves, within existing 	provisions in the legislation.  In particular, small-scale mining can 	be promoted on areas formerly open to pegging (the rights to 	minerals in the majority of which are held by the State) by the 	State granting short-term mineral leases coupled with mining 	permits, with proper regard to safety, health and rehabilitation.<P>

<A NAME="environment"></A> 
<dt><B>5.  ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT</DT></B><P>

<B>General Comment</B><P>

The South African mining industry has for many years taken a responsible attitude towards managing its impact on the environment.  For that reason it participated in and supported the development of environmental management programme reports (EMPRs) as a legal requirement.  The EMPR process follows integrated environmental management principles and ensures that a full assessment of environmental impacts will be made in regard to a prospecting or mining venture, in which the no project option can be considered.  If it is decided that prospecting or mining should take place, the process provides for responsible management of the environmental impact as well as for consultation with local committees and others affected by the operations. South Africas overwhelming need for economic development and job creation demands that a balance be struck between this need and environmental concerns.  It will be necessary to ensure co-ordination between the development of environmental management policy as part of a mining and minerals policy and parallel processes for example, CONNEP.<P>


<dt><B>5.2	ii)</B><BR>	<dd>The last part of paragraph 5.2 ii) fails to recognise that in terms of 	the current law site rehabilitation must be conducted 	simultaneously with mining operations, and not just when a mining 	activity has ceased.<P>

<dt><b>5.4	vi)</b><br>	<dd>The consultation should take place at the EMPR stage, but not 	necessarily at the planning stage. It should be at the discretion of 	the mining company to determine at what stage in its planning 	process to engage in external consultation.<P>

<DT><b>5.4	vii)</B><BR>	<dd>We disagree.  Catchment management schemes should be 	administered and managed by the relevant stakeholders, including 	mining companies.  Where feasible, the cost of remedying pollution 	- which would not necessarily be confined to pollution from mining 	operations - should be based on the polluter pays principle:  	provided that excessive costs should not be imposed on a mine for 	remedying pollution resulting from activities that in the past were 	consistent with regulatory requirements but do not meet current 	requirements.<P>

<DT><b>5.4	viii)</b><br>	<DD>We disagree.  This goes beyond issues of environmental 	management and implies the imposition of cost burdens on mines 	that could render them financially non-viable<p>

<DT><B>5.4	ix)</b><br>	<DD>Mines differ enormously in their impact on the environment and in 	their financial circumstances.  Appropriate measures for making 	financial provision for environmental expenditures would depend 	on particular circumstances in each case.  Great care must be taken 	to avoid an inflexible policy that would impose unduly onerous 	burdens that may destroy an enterprise.<p>

<DT><b>5.4	xi)</b><br>	<dd>We disagree. The polluter pays principle should be a cornerstone of 	national policy.  The proposed levy contradicts this principle.  	Where perpetrators cannot be identified, funding should come from 	the central fiscus.  For future damage, the EMPR process will 	ensure that the polluter pays.<p>

<DT><b>6.  SMALL-SCALE MINING AND MINERAL DEVELOPMENT</dt></b><p>

<b>General Comment</b><p>


For the sake of clarity, one should distinguish between small-scale mines and artisanal mines.  There are significant environmental and health and safety problems associated with artisanal mining, which form of mining is sometimes the only means of subsistence available to individuals.  For policy purposes great caution must be exercised before making any commitment to promoting such mining.<p>

For small-scale mines in the formal sector we believe that there should be equal treatment with large mines in respect of environmental and health and safety standards.  In addition, small-scale mines should be given adequate opportunity to participate in consultations on the formulation of policy and laws.<p>

New or emerging entrepreneurs in the formal small-scale mining sector should be encouraged and promoted where this can be done on sound economic and business principles and having regard to the nature of the mineral deposit.<p>

<DT><b>6.2	iii)</b><br>	<dd>We must stress in relation to the second sentence that the cost and 		availability of aggregate and sand will be determined by the 			market.<p>

<dt><b>6.3	 i)</b><br>	<dd>We disagree with the view that South Africa has an inactive small- 	scale mining sector.  The 1990 Mining Survey published by Central 	Statistical Services indicates that approximately 75% of the mines 	surveyed were small mines.  There is a sizeable small-scale	sector mining a wide variety of minerals used in South African 	industry.<p>

<dt><b>6.3	x)</B><br>	<dd>We disagree. No firms have closed down, but some operators have 	closed a number of quarries that were not economically viable.  A 	study by the Aggregate and Sand Producers Association of South 	Africa and the Minerals and Energy Policy Centre has indicated 	that the formal quarry industry can cope with the demands 	expected to arise from RDP construction with minimal exceptions.<p>

<dt><b>6.4	xiv)</b><br>	<dd>We recognise that the State can play a useful role in helping new 	entrepreneurs to formulate and implement business plans.  	However, given the existence of several competent bodies that can 	provide this service in the private sector the State should be wary 	about setting up additional structures.<p>

<DT><b>6.4	xvi)</B><br>	<DD>We disagree.  The underlying assumption that State ownership of 	all mineral rights is a precondition for the development of small- 	scale mining is untenable.<p>

This section covers material dealt with in sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 which sections have been commented on above.<p>

<dt><b>8.  DOWNSCALING</dt></b><p>

<B>General comment</b><p>

The society and employers recognise the hardships caused by closure, partial closure and job loss.  To that extent the legislature has imposed clear constraints upon individual and collective termination of employment which are among the most prescriptive in the world.  The addition of further obligations in respect of downscaling would add to the cost of employment, shorten the life of the mines and make employers less willing to employ.<p>

Employers are sensitive to the social consequences of job loss which may affect a community in which they operate or from which they draw their labour. It is, however, primarily the role of the State to attend to the jobless and to create an environment that will facilitate the generation of employment opportunities.<p>

The present and proposed Labour Relations Act imposes a requirement of consultation and collective bargaining with the employees affected.  The proposed Act moreover commands a duty of information disclosure and imposes a statutory, minimum, severance benefit.  The Unemployment Insurance Act requires employers (and employees) to contribute to a national unemployment fund.  In addition, many companies affected by closure or large-scale job loss have established specific retrenchment funds for programmes jointly agreed with the unions concerned.  Most retrenchment procedures negotiated at company level provide for the counselling, training and relocation (wherever possible) of redundant employees.<p>

The role of the State does not extend to the conduct of collective bargaining, which is properly left to the parties directly involved.  Legislation which commands the products of collective bargaining effectively denies collective bargaining to the detriment of corporate and labour market efficiency.<p>

The multiple functions of the State in respect of attending to the jobless, encouraging employment creation and sustainable growth requires co-ordination between ministries and national, regional and local levels of governance.  Employers need to be fully consulted as distinct from obligated to assume the public cost of job loss and unemployment.<p>

The government, nationally and locally, bears a particular responsibility.  The Unemployment Insurance Act is currently under review with the express intent of broadening its jurisdiction to attend to the concerns of the jobless.  Through established Regional Training Centres the Department of Labour provides ready access for employment skills training.  The Department of Trade and Industry is equally attending to programmes which encourage small and medium-size business development.  Many municipal authorities have established community forums inclusive of all stakeholders to manage and monitor the effects of closure and job loss on the community affected.  Evidently a need for the co-ordination of government initiatives arises.<p>

<dt><b>8.3	iii)</b><br>	<dd>The German experience is not instructive in South Africa;  it is a 	product of a unique political, economic, labour market and mining 	sector history. State and federal subsidy to the German coal mining 	industry is annually in excess of the revenues of the South African 	gold mining industry and the number of jobs involved is less than 	5% of the number of persons employed in the mining industry in 	South Africa.  The particular circumstances in Germany brought to 	bear financial resources and institutional capacity on a scale vastly 	in excess of what is available in South Africa.<p>

<DT><b>8.1	iv)</b><br>	<dd>Targeted State assistance to marginal mines returning to 	profitability is an established policy in South Africa.  Assistance to 	mines with no prospect of returning to profitability is an unjustified 	public expenditure and can, at best, only (temporarily) subsidise the 	employed at the expense of the unemployed.<p>

	Closure and job loss are the product of a multitude of factors not easily anticipated or predicted.  It is not effectively planned but has to be managed through disclosure of information, participation, collective bargaining and appropriate statutory assistance for the unemployed and for the creation of sustainable employment opportunities.<p>

<dt><b>8.4	i)</b><br>	<dd>A national plan cannot attend to the different circumstances of 	individuals, companies, communities and regions affected by job 	loss. The country has neither resources nor sufficient institutional 	capacity to apply a national plan.<p>

Unreasonable entry barriers will discourage investment 	and persuade employers to choose capital rather than labour 	intensive methods of production.<p>

	The comparison with the environment is misleading.  It overlooks the fact that the employee chooses his employment and benefits from that employment.<p>

<DT><b>8.4	iv) & ix)</b><br>		<dd>The circumstances of closure or job loss on a mine, or part of a mine, 	are so diverse as to defy a single prescription.  A fund may be 	appropriate in certain circumstances and not in others, having 	regard to the particular needs, capacities and interests of the 	parties involved.  Reconciling the needs and interests of the parties 	will be best secured through dialogue (and bargaining) in each 	particular instance and cannot reasonably be imposed by statute.<P>

	Raising the cost of employment will lower the level of employment.<p>

	It is unrealistic to suppose that a mine engaged in a struggle for survival should itself be responsible for the redeployment of its workforce.<p>

<DT><b>8.4	vi)</B><br>	<dd>The new Labour Relations Act establishes an advanced 	jurisprudence of trade union (and employee) rights and confers 	wide powers of participation, bargaining (and co-determination) 	(probably equal to) or in advance of anything in the world.  Further 	labour-related legislation in response to special pleadings on 	particular issues around collective bargaining is not appropriate.  	Bargaining is suited to meet the requirements of fairness in the 	workplace while it is the role of the State to address the 	circumstances of the jobless, and the regulatory environment for 	new employment creation.<p>

	Introduction of a Social Plan Act could have disastrous consequences for the mining sector and the people it employs.<p>

<dt><b>9.  MINING SAFETY AND HEALTH</dt></B><p>

<b>General Comment</b><p>

The health and safety of mining employees is a key component in any policy on mining.  However, it has very recently undergone comprehensive examination that is likely to find expression in a new statute early in 1996.<p>

The Department of Labour has launched, in co-operation with the Department of Health, an initiative to create a health and safety council whose purpose, among other things, is to ensure harmonization and co-operation between the various health and safety laws and their application in different industries.<p>

On the subject of HIV/AIDS we make the point that HIV/AIDS knows no boundaries.  The formulation of national policy in respect of HIV/AIDS is a responsibility of the government which should develop a national HIV/AIDS plan in consultation with all stakeholders.<p>

For these reasons the current process for the development of mining and minerals policy should not deal with issues of safety and health which have either been settled or are of much wider scope than the mining industry.<p>

<b>General Comment</b><p>

This section is concerned with (a) education and training;  (b) housing and living conditions;  (c) migrant labour;  and (d) industrial relations and employment conditions.  We comment generally on these topics as follows.<P>

<DT><B>(a)</B><BR>	<DD>If the mining sector is to maintain and strengthen its position as a world-class industry, and while the demand for manual labour especially in very deep mines will continue for a long time, it must rely increasingly on the availability of well educated and trained employees.  Provision of an education system which underpins that vital objective is necessarily the responsibility principally of the government.  While the private sector, and most prominently the mining industry, plays a crucial role in seeking to upgrade the countrys primary and secondary education standards, as well as to protect the excellence of certain tertiary institutions, these efforts can only be on top of the core role of the government.  Education and training are being adequately dealt with in other forums and processes and therefore should not be dealt with in the process of formulating mining and minerals policy.<P>

<DT><B>(b)</B><BR>	<DD>Certain large-scale mining owners have for many years provided accommodation for employees.  For reasons rooted in the countrys history a large part of the industrys manual labour requirements was met from rural areas and the accommodation provided for these workers was initially exclusively single-sex and also rudimentary.  Over time there has been considerable upgrading of accommodation including, where affordable and appropriate to the level of the employee, provision of married accommodation.<P>

	More generally, for several years there has been an increasing diversity of practice in the housing of employees in the mining industry and in line with trends in other industries.<P>

	Housing provided by mines is often superior to alternatives that are available to the individual employee.  Improvements have been made in the standard of mine housing, such standards being well in excess of those in respect of accommodation provided by the State.  In the delivery of houses in the RDP, the most conspicuous successes achieved so far have been mine housing in Kutluanong and Kanana.<P>

	Housing is increasingly part of a remuneration package determined by collective bargaining and cannot be settled by national policy.  This subject should not be on the agenda of the current process for the development of mining and minerals policy.<P>

<DT><b>(c)</B><BR>	<DD>The pressure for jobs in South and Southern Africa, and particularly from the rural areas, will inevitable lead to a continuation of migrant labour well into the future.  It is not unique to South Africa and in South Africa it is not unique to the mining industry.  Organised recruitment from rural areas within South Africa and beyond has played crucial and positive roles in enabling development of the industry, shaping the economic geography of the region and providing much needed jobs for rural dwellers.  The practice has negative consequences, such as disruptions to family and community life in the source areas and the creation of a less-than-desirable living environment at the place of work.  But there are offsetting elements such as the generation of income for rural areas that would not have been available otherwise.  In addition, revised working schedules under continuous operating arrangements could offer further improvements.  It should also be borne in mind that permanent residence has recently been conferred upon foreign citizens, including migrant workers in the mining industry, who participated in the 1994 General Election but who were not at the time admitted to the status of permanent residents of South Africa.<P> 

	Migrant labour is a very complex matter and is the subject of continuing interaction between the NUM, the Chamber of Mines of South Africa, TEBA and relevant South African government departments and the foreign governments involved.  It is therefore unnecessary and inappropriate for the subject to be focussed upon in the current process for the development of policy on mining and minerals.<P>

<DT><B>(d)</B><BR>	<DD>Industrial relations matters are best left to arrangements agreed between employers and employees.  Government must recognise that wages and conditions of employment, as well as matters affecting the employment relationship, cannot be settled by the government but need to be determined by owners and employees with regard to their particular interests.  In this respect the government must give primacy to forms of engagement that are designed to ensure meaningful participation by the parties in decisions affecting their responsibilities.  To this end government should commit itself to ensuring a legislative and regulatory environment which secures opportunity for the workplace parties to settle their affairs without intervention.  The owners believe that the necessary institutional arrangements are in place for meaningful discussions with employees on all issues of mutual interest in the workplace.  We have noted that in some parts of the discussion document there is an inaccurate assumption that invariably employees are represented by trade unions.<P>

	Legislation governing employment generally will be developed with the involvement of employers, employees and other stakeholders in other forums adequate for the purpose.  Similarly, legislation relating to corporate governance is not peculiar to the mining industry and should, like labour legislation, not be developed in a process devoted to mining and minerals policy.<P>

<B>General Comment</B><P>


For many decades, where there have been viable opportunities, the mining industry has invested in minerals beneficiation.  Minerals beneficiation projects should be initiated on the basis of market forces and of decisions taken by individual companies using well considered business objectives.  There is no justification for government intervention.<P>

<dt><b>12.  MINERAL MARKETING</DT></B><P>

<B>General Comment</B><P>

The mining industry is energetically involved in promoting, marketing and selling its products locally and internationally.  The promotion and marketing of mineral products in a competitive international milieu is a highly professional activity demanding the sustained application of technical and other specialised skills over many years.<P>

The industry is confident that its promotional and marketing efforts are conducted at the highest levels of competence.  There is no evidence to support the view advanced by some that the state could match the marketing and sales performance of the private sector.  On the contrary experience elsewhere has demonstrated that state marketing institutions have been unsuccessful and have too easily become corrupt.  For these reasons we are emphatically opposed to any government intervention in minerals marketing.<P>

Several of the observations made in the discussion document are entirely without foundation and indicate a lack of understanding of the workings of international markets.<P>

<b>General Comment</B><P>

Through sustained and concerted commitment to research and development, South African industry is the world leader in deep-level mining technology.  The depth, particularly of gold deposits, and the hardness of the rock in which the gold is embedded have demanded innovative technological solutions from the established mining houses.  Where the mining houses have found it advantageous they have undertaken R&D on a co-operative basis.  This has facilitated dissemination of information across the industry.<P>

The state is involved in R&D in and for the industry through Miningtek (CSIR) and Mintek.  The owners welcome the potential contribution that such R&D can make, provided the R&D agenda is strongly user-driven and genuinely complementary to private sector activity but would question the ability of the State to play a strategic roll in policy formulation for R & D.<P>

Co-operative research in health and safety is essential.  The Safety in Mines Research Advisory Committee (SIMRAC) is the vehicle through which research in the areas of health and safety is co-ordinated.  Such research should be funded in good part by Government.<P>

There is continuing interaction between companies, R & D organisations and universities both locally and internationally in respect of the industrys present and anticipated technological problems.  We do not believe that State intervention could add value to this process of interaction.<P>

<b>General Comment</B><P>

For many years the mining industry has had interests and involvements in the Southern African sub-continent.  These initially revolved around the recruitment of labour, which remains a factor critically important to the industry and to several of the countries concerned.  We have also included prospecting and mining operations which, after a static period due to sanctions, are now increasing appreciably.<P>

Given this history as well as the compelling logic for the economic integration of the region in the long term, we are firmly in favour of regional co-operation.  We support a phased removal of the barriers to the free movement of labour, capital, goods and services in such a way as to avoid destabilisation of any countries involved.  The resulting economic benefits will be profound and enduring.<P>

In particular, South African mining companies have technologies and specialised skills in potentially great demand throughout the region and indeed more widely in Africa.  There are associated opportunities for South African equipment suppliers as well as for engineering and other consultancies.  The South African economy thus stands to benefit significantly from regional, indeed continental, co-operation.<P>

South Africa and mining companies within South Africa are at an early stage in developing new relationships with their counterparts in the region.  It is too early to know how matters will develop.  We believe it is premature to give this subject detailed consideration as part of the development of a mining and minerals policy for South Africa.<P>

<B>General Comment</B><P>

Sensible regulation requires an understanding of the nature and interrelated technical complexities of mining which make the existence of a single, central regulatory agency highly desirable.  That agency should be the Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs (DMEA), working as necessary through its own regional offices.  Because of the way the industry has evolved as well as of the need for consistency of policy and practice across provincial and local boundaries, there should be minimal devolution of authority to separate provincial or lower-level bodies.  Such bodies should not be empowered to create laws or regulations which impact on mining.  In cases where there is a need for issues to be dealt with below national level, a prior consultative process with all affected parties is essential.<P>

The discussion document contains a variety of proposals for new government institutions.  We believe that an overall review is needed of what organisations of government will best serve the industry.  The review should focus, in particular, on efficiency and competence in the administration and functioning of government agencies whose activities have a direct bearing on the mining industry.</DL>

<H4>SYMPOSIUM FORMAT</H4>

All professionals who work or carry out research on the symposium's topics are invited to
participate. Abstracts for proposed papers should be submitted by 1 June 1996.  All
abstracts should be sent via e-mail to both symposium chairmen. Accepted papers will be
published on the Internet between 2-13 December 1996, which are the symposium dates.<p>

A Web site will be set up and maintained at NTUA, which will provide the technical support
for the symposium. Over the symposium period, participants will be able to use this Web
site to tune in, or tune out and in again, many times; to read and download papers, to
"write in" their comments, queries and criticisms. These will be entered and available for
all to see. Papers' authors will periodically defend their theses and offer comments to
queries or criticisms.  There is no cost for this symposium.  No "conference fees". No
"traveling costs".<p>

The symposium site at NTUA can be accessed through the Mining Systems Simulation
Lab's Home Page on:<p>

    <a href="http://www.metal.ntua.gr/msslab/MineSim96/index.html</a><p>

You may care to explore this home site now.  Please do not forget to register!  Once
registered you can enter this site at will. During the pre-symposium period this site will
keep you informed on symposium's status and provide useful information to tentative
participants.  The proceedings of the conference will be available on CD at nominal cost. <p><p>

by June 28, 1996.<p>


All papers should be written in English. Authors have two choices:<br>
<ol>
<li> To prepare and submit the paper in the form of a .HTM formatted file with graphics
and pictures in .GIF format. If this is the case, the organizers will consider this paper as
ready for publication (i.e. "camera ready") and will make no changes, except of the title and
author's name that should be uniform for all papers.
<li>To prepare and submit the paper in the form of a  .DOC or  .TXT formatted file
with graphics and pictures in  .PCX format. In this case, the symposium's staff at NTUA
will code up the paper in HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language) and convert graphics in 
.GIF format.
</ul>
The deadlines for submission of papers are:<br>
<ul>
<li>HTML ready papers:         October 31, 1996
<li>Text file papers:          September 30, 1996

<h4>STATUS REPORTS</h4>
<b>Monday 5 February 1996</b><br><p>
I have asked specific people to submit "benchmark" papers on certain subjects listed in the first circular.  The topics covered as: neural 
networks, mine system simulation, expert systems, computer assisted mine design, dispatching systems  and virtual reality.  I still need authors for papers on robotics and virtual reality as applied to mining.  (The person I asked to write the paper on virtual reality is not familiar with its development with regard to mining).  I will welcome any suggestions!!<p>

Someone wrote to me and asked if there will be any papers on the application of fuzzy logic in mining.  This is a good point.  Any suggestions???  I have quite a few commitments for "regular" papers.<p>

Remember that as a member of the organizing committee, your name and institution will be underlined.  If you are not familiar with how the WEB site works, anything that is underlined will have its own page.  One simply clicks on this and transfers to the page.  Remember that color photos are allowed in WEB pages.  (No fair putting your dog or cat's photo above your name).  I am going to set up my own WEB page in a week or two so you can surf over to it and see what mine looks like (and, of course, I will do the same for you).  George Panagiotou is working on the main WEB site.  It will not be operable until the dates of the symposium.  If you have any comments, suggestions, etc., let me know.  <p>

Gary Howell, CEO of the SME, suggested that we make the proceedings available on CD an nominal cost.  He said that he would assist us in this.  Sounds like a great idea.  Perhaps we can find a corporate sponsor to help underwrite the costs of this.  Any suggestions?  (I have one already but it will take a few months before I can approach the company).<p>

GOLD FIXES AT $337,70 IN LONDON, ITS LOWEST AFTERNOON FIXING SINCE 1993<I>(Business Report, Johannesburg)</I><BR>
Gold fixed at $337,70 in London yesterday afternoon, from $339,40 on Tuesday.<BR><P>
ANGLO EDGES CLOSER TO ZAMBIAN COPPER COUP<I>(Business Report, Johannesburg)</I><BR>
A consortium led by Anglo American has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Zambian government, which gives the group the exclusive right to conduct a feasibility study on the Konkola copper mining project.<BR><P>
SA JEWELLER SEIZES GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY<I>(Business Report, Johannesburg)</I><BR>
The Reserve Bank has given a Durban jeweller the go-ahead to export sculptures of big game in precious metals to Hollywood stars and other rich overseas collectors.<BR><P>
BALANCING THE RAND Editorial Comment <I>(Business Day, Johannesburg)</I><BR>
Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals did not intend his off-the-cuff remark to Reuters that the rand may have rebounded a little too far to have the dramatic impact it did in the market on Tuesday - a seven cent plunge before clawing back half of that after he clarified his views.  But if the unintended effect of the governor's intervention is to return to a more stable course for the rand, it will have served a useful purpose.<BR><P>
EMPLOYMENT<I>(Business Day, Johannesburg)</I><BR>
Employment rose from 4,95-million in March 1994 to 5,24-million in Sept last year, an increase of 290 000, Labour Minister Tito Mboweni said yesterday.<BR><P>

AN RDP BY ANY OTHER NAME WILL HAVE THE SAME BASIC PRINCIPLES<I>(Business Day, Johannesburg)</I><BR>

At the time, there seemed to be few linkages in place to ensure the effective management of programmes.  But are there any now?  Has a change of location made a difference and has the RDP remained at the centre of government's activities?<BR><P>
GOVT 'UNLIKELY TO LET SAA GO TO FOREIGNERS'<I>(Business Day, Johannesburg)</I><BR>
Government was unlikely to give foreign buyers the opportunity to acquire a majority stake in SA Airways (SAA), following its decision to give offshore investors access to up to 49% of a privatised Sun Air, Public Enterprises Ministry spokesman Wandile Zote said yesterday.<BR><P>
COMMONWEALTH DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION TO INVEST R400M IN SA<I>(Business Report, Johannesburg)</I><BR>
The Commonwealth Development Corporation, Britain's overseas finance institution, will invest about R400 million in development projects in SA over the next three years, David Morley, the SA director of the corporation said yesterday.<BR><P>
