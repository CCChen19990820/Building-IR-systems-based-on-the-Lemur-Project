<H2>Beam Diagnostics Control Software</H2></CENTER>

The Single Event Effects Test Facility has a smaller chamber upstream of
the test chamber that contains several devices used for beam diagnostics.
These items can be controlled from a window (shown below) in the control software.
Each item is on a slider and can be moved in and out of the beam.<P>

The shutter is used to instantly start and stop the beam.<P>

The mirror block, in conjunction with the alignment laser, is used to align
the parts with the beam.  A laser spot can be placed on the individual part to confirm
exactly where the center of the beam will be.<P>

The Solid State Detector (SSD) is used to collect energy information about
the beam.<P>

The filter wheel has 5 positions for 4-inch diameter disks.  These disks can
be used for beam degradation or collimation.  The filter wheel is not on a
slider.  It rotates among the 5 different positions.<P>

The Center and Quad Photo Multiplier Tubes (PMT) are used to measure the flux
of the beam.  The Center PMT is placed in the beam with the Quad PMT and a 
calibration reading is measured.  This way, the Center PMT can be moved out
during testing and the flux can be calculated based on the readings from
the Quad PMT.<P>

<img align=right border=0 src="../graphics/Camera.gif" WIDTH=230 HEIGHT=141 alt="Camera"><P>

The large chamber has a camera attached to it that views the inside of the
chamber.  There are also lights in the chamber.  These can be used to view
the parts and align them with the beam using the alignment laser.  You can align the parts by clicking on the alignment laser icon and then clicking on the part that you want to move into the beam.  The computer will make the appropriate calculations and move the part to the point indicated by the alignment laser.

<img align=right border=0 src="../graphics/TestHead.gif" WIDTH=274 HEIGHT=292 alt="Test Head">

The ASSET Test Head has several sections.  It can have multiple modules 
installed at the same time and can rotate the appropriate module into position
whenever the module is tested.  The user utilizes the Test Head window to tell the computer which modules are installed where.  They can drag the modules from
one position to another.

<H2>How Single Event Effects Testing is Done</H2></CENTER>

<H3>Basics of Testing</H3><P>
Radiation in the space environment consists of a variety of charged particles that greatly differ in
their ionizing ability, and, therefore, in the energy that can be deposited into electronic instruments. 
A particle's ionization loss-rate is called linear energy transfer (LET) and is measured in
MeV cm^2 / mg.

<P>

<CENTER>
<img src="../graphics/SEEsetup.gif" WIDTH=530 HEIGHT=308 alt="A SEE Test Setup">
<BR>

</CENTER>

<P>

The constituents in the space-radiation environment primarily responsible
for Single Event Effects are energetic atoms ranging in atomic number from
1 (hydrogen) to 26 (iron) and beyond.  A particle passing through matter
(for example, silicon) transfers its energy to the medium primarily by
ionizing atoms along its path.  The amount of energy lost by the particle
per unit path length is called linear energy transfer (LET) and varies
directly as the square of the atomic number of the particle and inversely
as its energy.  Thus, the amount of energy deposited (and therefore, charge
created) in a vulnerable region of a circuit component is proportional to
LET x path length in the region.  By convention, "path length" is measured
in units of mass per unit area (mg / cm^2) and energy in MeV.  Thus, LET has
the units of MeV - cm^2 / mg.  Note that in a vulnerable region shaped like
a thin slab, particles incident at an angle theta have a path which is 
1 / cos theta longer than a path at normal incidence and hence, produce 
more ionization charge than normally incident particles do.

<P>

The figure above illustrates a simple Single Event Effect test technique 
based on the concepts outlined above.  The device under test is monitored while it is being
irradiated with energetic particles.  By counting the number of Single Event Effects and knowing how many particles
passed through the part, we can calculate the likelihood of a particular particle causing a Single Event Effect. 
This resultant number, which is the number of upsets divided by the number of
particles per cm^2 causing the upsets, is called the cross-section of the part and is measured in units of
cm^2 / device.<P>

The goal of Single Event Effects testing is to determine the cross section vs. LET curve by irradiating the device
being tested with different species of particles, at various angles, to render a range of effective
LETs.<P>

<H3>The Effects of Varying LET</H3>

The following chart shows a sample cross-section curve for a microelectronic device and
the ions that were used to test it.  

<P>

<CENTER>

<img src="../graphics/LETcurve.gif" WIDTH=534 HEIGHT=415 alt="LET Curve">
<BR>

</CENTER>

<P>

With most devices, there is some minimum LET that is required
to affect the part.  We call this minimum LET the threshold LET.  Above the threshold LET, there is a range
where, as the LET increases, the cross-section also increases.  As LET gets larger, eventually a point
is reached, called the knee, where an increase in LET no longer affects upset rate.  All particles
with LET higher than the knee value affect the part equally.<P>

The following graph shows the LET of the ions that are encountered in an Earth orbit. 

<P>

<CENTER>

<img border=0 src="../graphics/400km_orbit.gif" WIDTH=503 HEIGHT=304 alt="400km Orbit">
<BR>

</CENTER>

<P>

Notice the selection of ions used to cover the range encountered in space.  Fortunately, for
satellites, the low LET ions are much more common than ones with high LET.

<H3>How an SEU (bit-flip) Occurs</H3>

<IMG ALIGN=right src="../graphics/how_seu_occurs.gif" WIDTH=222 HEIGHT=303 alt="How Bitflip Occurs">

The image below shows a simple 1-bit storage device illustrating the effect of an SEU, or
"bit-flip."  The circuit is designed so that it has two stable states, one that represents a stored
'0' and one that represents a stored '1.'  In each state, two transistors are turned on and two are
turned off.  A bit-flip occurs when an energetic particle causes the state of the transistors in the
circuit to reverse.  This phenomenon occurs in many microcircuits, including memory chips and
microprocessors.

In a spaceborne computer, for example, a bit-flip could randomly change critical data, randomly change
the program, or confuse the processor to the point that it crashes.

<H3>Interaction of a Cosmic Ray with Silicon</H3>

The figure below illustrates how an energetic particle can produce a 
spurious electrical signal.  The particle produces charges along its
path, in the form of electrons and holes.  These are collected at the 
source and drain, and a current pulse appears.  This can be large enough
to produce an effect like that of a normal signal applied to the 
transistor.

<H2>Single Event Latchup</H2></CENTER>

<H3>How Latchup Occurs</H3>

Circuits are manually made in silicon by combining adjacent p-type
and n-type regions (i.e., over-seeded, or "doped," with appropriate
impurities) into transistors.  Paths other than those chosen to form
the desired transistor can sometimes result in so-called parasitic 
transistors, which, under normal conditions, cannot be activated.
Latchup occurs when a spurious current spike, such as that produced by
a heavy cosmic ray, activates one of a pair of these parasitic transistors,
which combine into a circuit with large positive feedback.  The result
is that the circuit turns fully on and causes a short across the device
until the latter burns up or the power to it is cycled.  This condition,
when caused by a charged particle, is called Single Event Latchup.

<H3>Spurious Pulses</H3>

In analog circuits like the operational amplifier below, the output voltage will spike.  Depending on
the speed of the amplifier and the circuit, the output can settle smoothly back to the original
voltage or temporarily oscillate, as shown in this output waveform.  These spurious pulses can
propagate through other circuits and cause errors in received command data, errors in transmitted
telemetry, or false readings on sensors.

<H3>Permanent Destruction</H3>

A hexfet is a type of transistor that is designed to switch large amounts of voltage and current. 
A hexfet is actually made up of thousands of smaller transistors that work collectively to handle
the large load.  When a particle causes one of these small transistors to turn on by itself, that
transistor bears the brunt of the large load by itself and burns out, often destroying the
device.<P>

Even devices that don't contain memory elements can suffer from a form of single event upset. 
Until recently, very little research has been directed towards the study of other Single Event Effects. 
These SEEs can take several forms.<P>

In combinatorial digital circuits (circuits with no memory), the result is usually a glitch, or a
temporary change-of-state of the output.  A glitch usually lasts anywhere from a fraction of a
nanosecond to several nanoseconds, and can cause problems in circuits that are downstream.  For
instance, if a circuit that drives a counter experiences a glitch, the counter may increment,
causing the counter value to be inaccurate.<P>

</CENTER>

<P>

<H3>Temporary Nonfunctionality</H3>

Sometimes SEEs cause parts to cease functioning.  Possible causes include a mild latchup condition
where only small sections of the chip are disabled, or the occurrence of bit-flips in control logic. 
Parts often have diagnostic modes that disable the device and provide self-test data for use during
manufacturing.  By the time such a device is shipped to the end user, these special modes are disabled
so that the device is always functional.  However, a bit-flip can cause the part to enter one of its
diagnostic modes, making it seem nonfunctional.  Diagnosing and analyzing part failure in such a
circumstance is very difficult.<P>

In most cases where a part becomes nonfunctional with no apparent power increase (vs. the latchup
condition where large current draws occur), the part will function again if power is removed and
reapplied.

<H3>Abstract</H3><P>

SEE testing was performed on pulse width modulation (PWM) controllers, which
are commonly used in switched-mode power supply systems.  Two types of single event
upset (SEU) were observed; these can be related to different sections of the
device design that involve a Set-Reset flip/flop.<P>

<H3>Summary</H3><P>

Pulse width modulation (PWM) controllers such as the Unitrode UC1825A, UC1845A,
and UCC1805 are commonly used in various switched-mode power supply systems.  These devices offer special features designed to optimize
the controller while minimizing the need for external circuitry.  The devices generally
have an error amplifier, an oscillator circuit, the PWM latch and output, and
internal reference voltage.  In some controllers, such as the ones tested here, there are
also protection features such as undervoltage lockout (UVLO), current limiting,
and soft-start.  These are used for protection of both the device and other 
circuitry being driven by the device.  Unitrode uses bipolar technology for the first two of these controllers, and 
BiCMOS technology for the third.<P>

The goal of this work was to determine the vulnerability of these PWM controllers
in a radiation environment.  Each controller was tested for single event latchup
(SEL) and single event upset (SEU) at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) 88-inch
cyclotron facility using a "cocktail" of ions (N (70 MeV), Ne (89 MeV),
Ar (175 MeV), Cu (283 MeV), Kr (366 MeV), and Xe (603 MeV)).<P>

The testing technique adhered to practices established for testing at LBL.  The device is mounted in the beamline and bombarded with heavy ions from a 
known beam.  The beam is directed on the part and the flux and errors are measured.
From this a "cross-section," a measure of the device's vulnerability to SEE,
is computed.  The test is an active test.  The controllers are configured for normal
operation and are functioning during irradiation.  All input power is supplied from
the control room approximately 15 feet away, and the supply currents and device outputs
are monitored.  All currents were measured with digital ammeters, while all the
output waveforms were monitored on a digital oscilloscope.  Finally, by ranging
through the different ions available in the "cocktail," the threshold of the
particular part is determined.<P>

The inputs to the error amplifier and the current sense circuits were biased to typical levels for 
normal operation at a fixed frequency output, determined by set values of an external
resistor (R(t)) and capacitor (C(t)).  It was expected that the SEUs would manifest
as either frequency or duty-cycle changes.  One of the devices tested, the UC1825A,
allowed more visibility into the different circuits through output pins, such
as the oscillator monitor pin, the soft-start pin, and the complementary output 
pins.  It was important to see how the complementary outputs responded relative to
each other as well as to the clock, since the comparisons would help isolate the location of an
upset.  Therefore they were all monitored simultaneously.  The test results will
be summarized using the data for this device.<P>

SEL is recognizable by an increase in current consumption from which recovery
is achieved by cycling power to the device.  The UC1825A device did not latchup as was
expected from a bipolar device.  The current remained stable (around 70 mA, given device
variation) throughout the irradiation except during an SEU.  That is, when a change
in the device output occurred, a corresponding drop in current was observed.  
However, the steady-state current was always reestablished.  The current drop-out
seen here is related to the device soft-start state, which is a design feature intended
to minimize start-up current.<P>

In exploring the nature of the SEUs, there were two types identified.  The first (type I),
which was the predominant form, is characterized by both frequency outputs
returning to a low output state for a period of time correlated with the soft-start feature
of the device.  The data suggests that since both outputs are low during an upset, the inhibit features of the device are involved.
The duration of the type I disturbance has been correlated to the soft-start
feature.  The time it takes the duty cycle to increase from 0% to 50% after
the onset of the upset is equal to the time it takes to discharge and recharge
the soft-start capacitor (C).  To test this, three different values for this capacitor
were used in testing.  Initially, the test was done with C = 10 microF and the
recovery time from a disturbance was about 1 second.  By changing the value of C to
10,000 pF and 100 pF, the time to recover was shortened to about 4 ms and 10 us, 
respectively.  The soft-start feature has a latching circuit that forces the capacitor to
fully discharge before recharging on a fault.  This is an enhancement from an
earlier version of the device.  It was added to eliminate the effect of a fault
in the operation of the power system, which would cause a restart but had a vert
short duration.  With the change, such a fault would not overstress the part or
cause large power dissipation.  An error in either the over-current circuit
or the UVLO circuit will force the device into restart, during which both outputs 
are low.  There are 2 bistable elements (S-R flip/flops) common to these two circuits. <P>

The second type of SEU (type II) had a disturbance of much shorter duration.
An "interrupt" in the output, which lasted less than one clock period, was seen.  The correct function was restored before the next clock
cycle began.  Again, when both outputs are being forced low, an error in the output
inhibit circuit is indicated.  Sometimes, however, the data shows an upset in the toggle
flip-flop, which appears as a clock cycle of incorrect period but complementary at the
outputs.  These short disturbances indicate that the upset most likely occurred
in either the PWM latch (again an S-R flip/flop) or the output stage (a
toggle flip/flop).<P>

The LET threshold of the UC1825A is about 4 MeV/(mg/cm^2), while the saturation cross-section is about 2 x 10^-3 cm^2/device, at the LET value of about 
70 MeV/(mg/cm^2).<P>

These types of controllers have not been tested before, unlike SRAMs, DRAMs,
and microprocessors.  PWM controllers offer a wide variety of features in
different combinations.  Other devices will have similar susceptibilities to SEU
and therefore should be tested.  Since these devices are made up of both analog and 
digital circuits, there may be other effects.

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>Total dose response tests of electronics devices have been routinely
carried out with Co60 gamma rays. About two years ago, it was discovered
that the total dose degradation of an optocoupler device was much more
severe when protons were used as the irradiation source. In order to measure
the degradation response with a heavier ion beam (helium) as well as with
protons, a set of tests was conducted at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
88-inch cyclotron facility during the week of April 22, 1996. We used 48-MeV
helium ions as well as 45-MeV protons for the comparative investigation.
The test devices were optocouplers (4N24's, manufactured by Texas Instruments)
with date codes 8440 and 8841.</P>

<P> </P>

<H3>Test Setup</H3>

<P>The test devices were biased, in order to simulate the actual application
condition, with a suitable setting of the resistor values (RI is in the
input loop while RO is in the output loop.) Two ammeters were used to measure
the current readings (AI and AO.) A schematic representation of the test
setup is shown here: </P>

<P>Since the input current is mostly dependent on the input series resistor,
our measurements consist of the output current readings for the three selected
output series resistor values as a function of dose for each input resistor
setting. Then the ratio of the current passing through the output section
to that of the input section may be evaluated. This is the current transfer
ratio (CTR). During the irradiation, the input series resistor was maintained
at 230 ohm, while the output series resistor was kept at 10 kohm. After
each exposure, the output current values were measured by changing the
series resistor values.</P>

<P> </P>

<H3>Test Results</H3>

<P>All output current values decreased with increasing total dose. However,
the degradation was more dramatic when the test device was biased to produce
a large CTR (after each irradiation). In general, the higher the CTR, the
stronger the response to radiation. The output current values for the following
case are plotted here, for irradiation with protons and helium: </P>

<P>The total dose degradation due to helium is several times more pronounced
than that due to protons, as can be seen by the different dose scales on
the plots. The degradation curves plotted in each figure also show that
two devices with the same date code, DC8841, respond very differently.</P>

<P> </P>

<H3>Summary</H3>

<P>We have observed three main characteristics from the current irradiation
tests: 1. the total dose response for the 4N24 optocouplers was much more
pronounced when the helium ion beam was used, than was the case with the
proton beam; 2. a large part-to-part variation for total dose degradation
existed; and 3. devices with DC8440 were less affected than those with
DC8841. </P>

<H2>Communication Satellites, 1958 - 1995</H2>

<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="../../images/commSat.gif" WIDTH=228 HEIGHT=300 HSPACE=8>One of the most significant applications of space technology has been the development of communication satellites. Experimentation with communication satellites began early in the space age, and they were first used in operational systems in 1965. Growth of the technology has been rapid, with a new communication satellite launched almost every year since 1965. 
<P>
The variety of international and domestic applications demonstrates the usefulness of communication satellites, which provide services to both large and small terminals on land and on ships. Some systems are government sponsored; others are commercial ventures, in many cases competing with the terrestrial communications industry. 
<P>
Communications Satellites, 1958-1995, provides technical details of each type of satellite during this period. Each major section, introduced by a brief historical survey, covers one satellite type or application. Within the section, satellites are chronologically ordered by initial launch dates. Descriptions include graphic representations, block diagrams of communication subsystems, and satellite details. The book is liberally illustrated, with more than 300 line drawings, flowcharts, and maps. 
<P>
The focus of the text is communication satellites actually launched, but additional topics are covered, including satellites in planning and development stages. Some studies that did not result in launch or proposal by 1995, although not described in detail, are mentioned in relation to other programs. In addition, because each satellite is only a part of a large communication system, information on earth terminals and satellite operations for some systems is provided with the satellite description. 
<P>
An extended bibliography includes sources on communication satellite systems, experiments and applications, ground terminals, transmission methods, spectrum use, network engineering, satellite hardware, legal and economic issues, among others.

<H1>John A. Adams</H1>
<H2>
is a Minor Regional Art GWH&A
<A HREF="../../trivia/lizard.html">Lizard.</A></H2><P>
<H3>
Call him shy. Call him retiring.  Call him shy and retiring.  Call him whatever you want...you will anyway.  Lord knows we've tried to figure him out.<P>

More reclusive than that Pynchon guy or even Thms. MacPherson (who no one has heard of either), the details about his life are sketchy at best and painterly at worst.<P>
He is shown here in a rare photograph taken when he was twelve and shortly before receiving his 4-F on the grounds of his incredibly poor vision, spelling and taste in bolo ties.  He is the only person known to be rejected (wisely) on those grounds.<P>
His melon sharp wit and tolerance of the color turquoise have made him the solace of many a stormy night in Little America WY, where he has been three times.<P>
Beyond that, little else is known or necessary to relate here.<P>

There are the usual ways to contact him, just use his 
<A HREF="address.html">address</A>. <P>

Once in a while, his handlers slip up and some of his commercial
<A HREF="images.html">images</A>. get out onto the net. We are not sure if this is a bug or a bonus just yet.<P>

And if that's not enough, check out his "fine art" located just around the corner at the <A HREF="/~adams/PureArt/">PureArt </A>page </H3><P>

I am the <CITE>Technical Writer and Support Representative</CITE> <A HREF="../../trivia/lizard.html">Lizard</A> at GWH&A. I'm the one that does more UNIX and little imaging work around here. After all, someone has to make sure the software we sell gets installed successfully and licensed.<P>

I have a virtual "presence" around here. I do most of my work by modem and troubleshooting over the phone.<P>

<H1>3-D Lenticular Stereogram Imaging Process</H1>

<H2>GWH&A is the ND3D Master Service Center in the United States</H2>

GW Hannaway & Associates is proud to introduce a state-of-the-art 3-D Lenticular Stereogram imaging process for the visualization of 3-D computer generated graphics.
As a U.S. Master Service Center for ND3D, the Dutch-based developer of the 
lenticular 3-D Lenticular Stereogram process, we can now offer high-quality, full color
3-dimensional Lenticular Stereograms directly to you.<P>

If you are doing 3-D computer graphics, you probably already know how important 
it is to create accurate, compelling presentations of your work that capture 
the richness of your 3-D images. With the rapid growth of the 3-D computer
graphics industry, you have probably also detected increased competition, 
and perhaps you've already been searching for a way to set your work apart. 
The ND3D process creates high quality, detailed, full color reproductions 
of figure, perspective and depth from your 3-D data in a way that no ordinary
2-D print or transparency can match.<P>

ND3D 3-D Lenticular Stereograms are ideal for situations where accurate representation
is critical, such as: medical diagnostics and display; scientific research 
and education; entertainment production and promotion; industrial design 
and CAD/CAM; and landscape and industrial design. The affordability of the 
process makes it possible to produce single copies or full production runs 
of tens of thousands. This makes 3-D Lenticular Stereograms ideal for exhibitions, 
presentations and proposals, reports, brochures, business cards, product 
samples, and animation storyboarding, just to name a few applications.<P>

For those really hot promotions, backlit 3-D Lenticular Stereograms in sizes
upto 40"(H) by 60"(V) provide the perfect backdrop for your exhibit.
<P>

Please call, fax, or e-mail us if you have any questions about NS3D Lenticular Stereogram
output. Contact us to place an order for 3-D Lenticular Stereograms from your computer 
generated images.<P>

As ND3D's Master Service Center for the United States, we look forward to 
working with you to create 3-D output as compelling as your 3-D imagery.<P>

<H2>Software for the Kodak Professional Digital Cameras</H2>

<B>DC-Tool</B> is an X-Windows application that allows Silicon Graphics and 
SUN workstation users to directly acquire images from the KODAK DCS 460,
EOS1, DCS420 and DCS 200 Professional Digital Camera Systems. Using an 
OSF/Motif graphical user interface, the images are downloaded through 
the camera's SCSI port, color interpolated, balanced, corrected as 
required, and saved in one of 16 available image file formats.<P>

<H2>DC-Tool Features:</H2>
<H4>
<UL>
<LI>View scrollable pages of thumbnail images for selection and preview.
<LI>Save raw images in an archive file which can be interpolated, balanced, 
and corrected.
<LI>Perform color balancing after the fact for daylight, tungsten, fluorescent 
and flash balance.
<LI>Has a fully functional hot shoe for electronic flash.
<LI>Trigger camera exposures and manage images stored in the DCS from the
workstation.
<LI>View color previews on systems supporting 24 bit X-Windows (grayscale on 
8-bit systems).
<LI>Save acquired images in Silicon Graphics, X-Windows, TIFF, Photoshop, 
Wavefront, and other file formats.
<LI>Record detailed information (such as aperture setting, exposure duration,
date and time image was captured) and save annotations with each image in
archives.
<LI>Control the camera shutter in dedicated camera-based imaging solutions, 
such as microscopy, manufacturing, and remote sensing.
</UL></H4>

The Kodak DCS 460 Professional Digital Camera is the newest DCS camera for 
high resolution digital photography. It provides portable (approx. 4 lbs.), 
fully digital (CCD sensor records direct to disk), 12 bits/color, high 
resolution imaging (2036 x 3060 pixels) and a larger electronic sensor that
yields nearly full-frame viewing (1.3 x focal length) with the same control 
and precision of an advanced 35mm SLR film-based camera. However, with 
digital photography, the results are available instantly on-line, with no 
film expense, processing delays, or chemical processing. The Kodak Professional
DCS 460 consists of a standard Nikon N90 body with the Kodak digital camera 
back. The DCS stores images on a removable PCMCIA hard drive: Drives can be 
replaced in seconds for increased image storage.<P>

Because of the advantages of digital photography, the Kodak Professional 
Digital Camera System and GW Hannaway & Associates DC-Tool software are being 
used extensively in applications that require immediate access to images, such 
as journalism, remote sensing, long-distance interactivity, and surveillance, 
or applications that require a large volume of images, such as catalog 
production, manufacturing quality assurance, medical documentation, real estate
advertising, and multimedia.<P>

<H3>	DC-Tool is supported on platforms:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>	SGI IRIX 5.3 or above
<LI>	Sun Solaris 2.3 or above
</UL>

prepared. The tasty dishes on our menu are prepared with Silicon 
Graphic computers (with a variety of software) as well as video 
toasters and Mac based programs, and served on Beta SP, D1, SVHS, 
35mm or in digital form, all with no muss or fuss.<P>

And as always, our policy in the Kitchen is to remember that you, 
the customer, is the most important ingredient in any entree as we 
strive to bring you Graphics with good taste, not Graphics that taste 
good.<P>

<H2>Precision 35mm Motion Picture Scanner</H2>
This precision 35mm Motion Picture scanner was created for a major hospital on the west coast.  They will be using it to scan 35mm motion cardiac X-Rays.  It consists of a 35mm flatbed movement with custom modifications.  The scanning element itself is a 3K by 2K by 10 bit deep liquid cooled CCD (Charged Coupled Device) camera.  The system also includes a live video out for full motion search of the film.<P>

GWH&A created the scanner and integrated it with an SGI 2 processor ONYX with VTX graphics and Sirius Video.  GWH&A also created a custom user interface to control the scanner and capture the motion, high resolution, and digital imagery.

<A HREF="../../trivia/lizard.html">Lizard.</A></H2><P>
<H3>
Call him shy. Call him retiring.  Call him shy and retiring.  Call him whatever you want...you will anyway.  Lord knows we've tried to figure him out.<P>

More reclusive than that Pynchon guy or even Thms. MacPherson (who no one has heard of either), the details about his life are sketchy at best and painterly at worst.<P>
He is shown here in a rare photograph taken when he was twelve and shortly before receiving his 4-F on the grounds of his incredibly poor vision, spelling and taste in bolo ties.  He is the only person known to be rejected (wisely) on those grounds.<P>
His melon sharp wit and tolerance of the color turquoise have made him the solace of many a stormy night in Little America WY, where he has been three times.<P>
Beyond that, little else is known or necessary to relate here.<P>

There are the usual ways to contact him, just use his 
<A HREF="address.html">address</A>. <P>

Once in a while, his handlers slip up and some of his commercial
<A HREF="images.html">images</A>. get out onto the net. We are not sure if this is a bug or a bonus just yet.<P>

And if that's not enough, check out his "fine art" located just around the corner at the <A HREF="/~adams/PureArt/">PureArt </A>page </H3><P>

<H1>Denise V. Berg</H1>

is the Head Business <A HREF="../../trivia/lizard.html"> Lizard </A>at GWH&A.<P>

As the Business Manager I fit all of the pieces together.  I deal with all of the accounting issues, supervise our shipping department, and provide customer service.<P>

My position extends further into Sales.  Whenever there is a request for Kodak Printers and Cameras, Chameleo professional imaging software, and DC-TOOL I am the one to speak with.  Please refer to the <A HREF="/tools/index.html"> software tools </A> page for a full list and description of products.<P> 

I have two wonderful children.  Kiowa, who is 12 and a terrific big brother to Miles, who is now 2 and 1/2.  Miles has become a very special child since he was diagnosed with a mild/moderate hearing loss at 8 days of age.  From my family's experiences, GW Hannaway & Associates is now working in conjunction with Denver Ear Institute to develop a series of videos and a CD-ROM to help other families of children with hearing losses.  Please check out our <A HREF="/projects/hear/index.html"> hearing impaired project</A> page.<P>  

There are the usual ways to <A HREF="address.html">contact</A> me. <P>

<TITLE>A Brief History of Fop</TITLE>

<H1>A Brief History of Fop</H1>
fop, <I>n</I>. [ME. <I>fop</I>, <I>foppe</I>,  a fool; G. <I>fopper</I>,
a jeerer, scoffer.]
<OL>
<LI>originally, a foolish person.
<LI>a vain, affected man who pays too much attention to his clothes, appearance, etc.; a coxcomb; a dandy; a dude.
<LI>a nickname for J. Gabriel Foster, in formal usage Mr. Fopster.
</OL>

I got this nickname from my tendency to mistype my name when logging
in to my first Unix account at the University of Colorado.  A friend
of mine, Mike Sandige, started calling me that and the name stuck.  I
think the foolish person fits me more than the vain one, but you would
have to ask my friends about that.<P>

<TITLE> Fop's Science Fiction Bookshelf</TITLE>

<H1>Welcome to Fop's Science Fiction Bookshelf!</H1>

The following is a brief list of some of the better science fiction
books I have read over the years.  Just a few notes about my personal
taste in science fiction.  I admit to going for the more characters
than for speculative technology.  Although I often spend time figuring
out why something does not make sense technology wise, I try not to
let it concern me to much.  A good story is more important (for me)
than perfect technological detail.  I enjoy stories with strong female
leads.  My personal opinion is that popular TV and movies don't do very
interesting women.  You end up with male parts with a woman character
written in. I have seen some science fiction that does a much better
job.  I also happen to like well fit together worlds.  Science fiction
writers seem to do a much better job than I ever could at constructing
a place that feels real.<P>

Feel free to contact me via E-Mail with questions, comments, or
assertions.<P>

Oh, by the way, this list has no particular order.  I just glanced
around my collection looking for interesting books and series.<P>

<H2>Orson Scott Card</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Ender Series
	<UL>
	<LI><CITE>Ender's Game</CITE>
	<LI><CITE>Speaker for the Dead</CITE>
	<LI><CITE>Xenocide</CITE>
	</UL>
<LI>Tales of Alvin Maker
</UL>
Writes best about children growing up.  Has a unique perspective on
talented kids.<P>

<H2>CJ Cherryh</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Chanur series
<LI>Cyteen series
</UL>
Cyteen is a great series.  Has a dark edge to it though.  Its hard to
find a likable character in the bunch.  The Chanur series has a good
feel to it as well, less dark but good story telling.<P>

<H2>John Dalmas</H2>
<UL>
<LI><CITE>The Regiment</CITE>
<LI><CITE>The White Regiment</CITE>
<LI><CITE>The Regiment's War</CITE>
</UL>
The philosophy proposed here is interesting.  I'm not sure I agree with
it, but it makes for interesting reading.<P>

<H2>Robert Asprin</H2>
<UL>
<LI><CITE>Phule's Company</CITE>
<LI><CITE>Phule's Paradise</CITE>
</UL>
A comedy of non error.  Willard Phule is the very rich non-fool that
leads a band of misfit warriors to be more than anyone thought.<P>

<H2>L. E. Modesitt Jr.</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The Forever Hero Trilogy
<LI>The Ecolitan Matter Trilogy
<LI>The Recluce Books
<UL>
<LI><CITE>The Magic of Reculce</CITE>
<LI><CITE>The Towers of the Sunset</CITE>
</UL>
</UL>
His Forever Hero and Ecolitan Trilogies combine Ecology with good
action stories.  An odd mix, but he does it well.<P>

<H2>PC Hodgell</H2>
<UL>
<LI><CITE>God Stalk</CITE>
<LI><CITE>Dark of the Moon</CITE>
</UL>
A good fantasy about a woman who is not sure who she is.  Their is
a lot of tension of her dealing with the darkness within.<P>

<H2>Steve Perry</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The Matador series
</UL>

If you like a bit of politics, fast moving action, and tales of speed
and skill, this series is for you.  A bit of martial arts philosophy and
futuristic weapons.<P>

<H2>David Webber</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The Honor Harrington Series
	<UL>
	<LI><CITE>The Honor of the Queen</CITE>
	<LI><CITE>On Basilisk Station</CITE>
	<LI><CITE>The Short Victorious War</CITE>
	</UL>
</UL>

<H2>Mel Gilden</H2>
<UL>
<LI><CITE>Surfing Samurai Robots</CITE>
</UL>
A strange but likeable tale of Zoot Marlowe, an alien with a big nose
who wants to be a detective.  The world of Malibu is not quite ready
for a short alien in a fedora and overcate.  Warning this is a strange
bit of humor that very few people seem to like.<P>

<H2>Steven Goldin and Mary Mason</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The Rehumanization of Jade Darcy Series
</UL>
A human woman bouncer at an alien bar doesn't raise too many eyebrows
out in the outer reaches of space.  Especially since there are no other
human eyebrows to raise.  Good action told with a sense of humor.<P>

<H2>Lois McMaster Bujold</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The Adventures of Miles Vorkosigan
</UL>
Ms. Bujold has a great sense of how to create an odd man out character
and really run with it.  Miles is fun reading.<P>

<H2>Steve Miller and Sharon Lee</H2>
<UL>
<LI><CITE>Conflict of Honors</CITE>
<LI><CITE>Agent of Change</CITE>

<H2>Neal Stephenson</H2>
<UL>
<LI><CITE>Snow Crash</CITE>
</UL>
A good description of cyberspace, written before it was a popular
term.  Tells the story of the greatest sword fighter in cyberspace.
It does not hurt his chances that he wrote the dueling routines.<P>

<H2>Ursula K. LeGuin</H2>
<UL>
<LI><CITE>Left Hand of Darkness</CITE>
</UL>
Famous for its treatment of gender roles.<P>

The music of SWEATLODGE, reverberating through the canyonlands and
from the mountain tops of Colorado, live to the globe.<P>

An All-Star tribe of soulful players with international friends
performing to an enthusiastic gathering of their fans at CYBERFEST,
summer 1995, in Boulder, Colorado.<P>

SWEATLODGE takes the stage in the finale to a day of outdoor
music.  They are the last act to mount the stage, as clouds rumble
from the foothills from a storm rolling in.<P>

<H3>Lyrics by our mentor and guide, Blind Garlic</H3>

<H3>Live at CYBERFEST 95</H3>

"We were nothing but some old jazz friends til the monastic
camping sojourn in the canyonlands last spring.  That's where we came
upon an ascetic wanderer, young yet old, with desert skin and piercing
eyes.  He danced instead of speaking, and transmitted silence like a
symphony.  We knew this had portent, but no idea how to handle the
freedom contained in his companionship.  He whirled in a Kachina Dance
from Blade Runner, his worn leather belt was studded, "Blind
Garlic".<P>

Sometimes it just seems like destiny, sometimes jazz musicians
without their instruments.<P>

We fell into his council unanimously, without a word of
discussion, without retaining any memory of schedules or
commitments back home.  On the second day, he handed us a reed
basket of lyrics on bits of paper, wisdom like dried leaves.<P>

All the players felt the same unspeakable jazz symphonia in his
silent gaze, but each of three mornings, there was the warm hearth of
his power, as we sat patiently in darshan in the clearing below his
kiva.<P>

On day four, he stepped from the kiva weeping, and embraced us
with kisses of ecstatic love and tears of death, groaning and sighing
in an ancient behavior.<P>

As he flapped his arms as wings, we knew that separation and
departure was for us, not for him.  On a side glance, he mashed a scrap
of magazine in my paw, placed this wrinkled picture of a satellite
dish in my grasp, and grinned like a toothless hockey player.<P>

It is from this cryptic kiss on the cheek that "Live at Cyberfest"
began a genesis of songs and brotherhood, driven by the quiet
stratocumulus soul of Blind Garlic.  His lyrics became our mission.<P>

Ask about the name?  Blind Garlic...from whence.  Ask if you will.
Soon, however, it need not make sense.<P>

<TITLE>Nadina's Italy Page</TITLE>

<IMG WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=290 SRC="italy.gif"> <P>


It's the rich culture and the love of the mother.  The adoration of decoration, art, and architecture and the melanzana, aglio, and basil in the kitchen which makes Italy so intriguing to me.<P>

I am very fortunate to have traveled in the summer of 1994 to Firenze, Venezia, Roma, and Capri to study Baroque and Renaissance design.  I was delighted to find a new land full of beauty.  I can't wait to go back!<P>

Check out some cool Italian web sites like <A HREF="http://www.eat.com/">Ragu</A> and <A HREF="http://www.rain.org/~sturken/">P&C Sturken</A>.<P>

<H1>A Readers Guide to Adams</H1>

</OL>

  Call him shy. Call him retiring.  Call him shy and retiring.  Call him whatever you want...you will anyway.  Lord knows we've tried to figure him out.
  More reclusive than that Pynchon guy or even Thms. MacPherson (who no one has heard of either), the details about his life are sketchy at best and painterly at worst.
  He is shown here in a rare photograph taken when he was twelve and shortly before receiving his 4-F on the grounds of his incredibly poor vision, spellin and taste in bolo ties.  He is the only person known to be rejected (wisely) on those grounds.
His melon sharp wit and tolerance of the color turquoise have made him the solace of many stormy night in Little America WY, where he has been three times.
Beyond that, little else is known or necessary to relate here.  <P>

The "Story Gleaner" is a not for profit organization designed to provide highly costumed dance and storytelling performances that evoke creative responses and expression from the audience. This is made possible immediately following performances at workshops where all supplies are provided. The targeted audiences are children of all ages and their adult families and caregivers.<P>
<img align=left src="image/child1.gif">
This project began as a vehicle of artistic collaboration for a group of four professional artists: Vicki Anderson, sculptor/ costume designer/ dollmaker, Pat Selby and Marilyn Herrs, choreographers, and Susan Marie Frontczak, storyteller. We call the collaboration "art responding to art".<P>

Each year in November our new performances have been debuted at the Boulder Public Library with a book art workshop immediately following for the audience of 250. Admission is free to all. In 1996 we plan to add a signer to the performance in honor of "Pip" and friends. Our 1995 show and the new 1996 show will both be performed and aired on Channel 8, the City of Boulder Channel.<P>

After free public debuts, shows go on tour to schools, libraries and art centers for approximately $500 per show. Workshop events are custom designed and prices are negotiated.<P>

And who knows if Pip will even be the character's real name. You see, there will be a series of designs made by Vicki Anderson and small groups of children will be invited to play with the toy. They will actually choose and name our little friend. Afterwards, you will see "Pip's" animated form on the CDRom presenting "Where do we go from Hear?" news and information.<P>
By the way, "Pip" will also become a doll that can come to your house to live.<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

Vicki Anderson graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Fine Arts from the University of New Mexico in 1965. She was born in Texas, raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico and has since lived in the Midwest. on the East Coast, and the West Coast. Colorado has been her home since 1972.<P>

Art, and especially fine crafts have been her passion for as long as she can remember. Her hands have not been idle since she began making small toys with scraps from under her Grandmother's quilting frame. Now she is well known for her many animal costumes that perform with the Colorado Music Festival Orchestra's Young People's Performance each Summer.<P>

In 1993, Vicki originated, costumed and staged "The Story Gleaner", an ongoing series of dance and story telling performances that encourage creativity in children and their families. She is presently designing a doll named "Pip" that will wear hearing aids and be used to delight and assist hearing impaired children.<P>

<img align=right src="image/child2.gif">
Vicki's storybook characters have won six national window design contests. Her latest prize was a trip to see the birthing of harp seals in the Magdalen Islands.<P>

Vicki Anderson has loved costumes since she was a little girl. Her mother and grandmother were expert seamstresses. She had only to imagine a costume and they would whip it up. Her grandmother called her "chipmunk" because she spent hours cutting up their sewing scraps to make small toys.<P>

Vicki learned to sew by watching them and also by helping a man named "Golly" who worked in her parents' furniture factory. He was an expert at upholstering couches and chairs. This was the beginning of her education in building the cloth shapes that would later become animal masks.<P>
<img align=left src="image/cube1.gif" >
When her own children were growing up, Vicki, in turn, made costumes for them. They all enjoyed watching The Muppets on Sesame Street. One day Vicki saw a "TV Special" explaining how Muppet heads were put together. She uses many of those same techniques today.<P>

<img align=left src="image/camel.gif" ></TD><TD>
Her children grew up and moved away. There was no one at home to wear the wonderful costumes she had learned to make. Meanwhile she'd been doing many other things. Always an artist, she made clay figures, dolls, and primitive musical instruments. She also managed an art gallery and worked as a window designer. ln 1991 she made a lion-conductor costume for the window at the Printed Page announcing a new picture book called Meet the Orchestra. Her cloth lion looked just like the conductor in the book. He later came out of the window to appear on stage at the 1991 CMF Young People's Concert-and was the hit of the show! Since that day she has made nine costume characters for these concerts and sixteen others that delight audiences wherever they appear. "My art is geared to the child and to the child in every adult.", she says. "Childhood is such a rich time, when the imagination is really alive. I want to stay in touch with that and help others to do the same."<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

"When Jennifer was diagnosed at 2 1/2 years with a moderate hearing loss in the 50-55db range, I was a mess of feelings. I was wickedly victorious, as if I won an Olympic medal because I had searched for so long for a diagnosis and finally I had the confirmation on what I suspected all along. On the flip side, I was also crushed. My beautiful baby girl was not perfect. I was also riddled by guilt, thinking of how I must have caused this by something I did or didn't do. Thinking back, I think my FIRST reaction was a nonreaction. I remember being still, not moving and waiting to take a breath. I didn't take my breath until we got home.  Then all those feelings and reactions caved in. Interestingly, I remember trying to be logical and in control at the audiologists office. Maybe that is why I didn't react in the office, either. I did feel mad - at the stupid doctors who 100% missed the most obvious diagnosis in the world and who told me to stop worrying about Jennifer's speech delays, etc. and just love her. I was scared about what this all meant, and if Jennifer would ever be 'normal.' I flashed back in my mind to all children in my youth who were different and went to school in a segregated part of the building and never came out. It was a very scary and isolating time for me. The number one thing that helped me was talking about it. I needed desperately to talk, talk talk, to sort out the confusion of feelings I was having. And so I did. I talked to the neighbors, the postman, the garbageman, all my friends and family, everyone I met on the street and even the telephone salespeople. I also read EVERYTHING I could get my hands on."<br clear=all>

"Jennifer began preschool in our local school at age 3, Elise and Ty also began at age 3, taking advantage of a "headstart" program for children with disabilities or environmental delays. Jennifer is enrolled in 2nd grade, Elise in kindergarten, in mainstream public classes. Because our children are moderate in their hearing loss, they are classified in the elusive group of "hard of hearing". Thus, they talk clearly and often teachers, etc. forget they are hearing impaired. After a bumpy beginning in a mainstream school district, we are insisting a hearing impaired teacher (specialist) be involved in our children's future educations. We have learned the hard way that even though you are told your children are "only" hard of hearing doesn't mean they will automatically excel in mainstream school. Just as putting on hearing aids doesn't cure the original problem, mainstream school without support does not work.  I found a great deal of excellent, practical advice on educating the hard of hearing in the booklet, <U><B>Our Forgotten Children: Hard of Hearing Pupils in the School</B></U> by Julia Davis. It is available from Self Help for Hard of Hearing People, 7800 Wisconsin Ave., Bethesda, MD 20814."<P>

"Rob spends as much time as you would expect from a father who works full time. He doesn't attend school meetings regularly and is not involved in the daily grinds of speech, occupational therapy and physical therapy. Sometimes it drives me bananas, like somehow he got off much easier than I did, but then I face reality and accept that his work requires 50+ a week. And I believe he is the norm, not the exception. Since being homeless has never been my dream, and I was forced to stop my job after the kids needs were diagnosed, I don't have much choice right now but to carry the lions share of the kids therapies and school work.  The good side is that Rob plays with the kids when he gets home and we regularly go out on dates for the evening so I can get rejuvenated. He's not the perfect father, and I am most definitely NOT the perfect mother."<P>

"When I got Jennifer's diagnosis, I begged the audiologist for books or articles or organizations to call for more information. He had nothing and said there wouldn't be much at the library. It was incredibly discouraging to me. Slowly, (very slowly) I found other parents like me and asked them for book titles, etc. Most families were like me and hadn't found much on their own, either.  It wasn't until a couple of years into Jennifer and Elise's diagnosis's did I find a fabulous woman who developed a mind boggling amount of information on organizations world wide for the deaf/hard of hearing. That is when things really took off for me, because once you find out about one place, it is easy to get addresses and names for others.<P>
	Our family doctor knew less about hearing loss than I did. I have since discovered that medical school spends all of one day on hearing loss. No wonder doctors don't even know when to refer for a hearing test. Luckily, our doctor now is willing to admit she knows nothing and allows me to teach her."<P>

"The big difference with Ty is that we (Rob and I) were determined not to delay his hearing tests. I decided to have my baby in the only local hospital testing all newborns, and then found a doctor who delivered there. Getting Ty tested and fitted with hearing aids at 8 weeks was actually an exciting and healing time for Rob and I because we had the once in a lifetime chance to do something different and reverse the 'If I had known then what I know now syndrome' that came with struggling to identify what was wrong with our girls. Getting the opportunity to do it right was a real blessing for our family.<P>

Elise didn't make any progress her first year after identification in speech and we were weeks away from starting a sign language class when it came together for her and she hasn't shut up since. She is the motor mouth of our family. But her final ability to speak came from properly treating an unrelated health issue and improving her overall health, not from any magic time period of waiting. I felt so frustrated and sad about not being able to communicate with my girls that my desire to know how they felt and what they thought overrode my fear of them not being able to speak in a hearing world. I did not want to be strangers to my children. But I fully respect whatever communication mode a family chooses and support the data that shows it doesn't matter if a family signs, speaks or hangs from their toenails, if they are committed to it, their child will be successful."<BR clear=all>

"All of my children wear hearing aids. They are worn from the moment I stumble out of bed and begin to get them dressed until bedtime. I have learned that the older the child is before identification and wearing aids, the harder and more difficult it is to get them to wear them. It took a full year before Jennifer would wear her aids without a fight. It took Elise 6 months to get comfortable. Ty grew up with his aids. He had them before he even knew he had hands. Over the years we have had hearing aids be dunked in Kool-aid, washed in the toilet, left in pockets and gone through the washing machine, spaded into the garden, buried in the sandbox, dropped behind furniture, left for animals to chew on, batteries be swallowed and every other kind of destructive thing you can imagine. We definitely can attest to the importance of hearing aid insurance and the value of putting hearing aids on sunglass strings to keep them together."<P>

Press Release from the University of Colorado<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>
Oct. 2, 1996<P>

$1.3 MILLION HEARING SCREENING GRANT<BR>
TO AID INFANTS IN COLORADO, 16 OTHER STATE<BR>
        The U.S. Public Health Service has awarded a four-year, $1.3
million grant to the University of Colorado at Boulder to coordinate the
implementation of universal newborn hearing screening programs in Colorado
and 16 other states.<P>
        The project, which also involves the CU Health Sciences Center in
Denver, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and area
hospitals, is designed to screen at least 85 percent of newborns for
hearing problems annually in the 17 states, ensuring early intervention and
treatment.<P>
        The effort was funded to build momentum for universal newborn
hearing screening programs in all 50 states, said Christine
Yoshinaga-Itano, director of CU-Boulder's communication disorders and
speech science department who is heading up the project with CU-Boulder
assistant professor Kathryn Arehart.<P>
        Yoshinaga-Itano and Arehart will investigate and report on the
efficiency of universal newborn hearing screening and its impact on child
development.<P>
        CU-Boulder will manage the $1.3 million grant from the federal
agency's Division of Maternal Child Health and investigate the impacts of
hearing screening on childhood development.<P>
        Boulder Community Hospital Audiologist Vickie Thomson and Arlene
Stredler Brown, who heads up the statewide intervention program for deaf
and hard-of-hearing children for the state health department, will
coordinate with other states on research methods, allocation of resources
and individual state goals regarding the program.  Thomson currently
oversees Colorado's universal newborn hearing screening program in
Colorado.<P>
        "Colorado is a national leader in universal newborn hearing
screening," said Yoshinaga-Itano.  "We are pleased to have been selected to
administer this program."   In the past year, Colorado has provided
technical assistance to 28 states for infant hearing screening, diagnosis
of hearing loss and amplification methods, including the fitting of hearing
aids, she said.<P>
        The current state program now screens nearly 60 percent of the
54,000 annual births and places 75 percent of all hearing-impaired children
in intervention programs by six months of age, she said.<P>
        Two primary screening methods are used to check newborn hearing,
said Thomson.  In the automated brain-stem response method, electrodes are
placed on an infant's head to measure brain-wave responses to clicks
administered to the ear.  The second method, known as otoacoustic
emissions, measures inner-ear responses to sound.<P>
        "One goal is to help communities decide which methods work best for
them," said Thomson, who will work with program coordinators from
participating states to select appropriate screening technologies for each.<P>

        A 1993 report from the National Institutes of Health concluded that
a lack of early identification of hearing-impaired infants is a significant
public health problem and delays necessary clinical intervention.  About
four in every thousand babies nationwide have been shown to have
significant hearing problems.  In Colorado, the number is roughly three in
one thousand, said Thomson.<P>
        A 1995 CU-Boulder study showed children identified with such
problems at birth can function on a level equal to that of their hearing
peers in early childhood, regardless of their economic status or degree of
hearing loss.<P>
        Studies also have shown that early intervention and treatment of
infant hearing problems leads to a higher probability of gainful employment
later in life.  "It has been demonstrated that early intervention and
treatment lead to long-term cost savings to society," said Sandra Gabbard,
director of audiology at University Hospital who is heading up the
diagnosis and amplification portion of the project.<P>
        Gabbard will oversee state audits on protocols used in hearing-loss
diagnosis, hearing-aid fitting and data-management systems.  She also will
act as team leader to help identify potential barriers to intervention and
treatment.<P>
        The cost of screening in Colorado averages about $25 and the
testing portion of the screening procedure takes less than five minutes.
Currently, 27 Colorado hospitals voluntarily participate in universal
newborn hearing screening.<P>
        The new program will include the establishment of the Marion Downs
National Center for Universal Newborn Hearing Screening at CU's Health
Sciences Center.  Marion Downs was a pioneer audiologist in infant hearing
research and education during the 1960s at University Hospital.<P>
        The new grant also will allow the Colorado team to bring existing
national task forces together to select common evaluation, intervention and
data-collection strategies for the project.  HSC pediatrics Professor
Deborah Hayes, who will oversee the task-force activity, said a pilot
proposal based on Colorado's existing screening program will serve as a
starting point for many of the states.<P>
        The Colorado team also will mobilize a national advisory group
composed of representatives of all participating states, said Hayes,
director of speech pathology and audiology at Denver's Children's Hospital.
The group will include representatives of hospitals, state programs and
provider networks.<P>
        "Colorado's pioneering program was developed without the assistance
of any major grants, relying instead on community support," said
Yoshinaga-Itano.  "This new model will be of great value to other states
that have no major funding."<P>
        Dissemination of information on screening programs and educational
training to participants from the 17 states will take place at three
national meetings in 1997 to be held in Washington, Florida and Colorado.<P>
        Manufacturers and distributors of screening equipment and
amplification devices also have agreed to participate in the national
meetings.<P>
        Universal hearing screening is defined as the level at which at
least 85 percent of newborns in the 17 states are screened, a goal the
Colorado administrators hope to meet by the year 2000.<P>
        Colorado has had a follow-up system for infants with significant
hearing loss since the early 1970s.  The system, which connects local
school districts with the state health department, involves a large number
of trained facilitators from the school system and from audiologists in
private practice.<P>
        Other states participating in the hearing project include Alabama,
Arizona, Arkansas, Hawaii, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Minnesota, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia
and Wyoming.<P>

<H3>Excerpts from BEGINNINGS    For Parent of Deaf and Hard of 
Hearing Children: A Parent Manual     (copyright 1993)<P>
<P>
Reprinted with permission by the author, J. Craig Greene, Ed.D. and
A BEGINNINGS For Parents of Hearing Impaired Children, Inc.<P>
<P>
<B>From the Preface</B><P>

BEGINNINGS for Parents of Hearing Impaired Children is a program, established
through the efforts of Dr. J. Craig Greene while serving as the Parent
Representative to the North Carolina Council for the Hearing Impaired from
1981-1984. BEGINNINGS' purpose has always been to improve early identification
efforts and then to provide immediate and ongoing support to parents of
newly identified hearing-impaired children. This support comes in the form
of providing emotional support, information and access to services needed
by those parents. In addition, BEGINNINGS now assists parents of children
of any age and the professionals who serve them.<P>

Dr. Greene has written and revised this manual for parents after nineteen
years of struggling to find solutions to the problems that go along with
having a child with a hearing loss. So many times the solutions to those
problems were available, but inaccessible because of the complexity of the
various professions which serve deaf/hard of hearing children and their
families, and the lack of communication between professionals. There was
no other single source, like this manual and the BEGINNINGS program, to
assist him in his search for information and assistance.<P>

<B>From the Introduction & Chapter One</B><P>
<B>Accepting Your Deaf or Hard of Hearing Child</B><P>

The shock of learning that your child is deaf or hard of hearing is
similar to finding out that someone you love has died. Dealing with
the grief, anger, and pain of such a discovery is difficult. However,
it must be done properly before you are ready to help your child. 
Failure to "grieve successully" can keep you from taking actions 
and making decisions that need to be made for your child.<P>

<B>The Stages and Faces of Grief</B><P>

This chapter explains the normal process of grieving and offers
suggestions on how to help you and those you love to go through
the process.<P>

<B><I>Stage/Face/Symptom</I></B><P>
<UL><B>
Shock
	Numbness
	Distraction
	Forgetfulness
	Lack of Emotion
<BR>
Denial
	Disbelief
	Statements of Denial
	Refusal to discuss problem

	Unrealistic goal setting
	Inability to enjoy life
<BR>

	You stop assigning blame
	You have "worked through" the stages of grief
	You begin working with the professionals
	You begin to "manage" your childs habilitation
	You have a sense of HOPE
<BR>
Constructive Action
	You are now providing a future for your child
</UL>
</B><BR>
<P>
<B>Hearing Impairment and Family Relationships</B><P>

The fact of having a child with a hearing deficit in the home places
stress on family relationships. This stress must be managed for all
members of the family. It is best managed when all members of the
immediate and extended family are aware and involved.<P>

<B>Summary</B><P>

Having a child with a hearing deficit does not need to be a tragedy. 
You and your child can live a happy and successful life if you can 
accept, educate yourself, and act constructively.<P>

<A HREF = "http://www.gwha.com">GW Hannaway & Associates</A> is very excited about producing a multimedia project for parents dealing with the important subject of early detection in children with mild to profound hearing loss.  We are a pioneering firm in image processing and video production.  As a digital imaging service, we are recognized as one of the premiere laboratories in the country.  Our clients include NASA, The National Geographic Society and Martin Marietta.  GWH&A works with producers, editors, 3-D animators, videographers and multi-media specialists.<P>

<A HREF = "http://www.gwha.com">GWH&A</A> has found, through intense research, that there is a need for an easily accessible, comprehensive guide addressing all issues related to the deaf and hard of hearing community.  Through some organizations and government agencies, parents are given information packets.  Most of them are not properly organized, repetitive, and neglect issues involving newborns.<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
Here's our plan to produce a multi phase project educating and serving parents 
of newly diagnosed children.<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>
Phase 1<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
A 30 minute video that is targeted to parents when they are first told
their child has a hearing loss.  Issues that will be addressed include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Emotional anxiety such as grief, anger, confusion, fright, etc.
<LI>Explanations of what hearing loss is and the varying degrees
<LI>Types of testing and how the loss was detected
<LI>What kinds of hearing aids are available
<LI>How to deal with and stimulate your baby
<LI>The social interaction of children with a hearing loss
<li>Types of educational facilities/therapy available for all ages
<LI>Details of what an audiogram is
<LI>How to read the audiogram
<LI>How hearing aids work and how to maintain maximum efficiency
<LI>Resources that are available to the deaf community nation wide
<li>Alternatives to hearing aids (i.e. cochlear implants, assistive hearing devices)
</UL><P>
<FONT SIZE=4>
Phase 2<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
A 30 minute video cassette that would go deeper into the subjects covered
in phase 1.  It will include:
<LI>Details of what an audiogram is
<LI>How to read the audiogram
<LI>How hearing aids work and how to maintain maximum efficiency
<LI>Resources that are available to the deaf community nation wide
<li>Alternatives to hearing aids (i.e. cochlear implants, assistive hearing devices)
</UL><P>
<FONT SIZE=4>
Phase 3<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
An interactive CD-ROM, including all information known about the deaf and
hard of hearing community.  This CD-ROM will be fully inclusive.  Some of
the highlights will include:
<UL>
<LI>A computer-animated fly through the ear (how is it structured and how does it work?)
<LI>What the world sounds and feels like with a hearing loss
<LI>A real life scenario, modeling a hearing loss
<LI>How ear molds are made and how hearing aids work
<li>A complete database of public and private organizations that specialize in hearing loss.  This database will include organizations, schools, associations, on-line material, and government resources nation wide and in Canada.  To our knowledge there is currently no such database.
</UL><P>


Our overall goal is to provide a resource for families, to comfort, assist
and enlighten at a time when there is no where else to turn.  Where do we
go from Hear?  Our three phase multi-media project will give these families
an invaluable resource.<P>

<B>Why are we doing this?</B> <P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
My son, at 8 days of age, was tested on an ABR and diagnosed with a severe loss.  No information was given to us except a business card and we were told to have another test in six weeks.  The multimedia project will provide general information about hearing impairments, terminology, how tests are administered, what to expect, and where to turn for help.<P>

There is no other completed resource available that covers the generic information after a diagnosis of a hearing impaired child for the parents.  Most hospitals do not give the parents anything, others give brouchures at the time of diagnosis.  Most want you to contact your audiologist and get into an learning program right away or get a case manager, home intervention worker soon. </TD><TD ALIGN=MIDDLE ><img align=right src="image/miles.gif"></TD></TR></TABLE>
<TABLE><TR><TD><center>

The parents are left hanging out there with no immediate simple information to let them know
what their child just went through, what does this mean to me.  Is there any one else?  What now?
During this time of grief and frustration, no one wants to read through many brochures. If your
child is diagnosed at birth, you don't really care about which school to send them. A lot of
information is currently on children diagnosed from age 2 up and what to do.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
Early diagnosis is a new methodology.  It is being used in Rhode Island, Colorado, Arizona to other than high risk babies.  Otherwise the only newborns tested are the high risk ones.  The average seems to be about 1 in 250 babies tested have a hearing impairment (mild to profound).

a much needed resource. However, video and CD-ROM production are very
expensive processes, as is maintaining this web site. None of this is
possible without your help. If you would like to donate money or know of

The <b>Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML)</b> is a

<DD>Here is a terrain example using texturing.  The texture is a hybrid of
<DD>satellite imagery and an elevation map.  The satellite imagery is used
<DD>for the land portion, and the elevation map is used for the portion
<DD>of the terrain that is underwater.  The map is of the Monterey Bay 
<DD>in California. The image above gets you to a 40,000 polygon version.
<A HREF="http://www.gwha.com/~jym/DEM/mb1.wrl">Another version</A> has the geometry at a much lower resolution.  Only
<DD>1800 polygons.  Notice how we do not lose much quality because we
<DD> are using the same texture.

<H2>Lightning</H2>
<P><p>
Check out the lightning.  Here in Colorado, we bide our time waiting for
the next ski season by staring at lightning during the summer.  I've become
so intrigued by it, i couldn't wait to share it with others.  I put
my camera on the deck with the shutter open long enough to get some
good lightning on the film.

GWH&A has found, through intense research, that there is a need for an easily accessible, comprehensive guide addressing all issues related to the deaf and hard of hearing community.  Through some organizations and government agencies, parents are given information packets.  Most of them are not properly organized, repetitive, and neglect issues involving newborns.<P>

The solution:  An interactive CD-ROM, including all information known about the deaf and hard of hearing community.  This CD-ROM will be fully inclusive.  Some of the highlights will include:<P>
        
<UL>
<LI>        a computer animated fly through the ear (how is it structured and how does it work?)
<LI>        what the world sounds and feels like with a hearing loss
<LI>        a real life scenario, modeling a hearing loss
<LI>        how ear molds are made and how hearing aids work
<li>        a complete database of public and private organizations that specialize in hearing loss.  This database will include organizations, schools, associations, on-line material, and government resources nation wide and in Canada.  To our knowledge there is currently no such database.

3. Se presento la propuesta de la CAL sobre la politica general de
distribucion de espacios y cubiculos en el edificio en Ensenada. 
Se acordo lo siguiente:

a) Asignar cubiculos conforme a una distribucion zonal de las instalaciones. 
Se definieron cuatro zonas: administracion, area tecnica, astronomia y 
estudiantes y visitantes.

b) La CAL opino que los cubiculos grandes del nuevo edificio sean
ocupados por 2 personas. No hubo votacion, pero nadie opino en contra.

c) Que el espacio en el nuevo edificio que contiene 4 cubiculos en la 
planta baja que da al cerro sea habilitado como taller de electronica.

d) Que el espacio que actualmente ocupa electronica y computo se
distribuya en cubiculos para mecanicos de precision y administracion.

e) Que el futuro centro de super-computo se ubique en la bodega cerrada 
del nuevo edificio.

f) Tener mas de un centro de concentracion de servicios para computo, asi
como un almacen y area de mantenimiento para computo.

g) Respecto a la asignacion de cubiculos individuales dentro de las
zonas ya definidas, se presentaron 2 propuestas:

- Asignacion por sorteo. 2 votos
- Asignacion de acuerdo con los siguientes criterios (en orden de 
  importancia): nivel academico, antiguedad y numero de horas en que 
  se usa la oficina. 9 votos 
- Abstenciones. 3 votos

h) En su momento, la CAL presentara una convocatoria a todo el
personal academico para que solicite una oficina en la zona que 
le corresponde.

i) Todo el personal academico, incluyendo aquel que no desee cambiar
de oficina, debera responder a la convocatoria de la CAL.  

4. Se expreso preocupacion sobre la seguridad del nuevo edificio
habitacional en SPM, solicitandose la intervencion de un perito. Se
informo que este peritaje lo solicito el JOAN hace tres meses, y que 
esta en espera de una respuesta oficial.

PROPUESTA DE LINEAMIENTOS PARA LA ASIGNACION <BR>
Y USO DE TIEMPO DE TELESCOPIO DEL OAN 
</CENTER>

<P><STRONG> 1. Comisi&oacute;n de asignaci&oacute;n de tiempo de
telescopio</STRONG><BR>

<OL>
<LI>Atribuciones:

 <OL> 
  <LI> Asignar el tiempo de telescopio en el OAN (Tonantzintla y San
       Pedro M&aacute;rtir, SPM).
 
  <LI> Conocer el estado de telescopios y equipo en el OAN.

  <LI> Asesorar al Consejo Interno (CI), y a los jefes del OAN (JOAN) y
       de Astrof&iacute;sica Observacional (JAO),
       Instrumentaci&oacute;n y C&oacute;mputo sobre asuntos de su
       competencia.

  <LI> Conocer las condiciones de los diferentes convenios
       internacionales que involucren el otorgamiento de tiempo de telescopio
       en el OAN y asesorar al CI sobre los mismos.
 </OL>

 <LI>Composici&oacute;n: <BR>
  La CATT estar&aacute; integrada por 5 miembros los cuales
  ser&aacute;n elegidos o nombrados de la siguiente manera:<BR>
  <UL>
  <LI> 2 miembros por el Colegio del Personal Acad&eacute;mico
  <LI> 1 miembro por el CI
  <LI> 2 miembros por la direcci&oacute;n.
  </UL>
  El periodo de los miembros es de 2 a&ntilde;os. El secretario de la CATT
  <EM> ex oficio</EM> es el JAO quien es nombrado por la direcci&oacute;n. En
  caso de que no exista JAO, el secretario de la CATT (SC) se eligir&aacute;
  de entre los miembros .
</OL> 

<P><STRONG> 2. Criterios  y Frecuencia de Asignaci&oacute;n:</STRONG><BR>

<P> El tiempo de telescopio en el OAN (Tonantzintla y San Pedro
M&aacute;rtir, SPM) ser&aacute; asignado en reuniones semestrales por
la CATT, previo an&aacute;lisis de las solicitudes respectivas.  La
CATT basar&aacute; sus decisiones en la calidad cient&iacute;fica de
las propuestas, su factibilidad tanto cient&iacute;fica como
t&eacute;cnica, as&iacute; como en el an&aacute;lisis del uso del
tiempo asignado a el/los solicitantes en a&ntilde;os anteriores.

<P><STRONG> 3. Responsable del Proyecto:</STRONG><BR>

<P>El Responsable del Proyecto (RP) es el observador responsable del
uso del tiempo asignado y de los instrumentos involucrados.  Las
normas para poder ser RP en una propuesta para el OAN ser&aacute;n
establecidas por el Consejo Interno. En la actualidad, la CATT ha
considerado como posibles RPs, en el caso de proyectos astron&oacute;micos,
a:
<OL>
 <LI> Todos los investigadores en Astronom&iacute;a laborando con este
      nombramiento en instituciones nacionales.

 <LI> Los estudiantes de doctorado del posgrado en Astronom&iacute;a de la
      UNAM, cuando el proyecto sea parte de su tesis doctoral.

 <LI> Los t&eacute;cnicos acad&eacute;micos aprobados previamente para tal fin
      por el CI.

 <LI> Los investigadores de las instituciones con las que el IA-UNAM
      tiene convenios que involucren tiempo de telescopio del OAN.

 <LI> Los estudiantes del posgrado en Astronom&iacute;a de la UNAM, en el
      caso de los telescopios de 1.5 y 0.84 m.
</OL>

<P>Para que un estudiante de doctorado en Astronom&iacute;a de otra
instituci&oacute;n nacional pueda ser RP, es necesario que su
solicitud vaya acompa&ntilde;ada por una carta del director de la
instituci&oacute;n indicando que ese proyecto es parte de su tesis
doctoral y el tiempo global de observaci&oacute;n que requerir&aacute;
y que el estudiante est&aacute; calificado para realizar las
observaciones.

<P>Los RPs deber&aacute;n estar entrenados en el uso del telescopio y
equipo perif&eacute;rico requerido en su propuesta. Si esto no fuera
as&iacute;, deber&aacute;n indicar en su solicitud c&oacute;mo
realizar&aacute;n este entrenamiento o si estar&aacute;n
acompa&ntilde;ados por un participante en el proyecto debidamente
calificado.

<P><STRONG> 4. Solicitudes:</STRONG><BR>

<P>Cada solicitud de tiempo de telescopio deber&aacute; tener <STRONG>
un</STRONG> RP.  Se espera que el RP est&eacute; presente durante las
observaciones salvo en casos excepcionales en los que podr&aacute; ser
reemplazado por un <STRONG> responsable sustituto</STRONG>. El
responsable sustituto deber&aacute; figurar como participante en la
solicitud original y deber&aacute; estar igualmente calificado para
realizar las observaciones que el RP.  Para cualquier fin, se
considerar&aacute; la afiliaci&oacute;n del RP como la sede del
proyecto observacional. Asimismo, el RP es el responsable de
comunicarle a sus colaboradores todo lo referente a la temporada, ya
que el SC y/o el JOAN s&oacute;lo mantendr&aacute;n
comunicaci&oacute;n con el RP de cada proyecto.  Las fechas
l&iacute;mite para entregar al SC, o a las secretarias de la directora
y del Jefe del OAN (JOAN) las solicitudes de tiempo de telescopio para
el primer o segundo semestres del a&ntilde;o son el 15 de octubre y el
15 de abril, respectivamente. Cualquier solicitud recibida
despu&eacute;s de estas fechas se le considerar&aacute;
extempor&aacute;nea (ver punto 8). La CATT se reunir&aacute; pocos
d&iacute;as despu&eacute;s de las fechas l&iacute;mite de
recepci&oacute;n de solicitudes y examinar&aacute; s&oacute;lo las
recibidas antes de la fecha l&iacute;mite correspondiente.

<P>La &uacute;nica informaci&oacute;n de que disponen los miembros de
la CATT es la proporcionada en las solicitudes, as&iacute; que
&eacute;stas deben ser autocontenidas y concretas. Los l&iacute;mites
se&ntilde;alados para cada una de las secciones de la solicitud son
absolutos, esto es, s&oacute;lo se leer&aacute; la parte contenida
dentro de esos l&iacute;mites.

<P><STRONG> 5. Formas: </STRONG><BR>

<P> Se recomienda llenar los formatos oficiales de solicitud de tiempo
de telescopio y enviarlos por e-mail a la cuenta que se da en la
convocatoria respectiva, o bien, entregar la solicitud impresa a las
secretarias de la direcci&oacute;n o de la jefatura del OAN, antes de
la fecha l&iacute;mite.  Se recomienda comenzar a usar ya el correo
electr&oacute;nico para este fin. Una vez recibida la solicitud por
este medio, el SC acusar&aacute; recibo al IP por correo-e.  Todo el
personal acad&eacute;mico del IAUNAM que han solicitado tiempo en los
&uacute;ltimos dos a&ntilde;os, as&iacute; como quienes lo soliciten
al SC, recibir&aacute;n en su direcci&oacute;n electr&oacute;nica una
copia de las formas.

<P><STRONG> 6. Convocatorias:</STRONG><BR>

<P>Los formatos de las propuestas de tiempo de telescopio est&aacute;n
a la disposici&oacute;n de los usuarios en cualquier momento; basta
solicitarlos al JAO o extraerlos del mosaico del OAN.  Un mes antes de
la fecha l&iacute;mite para cada semestre, el SC emitir&aacute; la
convocatoria para el siguiente per&iacute;odo de asignaci&oacute;n de
tiempo de telescopio. Esta convocatoria informar&aacute; sobre la
instrumentaci&oacute;n en uso en cada uno de los telescopios.  Se
incluir&aacute; tambi&eacute;n un resumen de las normas y facilidades
que ofrece el OAN a sus observadores, tanto del IAUNAM como de otras
instituciones nacionales y extranjeras (i.e. d&iacute;as de subida y
bajada a/de SPM-Ensenada, cuotas por el uso de la ``casa de
hu&eacute;spedes'', viajes entre Ensenada, Tijuana y San Diego, etc.)
y otras noticias pertinentes.

<P><STRONG> 7. Comunicaci&oacute;n de las decisiones de la CATT:</STRONG><BR>

<P>Una vez elaborado el calendario de observaci&oacute;n de todos los
telescopios, se har&aacute; p&uacute;blico en las sedes del IAUNAM
junto con la relaci&oacute;n de los investigadores y los
t&iacute;tulos de cada proyecto al que se le asign&oacute; tiempo.
Simult&aacute;neamente a la publicaci&oacute;n del calendario de
observaci&oacute;n, el SC enviar&aacute; a cada solicitante (RP) las
decisiones de la CATT respecto a su solicitud y a las consideraciones
generales. El RP comunicar&aacute; a sus colaboradores tal
informaci&oacute;n.

<P><STRONG> 8. Solicitudes extempor&aacute;neas:</STRONG><BR>

<P>Las solicitudes extempor&aacute;neas son aquellas que incluyen
peticiones para usar algunos de los telescopios del OAN durante el
primero o segundo semestre de un a&ntilde;o y que fueron recibidas
despu&eacute;s del 15 de octubre o 15 de abril, respectivamente,
independientemente de la fecha de celebraci&oacute;n de la
reuni&oacute;n de la CATT o de la publicaci&oacute;n del calendario de
observaci&oacute;n. Estas solicitudes se har&aacute;n directamente al
SC, de preferencia por correo electr&oacute;nico y deber&aacute;n
contener la misma informaci&oacute;n que las solicitudes normales. En
primera instancia, el SC juzgar&aacute; e identificar&aacute; las
caracter&iacute;sticas de la propuesta en funci&oacute;n del tiempo
solicitado y el disponible (huecos) en el calendario. Salvo en casos
de urgencia extraordinaria, el SC consultar&aacute; por correo-e a los
miembros de la CATT y al JOAN y esperar&aacute; su respuesta por no
m&aacute;s de tres d&iacute;as h&aacute;biles, anunci&aacute;ndole al
solicitante (RP) la decisi&oacute;n en un plazo no mayor de una
semana.

<P><STRONG> 9. Cancelaciones de temporadas de observaci&oacute;n:</STRONG><BR>

<P>S&oacute;lo en casos excepcionales se considerar&aacute;n
cancelaciones a temporadas de observaci&oacute;n.  Si por alguna
raz&oacute;n excepcional se debe cancelar una temporada de
observaci&oacute;n, se deber&aacute; avisar al SC con la mayor
anticipaci&oacute;n posible explicando en detalle las causas. El SC
archivar&aacute; estas comunicaciones para anexarlas a futuras
propuestas del (los) solicitante(s) para su consideraci&oacute;n por
parte de la CATT. El SC anunciar&aacute; p&uacute;blicamente en
M&eacute;xico (tablero de avisos y correo-e) la disponibilidad del
tiempo cancelado con objeto de recibir solicitudes
extempor&aacute;neas para el uso del mismo.

<P><STRONG> 10. Cambios en el calendario de observaci&oacute;n:</STRONG><BR>

<P> En caso de que se solicite cambio de fechas a un periodo no
asignado, se considerar&aacute;, s&oacute;lo para fines de
programaci&oacute;n, como una cancelaci&oacute;n simult&aacute;nea a
una solicitud extempor&aacute;nea. Si se solicita una permuta de
per&iacute;odos de observaci&oacute;n, ambos (RPs) deber&aacute;n
solicitarlo al SC, quien verificar&aacute; que el cambio no implique
conflicto alguno entre los solicitantes y con la operaci&oacute;n del
OAN.

<P><STRONG> 11. Temporadas de ingenier&iacute;a:</STRONG><BR>

<P>Se consideran tres modalidades de temporadas de ``pruebas de
instrumentos al telescopio'': 
<OL>
 <LI> <EM> Mantenimiento preventivo</EM> a instrumentos y telescopios
      existentes de acuerdo a c&oacute;mo lo solicite el cuerpo
      t&eacute;cnico y el JOAN,
 <LI> <EM> ingenier&iacute;a</EM>, que se refiere a trabajo mayor de primera
      luz, evaluaci&oacute;n, reparaci&oacute;n o modificaci&oacute;n
      instrumental y
 <LI> <EM> pruebas en el telescopio</EM> que se refiere a pruebas en el
      telescopio de un instrumento que ser&aacute; de uso general en el OAN.
</OL>
Estos periodos nunca podr&aacute;n ser en tiempo oscuro y s&oacute;lo
excepcionalmente en gris. Su evaluaci&oacute;n se har&aacute; en forma
diferente a las de las propuestas de investigaci&oacute;n. Por ser de
inter&eacute;s para la comunidad, a estas temporadas se les
dar&aacute; alta prioridad.

<P><STRONG> 12. Instrumentos en fase de exclusividad:</STRONG><BR>

<P>Se consideran como tales, los instrumentos que ya fueron probados
en el telescopio, a los que ya se les hizo una primera caracterizacion
astron&oacute;mica, y que se encuentran en la etapa de
elaboraci&oacute;n de manuales, entrenamiento del personal
t&eacute;cnico en su instalaci&oacute;n y de nuevos usuarios, antes de
liberarlos como de uso general.  Ser&aacute; el Consejo Interno quien
decida la duraci&oacute;n de esta fase, para cada instrumento que se
solicite.  La evaluaci&oacute;n de las solicitudes de tiempo de
telescopio que utilicen dichos instrumentos se realizar&aacute; de la
misma manera que la descrita en el punto 2, es decir, teniendo en
cuenta el m&eacute;rito acad&eacute;mico y factibilidad del proyecto
astron&oacute;mico. Por lo tanto, su calendarizaci&oacute;n
seguir&aacute; las mismas reglas que cualquier otra temporada de
observaci&oacute;n.

<P><STRONG> 13. Instrumentos extranjeros de uso restringido:</STRONG><BR>

<P>Las temporadas astron&oacute;micas que hagan uso de instrumentos
extranjeros de uso restringido ser&aacute;n evaluadas de acuerdo a lo
descrito en el punto 2.  Para poder evaluar correctamente la
factibilidad, ser&aacute; necesario que el IP describa correctamente
las caracter&iacute;sticas del equipo a emplear y justifique
plenamente que: 
<OL>
 <LI> llegar&aacute; al OAN con antelaci&oacute;n suficiente, 
 <LI> se podr&aacute; instalar en el telescopio respectivo y su
      adaptaci&oacute;n a &eacute;ste no requerir&aacute; de recursos
      extras, tanto humanos como financieros, por parte del OAN, 
 <LI> que durante la temporada de observaci&oacute;n habr&aacute; una persona
      que sepa instalarlo, operarlo y repararlo en caso de desperfecto.
</OL> 
Los gastos de importaci&oacute;n de tales equipos ser&aacute;n
sufragados por el RP, mediante alg&uacute;n proyecto que tenga.

<P>El CI determinar&aacute;, en cada caso, la posibilidad de que este
equipo pase a ser de uso general.

<P><STRONG> 14. Convenios internacionales:</STRONG><BR>

<P>Las pol&iacute;ticas que se siguen, por parte del JAO y la CATT son
las dictadas por la Direcci&oacute;n y el Consejo Interno del
IAUNAM. En particular, respecto a los convenios vigentes, con el grupo
de Mil&aacute;n-Brera y con la Univ. de Massachusetts, se
aplicar&aacute;n las resoluciones tomadas en la reuni&oacute;n del
consejo interno (con la CATT de invitada) el 2 de diciembre de 1992
(acta 35-92).
 
<P>El JAO ser&aacute; el encargado de la supervisi&oacute;n de estos
acuerdos, apoyar&aacute; a la direcci&oacute;n en la revisi&oacute;n o
expiraci&oacute;n de los mismos y ser&aacute; el enlace oficial entre
el IA y los astr&oacute;nomos e instrumentistas extranjeros sujetos a
estos convenios.

<P><STRONG> 15. Reuniones de usuarios del OAN:</STRONG><BR>
 
<P>Se realizar&aacute;n reuniones semestrales de usuarios del OAN, en
M&eacute;xico D.F. y en Ensenada alternadamente. Durante estas
reuniones se presentar&aacute;n las estad&iacute;sticas pertinentes
del a&ntilde;o anterior, se discutir&aacute;n puntos de inter&eacute;s
y se recabar&aacute;n las opiniones y sugerencias para mejorar la
operaci&oacute;n del OAN y y de la CATT.

<P><STRONG> 16. Autorizaci&oacute;n del pago de viajes de C.U. a S.P.M
para temporadas observacionales:</STRONG><BR>

<P>El JAO ser&aacute; el encargado de aprobar los gastos de viajes de
observaci&oacute;n a del DF a SPM. Dadas las limitaciones, tanto de
financiamiento como de espacio en SPM, s&oacute;lo se
aprobar&aacute;n, como regla general, un m&aacute;ximo de dos
observadores por temporada de observaci&oacute;n en el 2.1m y 1.5m y
de un observador para el telescopio de 0.84m. El responsable de cada
temporada asignada deber&aacute;, cuando tenga sus planes hechos,
comunicar sus planes de viaje al Coordinador de Operaci&oacute;n del
OAN (paco@bufadora.astrosen.mx y opervis@bufadora.astrosen.mx ) y a la
secci&oacute;n administrativa del IAUNAM en CU, llenando las formas de
registro de observadores, que se anexan a la convocatoria
semestral. En caso de que el JAO no pueda ser contactado, el
secretario acad&eacute;mico (SA) se encargar&aacute; de la
aprobaci&oacute;n, previa consulta con el calendario de observaciones.
En los casos en que se requieran m&aacute;s observadores de los
mencionados arriba, el Consejo Interno deber&aacute; aprobar <STRONG>
con anticipaci&oacute;n</STRONG> los gastos de los viajes extras a
menos que &eacute;stos sean sufragados con recursos propios
(e.g. proyectos de DGAPA, CONACyT).  Tambi&eacute;n se deber&aacute;
avisar con la mayor anticipaci&oacute;n al JOAN (ya sea directamente o
a trav&eacute;s del JAO) para arreglar la disponibilidad de espacio
suficiente en los dormitorios de SPM.

<P>Para los residentes en Ensenada, la coordinaci&oacute;n de los
viajes de observaci&oacute;n a SPM se har&aacute; directamente con el
JOAN.

<P>En el caso de que alguno de los observadores labore en una
instituci&oacute;n extranjera, &eacute;ste deber&aacute; pagar su
estancia en las instalaciones del OAN en Ensenada y SPM de acuerdo con
las tarifas vigentes.
 
<P><STRONG> 17. Autorizaci&oacute;n de gastos de viajes a Tonantzintla
para temporadas observacionales:</STRONG><BR>

<P>Para periodos de observaci&oacute;n asignados por la CATT en
Tonantzintla a observadores del DF , el JAO o el Jefe del OAN en
Tonantzintla, JOAN-T, ser&aacute;n los encargados de aprobar los
viajes, previa consulta al calendario actualizado de
observaci&oacute;n en Tonantzintla. Las actividades de
divulgaci&oacute;n en Tonantzintla ser&aacute;n programadas por el
JOAN-T y ser&aacute;n dadas a conocer p&uacute;blicamente.

<P>Los viajes a temporadas de observaci&oacute;n de acad&eacute;micos
de Ensenada a Tonantzintla, los aprobar&aacute; el JOAN. En este caso,
se aprobar&aacute; a s&oacute;lo un observador a menos que se cuente
con la autorizaci&oacute;n expl&iacute;cita de CI.

<P>Los observadores en Tonantzintla tendr&aacute;n el derecho a
utilizar los bungalows con que cuenta el IA-UNAM en este lugar.

<P><STRONG> 18. Translado Ensenada--San Pedro M&aacute;rtir y
viceversa:</STRONG><BR>

<P>El OAN transportar&aacute; a SPM a observadores y t&eacute;cnicos
autorizados <STRONG> en los viajes programados</STRONG>. Aunque
usualmente hay subidas y bajadas todos los d&iacute;as exceptuando los
domingos, no en todos los viajes de Ensenada a SPM se puede
transportar carga voluminosa por ello, cuando se requiera transportar,
adem&aacute;s del equipaje necesario, equipo de observaci&oacute;n
voluminoso, se deber&aacute; notificar con la mayor
anticipaci&oacute;n al JOAN y considerar la posibilidad de que el
equipo sea transladado a SPM en unviaje alterno al del observador.

<P>Si al Coordinador de Operaci&oacute;n del OAN se le informa todo el
itinerario de el(los) observador(es) oportunamente, &eacute;ste
transmitir&aacute; la administraci&oacute;n los detalles para reservar
adecuadamente lugar en la ``casita'' de Ensenada y en SPM y en los
veh&iacute;culos para subir o bajar de/al observatorio en los viajes
programados.

<P><STRONG> 19. Preparaci&oacute;n para la temporada en SPM:</STRONG><BR>

<P>El OAN har&aacute; todo lo posible por tener lista en el telescopio
la instrumentaci&oacute;n y, si el observador principal lo comunica
oportunamente (m&iacute;nimo con una semana de anticipaci&oacute;n al
inicio de su temporada) al JAO y/o al JOAN, en la configuraci&oacute;n
solicitada. Salvo en casos especiales bien justificados, no se
permitir&aacute;n cambios de instrumento respecto a lo asignado
inicialmente. En especial si esto requiriera de cambios de secundario
(2.1m) o movimientos de los guiadores exc&eacute;ntricos.

Comisi&oacute;n de Asignaci&oacute;n de Tiempo de Telescopio (CATT)
Instituto de Astronomia, UNAM
</PRE>

<P>Estimados colegas,

<P>Nos dirigimos a ustedes para hecerles saber nuestro desacuerdo con
una regla que la CATT ha impuesto, que viene aplicando inflexiblemente
y que por las razones que a continuaci&oacute;n expondremos afectan
nuestro trabajo.

<P>La regla de que el investigador principal (IP) debe estar presente
en todas las temporadas solicitadas es tal vez una regla vieja pero
que sol&iacute;a observarse con mayor flexibilidad. Creemos que esa
flexibilidad es necesaria para desarrollar proyectos institucionales,
que ha permitido en el pasado elavorar cat&aacute;logos que requieren
mucho de tiempo de telescopio y que ha contribuido en general al buen
uso de los telescopios de 1.5m y 0.84m. Concretamente permiti&oacute;
que algunos de nosotros trabajaramos en equipo y lograramos producir
algunos art&iacute;culos que implicaron muchas observaciones
conseguidas en varias temporadas al a&ntilde;o, por ejemplo <EM> An
uvby-beta catalogue of F0-G8 supergiant stars brighter than V=6.5</EM>
Arellano Ferro, A., Parrao, L., Schuster,W. Gonz&aacute;lez-Bedolla,
S., Peniche, R. and Pe&ntilde;a, J. H. 1990, A&amp;A,
<STRONG>83</STRONG>, 225.  Actualmente un cat&aacute;logo de
observaciones uvby-beta de estrellas cefeidas esta casi terminado y
durante los tres a&ntilde;os que duraron las observaciones se
permiti&oacute; que observaran solos los colaboradores y no
necesariamente con el IP presente.  Actualmente este tipo de programas
no son posibles y estan obstaculizados por una regla mal
dise&ntilde;ada y peor observada. Cabe mencionar que es cierto que los
IP's no son los &uacute;nicos en un grupo de investigaci&oacute;n
capaces de hacer observaciones astron&oacute;micas o de comunicarse
con el personal de apoyo.

<P>En relaci&oacute;n a nuestras colaboraciones internacionales la
situaci&oacute;n es aun peor, no se permite que astr&oacute;nomos con
gran experiencia observacional observen sin la presencia del IP (que
es siempre un astr&oacute;nomo de una instituci&oacute;n mexicana). En
una colaboraci&oacute;n real internacional uno espera compartir con
los colegas todos los aspectos de la investigaci&oacute;n; las ideas,
el dise&ntilde;o del proyecto, las observaciones, las reducciones y
an&aacute;lisis y las producci&oacute;n de la publicaci&oacute;n. La
regla de la CATT en cuesti&oacute;n obliga al astr&oacute;nomo
mexicano a hacer todas las observaciones y, como en la mayor&iacute;a
de los casos no se necesita mas que un observador, el colaborador
extrangero se queda tranquilamente en casa a esperar nuestras
observaciones. Eso, que se parece mucho a la maquila de datos, no es
la colaboraci&oacute;n que muchos de nosotros esperamos o deseamos y
necesitamos y que sin embargo esta fomentada por una mala regla de la
CATT. Para conseguir una participaci&oacute;n mas equitativa al
interior de una colaboraci&oacute;n, un ambiente mas variado e
internacional en SPM y en Ensenada, lo que evidentemente enriquece el
ambiente acad&eacute;mico, es necesario que sean aveces nuestros
colaboradores internacionales los que hagan las observaciones y
fin&aacute;ncien su viaje y estancia en SPM.  Hay proyectos que
requieren mucho tiempo de telescopio por a&ntilde;o lo que hace
imposible para un solo IP estar en todas las temporadas, si esto va a
obligar a algunos equipos de trabajo a reducir sus peticiones de
tiempo de telescopio, nos parece que es ir en la direcci&oacute;n
opuesta a lo deseado para los telescopios en SPM, es decir, lograr un
uso continuo y denso del tiempo de telescopio para producir
astronom&iacute;a con base en la competencia acad&eacute;mica y
leal. La regla tal como se observa ahora pone en peligro de fracasar a
los proyectos observacionales de larga duraci&oacute;n de algunos de
nosotros.

<P>En diversas pl&aacute;ticas con miembros de la CATT se ha dicho que
la regla obedece mas bien a la preocupaci&oacute;n de que algunos
colegas nacionales presten su nombre para que grupos extrangeros
tengan acceso a SPM. Si bien eso nos preocupa a todos y nos
disgustar&iacute;a que alguien lo hiciera, parece sin embargo
elemental distinguir las colaboraciones reales de las falsas, con base
en antecedentes y afinidad de campos de
investigaci&oacute;n. Distinguir entre las verdaderas y las falsas
colaboraciones debiera ser entonces uno de los papeles de los miembros
de la CATT y si la colaboraci&oacute;n es real deben entonces permitir
al grupo de investigaci&oacute;n que se organize como mejor les
parezca a sus integrantes. Para esto el grupo podr&iacute;a definir de
antemano a su investigador principal y sus observadores principales,
tal vez al momento de solicitar el tiempo, la CATT vetar&iacute;a o
aprobar&iacute;a a los observadores basados en su experiencia y una
vez aprobados el grupo de investigaci&oacute;n decidir&iacute;a quien
har&aacute; las observaciones.

<P>Como creemos que la CATT esta simplemente buscando la mejor forma
de operaci&oacute;n de SPM y que para eso debe escuchar las opiniones
de los observadores en este pa&iacute;s, pedimos lo siguiente: 
 <OL> 
  <LI> que en la solicitud quede claro quien es el IP y quienes los
   observadores principales (OP's) y que estos una vez autorizados por la
   CATT puedan a juicio del grupo de trabajo encargarse de la temporada
   de observaci&oacute;n; 
  <LI> Que para proyectos institucionales haya un
   equipo de observadores bien entrenados y autorizados a hacer
   observaciones en solitario; 
  <LI> que reglas tan delicadas como la
   anterior y que pueden destruir proyectos de investigaci&oacute;n sin
   tomar en cuenta su m&eacute;rito acad&eacute;mico, no sean impuestas
   por la CATT sino discutidas en el seno del Colegio del personal
   acad&eacute;mico.
 </OL>

<P>Sin mas por el momento, les enviamos un saludo cordial.

The largest of the telescopes currently at San Pedro Martir, this 2.1
meter telescope was constructed between 1974 and 1979, dedicated on
September 17, 1979.  Optically, the telescope uses a Ritchey-Chretien
design.  The telescope has three secondaries, with focal ratios f/7.5,
f/13.5 and f/30.

collaboration with the University of Arizona.  The original aluminum
mirror was replaced in the late 1970's with one made of Cer-Vit, and
within the last 5 years, large parts of the mechanical support system
have been overhauled and upgraded.

and a low to medium resolution grating spectrograph from
<A HREF="instruments.html#bandc">Boller and Chivens</A>.
If you are more interested in pictures, there are several 
<A HREF="instruments.html#ccds">Optical CCD's</A>, and a

<A NAME="echelle"><EM>ESPRESSO, the Echelle Spectrograph</EM></A> <P>
The Echelle spectrograph, ESPRESSO, was constructed in the late 1970's
by the French optical firm of REOSC.  The echelle is capable of a
resolution of R=18,000 at 5,000&Aring;, with either of its two
camera/detector setups.  This gives a 2 pixel velocity resolution of
roughly 17 km/s.

<A NAME="camila"><EM>CAMILA, the near IR NICMOS Camera</EM></A> 

<P> "CAMILA" the IR Camera is a system based on a NICMOS3
detector. Its format is 256x256 pixels. It is sensitive from 1 to 2.5
microns. The system includes a diaphragm, cooled to reduce the
background radiation level, and a wheel with 12 filters. The optical
system consists of a mirror and a focal reducer designed for the
f/13.5 secondary focus of the 2.12m. telescope of OAN. This yields a
123x123 sq.arcsec. field. The camera is equipped with three wide band
filters (J, H and K) and set of narrow filters corresponding to HeI,
HI (Pa beta, Pa gamma, and Br gamma),
FeII, H2, CO and cK.  The limiting magnitudes 
(5 sigma) of the system are K=16, H=17, J=17.6 for a 1 min integration.<BR>

<P> The system has been upgraded to include a <STRONG>Spectrograph
mode </STRONG> which will be available for general use from July 1996
on.  The system covers the range from 1 to 2.5 microns in both
observational modes: Direct Imaging and Spectroscopy. The
specifications of the system are as follows:

<A NAME="byair"><STRONG>Arriving by Air</STRONG></A>
<P>

<A NAME="fromMex"><EM>From M&eacute;xico:</EM></A> If you are coming
from central M&eacute;xico by air, you will most likely fly into the
international airport in Tijuana.  If you are flying AeroMexico, be
aware that they have a transfer service from the Tijuana airport to
their downtown Ensenada office.  The cost is roughly N$50 each way,
and can be paid for when you buy your plane ticket.  The driver who
makes the run is quite friendly, and will usually drop you off at the
Observatory headquarters in Ensenada if you ask him to.  The
AeroMexico transfer service only meets some of the flights.  If you
arrive on a flight with no connection, Transporte Terrestes operates
van service to Ensenada (their vans are the white and yellow ones with
the airplane painted on the side).  Tickets and van information are
available at their office just outside the terminal (the sign says
TAXI).  The cost is N$60 one way, and the van arrives at the Hotel
Bahia in downtown Ensenada.

<P>
<A NAME="fromUS"><EM>From the USA:</EM></A>
If you are coming from the US, most likely, you will get a flight into
the San Diego International Airport.  The easiest way to get from
there to Ensenada is for a driver from the Observatory to come and
pick you up, for which service we charge (unless you work for the
Instituto de Astronom&iacute;a).  Otherwise, you can take the a taxi
or San Diego Rapid Transit (bus and/or trolley) to the San Ysidro border
point, walk across, and then pick up a bus from Tijuana to Ensenada.

<UL>
<LI> The San Diego Rapid Transit bus from the airport costs $1.50 and
departs every 15-30 minutes.  The airport bus stops across from the
terminal United Airlines uses.  Head out past the baggage claim,
across the loading area, towards the parking lots.  You should see a
bus kiosk toward the right as you emerge.
<LI> The bus from Tijuana to Ensenada costs about N$18, and takes about
1.5 - 2 hours.
</UL>

 <P>
If you have a little more money to spend, you can get a taxi or take
the bus from the airport to the cruise ship docks in downtown San
Diego, from whence you can catch a ship sailing for Ensenada.  I don't
know the cost, nor how long it takes, but I am pretty sure that they
make the trip everyday.

<P> <HR> <P>

<A NAME="bycar"><STRONG>Driving to Ensenada</STRONG></A>
<BR>This simple
<A HREF="/Gifs/direct.gif"> map </A> may help you to find us, once you are
in San Diego, Ca. or Tijuana, B.C.

<DL>
<DT> <EM>US Preliminary:</EM>
<DD> If you are driving south from the US, you will want to obtain
Mexican Auto Insurance before crossing the border, since most American
insurance is not recognized in M&eacute;xico, and most american
policies do not cover your car in M&eacute;xico.  Mexican auto
insurance can be purchased from any of the brokers along San Ysidro
Blvd (the last exit before the border on I-805, the San Diego by-pass
road, or the Via San Ysidro exit off of I-5), or from any of the
offices of the AAA in California, Arizona, and Texas.  The cost is
around $5/day (with discounts being given for periods over 30 days).
The So. CA AAA also puts out a good road map of Baja.  A Car permit is
no longer needed to bring a car into Baja, since Baja is considered
part of the Frontier Zone.

<DT> <EM>M&eacute;xico Preliminary:</EM>
<DD> If you are driving from central M&eacute;xico, then you either
have a car licenced in M&eacute;xico, and/or you have already obtained
Mexican auto insurance.  

<DT> <EM>From California - Step 1:</EM>
<DD> Come south on I-5 or I-805 (usually a faster route through San
Diego) to the Tijuana border point.  Once through, get into the third
lane from the left, and follow the signs for Ensenada Cuota (the toll
road to Ensenada).  You take the right side of the first fork, and
then the left exit as you execute a 270 degree turn to the left.  This
puts you a road running parallel to the border.  Follow this towards
the ocean, and up a hill.  Over the top, the road banks left and down.
Near the bottom, take the right hand exit.  Now, just follow the signs
for Ensenada.  Soon, you will reach the first of three toll gates, and
the beginning of highway 1-D.  Pay the N$12 toll.  It is now about 100
km to Ensenada, with 2 more N$12 tolls.  Once you have paid the last
toll, highway 1-D merges with highway 1 and continues south through El
Sauzal and into Ensenada.

<DT> <EM>From Arizona - Step 1:</EM>
<DD> If you are coming from AZ, most likely you will choose to enter
Baja at the Tecate border point.  Take I-8 west, and get off onto
CA94, and take that to the intersection with route 188 which leads
right to the border.  Go straight ahead on the street leading from the
border point to the street light at the bottom of the hill. Take a
left.  Go one block and take a right at the light.  You are now on the
road to Ensenada.  Follow this street straight out of town.  As you
climb the hill leading out of Tecate, the street becomes highway 3,
and passes under the new highway 2.  It is now about 100 km to
where highway 3 merges with highway 1/1-D just a little north of
Ensenada.

<DT> <EM>From M&eacute;xico - Step 1:</EM>
<DD> Most likely you will be coming west on highway 2 (or in the US on
I-8).  Turn onto highway 3 at Tecate and follow highway 3 to Ensenada.
It is now about 100 km to where highway 3 merges with highway 1/1-D
just a little north of Ensenada.

<DT> <EM>All - Step 2:</EM>
<DD> As you near the north side of Ensenada, you will pass a hotel
called Las Rosas (a big pinkish building on the right-hand side of the
road with a nice view over the bay).  About 1 km further you will see
a bridge over the highway, and an exit right before the bridge with a
sign for Punta Morro and the Universidad Aut&oacute;noma de Baja
California (UABC).  Get off here (be careful, the turn-off has
some nasty pot-holes), go around the traffic circle in front of
UABC, and over the bridge (you should be able to see the observatory
now, it is the building with the white dome on top halfway up the
hill).  When the road forks, go left (please be careful, since people
come the other way here and often pretty fast), and then left up a
short hill.  Take the first left by the sign that says Universidad
Nacional Aut&oacute;noma de M&eacute;xico (it faces away from you so
be warned), and drive up to the parking lot.  Park.  The Observatory 
headquarters is the building above the parking lot, and the entrance
is on the up hill side of the building.

Se describe un sistema de adquisici&oacute;n de im&aacute;gen
integrado por una c&aacute;mara CCD intensificada con salida de video 
y tiempo de exposici&oacute;n variable, una tarjeta digitalizadora 
("frame grabber", FG) y una computadora industrial.
La c&aacute;mara se instal&oacute; en el ocular del Echelle, pero con una
montura adecuada puede colocarse en el ocular de cualquier otro instrumento,
o emplearse para otra finalidad. 
El FG puede ser empleado para cualquier otra c&aacute;mara de video, 
aunque parte de la programaci&oacute;n desarrollada est&aacute; 
dedicada a la c&aacute;mara que aqu&iacute; se describe. A continuaci&oacute;n 
presentamos una descripci&oacute;n general del sistema, instrucciones
para su manejo, ya sea a trav&eacute;s de DOS o de WINDOWS, y, finalmente,
informaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica
sobre los instrumentos y programas.
<P>
La operaci&oacute;n del instrumento se explica con mas detalle 
en la parte del manual dedicada a la interfaz DOS.

El usuario puede operar el sistema directamente desde la computadora de 
control (etiquetada "Frame Grabber"). Para ello requerir&aacute; de 
teclado y monitor para esta computadora. Al encenderse la 
computadora entra directamente al directorio C:\USUARIO y ejecuta el 
programa. Si est&aacute; encendida y ocupada en otra cuesti&oacute;n, 
cambie al directorio se&ntilde;alado, y de el comando CCDINT.
El programa empieza inicializando el FG, reservando espacio
de memoria, calculando el reloj de la computadora y tomando im&aacute;genes
a frecuencia de video (30 Hz). Acto seguido aparece 
la siguiente secuencia de mensajes:

modos ("video" o "integrando"). 
<P>
En modo de video reaparece el encabezado general del programa, y la serie 
de exposiciones concluye tecleando cualquier otro comando.
<P> 
En modo de integraci&oacute;n aparece el mensaje:
<P>
<LI> Interrumpe exposici&oacute;n -----> i
<P>
para suspender el proceso y pasar al men&uacute principal y, si el
tiempo de exposici&oacute;n es mayor que unos 5 segundos, el
tiempo que lleva integrando. 
<P>
Existen dos variantes en el modo "integrando":
<P>
1) exposiciones continuas para tiempos de exposici&oacute;n menores que
50 decisegundos, y
<P>
2) exposici&oacute;n de tiempo indefinido si
el tiempo de exposici&oacute;n es mayor. En este caso
se toman exposiciones parciales (cada una de unos 5 segundos
de duraci&oacute;n) que se van cosumando, al mismo tiempo que el
resultado escalado se despliega en el monitor. En la pantalla de la PC de
control se da el tiempo de exposici&oacute;n hasta ese momento.
<P>
Al terminar la exposici&oacute;n la imagen queda en memoria RAM: es de 8 bits 
por pixel (unos 250 Kbytes en total) si el tiempo de exposici&oacute;n es menor 
que unos 50 decisegundos. Si es mayor es de 16 bits por pixel 
(unos 500 Kbytes en total). Puede almacenarla en disco duro y disquete dando

Como la PC de control no est&aacute; conectada a la red, esta es
la &uacute;nica manera que tiene para grabar imagenes en disco duro
y disquete. El programa hace lo siguiente: 
<P>
Si no est&eacute; puesto un disquete manda el mensaje:
<P>
<LI> "Falta disquete". 
<P>
Si est&aacute; el disquete pero no hay espacio suficiente:
<P>
<LI> "Falta espacio en disquete".
<P>
Si no hay espacio en disco duro:
<P>
<LI> "Falta espacio en disco duro"
<P>
Si no hay espacio en el disco duro y/o disquete, el programa no hace
nada mas. Recuerde que desde el programa puede 
<A HREF="#borra"><EM>borrar</EM></A> archivos *.fit para abrir espacio 
en el disco duro.
<P>
De haber espacio de escritura y/o disquete, el programa reporta:
<P>
<LI> "La imagen se llama: intXX.fit"
<P>
donde XX es un n&uacute;mero entre 01 y 99. Una vez escrito int99.fit, 
reescribe int01.fit. Luego manda el mensaje:
<P>
<LI> "Escribe un comentario (menos de 70 caracteres):"
<P>
El encabezado ya incluye tiempo de exposici&oacute;n, hora y 
fecha de escritura de la imagen (dada por el reloj de la PC), etc. pero
no los datos sobre el objeto (nombre, AR, DEC, &eacute;poca). Le sugerimos 
que ponga algunos en el comentario.
<P>
En modo de video o con tiempo de exposici&oacute;n menor que 50 
decisegundos, la imagen se graba en 8 bits por pixel, que corresponden
a 256 niveles. Caben hasta 5 imagenes de 8 
bits (cada una de alrededor de 250 kbytes) en un disquete de 1.44 Mb.
Si el tiempo de exposici&oacute;n es mayor que 50 decisegundos
(y puede ser tan grande como quiera) la imagen se graba en 16 bits por
pixel (65536 niveles)
y cada imagen ocupa cerca de 500 kbytes. Caben solo 2 imagenes en un 
disquete de 1.44 Mb. 
<P>
Para leer la imagen de 16 bits en IRAF es indispensable hacer lo
siguiente:
<LI> De el comando "rfits" (p.ej. rfits int21.fit gtrevi)
<LI> Luego de el comando: chpixtype gtrevi newpixtype="ushort" gtrevi
<P>
Si no pudo grabar la imagen en el disquete, ponga uno con espacio 
suficiente y vuelva a dar el comando para guardar la imagen. Si

La c&aacute;mara est&aacute; puesta en una montura fija sobre el ocular del
espectr&oacute;grafo Echelle, enfocada en la rendija de este instrumento.
La rutina que aqu&iacute; se describe es para enfocar una estrella sobre
la rendija moviendo el foco (posici&oacute;n del secundario) del telescopio. 
En esta rutina el CCD se pone a integrar continuamente. El m&aacute;ximo
tiempo de cada exposici&oacute;n para hacer foco es de 50 decisegundos 
(5 segundos). Al inicio aparecen los siguientes mensajes:
<P>
<LI> Mueve el cuadro con el teclado num&eacute;rico....
<LI> Termina ---------> x
<LI> Cambia velocidad ---> v
<LI> Aumenta caja ------> +
<LI> Disminuye caja -----> -
<P>
Con estos comandos mueve y redimensiona una ventana en el monitor, 
hasta centrar
la estrella que se va a usar para hacer foco. Cuide 
que el teclado num&eacute;rico se pueda usar (e.d., que no est&eacute;
prendido "Num Lock"). Cambia velocidad (`v') permite mover mas o menos
r&aacute;pido el cuadro (empieza en lento). Con `+' y `-' cambia el tama&ntilde;o de la ventana (entre 20 y 40
pixeles por lado, 30 por omisi&oacute;n). Centrada la estrella, oprima la 
tecla `x' (Termina). El programa hace entonces lo siguiente:
<P>
<LI> Da la posici&oacute;n del centro de la ventana en el monitor,
<LI> lee un cuadro de la imagen 3 veces mayor que la ventana,
<LI> calcula el centroide en la ventana,
<LI> calcula y reporta el FWHM , la eccentricidad y el &aacute;ngulo de posici&oacute;n, y
<LI> en el monitor de video, grafica barridos de la imagen en ambos ejes, 
pasando por el centroide de la misma.
<P>
El c&aacute;lculo se realiza con 3 o 5 exposiciones 
(para que haya una muestra suficiente sin que el tiempo total exceda
unos 15 segundos), y se promedian los resultados: FWHM (en pixeles y
segundos de arco), excentricidad y &aacute;ngulo de posici&oacute;n.
Estas cantidades se calculan en base a los segundos
momentos de la intensidad, dados en la rutina IMEXAMINE de IRAF. No
corresponden a un ajuste de una gaussiana bi-dimensional. El tama&ntilde;o de
la imagen en segundos de arco se calcula para una escala de placa de
0.24"/pixel.
<P>
Despu&eacute;s de presentar los resultados aparecen los mensajes:
<P>
<LI> Termina -----> q
<LI> Contin&uacute;a -----> cualquier otra tecla
<P>
Var&iacute;e el foco y oprima cualquier tecla (excepto `q') hasta quedar
satisfecho. El programa mueve la ventana de tal modo que la
estrella siempre queda en el centro. Termine oprimiendo `q'.

El presente reporte tiene por objeto describir las caracter&iacute;sticas
mec&aacute;nicas, &oacute;pticas y electr&oacute;nicas del guiador 
exc&eacute;ntrico del telescopio de 84 cm del OAN. Este telescopio de 
di&aacute;metro peque&ntilde;o presenta caracter&iacute;sticas atractivas para 
algunas ramas de la investigaci&oacute;n astron&oacute;mica - 
como su calidad &oacute;ptica, su gran escala de placa y la calidad de
im&aacute;gen del sitio en donde est&aacute; 
ubicado - que no han sido totalmente aprovechadas a falta de sistemas modernos 
de apoyo. Con la instalaci&oacute;n de un engrane en declinaci&oacute;n, una 
nueva consola de control (Ibarra et al 1992; Zazueta et al 1994), y el 
sistema de guiado exc&eacute;ntrico 
que se describe en el presente reporte, se espera superar esa deficiencia.
El sistema de guiado para el telescopio de 84 cm tiene las mismas
caracter&iacute;sticas b&aacute;sicas que el el de 150 cm. Con ello hemos
buscado reducir el tiempo de desarrollo aprovechando la experiencia
ganada en la construcci&oacute;n, instalaci&oacute;n y operaci&oacute;n del 
guiador del telescopio de 150 cm (Pedrayes et al 1992; Zazueta 1992; Zazueta y
Bohigas 1994). Asimismo, agilizar el 
mantenimiento y las mejoras a estos instrumentos y, para el usuario, 
reducir el tiempo dedicado a entrenamiento.

En la <A HREF="f1g84.gif">Figura 1</A> y la
<A HREF="f2g84.gif">Figura 2</A> presentamos una vista lateral y 
otra de planta del instrumento, con
las siguientes componentes numeradas:
<P>
1) Espejo inclinado a 45+-4 grados con respecto
al plano de la platina, con una agujero por donde pasa el haz del
eje &oacute;ptico del telescopio al instrumento de observaci&oacute;n. El
centro del agujero es la posici&oacute;n de referencia o centro
del campo que visualiza el sistema.
<P>
2) Mecanismo para hacer girar el espejo, barriendo de este modo
el campo observable en el eje de declinaci&oacute;n (ascensi&oacute;n recta
en el telescopio de 150 cm).  
<P>
3) Sistema de moviminento lineal para desplazar el espejo de tal suerte 
que deje pasar o bloquee la luz que va a dar al instrumento.
<P>
4) Mesa sobre la que descansa la c&aacute;mara del guiador. 
<P>
5) C&aacute;mara del guiador
<P>
6) Eje paralelo al espejo. La c&aacute;mara se mueve en este eje para
cubrir el campo del guiador en ascensi&oacute;n recta (declinaci&oacute;n en
el telescopio de 150 cm).
<P>
7) Eje perpendicular al espejo. Este movimiento es para enfocar la 
c&aacute;mara del guiador.
<P>
En la <A HREF="/Colegio/t1guiad84.html">Tabla 1</A> se dan las dimensiones 
m&aacute;s importantes del
guiador.  

<P>
Para que la c&aacute;mara del guiador y el instrumento de observaci&oacute;n
est&eacute;n en foco simult&aacute;neamente, es
necesario que la distancia de la base del guiador al detector del
instrumento, GI, est&eacute; comprendida en el siguiente rango de
valores:
<P>
GI = (EC1 a EC2) - HB = 173.8 a 323.8 mm 
<P>
Si un elemento &oacute;ptico entre la base del guiador y el detector
del instrumento cambia la escala de placa por un factor R, entonces hay
que sumarle o restarle (dependiendo de si es reductor o amplificador)
EI * R a GI, donde EI es la distancia del elemento &oacute;ptico al 
detector del instrumento.
<P>
El intervalo de distancias de la platina del telescopio a la posici&oacute;n 
donde hace foco la c&aacute;mara del guiador var&iacute;a entre 
365 y 515 mm. La posici&oacute;n de foco &oacute;ptimo est&aacute; a 
597 mm de la platina. Para llegar a ella es necesario colocar un
extensor (de unos 150 mm) entre el guiador y la platina. Dadas las
caracter&iacute;sticas mec&aacute;nicas del telescopio preferimos 
no incluir &eacute;sta extensi&oacute;n. 
Dentro del intervalo de distancias de enfoque (365 a 515 mm) la 
escala de placa del telescopio de 84 cm va de 17.5 a 16.8
segundos de arco por mil&iacute;metro (Noble, 1987;Noble y Harris, 1990). 
En consecuencia, el campo que cubre el guiador es del orden de
2570 X 1715 segundos de arco. El hoyo del guiador ocupa un 22% de este campo. 
Cabe apuntar que, aunque el hoyo del espejo primario del telescopio de 84 cm 
es muy estrecho, pr&aacute;cticamente no hay vi&ntilde;eta en este campo. 
<P>
En la <A HREF="f3g84.gif">Figura 3</A> se presenta la disposici&oacute;n 
general y conexiones entre los elementos principales del sistema.
Los cables y las terminales de cada conexi&oacute;n
est&aacute;n numerados de la siguiente manera, en donde O indica que est&aacute;
en el cuarto de observaci&oacute;n y T que est&aacute; en el piso de telescopio:

de estos dispositivos, revise que las terminales est&eacute;n bien
instaladas. Por ning&uacute;n motivo jale los cables.

<P>
El dise&ntilde;o electr&oacute;nico es descrito ampliamente por
Zazueta (1995). Consta de las siguientes componentes:
<P>
1) Computadora de una tarjeta basada en un microcontrolador 80C31 de
Intel, modelo BCC52 con 16 Kb de ROM, 8 Kb de RAM y ducto Z8, fabricada 
por Micromint. Recibe e interpreta las instrucciones del usuario
a trav&eacute;s de un puerto serie RS-232 (a 9600 bauds, 8 bits por
caracter, no paridad y 1 bit de paro), y manda los comandos de
inicializaci&oacute;n a la tarjeta de control. En la memoria ROM
est&aacute; grabado el programa (escrito en ensamblador) que ejecuta las
tareas de control del guiador. 
<P>
2) Tarjeta de control T628G84 dise&ntilde;ada en el OAN e insertable en
el ducto de la Micromint. Est&aacute; basada en los circuitos
integrados LM628 de la National Semiconductor. Controla la
posici&oacute;n y velocidad de los motores de corriente directa
para AR, DEC y foco con retroalimentaci&oacute;n de codificadores
incrementales para cerrar el lazo. Los conjuntos motor-codificador para
estos tres ejes son id&eacute;nticos (1000 pulsos por revoluci&oacute;n,
4000 en cuadratura). La resoluci&oacute;n de los movimientos en AR, foco
y DEC es de 1 micra por pulso para los dos primeros y 
2.25" por pulso para DEC. El movimiento de entrada y salida del
espejo se controla con un bit del puerto del microcontrolador 
y es sensado por microinterruptores.
<P>
3) Etapa de amplificadores (AMPG84) de potencia para la interfaz entre
la tarjeta de control T628G84 y los motores que mueven el sistema en sus 4 
ejes (AR, DEC, foco, y movimiento lateral del espejo). Los amplificadores
para los tres primeros movimientos son id&eacute;nticos.

<P>
La c&aacute;mara del guiador consta de tres componentes principales:
<P>
1) Una c&aacute;mara CCD comercial, SpectraSource modelo Lynxx-PC, con
enfriado termoel&eacute;ctrico. Se le ha deshabilitado el obturador. Las 
caracter&iacute;sticas de esta c&aacute;mara se dan en la 
<A HREF="/Colegio/t2guiad84.html">Tabla 2</A>.
<P>
2) Una computadora personal en donde se ha insertado la tarjeta
controladora de la c&aacute;mara CCD. Env&iacute;a comandos a la c&aacute;mara
a trav&eacute;s de un puerto serie con un conector DB15HD. Recibe
las instrucciones del usuario a trav&eacute;s de un puerto 
serie RS-232, y env&iacute;a la se&ntilde;al de video a un monitor situado
en el cuarto de observaci&oacute;n. La computadora calcula el centroide 
de la imagen, y a trav&eacute;s del puerto paralelo env&iacute;a pulsos de 
correcci&oacute;n a una paleta ad-hoc para realizar el
autoguiado (ver siguiente secci&oacute;n).
<P>
3) Un intensificador comercial de segunda generaci&oacute;n, Xybion
modelo IRO-201, acoplado a la c&aacute;mara CCD a trav&eacute;s de un
sistema &oacute;ptico de relevo. Se conecta a la unidad de
potencia situada en el cuarto de observaci&oacute;n. El control de ganancia 
variable (autom&aacute;tico o manual) se realiza a trav&eacute;s de esta
unidad. La clavija (pin) 1 del conector es para potencia (12 VDC), la 2
para tierra, la 3 est&aacute; libre, y la 4 se usa para la
ganancia variable (0 VDC para el m&aacute;ximo, 5 VDC para el m&iacute;nimo).  
En la <A HREF="/Colegio/t3guiad84.html">Tabla 3</A>
se apuntan las caracter&iacute;sticas de este sistema.

<A NAME="autoguia"><EM>V. Autoguiado</EM></A>
</H2>
<H3>
<P>
El autoguiado se realiza de la misma manera que con el guiador para el
telescopio de 150 cm (Zazueta 1994), es decir, a trav&eacute;s de 
una paleta ad-hoc que recibe los pulsos de correcci&oacute;n desde 
el puerto paralelo de la computadora de la c&aacute;mara del guiador. 
La paleta del telescopio debe estar en lentos. La computadora
del guiador realiza las siguientes operaciones:
<P>
1) Calcula el valor medio de la se&ntilde;al en el cuadro que incluye 
la estrella para guiar, normalmente de 30 pixeles por lado.
<P>
2) Hace cero cualquier se&ntilde;al que est&eacute; por debajo del valor
medio y amplifica la se&ntilde;al que est&eacute; sobre este valor. Hecho
el proceso calcula el primer centroide, que es el de referencia.
<P>
3) En todos los cuadros subsecuentes hace las operaciones
anteriores y calcula diferencias con el centroide de referencia
en ambas direcciones.
<P>
4) Por omisi&oacute;n, si la diferencia DX es inferior a 0.4 pixeles o 
superior a 8 pixeles, no corregir&aacute; (valores ajustables).
Si DX est&aacute; entre estos dos valores,
activar&aacute; la paleta durante un tiempo dado por:
<P>
DT = DX * VALKP milisegundos
<P>
donde DX est&aacute; dado en pixeles y VALKP es una constante que fija el
usuario (50 por omisi&oacute;n). En la consola del telescopio es 
posible definir la
unidad de pulso de la paleta. Una unidad de pulso (LEN=1) corresponde
a 0.008" en AR y 0.04" en DEC. Si las diferencias calculadas
exceden varias veces los 8 pixeles (3 veces por omisi&oacute;n) se suspende
el autoguiado dando aviso al usuario.
<P>
La paleta de autoguiado tiene los siguientes interruptores: (1) +AR,
(2) -AR, (3) +DEC y (4) -DEC.

<P>
Zazueta y Bohigas (1996) describen en detalle la
<A HREF="/Colegio/usrguiad84.html">interfaz de usuario</A>.  
Esta ha sido dise&ntilde;ada para operar en el ambiente de
Windows. Se utiliz&oacute; el compilador Symantec C++
versi&oacute;n 6.1, y el paquete para desarrollo gr&aacute;fico es el
ZINC Application Framework versi&oacute;n 4.0. La interfaz de usuario del guiador est&aacute; contituida por dos programas de MS-WINDOWS : 
GUIADOR.EXE y GSCAT.EXE. 
<P>
El programa GUIADOR.EXE recibe los comandos de alto nivel del 
usuario y genera los comandos de bajo nivel a las computadoras de 
control del guiador y de la c&aacute;mara. Los comandos de bajo nivel son
enviados al puerto serie por medio de una DLL ("dynamic link library").
Esta DLL se encarga de dar a cada mensaje el siguiente formato:
<P> 
<LI> inicio de mensaje ( : )
<LI> nmero de puerto (1 a 4)
<LI> nmero de caracteres del mensaje (0-70 en hexadecimal)
<LI> el mensaje (cualquier ascii menos ":" y ";")
<LI> fin de mensaje ( ; )
<P>
como por ejemplo, :10BGLORIATREVI;
que significa mensaje al puerto 1, de 11 caracteres (0B en hexadecimal), siendo
el mensaje "GLORIATREVI", y fin de mensaje declarado con ";".
<P>
El paquete anterior es recibido por una computadora despachadora de 
mensajes. La funci&oacute;n de esta computadora es redirigir el paquete por 
el puerto correspondiente (0-9) dependiendo de la direccin requerida.
La asignaci&oacute;n de puertos de la computadora de despacho es la siguiente:
<P>
<LI> COM1 a COM1 de la PC del guiador
<LI> COM2 a COM1 de la PC de la c&aacute;mara
<LI> COM3 a COM2 de la PC del usuario
<LI> COM4 a COM1 de la PC de la rueda de filtros (Zazueta et al, 1996)
<P>
El programa GSCAT.EXE realiza la
b&uacute;squeda en cat&aacute;logos de objetos de inter&eacute;s astron&oacute;mico, y
despliega un mapa de las posiciones de las estrellas del Hubble Guide
Star Catalogue (en CD-ROM) contenidas en el campo que cubre el espejo del
guiador. Asimismo, manda los offsets de la estrella seleccionada
al programa GUIADOR.EXE, con el que se comunica
por medio de la DLL mencionada, que tambien contiene 
las funciones de comunicaci&oacute;n entre procesos en WINDOWS.

En este reporte se describe la interfaz de usuario del guiador 
del telescopio de 84 cm del OAN. Esta opera bajo el 
ambiente MS-Windows. Incluye dos ejecutables: GUIADOR.EXE y GSCAT.EXE,
ambos en el directorio C:\G84. Cada uno tiene su propia ventana de
comandos. Los programas se pueden comunicar entre si, pero act&uacute;an
independientemente. GSCAT.EXE requiere de una unidad lectora de CD's
para revisar el contenido del Hubble Guide Star Catalogue. Los programas
se ejecurtan activando el icono correspondiente en el grupo denominado
"OAN".
<P>
GUIADOR.EXE:
<P>
Este programa abre la ventana denominada "Guiador 84 cm", desde
donde se controlan los movimientos del guiador y operaciones de la
c&aacute;mara. Se abren las siguientes ventanas auxiliares:
<P>
<LI> "Comandos del guiador"
<LI> "Ceros de instrumentos"
<LI> "Offsets relativos"
<P>
GSCAT.EXE
<P>
Este programa abre la ventana denominada "Guiador 84 cm. GSC" que se usa
para buscar las estrellas del Hubble Guide Star Catalogue 
(en un CD) que est&aacute;n en el campo que cubre el espejo del guiador.

de la c&aacute;mara CCD que est&aacute; ubicada en el guiador. Lo hace a trav&eacute;s
de su puerte serie COM2 y un conector tipo DB15HD. 
Tambien recibe las im&aacute;genes 
del CCD y las retransmite en formato de video a un monitor situado en el 
cuarto de observaci&oacute;n. Cuando recibe la instrucci&oacute;n de 
autoguiado de la PC usuario (por su puerto serie COM1), calcula
el centroide de la imagen y env&iacute;a se&ntilde;ales a la paleta de 
<A HREF="#autoguiado"><EM>autoguiado</EM></A> para corregir la posici&oacute;n 
del telescopio. Se
conecta a esta paleta a trav&eacute;s del puerto paralelo. PC c&aacute;mara

prenda esta unidad (O). Recuerde que EL INTENSIFICADOR ES UN INSTRUMENTO
MUY DELICADO, y puede quemarse facilmente si hay exceso de luz.
Mantenga estos cuidados durante la noche.
<P>
8) Active los iconos titulados "Guiador 84 cm", "C&aacute;mara Guiador 84 cm"
y  "Guiador 84 cm. GSC", que est&aacute;n en el grupo "OAN". Aparecer&aacute;
adem&aacute;s una ventana titulada "Ceros de instrumentos".
<P>
9) Centre el guiador haciendo lo siguiente:
<P>
<LI> Seleccione el instrumento que est&aacute; usando de la lista que se presenta
en la ventana "Ceros de instrumentos". Si no est&aacute; en la lista 
seleccione "Cero mec&aacute;nico". Espere hasta que se posicione el guiador.
<LI> Con el espejo del guiador "fuera", centre y enfoque una estrella
(preferentemente de magnitud 5 o 6) en el instrumento.
<LI> Con la <A HREF="#paleta">paleta</A> del guiador mueva el espejo a la 
posici&oacute;n "dentro"
<LI> En la ventana <A HREF="#interfaz2">"C&aacute;mara Guiador 84 cm."</A> 
inicie una secuencia de  exposiciones.
<LI> Con la paleta en la ventana "Guiador 84 cm.", centre la estrella en el monitor de la
c&aacute;mara y enf&oacute;quela. 
<LI> Si la estrella no est&aacute; en el monitor
aumente la ganancia del intensificador y/o el tiempo de exposici&oacute;n,
y desplace el guiador en ambos ejes con la paleta hasta ubicarla. 
Si a&uacute;n no la encuentra, centre una estrella m&aacute;s brillante en el
instrumento (recuerde mover el espejo a la posici&oacute;n "fuera"), 
v repita los pasos anteriores. Una vez centrada anote la 
<A HREF="#posguiador">posici&oacute;n real</A> en la que qued&oacute; 
el guiador (en AR, DEC y Foco) para utilizarla en sus siguientes noches de 
observaci&oacute;n. En vez de usar la paleta del guiador, puede intentar
mandar offsets cercanos al objeto central a trav&eacute;s de 
la ventana del <A HREF="#campoguiador">campo del guiador</A>
<LI> Del men&uacute; de comandos de la ventana "Guiador 84 cm.", seleccione
<A HREF="#comandos">"Comandos del guiador"</A>. Se abrir&aacute; 
una ventana. Oprima el bot&oacute;n "Define Cero AR/DEC" y pase de nuevo
a la ventana "Guiador 84 cm.".
<P>
Hecho esto ya est&aacute; listo para la operaci&oacute;n normal.

<A NAME="autoguiado"><EM>X. Autoguiado.</EM></A>
</H2>
<H3>
<P>
El autoguiado se realiza de la misma manera que con el guiador para el
telescopio de 150 cm (Zazueta 1994), es decir, a trav&eacute;s de 
una paleta ad-hoc que recibe los pulsos de correcci&oacute;n desde 
el puerto paralelo de la PC de la c&aacute;mara del guiador. 
La paleta del telescopio debe estar en lentos. La paleta de autoguiado
tiene los siguientes interruptores: (1) +AR,
(2) -AR, (3) +DEC y (4) -DEC.

<P>
La computadora
del c&aacute;mara realiza las siguientes operaciones:
<P>
1) En la primera exposici&oacute;n calcula el valor medio de la se&ntilde;al 
en el cuadro que incluye la estrella para guiar.
<P>
2) Luego iguala a cero cualquier se&ntilde;al menor que el valor
medio y amplifica la se&ntilde;al que exceda este valor. Hecho
esto calcula el primer centroide, que es el de referencia.
<P>
3) En todos los cuadros subsecuentes hace las operaciones
anteriores y calcula diferencias con el centroide de referencia
en ambas direcciones.
<P>
4) Por omisi&oacute;n, si las diferencias DX y DY son menores que 
0.4 pixeles o mayores que 8 pixeles, no correge.
Si DX y DY est&aacute;n entre estos dos valores,
activa la paleta durante un tiempo dado por:
<P>
DTX = DX * VALKP milisegundos en una direcci&oacute;n y
<P>
DTY = DY * VALKP milisegundos en la otra
<P>
<A HREF="#interfaz2"><EM>VALKP</EM></A> es una constante que fija el usuario. 
<P>
En la consola del telescopio es posible definir cuanto se mueve el
telescopio si se oprime el bot&oacute;n de la paleta durante 1 milisegundo
con la instrucci&oacute;n LEN=X, donde X es un n&uacute;mero (se sugiere usar
LEN=1). Por ejemplo, en el telescopio de 1.5 m, si LEN=DTX=DTY=1, el
telescopio se mueve 0.008" en AR y 0.04" en DEC.
<P>
Si las diferencias calculadas
exceden 3 veces los 8 pixeles (valores por omisi&oacute;n) se suspende
el autoguiado dando aviso al usuario.
<P>
El usuario puede mejorar la calidad del autoguiado enviando instruciones
desde la <A HREF="#interfaz2"><EM>ventana de la c&aacute;mara</EM></A>. Por
ejemplo:
<P>
- Si reduce el tama\~no de la `caja` mejora la precisi&oacute;n del guiado, pero
la estrella puede salirse de la caja y/o puede aumentar r&aacute;pidamente el
n&uacute;mero de veces que se excede `error_max`.
<P>
- El par&aacute;metro mas importante es VALKP: si es muy peque\~no no corige
lo suficiente, si es demasaiado grande corrige en exceso. Pruebe cambiar
este par&aacute;metro para mejorar el autoguiado. Puede darse el caso de que
el telescopio oscile (ver&aacute; que la estrella de guiado bailotea).
Suspenda el autoguiado y cambie el valor de VALKP para resolver el
problema. Puede ser necesario suspender tambi&eacute;n la integraci&oacute;n.

CCD puede girar. La rueda de polarizadores est&aacute; fija.
<P>
2) Una paleta con reductor focal y 2 posiciones: reductor dentro 
y fuera. El reductor cambia la escala 1::1.6 aproximadamente. 
Los filtros del OAN est&aacute;n dise&ntilde;ados para un haz
f/7.5. Es necesario tener este haz si el filtro es muy angosto:
este reductor convierte el haz de los telescopios de 84 y 150
cm (f/15 y f/13.5 respectivamente) a esta raz&oacute;n focal
aproximadamente (f/9.4 y f/8.4).
<P>
3) Una rueda que admite 8 filtros de 50 mm de di&aacute;metro 
(o filtros cuadrados de 50X50 mm). La rueda es 
intercambiable y el usuario puede poner en ella 
el juego de <A HREF="/Instruments/filtros.html"><EM>filtros</EM></A> 
que desee.
<P>
4) Una platina giratoria en donde va montado el CCD. 
La platina gira hasta 150 grados.

En las siguientes secciones se describen los cambios que sufre
la curva espectral con variaciones en la temperatura y el &aacute;ngulo
de incidencia, para los filtros de interferencia. Todos estos
tienen norma de calidad de imagen, es decir, las superficies son
planas a &lt;= 0.25 longitudes de onda y paralelas a &lt;=30&quot;.
Para evitar patrones o im&aacute;genes m&uacute;ltiples, todas
las pel&iacute;culas son depositadas en una sola superficie. Se
les da un tratamiento de &quot;envejecimiento&quot;, que supuestamente
retarda la deriva secular de la longitud de onda central
<P>
Todos los filtros cuentan con una montura individual, &uacute;nica
para todos ellos. Cada juego est&aacute; depositado en su propia
caja. Moreno (1986) proporciona informaci&oacute;n sobre otros
filtros del OAN. Informaci&oacute;n
de la serie de filtros para el PUMA, con M. Rosado.

<H3>
La superficie m&aacute;s reflectiva de los filtros de interferencia
debe apuntar hacia la fuente. La &uacute;nica raz&oacute;n aparente
es que ello evita el calentamiento radiativo, cosa un poco rid&iacute;cula
en el caso de fuentes astron&oacute;micas.

Las curvas espectrales que se presentan fueron calibradas para
una temperatura de operaci&oacute;n de 0&#176;C, el promedio aproximado
en San Pedro M&aacute;rtir, o 24&#176;C. La curva de transmisi&oacute;n
espectral se corre al azul al bajar la temperatura, al rojo cuando
&eacute;sta sube. La variaci&oacute;n depende de la longitud de
onda. T&iacute;picamente se habla de corrimientos de 0.15&Aring;/&#176;C
a 4000&Aring;, y 0.3&Aring;/&#176;C a 7000&Aring;. Es decir, s&oacute;lo
los filtros m&aacute;s angostos pueden presentar problemas al
operar en condiciones extremas de temperatura. Los efectos t&eacute;rmicos
sobre el ancho de banda y la transmitancia son m&iacute;nimos
(&#152;0.01&Aring;/&#176;C y 0.013% &Aring;/&#176;C respectivamente).
<P>
Los filtros se da&ntilde;an permanentemente cuando est&aacute;n
sujetos a temperaturas extremas (&#177;60&#176;C), o variaciones
t&eacute;rmicas r&aacute;pidas (10&#176;C por minuto).

</U></H2>
<H3>

Para luz colimada con un &aacute;ngulo de incidencia &lt;= 10&#176;C,
la longitud de onda central se corre seg&uacute;n la siguiente
f&oacute;rmula:
<P>

<CENTER>
lambda_&oslash;=lambda_o*sqrt{[1 - (Ne/Nf)*(Ne/Nf)*sin&oslash;*sin&oslash;]}          ....(1)
</CENTER>

<P>
donde &oslash; es el &aacute;ngulo de incidencia, lambda_&oslash;
y lambda_ o son la longitud de onda central al &aacute;ngulo
&oslash; y a 0&#176; respectivamente, Ne y Nf los &iacute;ndices
de refracci&oacute;n del medio externo y el filtro respectivamente.
Como se puede ver de (1), la curva espectral se corre al azul
al aumentar el &aacute;ngulo de incidencia. Este &uacute;ltimo se calcula
de la raz&oacute;n focal con:
<P>

<CENTER>
&oslash; = 0.5 atan(1/F) ....(2)
</CENTER>

<P>
Es decir, &oslash; = 3.8&#176;, 2.1&#176;, 1.9&#176; y 0.95&#176;,
para F = 7.5, 13.5, 15 y 30 respectivamente. Con respecto al sistema
F/7.5, la longitud de onda central en un sistema F/30 se corre
no m&aacute;s de 0.8% al rojo, que corresponde a unos 52&Aring;
a 6560&Aring;. Los efectos de luz no-colimada son m&aacute;s complejos
en la medida en que el haz incide a diversos &aacute;ngulos. Para
haces de luz relativamente uniformes (delta(&oslash;)&lt;=20&#176;)
el corrimiento de la longitud de onda central es aproximadamente
la mitad de lo prescrito en (1). El ancho de banda aumenta ligeramente
en este caso.
<P>
N&oacute;tese que es posible muestrear el espacio de velocidades
inclinando los filtros.

<H3>
La gran mayor&iacute;a de las manchas desaparecen echando uno
o varios vahos sobre las superficies de los filtros, para despu&eacute;s
limpiar con el papel que se usa para lentes fotogr&aacute;ficas.
NO emplee otro procedimiento.

Filtros de interferencia
con ancho de banda &lt;=50&Aring;, di&aacute;metro de 50mm, centrados
en las principales l&iacute;neas de emisi&oacute;n de objetos
nebulares o en el continuo cercano. Sus caracter&iacute;sticas
est&aacute;n anotadas en las Tabla I, y sus curvas de respuesta
espectral se presentan en varias figuras. Las
curvas son para un &aacute;ngulo
de incidencia de 3.8&#176; (correspondiente a F/7.5) y T = 0&#176;C
(hay un par de excepciones).
<P>
<B> Notas sobre filtros nebulares gal&aacute;cticos</B>
<P>
En principio los filtros s&oacute;lo dejan pasar una l&iacute;nea
o un continuo puro. En realidad esto es imposible, aunque en la
mayor parte de los casos es una excelente aproximaci&oacute;n.
Los contados casos en los que esto no es cierto son:
<P>
- [OII]3727: incluye l&iacute;neas de la serie de Balmer y en
algunas circunstancias, l&iacute;neas permitidas. Las primeras
se pueden eliminar con im&aacute;genes en Halfa o H&szlig;. Con las
segundas no hay remedio.
<P>
- Hgama: incluye [OIII]4363&Aring;, pero se tiene el filtro para
esta l&iacute;nea. 
<P>
- Continuo a 6650: si la emisi&oacute;n en HeI es importante,
este filtro ya no es para el continuo. En este caso, se puede
usar el filtro 6450 o el 6810 de la serie nebular extrgal&aacute;ctica.
<P>
En cualquier caso, no se debe dejar de revisar el espectro (si
existe) de la regi&oacute;n estudiada.

<P>
El filtro U es interferencial. Los dos juegos VBRI fueron dise&ntilde;ados,
hasta donde fue posible, con las combinaciones recomendadas por
Bessell (1979) para el sistema de Cousins. Se emplearon filtros
Schott. Desde luego, el fotomultiplicador recomendado por Bessell
(RCA C31034, con fotoc&aacute;todo de GaAs) no tiene nada que
ver con la respuesta espectral del CCD, por lo que es necesario
generar las ecuaciones de transformaci&oacute;n para emplear este
sistema fotom&eacute;tricamente.

(<A HREF="#contents">Contents</A>|
<A HREF="#sctadju">Next Section</A>)
  
 <P>The Echelle Spectrograph at San Pedro Martir (SPM) was constructed
in the late 1970's by the French Optical firm of REOSC.  The echelle
is capable of a resolution of <EM>R ~ 18,000</EM> at 5,000&Aring;,
with either of its two camera/detector setups.  This translates into a
2 pixel velocity resolution of roughly 17 km/s
  
 <P>A note on the choice of name.  The echelle (unlike the newer
instruments at San Pedro) has not been graced with a name other than
to call it ``the echelle'' (at least as far as the author is aware).
While writing this manual, I had a free moment to ponder this terrible
state of affairs, and propose to call the echelle ESPRESSO (for
ESPectrografo Reosc Echelle de Sierra San pedro martir, Observatorio
or if you prefer, Echelle SPectrograph from REosc for the Sierra San
pedro martir Observatory).  Thus, this is the ESPRESSO User's Guide,
and if you like, you can tell your friends that you are up on the
mountain using the ESPRESSO Machine.

<P><A NAME="sbcgen"><EM>1.1 General Information</EM></A> <P>

 <P>The layout of the main optical elements of the spectrograph is
shown in <A HREF="fig_opti.html">Figure 1</A>, and the instrument
controls in <A HREF="fig_sides.html">Figure 2</A>.  The main <STRONG>
echelle grating </STRONG> is ruled on a 254mm&#215;128mm area, and has
79 lines/mm.  The blaze angle is 63&#176;433, and the incidence angle
is 71&#176;.  The beam is dispersed into an angle of &#177;2&#176;63.
The dispersion depends upon the order, and ranges from 4&Aring;/mm to
16&Aring;/mm.  The values differ slightly depending upon which of the
two available cameras you are using (see the sections on the two
cameras - <A HREF="#sctucl">ucl</A> or <A HREF="#sctoan">reosc</A>).
  
 <P>The two <STRONG> grating cross-dispersers </STRONG> available are
listed in <A HREF="tables.html#tbinfo">Table 1</A> .  The 900 lines/mm
cross-disperser (B) was most useful when the detector was a
photographic plate.  With a CCD (and its much smaller detector surface
area), the 300 lines/mm grating (A) is more useful.  With this, it is
possible to fit between 8 (near Halpha) and 16 (near 4,000&Aring;)
orders onto the chip with the REOSC/UMass setup, or between 12 and 30
orders onto the UCL/Mil setup.

 <P>The current default setup uses cross-disperser A, with the UCL
camera and the CCD-Mil detector.
  
 <P>There are half a dozen <STRONG> comparison lamps </STRONG>
available (see <A HREF="tables.html#tblamp">Table 2</A>).  The lamp
housing has three permanently mounted lamps, and one hole that permits
the easy interchange of additional lamps.  Currently mounted in the
permanent sockets are lamps of <EM> Argon</EM>, <EM> Cesium</EM> and
<EM> Rubidium</EM>.  In the open hole, a <EM> Thorium-Argon</EM> lamp
(with its own voltage supply) can be mounted.  The <EM> flat lamp</EM>
mounting socket also fits in the same hole, and <EM> Neon</EM> and
<EM> Helium-Argon</EM> bulbs can be fitted into this socket.  On the
underside of the lamp housing, a sliding diffuser is mounted.  To
insert the diffuser, push up (in).  It should click into position.
This is used with the flat lamp to help ensure even illumination of
the slit.  The most commonly used comparison lamps currently are the
Th-Ar and the He-Ar.

 <P>Each of the permanently mounted lamps has a switch on the lamp
housing.  There is a mirror in the housing that can be rotated to
select which lamp is reflected onto the slit assembly.  The mirror can
be pulled out (and should be) when using light sources that mount in
the open socket (the flat lamp, the Th-Ar, He-Ar, etc.).  To remove
the mirror from the light path, pull outward on the knob which rotates
the mirror.
  
 <P>The spectrograph has a continuously adjustable <STRONG> slit
</STRONG>, with a minimum slit width of 30&#181;m, and a maximum of
900&#181;m.  Presuming that you are using the f/7.5 secondary, the
plate scale 1.33&#215;10&#175;&#178;''/&#181;m. The
optimum slit width (matched to 2 pixel resolution) is close to 2
arcseconds (150&#181;m) (see <A HREF="tables.html#tbopslit">Table 11</A> 
in the appendix).  We present some typical slit sizes in microns and
arcseconds in <A HREF="tables.html#tbslit">Table 3</A>.
    
 <P>The <STRONG> slit viewer </STRONG> observes an 18 mm diameter
field around the slit.  An intensified CCD camera that can be used to
view the slit is currently being tested out.  This replaces the
eyepiece, and should allow the observer to both acquire objects and
guide on the slit (the ability to guide on the slit is dependent upon
the slit size used).  As it exists now, the camera has no difficulty
reaching tenth magnitude objects (as faint as I have seen tried) and
should be able to image at least as faint as twelfth magnitude for
useful guiding.
  
 <P>The slit length is 30 mm (6'.7) but it can be shortened using
a series of <STRONG>masks</STRONG> or <STRONG>deckers</STRONG>.
The masks typically come in pairs, and there are 10 masks all
together.  Each pair consists of a central mask, and a double mask
positioned outside the central mask.  This permits the observer to
make two non-overlapping exposures on the same image (subject to the
inter-order spacing).  The widths of the masks are given 
<A HREF="tables.html#tbmask">Table 4</A>.  Pulling the mask slide all the
way out (beyond mask position 10) permits the user to view the whole
slit length (or at least the full field of view of the slit viewer
eyepiece).  Which mask you use is dependent upon the wavelength region
you wish to observe.

 <P>The further towards the blue you wish to observe, the more closely
spaced the orders become, thus limiting the length of the slit that
you can effectively use without getting overlap of the orders.  The
cross disperser and camera optics magnify the image of the length of
the slit (see the appendix), just as the echelle grating and camera
optics magnify the slit width (hence the derived optimum slit width).
In <A HREF="fig_iosp.html">Figure 3</A>, 
the distance between the order centers is
plotted, and overlaid upon that are dashed lines showing the length of
the slit as it actually appears on the detector.  For the orders NOT
to overlap, the inter-order spacing must be greated than the image
length.  So, with the 2 mm mask (#7), all the orders redward of order
50 (lambda &gt; 4400&Aring;) should not overlap.  Of course,
you will want to leave some space between the orders, so effectively,
this means that you should not go all the way to order 50.  At
4200&Aring; the maximum slit length for no overlap is 
1 mm = 13''.3 (decker number 8, see the 
<A HREF="fig_masks.html">Figure</A> accompanying 
<A HREF="tables.html#tbmask">Table 4</A> and also 
<A HREF="fig_iosp.html">Figure 3</A> ).

 <P><A NAME="sbccams"><EM>1.2 The Cameras</EM></A>
  
 <P>There are now two cameras available for use with the echelle.  The
first has been recently constructed at University College London, and
is paired with a 1024&#215;1024 CCD detector (either the CCD-Mil
or the CCD-Tek).  We shall refer to this system as the UCL camera.
This is the current default configuration for the echelle.

 <P>The second camera is the original REOSC camera, which is used with
a 512&#215;512 CCD run by a system put together by Photometrics
(CCD-UMass).  We shall call this combined camera and CCD setup the
REOSC camera.
  
 <P><A NAME="sbceff"><EM>1.3 Efficiency and Response</EM></A>

 <P>Be aware that there is a very wide range in response with
wavelength of the system as a whole (including the CCD), and it is
likely that some regions of your spectra will be saturated while
others are barely exposed.  The blaze functions for the first order of
the cross dispersers are shown in the 
<A HREF="fig_blaz.html#fgbl_top">top panel</A> of 
<A HREF="fig_blaz.html#fgblaz">Figure 4</A>, along with the typical blaze

(<A HREF="fig_blaz.html#fgbl_bot">bottom panel</A>).

 <P>To help point out somewhat more the wide dynamic range of the
system as a whole, <A HREF="fig_int.html">Figure 5</A> shows first the
Quantum Efficieny curves for the CCD-Mil and the CCD-Tek

<A HREF="fig_int.html#fgin_pan4">panel 4</A>
shows what the relative output intensities would be.  Note that the
total relative intensities are better than you will actually get,
since we have not included transmission and reflection loss from all
of the rest of the various optical elements.

 <P>How long do you need to integrate to reach a given Signal to
Noise ratio (<EM>S/N</EM>) for a given magnitude?  

<PRE>

     &#215; [QE = e&#175; / photon]
     &#215; [t = integration time in seconds] }
</PRE>
 <P>We can re-write gamma in terms of V magnitudes (lambda = 5556&Aring;) as 
<PRE>
gamma(V) = 948 &#215; 10^{-V/2.5} photons/(cm&#178; s &Aring;) ,
</PRE>
 <P>where the 948 is the number of photons from a star of magnitude V=0.
(Actually, this is the monochromatic flux at 5556&Aring;, but for a
rough estimate it will be close enough.  See Mihalas &amp; Binney, 1981,
Galactic Astronomy, p. 62.)
So,
<PRE>
S/N(lambda) = sqrt{ 948 &#215; 10^(-V/2.5)
                   &#215; epsilon A (Delta x)(QE) t }.

 <P>For the 2 meter telescope at SPM, at 5,000&Aring;, 
A=31416cm&#178;.  With the UCL camera and CCD-Mil chip, 
(Delta_x) = 0.14&Aring;/pixel.
We'll assume that the CCD QE is about 15%,
and that the combined transmission epsilon~6% (this presumes 90%
transmission or reflectance at every optical element and through the
atmosphere, and 40% at each of the gratings).  When combined with the
QE of the CCD this gives a throughput of just under 1%.  So, the
S/N(lambda) will be
<PRE>
S/N(lambda) ~ sqrt{ 39,000 &#215; 10^(-V/2.5) t 
                   &#215; e&#175;/(pixel in echelle dispersion direction)}.
</PRE>
 <P>This is the S/N you should get <EM>after</EM> you sum together the
pixels dispersed in the spatial direction.  For those who cannot do
this, divide this number by the number of pixels in the
cross-disperser direction (let us estimate it at 4 for ease of
illustration) making the S/N(pixel)=1/2&#215;S/N(lambda).

 <P>The example above is probably a bit optimistic. Remember too that the
S/N is also going to depend upon the wavelength, and the spectral
structure of the object under study.  You are advised to take several
spectra of various magnitude objects to get an empirical value for the
constant term in the S/N relations, which are summarized below: (a)
S/N given V and t, (b) t given S/N and V, (c) V limit given t and
S/N.

(<A HREF="#contents">Contents</A>|
<A HREF="#sctproc">Next Section</A>|
<A HREF="#sctcharac">Prev. Section</A>)

 <P>First, don't forget to focus the telescope.

 <P><A NAME="subadjfoc"><EM>2.1 Focusing the Spectrograph</EM></A>

 <P>In addition to focusing the telescope, it is also necessary to make
sure that the spectrograph is focused.  The spectrograph is focused by
moving the collimator using the micrometer on the bottom of the
instrument housing.  The telescope should be pointing at or near the
zenith for focusing.  This procedure can be done fairly rapidly with
two people, and should be done everytime the dewar is removed and
replaced.  We found that once done in the early evening, the focus
would remain ok for the rest of the night.  The smallest line widths
(FWHM) you will realistically be able to achieve are about 2.5 pixels.

 <P>To focus:

<OL>
<LI> Turn on an arc lamp, push in the knob on top of the lamp
housing, and set up a small slit (say about 40&#181;m - the key
point here is really only that the slit be small enough that the CCD
pixel size, not the slit width limits the resolution - see the
appendix and <A HREF="tables.html#tbopslit">Table 11</A>).
  
<LI> Unlock the collimator by loosening the three set screws spaced
around the side of the housing. These should only be finger tight.

<LI> The collimator should now be free to move.  It is moved by
turning the knob of the micrometer found on the bottom of the
instrument housing.  This micrometer can be difficult to turn.

<LI> Take an image, noting the micrometer setting.

<LI> Turn the micrometer 0.5 or 1.0 turns and take another image.

<LI> Repeat (4) and (5) until you have acheived a satisfactory focus.
Be aware that the optimum focus settings may be slightly different for
the red and the blue ends of the spectrum.

<LI> Tighten the set screws by hand when you have a good focus.

</OL>
  
 <P><A NAME="subadjwave"><EM>2.2 Changing the Wavelength Region</EM></A>

 <P>To access different wavelength regions, you will need to rotate
the cross disperser.  On your images, you will see that this causes
motion perpendicular to the dispersion direction of the orders.  The
cross disperser angle is set with a circular micrometer on the lower
side of the instrument housing.  Course adjustment is done by
loosening the right thumb screw and turning the grating holder by
hand.  Fine adjustment is done using the left thumb screw.  The right
hand thumb screw should be tightened before doing fine adjustment.
Using the vernier, you can read the grating tilt angle to one minute
of arc.
 
 <P>Maps of grating angles, blaze wavelengths and visible orders are given
in each of the sections on the two possible camera setups.
  
 <P><A NAME="subadjrot"><EM>2.3 Rotating the Slit</EM></A>

 <P>To rotate the echelle slit, the whole instrument is rotated on the
telescope mounting.  There are two locking knobs and a third knob that
causes the mounting platen to rotate. There is an angle indicator next
to this knob.  Check the value when you begin.  Usually the
spectrograph is mounted with the slit pointing in an east-west
direction.

 <P>There are two reasons you might wish to rotate the slit. The first
and obvious one is to orient the slit in a particular direction on an
extended object.  The second reason is that you may wish to minimize
the differential refraction due to the atmosphere (see paper by
Filippenko, A. 1982, PASP, vol.  94, p.715).  These two objectives are
not usually compatible, and those of you doing intensity measurements
are advised to read Filippenko's paper and see if this will make a big
difference for you.

<A HREF="#sctucl">Next Section</A>|
<A HREF="#sctadju">Prev. Section</A>)
  
 <P><A NAME="sbcbasic"><EM>3.1 How To</EM></A>

 <P>In the course of taking data with the echelle spectrograph, you
will need to know how to take flat and bias frames and arc lamp and
object images.
 
 <P><STRONG> Bias frames </STRONG> are simple and easy to take, and do
not depend upon the settings of the echelle.  Note however, that the
dome should be dark, as the whole system is not totally light tight,
and if you take a bias with bright lights on in the dome, you will
notice a gradient in the bias images (this has been seen with both the
CCD-Mil and the CCD-UMass).  There is also some scattered light in
the system.
 
 <P>When taking <STRONG> flat field </STRONG> images, you have several
options.  You can use the internally mounted flat lamp, which is (I
believe) a tungsten bulb (so the effective temperature of the spectrum
is around 3200&#176;K, see <A HREF="fig_int.html">Figure 5</A>) or you
can take dome flats, which seem to be slightly bluer, but take much
longer to reach the same saturation level (they are fainter by roughly
a factor of 10).  Sky flats have difficulty with solar and atmospheric
lines in the spectrum.  Note that the response of the system, and the
QE of the CCD and the temperature of the typical flat image lamp all
conspire to cause a very wide range in intensity with wavelength, and
you will very likely need exposures of long and short duration to
properly fill the wells in the blue and red respectively.

 <P>The flats are typically used for two things, correcting for the
response of the CCD, and correcting for the blaze functions of the
gratings.  They should be taken with the same instrumental setup up
that your data are taken with.

 <P>To take a flat field using the internal lamp:
<OL>

<LI> Go up to the instrument.  Put the flat lamp into the lamp holder.
Remember to push in the diffuser (the slide is found on the underside
of the lamp housing), and pull out the rotating mirror.  The diffuser
helps to ensure even illumination of the slit.

<LI> Push the knob on top of the lamp housing IN.  This reflects the
lamp light down through the spectrograph slit, and blocks out the
optical path from the telescope.

<LI> Set the desired slit width, and choice of mask.

<LI> Take an <EM> n</EM> second exposure, where <EM> n</EM> is long enough to
mostly fill, but not saturate the image.

</OL>
 
 <P>For images of the <STRONG> comparison lamps </STRONG>, you are
presented with a plethora of possibilities, but the most commonly used
lamps currently are the Thorium-Argon lamp and the Helium-Argon
lamp. (G.  Koenigsberger, G. Canalizo and D. Pe&#241;a have recently
compiled a Th-Ar atlas using this echelle.  In addition, there are
two high resolution line atlases are available for the Th-Ar lamp, one
from the AAT and one from KPNO, and J. Echevarria has compiled a
He-Ar lamp atlas using this echelle.)

 <P>To take a spectrum of a comparison lamp:

<OL>

<LI> Choose the comparison lamp you wish to use, and turn it on.
Remember to rotate the mirror to the proper setting, or to pull it out
if you are using one of the bulbs that mounts in the same holder as
the flat lamp, and if necessary to push in the diffuser.

<LI> Push the knob on top of the lamp housing IN.  This reflects the
lamp light down through the spectrograph slit, and blocks out the
optical path from the telescope.

<LI> Set the desired slit width, and choice of mask.

<LI> Take an <EM> n</EM> second exposure.  Typically for the Thorium-Argon
lamp, a 60 second exposure is long enough to give well defined lines.

</OL>
  
 <P>Now, go find your objects!  For fainter objects, you may well find
it necessary to take several shorter exposures and co-add the images
later, since the number of cosmic rays in a 15 minute exposure is
fairly high.

 <P>To take a spectrum of an astronomical object:

<OL>
<LI> Turn off all the lamps.

<LI> Pull the knob on the lamp housing OUT.

<LI> Set the desired slit width, and choice of mask.

<LI> Take an <EM> n</EM> second exposure.

</OL>

 <P>Depending upon the wavelength region you are working in, you may
need to insert a long pass filter to block out overlap from the second
and third orders of the cross-disperser.  We use the first order of
the cross-disperser to separate the echelle orders.  Second and third
order images also show up on the image plane.  For stellar spectra,
this is not a problem shortward of about 6,500-7,000&Aring;, since the
atmosphere effectively blocks transmission of much of the radiation
short of 3,000&Aring;.  However, if you wish to observe further towards
the red, you will want to have a long pass filter to remove the second
and third order spectra.  For the comparison arcs, technically this is
a problem for all the echelle orders, since you don't have the
atmosphere to cut out the violet, though the first order is
substantially brighter than the second and third orders.

 <P>While we do not currently have an optical quality long pass
filter, some tests have already been made with a photographic wratten
filter placed in a temporary mounting behind the slit assembly.
 
 <P><A NAME="sbcstand"><EM>3.2 Taking Standard Star Spectra</EM></A>

 <P>For absolute flux calibration, you will need standard star
spectra.  The spectrophotometric standards given by P.  Massey,
K. Strobel, J. Barnes and E. Anderson (1988, ApJ, 328, 315) are
available on line in IRAF, along with several other sets of
spectrophotometric standards.  When in IRAF, type ``<CODE>page
onedstds$README</CODE>'' to see a listing of the standards.  Copies of
the finder charts for the Massey et. al.  standards should be in the

 <P>The <STRONG> UCL camera </STRONG> was recently constructed at
University College London to replace the original REOSC camera.  First
observations with the new camera were done in the fall of 1993.  The
camera has a focal length of 215.6 mm.  This camera is used with the
CCD-Mil (see section <A HREF="#sbcccdmil">6.1</A>) and the
CCD-Tek (see section <A HREF="#sbcccdtek">6.2</A>).

 <P>This camera setup is capable of observing between 3,000&Aring; and
11,000&Aring;, though not all at once.  For orders 74 through 34 (the
blue end from about 3,000&Aring; to about 6,700&Aring;, including
Halpha in order 34, Hbeta; in order 46, Hgamma in order 52, and
Hdelta) the CCD can be set to cover the complete free spectral range.
For wavelengths longer than about 6,700&Aring; (orders 33 through 20),
the percentage of coverage steadily decrease until in order 20, only
about 5/8 of the free spectral range is on the chip.  According to
J. Echevarria, it is possible to cover the entire range from
3,000&Aring; to 11,000&Aring; in three or four overlapping frames:
Orders 74 through 41, 40 through 27 and 26 through 20.  To observe
redder than Halpha, it is necessary to insert a filter to cut out the
overlap from the second and third orders.

 <P><A NAME="sbcuclmaps"><EM>4.2 Positioning the Spectrum</EM></A>

 <P>To determine what portion of the spectrum is imaged onto the CCD,
you can rotate the cross-disperser using the rotating micrometer on the
side of the echelle housing.  See <A HREF="tables.html#tbuclpos">Table 5</A> 
for a list of which wavelength regions are imaged onto the CCD at

 <P><A NAME="sbcreocam"><EM>5.1 REOSC Camera Specifications</EM></A>
 
 <P>The <STRONG> REOSC camera </STRONG> has a focal length of 204 mm,
and is constructed of a spherical plate mirror with a double lens
afocal correcting plate and a field lens.  It has a flat field of
8&#176; &#215; 5&#176;2 with an f/1.4 focal ratio.  The blur circle
is less than 15&#181;m\ for every wavelength in the whole field.  The
central wavelengths of the orders are given in 
<A HREF="tables.html#tbreoord">Table 8</A>.  
Because of the short focal length of the
camera, it is necessary to guide the light from the focal plane to the
CCD using a fiber optic bundle.  The only CCD equipped with the
necessary fiber bundle is the CCD-UMass 
(see section <A HREF="#sbcccdumass">6.3</A>).  
The CCD is not quite large
enough to encompass the whole free spectral range of most of the
orders, so provision is made for moving the CCD mounting stage.
Details of how to do this are given below.
  
 <P><A NAME="sbcreomaps"><EM>5.2 Positioning the Spectrum</EM></A>

 <P>To determine what portion of the spectrum is imaged onto the CCD,

 <P><A NAME="sbcstage"><EM>5.3 Moving the Focal Plane Stage</EM></A>
  
 <P>Because CCD-UMass is not big enough to capture overlapping
orders, it is possible to move the stage that the CCD is mounted on
roughly parallel to the echelle dispersion direction.  This is
accomplished using the micrometer mounted on the left hand side of the
dewar (when facing the instrument from the dewar side).  Move so that
the micrometer is directly in front of you.  To move the stage, you
first loosen the two brass colored bolts on the left and right sides
just below the stage.  Now, you can move the stage by turning the
micrometer.  This micrometer is calibrated in inches, not meters.
Attached to the micrometer is a digital readout that can be zeroed at
any position.  This makes it easy to change back and forth between
stage positions.  When you are done moving the stage, don't forget to
tighten the locking nuts.

 <P>A note before we begin: the gain factor and CGAIN are NOT the same
thing.  The gain factor (f) is just that, the ratio of the number of
electrons/ADU relative to the number of electrons/ADU when the A/D
converter's range equals the full well depth.  Hence, a gain of 1
implies that the A/D converter should saturate when the CCD's wells
fill.  A gain factor of 2 implies that the A/D converter saturates at
half the well depth etc.  The CGAIN that many of the control programs
use is a holdover from the Photometrics control systems.  CGAIN is
related to the gain, typically by a formula like 
<PRE>
CGAIN = C_1 &#215; (f - 1) + C_2
</PRE>
 <P>where the constants C_1 and C_2 vary depending upon the CCD and

11 (see IA-UNAM Technical Report #102). 

 <P><A NAME="sbcccdmil"><EM>6.1 The CCD-Mil</EM></A>

 <P>According to Photometrics, the well depth is 173,000 electrons,
and the A/D converter has a range from 0 to 2^14-1 = 16,383,
meaning that the A/D conversion factor is 10.6 e&#175;/ADU
at a gain of 1.  The readout noise is 5.71 electrons.  The normal

(See the Photometrics specifications for this chip as well as IA-UNAM
Technical Reports # 97 and # 102 for more information.)

 <P>The constants for conversion from gain factor (f) to CGAIN are
C_1 = 15 and C_2 = 11 for this chip.  Note though that as it is
implemented in the <CODE>elmil</CODE> control program, C_2 = 0, so
that a gain factor of 1 is entered as CGAIN=0 and a gain
factor of 5 is entered as CGAIN=60.

use 512&#215;512.  The CCD wells are 250,000 electrons deep, and
the A/D converter has a dynamic range from 0 to 2^14-1 = 16,383
ADU's.  Readout noise is between 7 and 12 electrons/pixel rms, and the
unit gain (with CGAIN=0) is 15 e&#175;/ADU (IA-UNAM Technical
Report #102).

 <P>A fiber optic bundle is cemented to the face of the chip.  This
bundle is made up of 5&#181;m fibers in roughly hexagonal sheaves.
The operating temperature range is -90&#176;C to -130&#176;C, with
typical temperatures being -101&#176;C and -110&#176;C.  If the dewar
is filled at the beginning of the night, the charge will normally last
all night.  Once the temperature of the CCD system stabilizes, the
temperature probably won't vary by more than than 0.1&#176;C over the
course of the night.
  
 <P>The gain conversion factors for this CCD are C_1 = 30 and C_2 = 0.

 <P><A NAME="subsubbas">6.3.1 Basic Operation</A>
  
 <P>The computer control for the CCD-UMass system is a Heurikon
Systems computer running a system V version of the Unix operating
system.  The CCD control software is called <EM> ccd_oan</EM>, and is a
FORTH interpreter written in C.  Usually you will find the Heurikon up
and running, but just in case, we now tell you how to <STRONG>
(re-)boot </STRONG> the computer (see IA-UNAM Technical Report #61
for more details).
  
<OL>

<LI> Turn on the power to the computer. The switch is on the front of
the box that says Photometrics 3000.  Turn on the HDS terminal (this
is the computer console).

<LI> When the ``&gt;'' prompt appears, type ``bw &lt;return&gt;''.  This
begins the boot-strap process.

<LI> After several messages, the computer will say ``Standalone
boot''.  At the ``:'' prompt, type ``&lt;return&gt;''.

<LI> Several more messages will scroll by, and then the computer will
prompt you with ``type return to start at 0x100''.  You type
``&lt;return&gt;''.

<LI> Finally, the basic unix system will be up and running in single
user mode, and the system will say ``Welcome to UNIX System (7a)'' and
display a ``#'' prompt.  At this point, you should type ``init 2''.
This will tell the system to initialize multi-user mode.

<LI> The computer will next ask if you wish it to check the file
system.  You should answer ``y&lt;return&gt;'', unless you know for
sure that the file system is ok and uncorrupted.  The checking should
take no more than 3 to 5 minutes.

<LI> Presuming all has gone well, the next prompt you receive will be
a standard UNIX login prompt, ``login:''.  Log on as ``ccd'' (no
password).  Congrats, the computer is now up, and ready to run the CCD
control program.

<LI> Type ``ccd_oan'' to start up the FORTH interpreter that controls
the CCD.

</OL>
   
 <P>Since you know how to start the computer, you should also know how
to shut it off (in case the power goes out for example).  <STRONG>
Shut down </STRONG> is a much simpler procedure.
  
<OL>
<LI> If you are in ``ccd_oan'', type ``quit'' to exit.

<LI> At the UNIX prompt ``%'' type ``su &lt;return&gt;''.  This will
log you in as the root user.  You will now have the access necessary
to shut down the computer gracefully.

<LI> At the UNIX prompt ``#'', type ``sync &lt;return&gt;''.  Now, type
it again.

<LI> You should now turn off the power on the computer box labeled
Photometrics 3000, then the power to the HDS terminal and the Cabel
graphics terminal, and finally the power on the tape drive.
  
</OL>

 <P>CCD control commands are listed in the Photometrics 3000 Users
Manual, but for convenience, we list a few of the most commonly used
ones.

<DL>
<DT> <EM>bias</EM> <DD> This takes a bias frame.

<DT> <EM>cisc</EM> <DD> This starts up the cycle that continuously
clears the CCD.

<DT> <EM>obs n</EM> <DD> This takes an exposure of <EM> n</EM>
deciseconds duration.  <STRONG> N.B.: DO NOT type cisc during an
observation!!!</STRONG> Doing so will cause the control program to
lock-up, and the only apparent solution is to re-boot the computer.

<DT> <EM>pcol n</EM> <DD> Plot column <EM> n</EM> of the current
image.

<DT> <EM>prow n</EM> <DD> Plot row <EM> n</EM> of the current image.

<DT> <EM>qshow</EM> <DD> This displays an image on the image display.

</DL>

 <P>N.B.: If you will be saving full frame images to disk, there is
only enough space on the disk for about 50 images, so plan ahead.
Also, while the software makes no mention of it, the Heurikon only has
enough RAM to hold 6-7 images in memory at one time.

 <P><HR><P>
<A NAME="sctcaveat"><STRONG>7. General Caveats</STRONG></A>
(<A HREF="#contents">Contents</A>|
<A HREF="#sctoptics">Next Section</A>|
<A HREF="#sctdetec">Prev. Section</A>)
   
 <P>a) light leak - with the dome lights on, or the slit open during the
day, you will notice a gradient in the bias frames.  This should go
away pretty much as soon as the lights go out.  It may take several
minutes, and you should probably do a cisc on CCD-UMass to flush the
chip wells.  The bias should be very flat, typically at about 310 ADU.
On the CCD-Mil, try taking a series of bias frames to acheive the same
objective (since there doesn't appear to be a cisc equivalent).
  
 <P>b) dome slit openings - It is not possible to have  
the whole slit open.  There are 3 possible configurations: 2 doors  
down, which cuts off the lower 40 degrees (roughly); 2 doors up, which  
cuts off about 30 degrees from the zenith; and 1 up and 1 down.  It  
takes about 10 minutes to change between door configurations.  
  
 <P>c) high humidity - If the humidity climbs above about 70%,  
condensation begins to form on the face of the fiber bundle that is  
cemented to the CCD-UMass.  This is a time variable phenomenon that can be  
very noticeable.  The face should be cleaned every few hours when this  
happens.  Also be aware that under current observatory operating  
procedure, the telescope will not be opened if the humidity reaches  
85%.  
  
 <P>d) tape drive troubles - The 9 track on the Heurikon  
is <EM> very</EM> finicky about loading tapes.  The only apparent solution  
(short of a serial link or new tape drive) is persistence.  The  
Exabytes on the Suns need to be cleaned on a regular basis.  

 <P>e) warning about the clock settings - (i) on the HEURIKON: The
clock on the Heurikon can be set by the user (when logged in as root).
Except for the short period between old and new change over dates to
daylight savings time, the clock should be displaying Pacific time.
The Heurikon actually stores time in UT internally.  If the time gets
re-set improperly, it will affect the UT that gets written into your
FITS image headers by wfits when it writes the images to tape.  (ii)
on the SUN: The date and time can be set only by the root user.  The
times written into your FITS images by <CODE>elmil</CODE> and/or IRAF
will use the system time so make sure it is right.  Be aware that the
clocks on the computers can drift by up to several seconds per day.
There is a WWV receiver up in the telescope console room.

<A HREF="#sctcaveat">Prev. Section</A>)

 <P>If the set-ups change, or you just feel like checking the numbers
given in the tables, we provide for your convenience a few of the more
important equations relating to gratings.  A few definitions first:

<UL>
<LI> <EM>f_cam</EM> is the focal length of the camera.
<LI> <EM>f_col</EM> is the focal length of the spectrograph collimator.
<LI> <EM>g</EM> is the number of grooves per millimeter.
<LI> <EM>m</EM> is the spectral order (and is an integer).
<LI> <EM>x</EM> is the position on the detector measured with respect to
the position of the blaze wavelength.  tan(psi) = x/f_cam.
<LI> <EM>alpha</EM> is the angle of incidence with respect to the grating 
normal.
<LI> <EM>beta_0</EM> is the angle of diffraction of the blaze wavelength
of the order.  beta_0 = 2 theta_B - alpha.
<LI> <EM>beta</EM> is the angle of diffraction with respect to the
grating normal.  beta = beta_0 + psi.
<LI> <EM>theta_B</EM> is the blaze angle of the grating.
<LI> <EM>lambda</EM> is the wavelength in angstroms.
<LI> <EM>psi</EM> is the angle of diffraction away from the angle of
diffraction of the blaze wavelength (ie, psi is an angle away from
beta_0).
</UL>

 <P>We define the blaze angle to be positive, and any angle on the
same side of the grating normal is also positive.  Any angle on the
opposite side of the grating normal is negative 
(see <A HREF="fig_angl.html#fgangl">Figure 8</A>).

 <P> In the terms defined above, the <EM> grating equation</EM> is written
<PRE>
lambda [&Aring;] = [10^7 &Aring;/mm] {sin(alpha) + sin(beta)} / (g m).
</PRE>
 <P>The blaze wavelength of an order m is given by the grating equation
when psi = 0, so beta = beta_0 = 2theta_B - alpha.  The
position on the detector (with respect to the position of the blaze
wavelength) of any wavelength in the order $m$ can be found by solving
the grating equation for psi and thence x, and works out to be
<PRE>
                           / g m lambda              \
x[mm] = f_cam tan { arcsin | ----------- - sin(alpha)| - (2theta_B - alpha) }.
                           \ 10^7 [&Aring;/mm]             /
</PRE>

 <P>The <EM> linear dispersion</EM> can be derived by differentiating the
grating equation with respect to beta and using the chain rule to
work out the derivative with respect to x
<PRE>
dlambda/dx [&Aring;/mm] = [10^7 &Aring;/mm] {cos(beta)} / (g m f_cam).
</PRE>

 <P>The free spectral range (FSR) of each order (m) is given by
<PRE>
FSR = lambda_blaze / m.
</PRE>

 <P>For this echelle, for the main grating, as pointed out previously, 
g=79 lines/mm, theta_B = 63&#176;433, and
alpha = 71&#176;, so
<PRE>
lambda_blaze [&Aring;] = (2.244615 &#215; 10^5) / m
</PRE>
and
<PRE>
dlambda_blaze/dx [&Aring;/mm] = (7.10291 &#215; 10^4) / (m &#215; f_cam [mm])
</PRE>
 <P>where f_cam = 215.6 mm for the UCL camera and
f_cam = 204 mm for the REOSC camera.

 <P>The intensity in each order relative to that of the blaze wavelength
can be described very roughly by
<PRE>
I(beta) is proportional to sin&#178;(A) / (A&#178;),
</PRE>
where
<PRE>
A = m pi { cos(theta_B) - sin(theta_B)/tan((alpha + beta)/2) }.
</PRE>
Again inverting the grating equation, we can write
<PRE>
beta = arcsin{(g m lambda) / [10^7 &Aring;/mm] - sin(alpha)},
</PRE>
 <P>and hence compute I as a function of wavelength.  Within the
echelle, remember that the spectrum is actually the product of two
diffraction gratings, and hence both will affect the final intensity.
(See D. Gray, 1976, The Observation and Analysis of Stellar
Photospheres, chapter 3 for more on this, as well as the references
noted with it in the references section.)

 <P>Finally, it is often pointed out that aspects other than the
diffraction limit of the telescope optics dictate the optimal slit
width.  The telescope diffraction limit is roughly 1.22&#215;lambda/D,
where D is the diameter of the objective (for the 2 meter telescope,
at 5,000&Aring;, this is ~ 1/20'').  The internal optics of
the spectrograph will magnify the image of the slit on the detector
plane, where the resolution is fixed by the pixel size, so the optimal
slit is that slit which lets in as much light as possible, while the
slit image is no wider than one pixel (roughly).  If we have a pure,
monochromatic beam of light illuminating the entrance aperture, which
has a width w [mm], then the angular size of the image of that
aperture on the detector is obtained from the derivative of the
grating equation with respect to alpha taken over a finite but
small angle
<PRE>
Delta_beta = {-cos(alpha)/cos(beta)}&#215; Delta_alpha.
</PRE>
 <P>To convert to linear measures on the detector (Delta x) and on the
telescope focal plane (w) respectively, 
<PRE>
Delta_beta ~ Delta_x[mm] / f_cam[mm], 
</PRE>
and 
<PRE>
Delta_alpha = arctan (w/f_col) ~ w[mm]/f_col[mm].  
</PRE>
Putting it all together,
<PRE>
w[mm] = {cos(beta)/cos(alpha)} &#215; {f_col/f_cam} &#215; {Delta x[mm]}.
</PRE>
 <P>For the echelle and camera combinations we have, we find the
theoretical optimal slit sizes given in 
<A HREF="tables.html#tbopslit">Table 11</A>.
(The focal length of the collimator is 720 mm.)  Note that the optimal
slit width is close to what the typical seeing is at the 2 meter.

 <P>Este documento contiene la primera versi&oacute;n del Manual de
Observaci&oacute;n de la C&aacute;mara Infrarroja ``CAMILA'',
construida en el IAUNAM para observaciones en imagen directa en el
infrarrojo cercano. Se pretende distribuir a los observadores con
CAMILA como una versi&oacute;n de trabajo. Esperamos recibir
sugerencias, comentarios y adiciones para producir una versi&oacute;n
enriquecida y m&aacute;s definitiva posteriormente.

 <P>El sistema ``CAMILA'' est&aacute; centrado en un detector NICMOS 3
de 256&#215;256 pixeles sensible en el intervalo de longitud de onda
de 1 a 2.5 &#181;m. Cuenta con un carrusel de 12 filtros motorizados y
un diafragma fr&iacute;o que reduce la radiaci&oacute;n de fondo. El
sistema &oacute;ptico consiste b&aacute;sicamente de una montura con
un espejo y un reductor focal y est&aacute; dise&#241;ado para el
secundario f/13.5 del telescopio de 2.1 m del OAN/SPM. En este
telescopio la escala de placa es de 0.48 "/pixel, la cual nos da un
campo de observaci&oacute;n de 123"&#215;123".  Adem&aacute;s de los 3
filtros de banda ancha: J, H y K', se cuenta con filtros de
interferencia para l&iacute;neas de He I, H I (Pa beta, Pa gamma y Br
gamma), [Fe II], H_2, CO y cK. La magnitud l&iacute;mite (5 sigma) del
sistema es K'=16, H=17 y J=17.6, en 1 min de integraci&oacute;n.

 <P><A NAME="contenido"><EM>1.1 Contenido</EM></A><BR>

 <P>En este trabajo se presenta el Manual de Observaci&oacute;n para
los usuarios de la C&aacute;mara Directa IR ``CAMILA''. Para una
descripci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica detallada, referimos al lector a los
distintos reportes t&eacute;cnicos (ver <A HREF="#apenda">Anexo A</A>,
donde se presenta la lista).

 <P>Para el lector interesado en detectores e instrumentaci&oacute;n
IR actual, los referimos a McLean (1993).

 <P>El texto est&aacute; dividido en 7 cap&iacute;tulos, que contienen
informaci&oacute;n acerca del proyecto y configuraci&oacute;n del
sistema, las caracter&iacute;sticas de la c&aacute;mara directa para
el intervalo de 1 a 2.5&#181;m, el procedimiento de instalaci&oacute;n
en telescopio, una descripci&oacute;n de los programas de
observaci&oacute;n y finalmente, se mencionan algunas t&eacute;cnicas
de observaci&oacute;n en el IR. En el <A HREF="#comentarios">Cap.
6</A> se presentan algunos comentarios finales. Al final, se presentan
una serie de ap&eacute;ndices que contienen informaci&oacute;n
importante: las publicaciones de CAMILA (<A
HREF="#apenda">Ap&eacute;ndice A</A>), las curvas de
transmisi&oacute;n de los filtros disponibles (<A
HREF="#apendb">Ap&eacute;ndice B</A>), copia del trabajo de
McCaughrean sobre t&eacute;cnicas de reducci&oacute;n y
an&aacute;lisis IR (<A HREF="#apendc">Ap&eacute;ndice C</A>),
Estrellas Est&aacute;ndares (<A HREF="#apendd">Ap&eacute;ndice D</A>)
y la forma de bit&aacute;cora (<A HREF="#apende">Ap&eacute;ndice
E</A>).

 <P>Dado que el proyecto CAMILA ha sido una colaboraci&oacute;n de
grupos del Instituto de Astronom&iacute;a, UNAM (IAUNAM) y del Five
College Astronomy Department de la Universidad de Massachusetts (FCAD,
UMass), cabe aclarar aqu&iacute; que la parte mec&aacute;nica de la
botella criog&eacute;nica y el mecanismo de movimiento de filtros
fueron construidos en el Laboratorio IR del FCAD en UMass y es un
dise&#241;o de M. Skrutskie. Por otro lado, la parte
electr&oacute;nica del cri&oacute;stato, la disposici&oacute;n de las
partes en el &aacute;rea de trabajo, el funcionamiento del
cri&oacute;stato y el detector NICMOS 3, el sistema de
adquisici&oacute;n y los programas son trabajo realizado en el IAUNAM.

 
 <P><A NAME="descrip"><EM>1.2 Descripci&oacute;n General</EM></A><BR>

 <P>La configuraci&oacute;n inicial del sistema ha sido
b&aacute;sicamente concluida y consiste de las siguientes componentes:

<OL>
<LI> Celda Criog&eacute;nica: Detector, Carrusel de Filtros
<LI> Montura para Imagen Directa
<LI> Generador de Se&#241;ales para el Manejo y Lectura del Detector  
<LI> Amplificador, Integrador y Convertidor A/D  
<LI> Tarjeta Interfaz-PC
<LI> Sistema de Adquisici&oacute;n: Computadoras, Modos de Lectura y Programas

</OL>

 <P>En la <A HREF="#figuras">Figura 1</A> se presenta el diagrama
general de bloques del sistema completo y en la <A
HREF="#figuras">Figura 2</A> se presenta 2 fotograf&iacute;as del
sistema CAMARA / ESPECTROGRAFO INFRARROJO: ``CAMILA'' instalado en
telescopio. En la <A HREF="#figuras">Fig. 2a</A> se presenta a
CAMILA en modo de IMAGEN DIRECTA, ya concluido y parte de la
instrumentaci&oacute;n del OAN/SPM, mientras que en la <A
HREF="#figuras">Fig. 2b</A> se presenta a CAMILA en modo de
ESPECTROGRAFO IR, a&uacute;n en etapa de desarrollo y por ser liberado
al OAN una vez concluido.

 <P>El diagrama general de bloques del sistema completo presentado
esquem&aacute;ticamente en la <A HREF="#figuras">Fig. 1</A>, muestra
lo siguiente: a) las 4 computadoras que controlan el sistema (1
microcontrolador, 2 PCs 486 y una estaci&oacute;n de trabajo) , b) la
electr&oacute;nica de control y adquisici&oacute;n de im&aacute;genes,
c) el cri&oacute;stato que aloja al detector y d) la montura del
sistema en la platina del telescopio.

 <P>El detector est&aacute; localizado dentro de una celda
criog&eacute;nica de nitr&oacute;geno l&iacute;quido (N2L) a 77K.  El
NICMOS 3 est&aacute; montado en un plano ortogonal al eje del
cri&oacute;stato (<EM>side-looker</EM>) sobre un circuito impreso que
contiene elementos el&eacute;ctricos para el filtrado y desacople
requeridos para un desempe&#241;o de bajo ruido. Alrededor del
detector rota un carrusel que contiene 12 filtros, controlado desde el
exterior mediante un motor de pasos.  Montada en la parte posterior
del cri&oacute;stato se encuentra una tarjeta electr&oacute;nica que
contiene los circuitos electr&oacute;nicos que interactuan
directamente con el detector, y se encuentra blindada dentro de una
caja met&aacute;lica (mochila de CAMILA). Esta tarjeta contiene 4
canales de procesamiento anal&oacute;gico-digital, potenciales de
alimentaci&oacute;n-referencia e impulsores (<EM>buffers</EM>) para
acondicionar las se&#241;ales digitales de control.  El
microcontrolador simula un generador de se&#241;ales completamente
programable que define los modos de borrado, integraci&oacute;n y
lectura de las im&aacute;genes. Este generador y las fuentes de poder
lineales (bajo ruido) se encuentran en un solo gabinete el cual se
coloca en la platina del telescopio. Las se&#241;ales de los
convertidores son transmitidas desde la tarjeta electr&oacute;nica via
RS422 hasta una interfaz con la computadora PC-Camila, que se encarga
de almacenar y procesar preliminarmente los datos. La interfaz recibe
los datos seriales de los 4 cuadrantes simult&aacute;neamente, los
convierte en paralelo y los almacena temporalmente en memoria. La
PC-Camila est&aacute; conectada tambi&eacute;n con el microcontrolador
via RS232 y carga en &eacute;ste el programa operativo del
detector. La adquisici&oacute;n final de datos y el control general
del instrumento son realizados por una estaci&oacute;n de trabajo SUN
via un enlace ethernet con la PC-Camila. La programaci&oacute;n
est&aacute; basada en la plataforma IRAF a la cual se han agregado
programas especiales, particulares de la observaci&oacute;n en el
infrarrojo, proporcionando distintos modos de lectura y linealizando
las im&aacute;genes en tiempo real. Dado que la observaci&oacute;n en
el IR requiere de movimientos especiales del telescopio, se ha
incorporado a la programaci&oacute;n de CAMILA, el control de
movimiento del telescopio de 2.1 m del OAN/SPM, el cual es actualmente
realizado por la PC-2metros via ethernet.

 <P><A NAME="detector"><EM>1.3 Detector NICMOS 3</EM></A><BR>
 
 <P>La parte medular del dise&#241;o de CAMILA fue realizada alrededor
de un detector NICMOS 3 de HgCdTe, desarrollado por Rockwell Inc. en
Estados Unidos. El detector montado actualmente tiene calidad
cient&iacute;fica y ha sido uno de los mejores detectores producidos
por Rockwell. Las caracter&iacute;sticas generales se muestran en la
<A HREF="camila_tables.html#t1">Tabla 1</A>.

 <P>En la <A HREF="#figuras">Figura 3</A> se presenta una
fotograf&iacute;a del detector (<A HREF="#figuras">Fig. 3a</A>) y una
imagen de los pixeles malos del detector NICMOS 3 de calidad
cient&iacute;fica de CAMILA (<A HREF="#figuras">Fig. 3b</A>). El
detector proporcionado por Rockwell Inc. es de muy alta calidad y
contiene un n&uacute;mero peque&#241;o de pixeles malos y defectos,
que son f&aacute;cilmente corregibles en el proceso de
reducci&oacute;n de las im&aacute;genes.

<A HREF="#">Next Section</A>|
<A HREF="#introduccion">Prev. Section</A>)

<P><A NAME="imagen"><EM>2.1 Imagen Directa y Espectroscop&iacute;a</EM></A><BR>

 <P>En el diagrama de CAMILA (<A HREF="#figuras">Fig. 1</A>) se
muestra esquem&aacute;ticamente que el cri&oacute;stato puede ser
acoplado a dos monturas (ver <A HREF="#figuras">Fig. 2</A>).  Estas
dos monturas son utilizadas para los dos modos de operaci&oacute;n del
sistema: <STRONG>imagen directa</STRONG> y
<STRONG>espectroscop&iacute;a</STRONG>.


 <P>La primera montura es relativamente simple y es utilizada
exclusivamente en el modo de imagen directa. As&iacute;, es posible
realizar observaciones fotom&eacute;tricas en el infrarrojo cercano
utilizando una serie de filtros en las bandas IR de 1 a 2.5
&#181;m. Consiste b&aacute;sicamente de una estructura mec&aacute;nica
con componentes &oacute;pticas que reenfocan el plano focal del
telescopio sobre el detector y se acopla mediante una cubeta extensora
directamente a la platina del telescopio. En la siguiente
secci&oacute;n se describen las especificaciones de su dise&#241;o. El
sistema de imagen directa ha sido probado exitosamente por el grupo
que lo desarroll&oacute;, est&aacute; ya en una etapa de
operaci&oacute;n cotidiana y confiable y ya ha sido entregado al
IAUNAM como un instrumento del OAN/SPM.


 <P>La segunda montura es m&aacute;s compleja, ya que consiste de un
banco &oacute;ptico que tiene integradas componentes &oacute;pticas
controladas por computadora en plataformas m&oacute;viles que permiten
utilizar al detector en dos modos: c&aacute;mara directa (con dos
razones focales diferentes f/13.5 y f/4.5) y espectroscop&iacute;a
(baja y alta resoluci&oacute;n). El espectr&oacute;grafo se encuentra
en sus &uacute;ltimas etapas de construcci&oacute;n y desarrollo, por
los detalles de su montura se describir&aacute;n en el reporte
t&eacute;cnico correspondiente y ser&aacute; entregado al OAN en un
futuro cercano.


 <P><A NAME="reductor"><EM>2.2 Reductor Focal</EM></A><BR>

 <P>Para realizar observaciones en modo de imagen directa se
dise&#241;&oacute; una montura relativamente sencilla que se acopla,
mediante una cubeta extensora, directamente a la platina del
telescopio. En esta montura se coloca la botella criog&eacute;nica
sobre una brida de tefl&oacute;n que aisla el&eacute;ctricamente. El
dise&#241;o de esta montura se presenta en las <A
HREF="#figuras">Figuras 4</A> (diagrama mec&aacute;nico) y <A
HREF="#figuras">5</A> (diagrama &oacute;ptico). En la <A
HREF="#figuras">Figura 5</A> puede 
verse que el haz del telescopio incide en un espejo colocado a
45&#176; para despues incidir en un doblete de ZnS/ZnSe que actua como
un reductor focal 2:1 y reenfoca el plano focal del telescopio sobre
el detector. Es importante hacer notar que con el objeto de reducir
radiaci&oacute;n de luz par&aacute;sita de fondo es necesario utilizar
una pupila fr&iacute;a (o Lyott stop) de 7 mm de di&aacute;metro, que
se coloca en la parte externa del carrusel de filtros, cuando se
utilize el doblete para observar en imagen directa. Esta pupila es
sobre todo importante en las longitudes de onda mayores donde la
radiaci&oacute;n de fondo en el IR es mayor, ya que tanto el
telescopio como muchas de las componentes rad&iacute;an en el IR
cercano.

 <P>El dise&#241;o &oacute;ptico del reductor focal o doblete fue
realizado con el software Zemax y ha sido optimizado para el
secundario f/13.5 del telescopio de 2.1 m del OAN/SPM.  En la <A HREF="#figuras">Figura 6</A>
se presenta un diagrama de rayos del camino &oacute;ptico del
telescopio al detector.  El dise&#241;o del doblete fue enviado a
Janos Technology Inc. en Estados Unidos, para su manufactura y
recubrimiento con capas anti reflectora. El doblete fue colocado en un
barril protector, despu&eacute;s de alinear cada lente y no debe
removersge de la montura de CAMILA para no perder la alineaci&oacute;n
&oacute;ptica.  Para alinear el haz del telescopio con el doblete se
utiliza un peque&#241;o laser y una montura en forma de cruz y dos
tornillos que realizan un movimiento tip/tilt del espejo a
45&#176;. Los detalles de este procedimiento se encuentran m&aacute;s
adelante (<A HREF="#montura">Sec. 3.7.1</A>).  Es importante aclarar
que la montura en directa de CAMILA permite ajustes para distintas
razones focales siempre y cuando sean cercanas a f/13.5, y por tanto
podr&iacute;a ser utilizada en los 3 telescopios del OAN/SPM.


 <P><A NAME="escala">
    <EM>2.3 Escala de Placa y Campo de Observaci&oacute;n</EM></A><BR>

 <P>Para imagen directa con CAMILA la <STRONG>escala de placa</STRONG>
en el telescopio de 2.1m del OAN/SPM con el secundario f/13.5 y el
doblete descrito arriba, es de <STRONG>0.48 "/pixel</STRONG> la cual
nos da un <STRONG>campo de observaci&oacute;n de
123"&#215;123"</STRONG>.

 <P>En la pantalla de la SUN se ver&aacute; desplegada la imagen
observada con el Norte arriba y el Este a la derecha, esto es si
CAMILA est&aacute; montada del lado Norte de la platina.  El detector
est&aacute; dividido en 4 cuadrantes de 128&#215;128 pixeles
localizados as&iacute; en la pantalla: cuadrante 1 est&aacute;
abajo-izq., el 2 abajo-der., el 3 arriba-der y el 4 arriba-izq.

 <P><A NAME="ruido">
    <EM>2.4 Ruido del Sistema y Magnitud L&iacute;mite</EM></A><BR>

 <P>Los resultados de las pruebas observacionales del instrumento,
realizadas en el telescopio de 2.1 m. del Observatorio
Astron&oacute;mico Nacional, en San Pedro M&aacute;rtir, B.C.,
M&eacute;xico con el secundario f/13.5, durante el per&iacute;odo
Oct-Dic de 1993, relativas al desempe&#241;o de la electr&oacute;nica
y la sensibilidad se presentan en las Tablas <A
HREF="camila_tables.html#t2">2</A> y
<A HREF="camila_tables.html#t3">3</A>, respectivamente.

 <P>Las magnitudes l&iacute;mite de CAMILA son similares a las
obtenidas con c&aacute;maras IR basadas en un NICMOS 3 (ej. ESO:
Moorwood et al. 1992; CFHT: Simons 1993).


 <P> IMPORTANTE: Se recomienda nunca exponer el detector de CAMILA en
objetos m&aacute;s brillantes que magnitud V=5 puesto que el detector
se satura. Adem&aacute;s, una vez expuesta la c&aacute;mara en objetos
brillantes, las im&aacute;genes subsecuentes contendr&aacute;n un
residuo en las zonas saturadas que se ir&aacute; quitando con las
integraciones, pero que es dif&iacute;cil de eliminar en la
reducci&oacute;n.


 <P><A NAME="pixeles"><EM>2.5 Pixeles Malos</EM></A><BR>

 <P>En el directorio de trabajo existe un archivo llamado badpix.ls
con una lista de los pixeles malos del detector montado en CAMILA. La
imagen presentada en la <A HREF="#figuras">Figura 3b</A>, representa los pixeles malos en el
detector actualmente montado en el sistema.

 <P><A NAME="filtros"><EM>2.6 Filtros</EM></A><BR>

 <P>El sistema cuenta con un carrusel con 12 filtros, uno de los
cuales opera como obturador. En la <A HREF="#figuras">Figura 7</A> se
muestra una fotograf&iacute;a del carrusel. En la <A
HREF="camila_tables.html#t4">Tabla 4</A> se muestran las
caracter&iacute;sticas de los filtros montados en el carrusel:
n&uacute;mero de filtro, posici&oacute;n en el motor de pasos, filtro,
longitud de onda central (lambda), ancho del filtro (Delta lambda) y
ruido de fondo (en conteos por segundo) obtenido en cada filtro con el
reductor focal. Las curvas de transmisi&oacute;n espectral de los
filtros disponibles para CAMILA se presentan en el <A
HREF="#apendb">Ap&eacute;ndice B</A>.

 <P>El posicionamiento de los filtros dentro de la botella puede ser
realizado manualmente, teniendo precauci&oacute;n de desconectar antes
el <STRONG>motor de pasos</STRONG>, por medio de una perilla, &oacute;
<STRONG>preferentemente autom&aacute;ticamente</STRONG>, a
trav&eacute;s de una instrucci&oacute;n enviada al microcontrolador
desde el programa <STRONG>camila</STRONG> que se describe m&aacute;s
adelante. En ambos casos, la posici&oacute;n absoluta del carrusel
puede ser leida directamente por medio de un cuenta vueltas ubicado
junto al motor en el exterior de la botella. Una vez definida la
posici&oacute;n cero al centro del obturador, las posiciones de cada
filtro est&aacute;n dadas en la <A HREF="camila_tables.html#t4">Tabla
4</A>. La rotaci&oacute;n del carrusel es llevada a cabo por el motor
de pasos, cuyo movimiento se transmite a trav&eacute;s de un eje de
acero inoxidable que mueve un sinfin y una corona. El eje de acero
atraviesa la botella por medio de un sello ferroflu&iacute;dico,
garantizando hermeticidad y libertad de movimiento.

 <P><A NAME="bitacora">
	<EM>2.7 Bit&aacute;cora de Observaciones con CAMILA</EM></A><BR>

 <P>Para que el observador lleve una bit&aacute;cora de
observaci&oacute;n con CAMILA se puede utilizar las formas presentadas
en el <A HREF="#apende">Ap&eacute;ndice E</A>.  Estas pueden
imprimirse desde la SUN mediante el comando: <STRONG>lpr

 <P>En las fotograf&iacute;as de las <A HREF="#figuras">Figuras 2a y

telescopio. Para la instalaci&oacute;n en telescopio se presenta en la
<A HREF="camila_tables.html#t5">Tabla 5</A> una lista de las unidades
que constituyen al sistema.

 <P><A NAME="inicial"><EM>3.2 Procedimiento Inicial</EM></A><BR>

 <P><A NAME="prelim"><CODE>3.2.1 Preliminares</CODE></A><BR>


 <P>CAMILA es un equipo muy DELICADO y debe ser tratada con mucha
precauci&oacute;n (i.e. como a una DAMA).

 <P>Se recomienda iniciar la instalaci&oacute;n de la c&aacute;mara
directa CAMILA <STRONG>dos</STRONG> d&iacute;as antes de la temporada
de observaci&oacute;n en que se vaya a utilizar. Este tiempo es
necesario porque se requiere evacuar adecuadamente el cri&oacute;stato
y porque el proceso de enfriado del detector requiere de alrededor de
12 horas en su etapa final.

 <P>La preparaci&oacute;n de CAMILA, la instalaci&oacute;n en
telescopio y las pruebas iniciales de operaci&oacute;n ser&aacute;n
realizadas por el equipo t&eacute;cnico especializado del OAN. La
operaci&oacute;n de CAMILA es responsabilidad del OAN por lo que se
pide a los observadores &uacute;nicamente vigilar que el sistema sea
instalado y opere adecuadamente. Con el objeto de lograr una
operaci&oacute;n &oacute;ptima y detectar problemas, se recomienda a
los observadores estar familiarizados con el procedimiento general de
instalaci&oacute;n y pruebas iniciales de CAMILA que se describen en
este cap&iacute;tulo.

 <P><A NAME="stop"><CODE>3.2.2 Stop Fr&iacute;o</CODE></A><BR>

 <P>Antes de comenzar a realizar el vac&iacute;o del cri&oacute;stato
y/o enfriar, checar que est&eacute; instalado el <STRONG>Lyott stop o
diafragma fr&iacute;o dentro de la botella criog&eacute;nica</STRONG>.
Este stop es un diafragma de aluminio de 7 mm de di&aacute;metro, que
se instala (pega) en la parte exterior de la rueda de filtros, dentro
de la botella, cuyo papel es disminuir la radiaci&oacute;n de fondo en
la banda K.  Para checar que est&eacute; en su lugar se asoma uno por
la ventana de la botella con una linterna y el diafragma debe ser
claramente visible. Este diafragma actualmente se remueve si CAMILA es
usada en modo espectrosc&oacute;pico, por lo que debe checarse para
imagen directa.

 <P><A NAME="filtthree"><CODE>3.2.3 Filtros</CODE></A><BR>

 <P>Checar que no est&eacute; puesto el seguro del dial de los filtros
(n&oacute;tese que el seguro <STRONG>NUNCA</STRONG> debe estar
puesto).  Mover a mano los filtros para checar que est&eacute;n
centrados en sus posiciones.  La posici&oacute;n en el dial de cada
filtro disponible, se muestra en la <A
HREF="camila_tables.html#t4">Tabla 4</A>. Para iniciar la
operaci&oacute;n, la rueda de filtros <STRONG>debe</STRONG> estar en
el filtro 0 antes de conectar la electr&oacute;nica.  <STRONG>La
micromint (cajita verde) es la &uacute;nica computadora en el sistema
que lleva la cuenta del filtro, y &eacute;sta asume que la
posici&oacute;n al encender es la correspondiente al filtro 0.
</STRONG> Si en cualquier momento durante la operaci&oacute;n, es
necesario apagar esta computadora, habr&aacute; que llevar manualmente
a la posici&oacute;n 0 nuevamente (desconectando el motor de pasos o
apagando la micromint).

 <P>Una vez realizadas estas pruebitas se procede a evacuar la botella
criog&eacute;nica.
 

 <P><A NAME="evacuacion">
	<EM>3.3 Evacuaci&oacute;n del Cri&oacute;stato</EM></A><BR>

 <P>Uno de los procedimientos m&aacute;s importantes es la
evacuaci&oacute;n del cri&oacute;stato de CAMILA. Se recomienda que
&eacute;ste sea realizado por personal t&eacute;cnico experimentado.

 <P>En la <A HREF="#figuras">Figura 9</A> se presenta al cri&oacute;stato siendo evacuado en
el sistema Veeco de SPM, con el objeto de ilustrar donde est&aacute;
la v&aacute;lvula y donde deben conectarse la manguera de la bomba de
vac&iacute;o y el puerto para el termopar.  Actualmente, hay otro
sistema adicional de vac&iacute;o operando en SPM y el uso del sistema
Veeco o el nuevo es equivalente. CAMILA cuenta con un medidor de
presi&oacute;n interna o termopar que permite medir la presi&oacute;n
de la botella durante el proceso de evacuaci&oacute;n y el sistema de
vac&iacute;o nuevo cuenta con su propio medidor.

 <P>Una vez conectada la manguera del sistema de vac&iacute;o al
cri&oacute;stato se deber&aacute; esperar unos minutos a que el
sistema se estabilize y se evacue la manguera para proceder a abrir la
v&aacute;lvula de vac&iacute;o e iniciar la evacuaci&oacute;n del
cri&oacute;stato. Esta v&aacute;lvula s&oacute;lo puede abrirse si el
cri&oacute;stato se encuentra a temperatura ambiente.

 <P>Cuando el medidor de vac&iacute;o (termopar) marque una
presi&oacute;n inferior a <STRONG>30 mTorr</STRONG> el
cri&oacute;stato se encuentra a presi&oacute;n de operaci&oacute;n y
puede ser llenado con nitr&oacute;geno l&iacute;quido(N2L). La
v&aacute;lvula de vac&iacute;o, localizada junto al termopar, es el
conducto a trav&eacute;s del cual se realiza la evacuaci&oacute;n del
cri&oacute;stato y una vez que se ha llegado a la presi&oacute;n
requerida permite el cierre, evitando la p&eacute;rdida de
vac&iacute;o. Tanto el termopar como la v&aacute;lvula se atornillan
con cinta de tefl&oacute;n a la tapa superior del cri&oacute;stato
(ver <A HREF="#figuras">Fig. 9</A>).

 <P>En caso de requerir mayor vac&iacute;o, se debe tener en cuenta
que, en cada paso que se siga con el equipo de vac&iacute;o, se
deber&aacute; primero cerrar la v&aacute;lvula de vac&iacute;o de la
botella y dejar que se evacue la manguera y se estabilice.  En
particular, cuando se pasa de la bomba mec&aacute;nica a la difusora,
hay un per&iacute;odo de degasamiento de la difusora en el que se
pierde vac&iacute;o y se contaminan las superficies con los gases que
desprende este degasado, el medidor subir&aacute; un poco y la aguja
oscilar&aacute; un rato hasta volver a bajar.  Este per&iacute;odo
puede durar unos 5 minutos.

 <P>En total, el cri&oacute;stato de CAMILA debe poder llegar a un
buen vac&iacute;o, i.e. inferior a 30 mTorr en el termopar, en unos 45
minutos. Sin embargo, es posible que por alg&uacute;n problema el
sistema se encuentre muy sucio y que la evacuaci&oacute;n dure
m&aacute;s tiempo.

 <P>Cuando el sistema ya est&aacute; instalado y operando en
telescopio, puede medirse el vac&iacute;o con el termopar. En caso de
que no se cuente con el medidor, una apariencia nublada de la ventana
&oacute; la presencia de condensaci&oacute;n de agua en el
cri&oacute;stato, son indicadores de que el vac&iacute;o dentro
del cri&oacute;stato es deficiente. Deber&aacute; checarse el
cri&oacute;stato y evacuar el sistema a temperatura ambiente,
i.e. vaciar el nitr&oacute;geno l&iacute;quido y esperar a que la
botella se caliente.

 <P><A NAME="conexiones"><EM>3.4 Conexiones Iniciales</EM></A><BR>

 <P>Antes de iniciar el proceso de enfriado del cri&oacute;stato, es
necesario conectar la electr&oacute;nica para poder monitorear el
proceso.  En este paso no se requiere a&uacute;n conectar la SUN ni la
PC del dos metros, por lo que esta operaci&oacute;n puede realizarce
en otro lugar, p.ej. en el laboratorio de electr&oacute;nica o en el
cuarto de junto.

 <P>Se requiere conectar la mochila (caja roja), la micromint (caja
verde) y la PC-Camila.  Para ello existen tres cables, uno corto (que
se guarda en la caja militar de camila) que va de la botella a la
mochila; uno m&uacute;ltiple, que va de la mochila a la micromint; y
un DB-25 que va de este m&uacute;ltiple a la PC (OJO: requiere un
cambiador de g&eacute;nero).  En este &uacute;ltimo cable, se
transmiten, adem&aacute;s de los datos del detector, se&#241;ales de
comunicaci&oacute;n serial (RS422) entre la PC y la micromint
(mediante el puerto COM1: de la PC).  Es por esto que debe estar
conectado un cablecito telef&oacute;nico entre COM1: y la tarjeta de
interfaz en la PC-Camila.

 <P>La conexi&oacute;n entre las distintas computadoras asociadas al
sistema es como sigue (ver <A HREF="#figuras">Fig. 10</A>):


<OL>
<LI> PC-Camila a SUN v&iacute;a ethernet
<LI> PC-Camila a micromint v&iacute;a COM1: que va por RS422 en la

 <P><A NAME="pruebas"><EM>3.5 Pruebas Iniciales</EM></A><BR>

 <P><A NAME="camina"><CODE>3.5.1 Programa CAMINA</CODE></A><BR>

 <P>Encender la PC-Camila y posteriormente la micromint (cajita
verde), pasarse al directorio observa y correr el programa
<STRONG>pcplot</STRONG>, que permite establecer la comunicaci&oacute;n
entre ellas.  La micromint responde con el prompt del
int&eacute;rprete BASIC, y para habilitar la transferencia de archivos
a la micromint hay que dar el comando <STRONG>(Alt)U <nombre del
archivo></STRONG>, que en este caso ser&iacute;a <STRONG>(Alt)U
camina</STRONG>, el cual se ejecuta al dar <STRONG>RUN</STRONG>.
 
 <P>En la ejecuci&oacute;n pueden darse varios comandos de prueba
(siempre con may&uacute;sculas) como los siguientes:

<UL>
<LI> R (resetea los convertidores),
<LI> B (Borra detector, responde con T por termin&eacute;); 
<LI> L (lee, responde T); 
<LI> F01 Return (mueve al filtro 01, responde T).
</UL>

 <P>Una vez probado <STRONG>camina</STRONG>, se requiere salir de pcplot con
<STRONG>(Alt)x</STRONG>.

 <P><A NAME="prueba4"><CODE>3.5.2 Programa PRUEBA4</CODE></A><BR>

 <P>Ejecutar programa <STRONG>prueba4</STRONG> en la PC-Camila.  Este
programa da el n&uacute;mero de pixeles le&iacute;dos (debe ser
16384); y luego el n&uacute;mero de pixeles en cero (debe ser cero) y
el n&uacute;mero de pixeles saturados (deben ser casi todos 16384) en
cada uno de los cuadrantes.

 <P><A NAME="enfriado"><EM>3.6 Procedimiento de Enfriado</EM></A><BR> 

 <P>Con <STRONG>prueba4</STRONG> funcionando, comenzar el proceso de
llenado de nitr&oacute;geno.  Para esto usar el embudo en forma de
cuerno.  Hay que tener en cuenta que el v&aacute;stago del embudo debe
penetrar hasta la c&aacute;mara de nitr&oacute;geno, pasando el
cuello, ya que de lo contrario el nitr&oacute;geno hierve y rebota
desde el cuello y nunca llega al dep&oacute;sito.  Otro detalle que
hay que checar es que no se forme hielo entre el cuello y el
v&aacute;stago, ya que esto evita que respire el dep&oacute;sito.
Esto se puede verificar quitando el embudo y probando con cuidado con
un desarmador largo.  El tiempo de llenado debe ser como de 20
minutos, y se usan del orden de 5 litros.

 <P>Durante el proceso de enfriado, debe notarse que, una vez que
empieza a transferirse el nitr&oacute;geno, el numero de pixeles
saturados en cada cuadrante comienza a disminuir, lo cual indica que
el detector empieza a responder (``vive'').  El &uacute;ltimo cuadrante
en responder es el 4, que normalmente est&aacute; vivo cuando los
otros ya casi no muestran pixeles saturados.

 <P>Cuando el cuadrante 4 comience a vivir, puede interrumpirse el
programa <STRONG>prueba4</STRONG> y usar el programa
<STRONG>prueba5</STRONG>.

 <P><A NAME="prueba5"><CODE>3.6.1 Programa PRUEBA5</CODE></A><BR> 

 <P>Este programa realiza un borrado y dos lecturas en forma
secuencial, con un tiempo de integraci&oacute;n entre las dos
lecturas, que es programable (dar 0). Lo que muestra para cada
cuadrante, es el nivel medio del offset (1a. lectura) y la se&#241;al
(2a-1a lectura) y esto sirve para determinar cuando el detector
est&aacute; en condiciones de operaci&oacute;n.

 <P>El nivel normal de operaci&oacute;n es cuando el offset llega a
valores del orden de <STRONG>2000 conteos en cada
cuadrante</STRONG>. Cabe notar, que el cuadrante 4 tiene un nivel
generalmente mayor (approx 3000).  Para esto son necesarias varias
horas (entre 8 y 12).  Durante este proceso ser&aacute; necesario
estar rellenando de nitr&oacute;geno aproximadamente cada 6-8 horas.
(m&aacute;s frecuente al principio).


 <P><A NAME="instal"><EM>3.7 Instalaci&oacute;n en el Telescopio</EM></A><BR> 
 <P><A NAME="montura"><CODE>3.7.1 Montura</CODE></A><BR> 

 <P>La montura de la c&aacute;mara directa (ver. <A
HREF="#figuras">Figs. 4 y 5</A>) contiene un espejo y una lente
(doblete), por lo que deber&aacute; manejarse con cuidado.
Normalmente, el espejo no requiere realinearse, pero en caso
necesario, &eacute;sto se puede checar con el laser que se monta en
una cruz de aluminio a la entrada de la montura. Dos tornillos en la
parte posterior del espejo permiten darle tilt en X y Y.  El mecanismo
de este espejo, consite de un bal&iacute;n, un resorte que jala y dos
tornillos que empujan, pivoteando sobre el bal&iacute;n.  El
bal&iacute;n puede llegar a salirse de lugar en caso que se excedan
los l&iacute;mites del tornillo o porque se despeg&oacute;, y en ese
caso hay que abrir el mecanismos para reubicar (con pegamento) el
bal&iacute;n.

 <P>La montura se pone a la platina con una cubeta extensora como de
40 cm, que es parte del equipo de CAMILA. En la base de tefl&oacute;n
de la montura se instala la botella con 4 tornillos allen,
preferentemente del lado Norte de la platina.  Con esta
configuraci&oacute;n el Norte queda arriba y el Este a la derecha en
las im&aacute;genes en la SUN, pero el observador puede preferir otra
orientaci&oacute;n.

 <P><A NAME="electronica"><CODE>3.7.2 Electr&oacute;nica</CODE></A><BR> 

 <P>La electr&oacute;nica se conecta en la misma forma que para el
enfriado, con algunas diferencias.  La mochila se coloca sobre la
botella con las abrazaderas que tiene, la cajita verde (micromint) se
instala en la celda mediante un tornillo de platina que fija la caja
(es necesario desatornillar la tapa de la micromint) y la PC-Camila se
queda en el cuarto de observaci&oacute;n, comunic&aacute;ndose hacia
arriba con un cable DB-25 (25 l&iacute;neas). Checar que el cable de
la rueda de filtros que va de micromint al cri&oacute;stato
est&eacute; conectado.

 <P>Addicionalmente, la PC-Camila se conecta a la PC-2metros mediante
el puerto COM2 de ambas computadoras y un modem nulo.  Tambi&eacute;n
es necesario conectar la PC-Camila a la red ethernet, para que
&eacute;sta pueda comunicarse con la SUN.

 <P><A NAME="computa"><EM>4.1 Computadoras</EM></A><BR> 

 <P>CAMILA tiene 4 computadoras asociadas. Estas son la SUN-2metros,
la PC-Camila, la PC-2metros y la micromint. El observador interacciona
en mayor o menor medida con 3 de &eacute;stas. En modo de
observaci&oacute;n, la SUN es la interfaz principal para el
observador, puesto que ah&iacute; se programan las secuencias de
observaci&oacute;n, se controla el instrumento y se obtienen
finalmente las im&aacute;genes (IRAF). La PC-Camila tiene una
comunicaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s directa con la c&aacute;mara y el
observador la utilizar&aacute; para enfocar. Durante la
observaci&oacute;n normal no requerir&aacute; de mayor
atenci&oacute;n, pero debe notarse que est&aacute; realizando
pre-procesamiento y transferencia de im&aacute;genes.  Adem&aacute;s,
la PC-Camila es una herramienta para pruebas de operaci&oacute;n del
instrumento. La PC-2metros se encarga de controlar los movimientos del
telescopio, los cuales son requeridos como parte de las secuencias de
observaci&oacute;n. La micromint se encuentra en el telescopio y
est&aacute; directamente ligada a la electr&oacute;nica del detector.

 <P>Los detalles del sistema de adquisici&oacute;n de im&aacute;genes
desarrollado para CAMILA se describen en un reporte t&eacute;cnico
respectivo y referimos al lector para los detalles a este trabajo (ver
<A HREF="#apenda">Ap&eacute;ndice A</A>).  La filosof&iacute;a central
de la programaci&oacute;n atiende a los siguientes prop&oacute;sitos:

<OL>

<LI> Dado que la lectura del NICMOS 3, es en general no destructiva
(detector tipo DRO=Direct Readout), es posible leer en varias
ocasiones la cantidad de carga acumulada en cada pixel, incrementando
el rango din&aacute;mico del detector y mejorando la se&#241;al a
ruido.  Para lograr esto, es necesario tener control en tiempo real,
suficiente memoria para poder efectuar interpolaciones lineales y gran
rapidez de c&aacute;lculo, lo cual es ascequible con un computadora
dedicada, como una PC-486 (<STRONG>PC-Camila</STRONG>).

<LI> El manejo de im&aacute;genes es un problema com&uacute;n en la
comunidad astron&oacute;mica.  La programaci&oacute;n necesaria para
poderlas manejar y analizar adecuadamente es bastante compleja.  Sin
embargo, se han desarrollado paquetes de programas de uso
com&uacute;n, como <STRONG>IRAF</STRONG>, que contienen un gran
n&uacute;mero de rutinas diversas que dan una gran versatilidad al
trabajo de observaci&oacute;n.  Es por esto deseable e importante
desarrollar una plataforma de trabajo que sea directamente compatible
con <STRONG>IRAF</STRONG>.  Esto nos llev&oacute; al final a
transferir los datos a una estaci&oacute;n de trabajo tipo SUN, tanto
para almacenamiento como para an&aacute;lisis in situ.  La desventaja
de esto es que se pierde tiempo desde que finaliza la
integraci&oacute;n hasta que se reciben los datos en la SUN (hasta 30
seg).  Sin embargo, este tiempo puede ser aprovechado por el usuario
para realizar cambio de filtro o cambiar otros par&aacute;metros, y/o
mover el telescopio a la siguiente posici&oacute;n de
observaci&oacute;n, mediante la programaci&oacute;n de diversas
<STRONG>secuencias</STRONG> que se describen adelante.

</OL>

 <P><A NAME="programas"><EM>4.2 Programas</EM></A><BR> 

 <P>La programaci&oacute;n para la SUN-2metros y la PC-Camila,
encargadas de atenci&oacute;n al observador durante la
operaci&oacute;n y pre-procesamiento en tiempo real, respectivamente,
ha quedado organizada alrededor de dos programas principales:
<STRONG>camila</STRONG> en la SUN y <STRONG>corre</STRONG> en la
PC-Camila.  Conjuntamente operan los programas
<STRONG>movecam5</STRONG> en la PC-2metros) y <STRONG>camina</STRONG>
en el microcontrolador micromint. Para enfocar se usa el programa
<STRONG>foco</STRONG> en la PC-Camila. Estos programas se describen a
continuaci&oacute;n.

 
 <P><A NAME="pcamila"><CODE>4.2.1 Programa CAMILA</CODE></A><BR> 

 <P>En la SUN del telescopio de 2.1m en SPM se encuentra el programa
de observaci&oacute;n. Para accesarlo, entrar en la clave de
observadores: <STRONG>observa (con password *******)</STRONG>.

 <P>El programa de observaci&oacute;n se llama <STRONG>camila</STRONG>
y se ejecuta desde cualquier ventana de comandos en plataforma
openwindows, sunview o las nuevas que vengan (que acepten IRAF).  El
usuario de CAMILA en realidad puede escoger la que m&aacute;s le guste
y acomode. Aqu&iacute; cabe aclarar, que el usuario tiene a su
disposici&oacute;n toda la plataforma disponible en la SUN: IRAF,
SUPERMONGO, TeX, etc. El programa de CAMILA s&oacute;lo ocupa una
ventana de comandos para su ejecuci&oacute;n y generar&aacute;
im&aacute;genes en formato IRAF.

 <P>Para iniciar una temporada de observaci&oacute;n, es conveniente
dar el comando <STRONG>iniciacamila</STRONG>, el cual copia a la clave
de observa una serie de archivos necesarios, como el programa de
observaci&oacute;n <STRONG>camila</STRONG>, secuencias (descrito
abajo), badpix que contiene la lista de pixeles malos de CAMILA, etc.

 <P>El programa de observaci&oacute;n con CAMILA se ejecuta tecleando
simplemente <STRONG>camila</STRONG> en una ventana de comandos en la SUN. Sin
embargo, previo a su uso deber&aacute;n estar en ejecuci&oacute;n el
resto de los programas en las otras m&aacute;quinas, como se describe
en otras subsecciones de este cap&iacute;tulo.
 
 <P>En la pantalla de comandos de la SUN donde se ejecut&oacute; el
programa se despliega una pantalla de observaci&oacute;n como la
presentada en la <A HREF="camila_tables.html#t6">Tabla 6</A>.

 <P>En este punto el programa est&aacute; listo y se encuentra
b&aacute;sicamente esperando alg&uacute;n comando del usuario de
CAMILA para iniciar la observaci&oacute;n.


 <P><CODE>Comandos</CODE><P>

 <P>En la pantalla en la SUN, todas las palabras que se encuentran en
<STRONG>letra oscura</STRONG> son comandos que acepta el programa. La
informaci&oacute;n que contienen estos comandos ser&aacute; guardada
en el encabezado de las im&aacute;genes (ver siguiente
secci&oacute;n).

 <P>Para ilustrar el uso del programa veamos algunos ejemplos:

<UL>

<LI> <STRONG>fil 9</STRONG>: posicionar&aacute; el filtro 9 antes de
la siguiente exposici&oacute;n (la tabla de filtros se presenta en la
<A HREF="camila_tables.html#t4">Tabla 4</A>);

<LI> <STRONG>tint 30</STRONG>: selecciona un tiempo de
integraci&oacute;n de 30 segundos, el tiempo m&iacute;nimo de
integraci&oacute;n es de 0.5 seg;

<LI> <STRONG>e</STRONG> (no mostrado) es el comando de
ejecuci&oacute;n de una integraci&oacute;n;

<LI> <STRONG>fin</STRONG>: (no mostrado) finaliza el programa;  

<LI> <STRONG>nlec 2</STRONG>: ocasiona que el detector se lea dos
veces en el tiempo de integraci&oacute;n deseado; 

<LI> <STRONG>arch ago93</STRONG>: selecciona el nombre ago93 como
prefijo para una serie de exposiciones que comienzan desde la 001
&oacute; el archivo subsecuente, si es que ya existen archivos con ese
nombre;

<LI> <STRONG>obj M82</STRONG>: define el nombre del objeto como M82;

<LI> <STRONG>ar #</STRONG>: ascenci&oacute;n recta del objeto;

<LI> <STRONG>dec ##</STRONG>: declinaci&oacute;n del objeto;

<LI> <STRONG>ma ##.#</STRONG>: masa de aire (OJO: el programa MOVECAM5
el la PC-2metros despliega la masa de aire de las coordenadas de
posici&oacute;n del telescopio)

<LI> <STRONG>nadd 3</STRONG>: ocasiona que se realicen 3
integraciones, cada una por un tiempo de integraci&oacute;n dado por
<STRONG>tint</STRONG>, b&oacute;rrando el detector entre integraciones
y produciendo una imagen promedio de las 3. De esta manera se puede
aumentar el tiempo de integraci&oacute;n de un objeto cuando haya
problemas de saturaci&oacute;n ya sea por objeto o por fondo.

<LI> <STRONG>sat 17000</STRONG>: define el nivel de conteos arriba del
cual, se deshechan las lecturas que se realizan de un pixel. Para
incluir todas las lecturas, este valor debe ser &gt;16384 conteos, que
es el nivel real de saturaci&oacute;n de la electr&oacute;nica del
detector

</UL>


 <P>N&oacute;tese que para ejecutar una integraci&oacute;n se utiliza
el comando <STRONG>e</STRONG> y para finalizar el programa se utiliza
<STRONG>fin</STRONG>. Los otros comandos son explicados adelante. Si
el usuario escribe algo incomprensible, el programa responder&aacute;
con NO TE ENTIENDO, teclea RETURN, con lo cual aparecer&aacute;
nuevamente status: ESPERANDOTE y &gt;.
 
 <P>Para una descripci&oacute;n m&aacute;s detallada de las opciones
dadas por estos comandos referimos al lector al Reporte T&eacute;cnico
IAUNAM RT 94-06.


<P><CODE>Secuencias de Observaci&oacute;n</CODE><P>


 <P>Existe la posibilidad de realizar secuencias de exposiciones que
involucren distintos tipos de cambios en los par&aacute;metros para
cada integraci&oacute;n. Esto se realiza mediante el comando
<STRONG>sec &lt;nombre de secuencia deseada&gt;</STRONG>.  Para esto
se ha construido un archivo llamado <STRONG>secuencias</STRONG>, donde
se definen los pasos a ejecutar por el programa y al cual se pueden
agregar secuencias deseadas por el usuario. Las secuencias
generalmente involucran <STRONG>movimientos de telescopio</STRONG>
como ejecutar un mosaico o una cruz dado un desplazamiento (offset) en
segundos de arco en cierta direcci&oacute;n en el cielo.  En la <A
HREF="camila_tables.html#t7">Tabla 7</A> se presentan 3 ejemplos de
secuencias (una, cielo y cuatro) con el objeto de ilustrar su uso.
Cabe notar que cualquier comando que se puede dar en forma iterativa,
se puede incluir como parte de una secuencia (p. ej. cambio de
filtros, movimientos telescopio, etc.)  y que las secuencias posibles
dependen del tipo de observaci&oacute;n que el usuario requiere:
mosaicos, rastreos, etc.

 <P>El archivo <STRONG>secuencias</STRONG> contiene una serie de
secuencias de observaci&oacute;n que pueden ser &uacute;tiles para los
observadores, ya que permiten mover el telescopio para hacer mosaicos
de 3&#215;3, cruces, observaciones de cielo, etc. Se recomienda a los
observadores ver este archivo (con textedit) y adecuarlo a sus
observaciones, i.e. ajustar offsets, movimientos, etc.

 <P>En la <A HREF="camila_tables.html#t8">Tabla 8</A> presentamos las
secuencias CRUZ y MOSAICO3 que consideramos importantes para la
observaci&oacute;n IR. La secuencia CRUZ permite realizar
observaciones profundas de una regi&oacute;n central que se observa un
n&uacute;mero repetido de veces, tomando cielos en las 4 direcciones
(N, S, E y W) despu&eacute;s de cada centro y generando 9
im&aacute;genes. La secuencia MOSAICO3 permite obtener un mapa de
3&#215;3 alrededor de una posici&oacute;n central, generando 10
im&aacute;genes.


<P><CODE>Modos de Lectura</CODE> <P>


 <P>El detector de CAMILA puede leerse de varias maneras.  Se pueden
realizar lecturas m&uacute;ltiples durante una integraci&oacute;n y
tambi&eacute;n incrementar el n&uacute;mero de
<STRONG>addups</STRONG>.  Esto permite incrementar la se&#241;al a
ruido en varias formas, adem&aacute;s de simplemente variar el tiempo
de integraci&oacute;n.

 <P>Para la mayor&iacute;a de las aplicaciones en imagen directa,
donde el ruido dominante es ruido de fotones y disparo de la
radiaci&oacute;n de fondo, se recomienda trabajar con dos lecturas
(<STRONG>nlec = 2</STRONG>).  De esta forma el detector se lee dos
veces durante una integraci&oacute;n, una al pricipio y otra al final,
y se producen dos archivos de datos por cada integraci&oacute;n
(im&aacute;genes IRAF). Estos son <STRONG>imagen.b</STRONG> con el
resultado de la primera lectura que es b&aacute;sicamente el bias
electr&oacute;nico, e <STRONG>imagen.d</STRONG> que es el resultado de
la segunda menos la primera lecturas dividido por el tiempo de
integraci&oacute;n, esto es se&#241;al neta en conteos por segundo.
De esta manera se elimina el super-ruido asociado a una sola lectura,
que es 50 veces mayor que el ruido de lectura.  La primera lectura se
guarda &uacute;nicamente para prop&oacute;sitos de
linearizaci&oacute;n (ver <A HREF="#nolineal">Sec. 5.4</A>).  Sin embargo, si el conteo total se
mantiene por debajo de 10000 conteos, las correcciones por
linearizaci&oacute;n pueden no ser importantes. Para m&aacute;s
detalles referimos al lector al Reporte T&eacute;cnico RT 94-06 del
IAUNAM.


<P><CODE>Tiempos de Integraci&oacute;n</CODE> <P>

 <P>El tiempo de integraci&oacute;n puede controlarse de dos formas:
directamente mediante el comando <STRONG>tint</STRONG> o, en el caso
en que el detector se sature antes del tiempo total deseado, se puede
incrementar el n&uacute;mero de addups con <STRONG>nadd</STRONG> hasta
obtener un tiempo total de integraci&oacute;n equivalente al deseado.

 <P>El tiempo de integraci&oacute;n para una exposici&oacute;n se debe
seleccionar en base a varios elementos.  En primer lugar, el filtro
que se use determina muy fuertemente el tiempo m&aacute;ximo para una
integraci&oacute;n.  Esto es debido a que el detector puede saturarse
f&aacute;cilmente por radiaci&oacute;n de fondo (cielo).  As&iacute;
por ejemplo, de acuerdo con la <A HREF="camila_tables.html#t4">Tabla
4</A> (ver <A HREF="#filtros">Sec. 2.6</A>), el conteo de fondo para
el filtro K' es de 400 conteos/s, por lo que en 20 segundos se
tendr&iacute;an 8000 conteos tan solo de brillo de fondo.  Aunque el
nivel de saturaci&oacute;n es de 16384 conteos, debido a la fuerte
no-linealidad despu&eacute;s de 14000 conteos no es conveniente
rebasar este nivel.  De hecho es conveniente calcular el tiempo de
integraci&oacute;n al menos para no rebasar los 7000 conteos por
radiaci&oacute;n de fondo.  A&uacute;n con esta previsi&oacute;n, es
posible que el objeto sature en el detector, por lo que ser&iacute;a
necesario disminuir a&uacute;n m&aacute;s el tiempo de
integraci&oacute;n.  Si el tiempo de integraci&oacute;n que resulte
finalmente es demasiado corto para obtener la raz&oacute;n S/R
deseada, se puede incrementar el tiempo aumentando el n&uacute;mero de
add-upps con <STRONG>nadd</STRONG>.


<P><CODE>Archivos de Im&aacute;genes</CODE> <P>

 <P>Cuando el n&uacute;mero de lecturas, nlec=2, cada
exposici&oacute;n genera dos archivos <STRONG>imagen.b</STRONG> e
<STRONG>imagen.d</STRONG>.  La <STRONG>imagen.b</STRONG> tiene los
conteos de la primera lectura que se realiza inmediatamente
despu&eacute;s de borrar el detector. Esta informaci&oacute;n puede
ser &uacute;til para linealizar las im&aacute;genes (ver <A
HREF="#nolineal">Sec. 5.4</A>). La <STRONG>imagen.d</STRONG> tiene la
se&#241;al resultante de una observaci&oacute;n, en conteos/seg,
i.e. es el resultado de dividir los conteos totales entre el tiempo de
integraci&oacute;n.

 <P>Es posible cambiar el n&uacute;mero de veces en que se lee el
detector durante una integraci&oacute;n, mediante el comando
<STRONG>nlec</STRONG>. As&iacute;, si nlec=1 &uacute;nicamente se
realiza una lectura del detector y s&oacute;lo se genera el archivo
<STRONG>imagen.b</STRONG>.  En este modo se tiene la ventaja de que puede
disminuirse el tiempo de integraci&oacute;n al m&iacute;nimo de 0.5
seg. Sin embargo, tiene la desventaja de que el ruido se incrementa
por un factor &gt;50, con respecto al caso nlec=2.

 <P>Por otro lado, si nlec&gt;2 (ver modos de lectura arriba y Reporte
T&eacute;cnico IAUNAM RT 94-06), se puede disminuir el ruido de
lectura a&uacute;n m&aacute;s. Esto se logra ajustando una recta por
m&iacute;nimos cuadrados a la se&#241;al en cada pixel de la imagen,

 <P><A NAME="pfoco"><CODE>4.2.2 Programa FOCO</CODE></A><BR> 

 <P>Para enfocar el telescopio y determinar los focos relativos en
cada banda disponible: J, H y K, se recomienda iniciar con una
estrella de magnitud &gt;5. Para no saturar puden utilizar los filtros
angostos en cada banda y tiempos de exposici&oacute;n &lt;= 1 s.

 <P>Aunque es posible enfocar tomando im&aacute;genes con el programa
<STRONG>camila</STRONG>, se desarroll&oacute; una opci&oacute;n
m&aacute;s r&aacute;pida.

 <P>El observador puede utilizar el programa <STRONG>foco</STRONG> que
corre en la PC-Camila y realiza exposiciones r&aacute;pidas de un
cuadrante del detector. Este programa se encuentra en el directorio
<STRONG>observa</STRONG> en la PC-Camila. Cuendo se ejecuta se
selecciona que cuadrante, as&iacute; como el tiempo de
integraci&oacute;n y n&uacute;mero de lecturas (1 &oacute; 2) que
realizar&aacute; el detector.  En general, una lectura es suficiente
si se est&aacute; enfocando con un objeto brillante, pero es muy
posible que el detector se sature de cualquier forma.  Si se va a
tratar de enfocar con objetos de magnitud 6 o m&aacute;s brillantes,
es necesario hacerlo a trav&eacute;s de filtros angostos.  Estrellas
m&aacute;s d&eacute;biles que magnitud 6, s&iacute; pueden ser
observadas directamente mediante los filtros anchos.  El utilizar dos
lecturas para enfocar es m&aacute;s recomendable ya que se disminuye
el ruido de lectura.

Este programa se encuentra en el directorio <STRONG>observa</STRONG>

secuencias de observaci&oacute;n que se determinan desde la SUN y se
envian al controlador de CAMILA. Cuando no hay ninguna
integraci&oacute;n el programa est&aacute; borrando continuamente el
detector. Esta actividad en la PC se nota ya que continuamente
est&aacute; escribiendo un mensaje:

<CENTER>Espero comando remoto; cualquier tecla termina</CENTER>

 <P>En caso de que se note que esto deje de ocurrir, es posible que
sea debido a un problema moment&aacute;neo en la comunicaci&oacute;n
(brinc&oacute; un Cham&aacute;n). Se tiene que dar un RESET a la

 <P>En caso de que a&uacute;n as&iacute;, no haya respuesta, entonces
es necesario apagar la micromint (cajita verde) y debe tenerse
precauci&oacute;n con el motor de los filtros.  Checar que no
est&eacute; puesto el seguro del dial de los filtros (n&oacute;tese
que el seguro NUNCA debe estar puesto).  Mover a mano los filtros para
checar que est&eacute;n centrados en sus posiciones.  La
posici&oacute;n en el dial de cada filtro disponible, se muestra en la
<A HREF="camila_tables.html#t4">Tabla 4</A>. Para iniciar la

distintos comandos posibles. Para que las secuencias de
observaci&oacute;n que involucran movimientos del telescopio funcionen
adecuadamente, es necesario dar las coordenadas del objeto que se

<STRONG>Q</STRONG>, que pregunta el nombre del objeto, lo busca en un
cat&aacute;logo y si no lo encuentra pregunta las coordenadas
<STRONG>1950</STRONG>. Con esto los desplazamientos (offsets) del
telescopio realizados en las secuencias toman en cuenta la DEC del
objeto y los movimientos efectivamente corresponden a desplazamientos
en el cielo.  Si se quieren detalles sobre este programa, se
recomienda consultar con los asistentes de telescopio.

 <P><A NAME="pcamina"><CODE>4.2.5 Programa CAMINA</CODE></A><BR>

 <P><A NAME="apariencia">
	<EM>4.3 Apariencia de las Im&aacute;genes</EM></A><BR> 

 <P>Para el observador nuevo en el equipo, las im&aacute;genes que se
obtienen pueden parecer sumamente raras, y a veces en efecto lo son.
Uno de los problemas mas frecuentes con que se encuentra uno es que en
la <STRONG>imagen.d</STRONG> no se observa m&aacute;s que un
extra&#241;o patr&oacute;n de iluminaci&oacute;n.  Este patr&oacute;n
puede tener la apariencia de cualquiera de las <A
HREF="#figuras">Figuras 11a, 11b y 11c</A> (flatJ, flatH y flatK,
respectivamente).  Esto es debido a que en muchas ocasiones la
radiaci&oacute;n de fondo es mucho mas intensa que la proveniente del
objeto y &eacute;ste no resalta del fondo.  Para ver el objeto es
necesario restar otra imagen similar adquirida en otra posici&oacute;n
del telescopio (i.e. cielo). En la secuencia de im&aacute;genes de las
<A HREF="#figuras">Figuras 12a (objeto) 12b (cielo) y 12c (resta)</A>,
se ilustra este efecto.
  
 <P>Otras veces, por el contrario, se observa el objeto claramente
resaltando sobre un cuadro que tiene la apariencia de la <A
HREF="#figuras">Figura 13</A> que es un DARK.  Lo extra&#241;o de esta
<A HREF="#figuras">figura</A> son las dos bandas horizontales que se
observan en la parte inferior de cada uno de los cuatro cuadrantes.
Esto ocurre en el filtro 0 (oscuro o dark) y en los filtros muy
angostos, en donde la radiaci&oacute;n de fondo es lo suficientemente
baja como para poder apreciar este otro efecto, que es producido por
la corriente oscura del detector.  Esta estructura que se ve en las
im&aacute;genes se cancela igualmente al restar otra imagen similar,
aunque en ocasiones queda algun indicio (bastante peque&#241;o) de
esto que no logra cancelarse completamente.

 <P>Cuando el tiempo de integraci&oacute;n es corto y se lee
frecuentemente el detector, se observan brillantes las cuatro esquinas
de &eacute;ste.  Esto tambi&eacute;n es normal, son los
pre-amplificadores de salida de la electr&oacute;nica del detector que
se calentaron, y se cancela al restar dos im&aacute;genes.

 <P>En otras ocasiones, ocurre que un cuadro se lee mal (bad readout)
como en la <A HREF="#figuras">Figura 14a</A>. Esto indica una mala
transferencia entre la electr&oacute;nica de la mochila y la
PC-Camila, y la imagen deber&aacute; deshecharse.

 <P>Frecuentemente, al iniciar una secuencia la primera imagen del
detector es defectuosa, esto puede verse claramente cuando al hacer la
diferencia entre esta imagen y la segunda resulta una imagen como la
presentada en la <A HREF="#figuras">Figura 14b</A>; en este caso debe
deshecharse la primera exposici&oacute;n. La raz&oacute;n de este
problema es una diferencia que se origina por cambios que sufre el
detector al pasar del estado inactivo a uno de integraci&oacute;n,
efecto que a&uacute;n no entendemos. Es posible que esta imagen
defectuosa ocurra en poqu&iacute;simos casos durante una secuencia y
pues tambi&eacute;n deber&aacute; deshecharse.


 <P>Para evitar problemas como malas lecturas y no cancelaciones de la
corriente oscura, y aprovechando de la necesidad de tomar
im&aacute;genes del cielo con bastante frecuencia, es conveniente
dise&#241;ar una estrategia de observaci&oacute;n que repita varias
veces la misma zona observada repartiendo as&iacute; el tiempo de
integraci&oacute;n global, y no tratar de tomar un solo cuadro de todo
el tiempo de integraci&oacute;n.  Un ejemplo de esta estrategia es la
secuencia <STRONG>cruz</STRONG> que da muy buenos resultados al
superponer finalmente la zona central de la cruz observada.

 <P>Un posible problema de las secuencias es la posible coincidencia
de un objeto excesivamente brillante en uno de los cuadros observados.
Esto debe evitarse, ya que la observaci&oacute;n de una estrella muy
brillante deja una huella (after-image o imagen fantasma) que dura en
el detector varias exposiciones, pudiendo inutilizar toda una
secuencia, y es casi imposible quitarla en la reducci&oacute;n.
 
 <P>Una imagen que uno normalmente no mira, es la
<STRONG>imagen.b</STRONG> de cualquier cuadro.  Esta imagen, que puede
ser necesaria para linearizar las mediciones, ya que corresponde
fundamentalmente a la carga inicial en cada pixel (i.e. BIAS)
(<A HREF="#figuras">Fig. 15</A>).

 <P>Finalmente pueden cancelarse muchos de los factores indeseables y
obtener im&aacute;genes reducidas, como se ilustra en la <A
HREF="#figuras">Figura 15</A> donde todos los problemas adicionales
han sido cancelados a niveles del 1%.

<P><A NAME="metodos"><EM>5.1 M&eacute;todos de Observaci&oacute;n</EM></A><BR> 

 <P>Para poder reducir y calibrar adecuadamente las observaciones de
una temporada hay que realizar una serie de procedimientos, tales como
correcciones por no-linealidad del detector, aplanamiento de campo,
correcci&oacute;n de pixeles malos, sustracci&oacute;n de bias y
cielo, y calibraci&oacute;n fotom&eacute;trica con est&aacute;ndares.

 <P>Estas correcciones son necesarias ya que en cada
observaci&oacute;n que se realiza, adem&aacute;s de la se&#241;al que
se desea medir, hay contribuciones de distintas fuentes de ruido.
Entre &eacute;stas est&aacute;n las emisiones del cielo y de la
&oacute;ptica a temperatura ambiente (telescopio, espejos, doblete,
etc.).  Una referencia muy &uacute;til para comprender el significado
de las distintas fuentes de ruido es la de McCaughrean 1988, que puede
ser consultada en el <A HREF="#apendc">Ap&eacute;ndice C</A>.

<P><A NAME="planos"><EM>5.2 Campos Planos</EM></A><BR> 

 <P>En general es necesario obtener campos planos para calibrar la
respuesta cu&aacute;ntica del detector en cada filtro.  Como esta
respuesta no se espera que var&iacute;e significativamente de noche a
noche, es suficiente obtener campos planos unas dos veces durante la
temporada.
  
 <P>Los campos planos deben ser obtenidos bajo dos condiciones de
iluminaci&oacute;n muy distintas, para poder cancelar la
emisi&oacute;n t&eacute;rmica de la propia &oacute;ptica del
telescopio (ver <A HREF="#apendc">Ap&eacute;ndice C</A>), poca y mucha
iluminaci&oacute;n.  Esto puede lograrse observando el cielo desde
poco antes de que amanezca, hasta que sale el Sol, tomando
exposiciones cortas en todos los filtros.  Cuando en cada filtro se
tengan al menos una exposici&oacute;n con poca iluminaci&oacute;n y
otra del mismo tiempo de integraci&oacute;n pero con mucha
iluminaci&oacute;n (del orden de 7000 conteos, pero sin saturar), en
ese momento se puede dar por concluido el proceso de im&aacute;genes
de campo plano.  El campo plano en cada filtro se obtendr&aacute; de
la diferencia entre estas dos im&aacute;genes.

 <P>En caso de que no se puedan obtener campos planos al atardecer o
al amanecer, se puede tambi&eacute;n intentar tomar campos planos de
c&uacute;pula con luz de c&uacute;pula, i.e. no de l&aacute;mpara para
pantalla (pues el detector satura).  En este caso, deben obtenerse
im&aacute;genes con luz y tambi&eacute;n sin luz del mismo tiempo de
integraci&oacute;n, para as&iacute; poder efectuar las diferencias a
las que se refiere el p&aacute;rrafo anterior.

<P><A NAME="darks"><EM>5.3 Darks, Bias y Cielo</EM></A><BR> 

 <P>Un <STRONG>dark</STRONG> es una imagen de la corriente oscura del
detector integrada durante un cierto tiempo de integraci&oacute;n.
Los requerimientos de observar <STRONG>darks</STRONG> varian
seg&uacute;n el tipo de procesamiento que se quiera dar a los datos
(ver <A HREF="#apendc">Ap&eacute;ndice C</A>).  Cuando el tipo de
procesamiento que se realizar&aacute; es parecido al procesamiento
para CCD's &oacute;pticos, es imprescindible obtener
<STRONG>darks</STRONG> del mismo tiempo de integraci&oacute;n que se
us&oacute; en las observaciones.  Estos <STRONG>darks</STRONG> son
simplemente exposiciones a trav&eacute;s del filtro n&uacute;mero 0.
De acuerdo con McCaugheran, el procesamiento t&eacute;rmico no
requiere de la obtenci&oacute;n de darks.

 <P>Un <STRONG>bias</STRONG> es una imagen de tiempo de
integraci&oacute;n cero y mide el offset de la electr&oacute;nica en
cada pixel.  Sin embargo, en cualquiera de los procesamientos
recomendados por McCaugheran (<A HREF="#apendc">Ap&eacute;ndice
C</A>), se realizan diferencias de im&aacute;genes, lo cual cancela
esta contribuci&oacute;n ya que es constante.  Sin embargo es
recomendable tomar unos 10 <STRONG>bias</STRONG> al final de cada
noche.

 <P>La radiaci&oacute;n de fondo o <STRONG>cielo</STRONG> en el
infrarrojo var&iacute;a con mucha frecuencia (del orden de unos pocos
minutos) para longitudes de onda de 2&#181;m.  Por esto, es
imprescindible alternar las observaciones del objeto con observaciones
de cielo, que se obtienen moviendo el telescopio a posiciones cercanas
(approx min de arco).  Esto se puede realizar eficientemente
mediante la programaci&oacute;n de <STRONG>secuencias</STRONG> de
observaci&oacute;n (ver <A HREF="#pcamila">Sec. 4.2.1</A>).  Cuando el
objeto que se est&aacute; observando es extendido, el offset
deber&aacute; aumentarse hasta encontrar una regi&oacute;n libre de
emisi&oacute;n.  Tambi&eacute;n es conveniente realizar observaciones
de cielo en m&aacute;s de una posici&oacute;n, ya que si
&uacute;nicamente se realiza una observaci&oacute;n, no es posible
cancelar la contribuci&oacute;n de objetos puntuales (estrellas) del
cielo.  En cambio, si se realiza m&aacute;s de una observaci&oacute;n
de cielo, en distintas posiciones, las im&aacute;genes obtenidas se
pueden combinar de tal forma que las contribuciones de las estrellas
se cancelen.  Esto se puede realizar, por ejemplo, combinando al menos
tres im&aacute;genes por mediana. Previamente hay que tener cuidado en
que el nivel mediano de cada una de las im&aacute;genes que se
combinan sea el mismo, para lo cual es posible sumar o restar una
constante peque&#241;a.


<P><A NAME="nolineal"><EM>5.4 Correcci&oacute;n por No-Linealidad</EM></A><BR> 

 <P>El detector asociado a CAMILA es ligeramente no-lineal.  A 10000
conteos la no-linealidad es del 5% y empeora por arriba de este
nivel. En la <A HREF="#figuras">Figura 17</A> se ilustra el efecto de
no linealidad del detector NICMOS3. La no linealidad del detector
puede ser descrita por la ecuaci&oacute;n

<PRE>
c = d ( c_1 + c_2 d_io + c_3 d_io^2)
</PRE>

<P>donde <CODE>c</CODE> es la se&#241;al (conteos/segundo) corregida
por la no-linealidad; <CODE>d</CODE> es la se&#241;al obtenida
(imagen.d); <CODE>d_io</CODE> = imagen.d &#215; tiempo + imagen.b -
offset-electr&oacute;nico; y las <CODE>c_1</CODE>, <CODE>c_2</CODE> y
<CODE>c_3</CODE> son las constantes que resultan de ajustar una
c&uacute;bica.  Estas &uacute;ltimas son muy similares para los 4
cuadrantes, mientras que los valores de los offsets
electr&oacute;nicos difieren entre s&iacute; del orden de 10%.

 <P>Los par&aacute;metros que caracterizan la no-linealidad y el
offset electr&oacute;nico de cada cuadrante, pueden variar ligeramente
de temporada a temporada, por lo que es recomendable calcularlos una
vez durante la temporada.  Para determinar estos par&aacute;metros,
hay que realizar una serie de observaciones de c&uacute;pula con luz
difusa teniendo im&aacute;genes con approx 1000 conteos por segundo
en el filtro 6 [Fe II] (se recomienda este filtro para no saturar el
detector). El observador deber&aacute; realizar observaciones con
<STRONG>nlec=1</STRONG>, con tiempos de integraci&oacute;n de 1, 2, 3,
4, ... , 20 segundos, para poder ajustar los par&aacute;metros del
modelo. El observador puede usar la secuencia <STRONG>lineal</STRONG>
en el archivo de secuencias, para adquirir las im&aacute;genes para la
linealizaci&oacute;n, que pueden ser llamadas linealxxx por
conveniencia.  Una vez adquiridas estas im&aacute;genes, se puede
proceder de la siguiente forma para obtener los par&aacute;metros
<CODE>c_1</CODE>, <CODE>c_2</CODE> y <CODE>c_3</CODE>:

<OL>

<LI> Hacer un imstat para cada cuadrante de todas las im&aacute;genes
obtenidas:

<UL>
<LI> imstat  lineal*.b.imh[70:80,70:80] &gt; lindat1
    
<LI> imstat  lineal*.b.imh[170:180,70:80] &gt; lindat2
    
<LI> imstat  lineal*.b.imh[70:80,170:180] &gt; lindat3
    
<LI> imstat  lineal*.b.imh[170:180,170:180] &gt; lindat4
</UL>

<LI> Generar archivo llamado tiempo con una lista de los tiempos de
integraci&oacute;n correspondiente a c/u de las im&aacute;genes
lineal*.b.

<LI> Entrar a supermongo en una ventana gterm o xterm con
<STRONG>sm</STRONG> y ah&iacute; decir: <STRONG>input
lineal</STRONG>. Aparecer&aacute;n 4 gr&aacute;ficas que muestran el
incremento de la se&#241;al como funci&oacute;n del tiempo para una
iluminaci&oacute;n constante (ver <A HREF="#figuras">Figura 17</A>).
En esta gr&aacute;fica se puede apreciar como es aproximadamente
lineal el incremento de la carga con respecto al tiempo hasta niveles
mayores de 10000 conteos y en particular, el detector se satura
completamente en 16384 conteos.

<LI> En supermongo decir: <STRONG>input coeflin</STRONG>. Este
programa (ver <A HREF="#figuras">Figura 18</A>) resalta la
separaci&oacute;n de la linealidad, al graficar el # de conteos
esperados si el detector fuese lineal entre el # de conteos leidos
vs. el n&uacute;mero de conteos leidos. Posteriormente, el programa
ajusta un polinomio como el descrito anteriormente, para lo cual
define <CODE>c1=1</CODE>. Adem&aacute;s, se asume que el
comportamiento es esencialmente lineal entre 1500 y 9000 conteos y que
puede aproximarse por un polinomio como el propuesto hasta 14200
conteos. Como se realiza un ajuste por m&iacute;nimos cuadrados, suele
ser demasiado sensible a peque&#241;as desviaciones, por lo que es
previsible que el observador tenga que interaccionar con los
par&aacute;metros del programa <STRONG>coeflin</STRONG>. En
particular, los par&aacute;metros: contlin, contmin, contpmax y
contpmin, que definen las distintas regiones (lineal,
cuadr&aacute;tica, etc.) mencionadas arriba. En la <A
HREF="#figuras">Figura 18</A>, es posible medir que tan malo es el
ajuste polinomial o bien que tan necesario es realizarlo, ya que el
eje vertical directamente puede interpretarse como una medida
porcentual del error. En la figura se aprecia que las dispersiones son
menores del 2% al ajuste que ah&iacute; se propone mediante la curva
s&oacute;lida para niveles &lt;14000 conteos. Puede tambi&eacute;n
apreciarse que el detector es lineal hasta niveles de 10000 conteos
(dentro de un 2%).

<P><A NAME="estandard"><EM>5.5 Estrellas Est&aacute;ndares</EM></A><BR> 

 <P>Para reducir la fotometr&iacute;a a un sistema absoluto
(p.ej. Korneeff et al. 1988), es necesario realizar observaciones de
estrellas est&aacute;ndares.  Sin embargo, los sistemas de estrellas
est&aacute;ndares cl&aacute;sicos, como Elias (1982) que fueron
obtenidos con detectores monocanal, no pueden ser utilizados, ya que
generalmente est&aacute;n basados en estrellas demasiado brillantes
para ser observadas con los nuevos detectores infrarojos.  Por esto,
se han comenzado a definir nuevos sistemas basados en estrellas
m&aacute;s d&eacute;biles.  Un ejemplo de estos sistemas es el de
UKIRT, que se puede consultar en el <A HREF="#apendd">Ap&eacute;ndice
D</A>, que consiste de 32 estrellas observadas en el IR, con magnitud
K en el intervalo 8&lt;K&lt;15.  En la lista del <A

(1950) , magnitud K, colores (J-K) y (H-K), as&iacute; como,
referencias a las cartas de identificaci&oacute;n de las estrellas
(muchas est&aacute;n en Landoldt 1983, copia del cual est&aacute; en
el 2.1m).

 <P>Cabe notar, sin embargo, que no hay en este sistema estrellas
suficientemente rojas como para poder determinar las ecuaciones de
color con suficiente precisi&oacute;n.

 <P>Por esta raz&oacute;n a&uacute;n no tenemos determinados
adecuadamente los t&eacute;rminos de color de la fotometr&iacute;a.
De 11 observaciones de est&aacute;ndares de la lista de UKIRT, durante
las temporadas de Diciembre 1993 y Abril 1994, determinamos puntos
cero preliminares para la fotometr&iacute;a, con una dispersi&oacute;n
del 5%.  Estos puntos cero son:

K' = K'_i + 20.25

H = H_i + 20.45

 <P>El instrumento descrito en este trabajo ha concluido dos etapas
muy importantes y se encuentra en operaci&oacute;n en el
OAN/SPM. Actualmente es el instrumento m&aacute;s avanzado en el
infrarrojo en M&eacute;xico. La calidad de sus datos es comparable y
en algunos casos superior a instrumentos similares construidos por
otros grupos en el mundo.  Su desarrollo ha motivado la
construcci&oacute;n de sistemas a&uacute;n m&aacute;s avanzados, con
&oacute;ptica criog&eacute;nica y detectores sensibles en un intervalo
espectral a&uacute;n mayor y con mayor n&uacute;mero de pixeles.


 <P>El instrumento que se ha entregado al OAN ha producido material
observacional astron&oacute;mico de alta calidad. Algunos datos
obtenidos son muy novedosos y verdaderamente excitantes. Esperamos que
los observadores de CAMILA vean enriquecida su investigaci&oacute;n
con el vasto n&uacute;mero de problemas que pueden atacarse en el
cercano IR. Para nosotros CAMILA ha sido un proyecto maravilloso y una
experiencia invaluable, pues nos ha permitido acercarnos al desarrollo
de instrumentos IR de frontera y realizar observaciones
astron&oacute;micas en un &aacute;rea que actualmente tiene un impulso
enorme, debido al reciente desarrollo de detectores bidimensionales IR
(m&aacute;s sensibles y de mayor formato).

<P>
<B>I Introducci&oacute;n</B>
<P>
Recientemente, el CCD TH 7882 (mejor conocido como &quot;italiano&quot;)
se ha conectado a una PC mediante una interfaz (controlador) provista
por la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a Photometrics denominada AT200. La
conexi&oacute;n se ha conseguido mediante la sustituci&oacute;n
de 4 ROMS en la unidad electr&oacute;nica de la c&aacute;mara
(CE200), lo cual significa que no podr&aacute; conectarse de nuevo
a la computadora Heurikon (con la que originalmente se instalaba),
a menos que se reinstalen las ROMs originales. Tambi&eacute;n
se ha manufacturado una fuente de alimentaci&oacute;n triple,
para proporcionar los voltajes que requiere la unidad electr&oacute;nica
y que antes eran proporcionados por la Heurikon. 
<P>
La adquisici&oacute;n de las im&aacute;genes puede realizarse
ahora mediante un programa elaborado para este fin por Photometrics,
el cual funciona en PC. Este programa se denomina PMIS y funciona
en el ambiente Windows. A continuaci&oacute;n se presenta un procedimiento
resumido de trabajo, as&iacute; como una descripci&oacute;n de
algunas de las opciones; para una descripci&oacute;n m&aacute;s
detallada, cons&uacute;ltese el manual &quot;PMIS, Image Processing
Software. User Manual&quot;.
<P>
El CCD TH 7882 se ha destinado desde principios de 1994 a usarse
en el telescopio de 1.5m de San Pedro M&aacute;rtir, por lo que
algunas referencias har&aacute;n alusi&oacute;n a este telescopio,
aunque la instalaci&oacute;n puede realizarse en cualquiera de
los telescopios.
<HR>

<P>
<B>II Iniciando Operaciones.</B>
<P>
La c&aacute;mara (botella criog&eacute;nica) deber&aacute; estar
instalada en el telescopio y s&oacute;lo cuide que la orientaci&oacute;n
sea la correcta. Generalmente, la c&aacute;mara se instala en
una montura giratoria, pero deber&aacute; cuidarse la orientaci&oacute;n
inicial para no causar problemas a los cables. La unidad electr&oacute;nica
CE200 deber&aacute; estar puesta en la celda del telescopio, con
sus cables debidamente conectados. Si la c&aacute;mara ya tiene
nitr&oacute;geno l&iacute;quido, la unidad CE200 deber&aacute;
estar encendida. El extremo de uno de los cables deber&aacute;
estar conectado al controlador AT200, instalado en una computadora
personal (PC). Si nota alguna anomal&iacute;a o sospecha que hay
algo mal instalado, llame al personal t&eacute;cnico de mantenimiento.
No trate de corregir los problemas usted mismo.
<P>
Si todo est&aacute; correcto encienda la computadora. Cuando haya
concluido todo el proceso normal de arranque de la misma, inicie
WINDOWS mediante el mando WIN. En el panel principal del Manejador
de Programas (Program Manager) aparecer&aacute; el grupo &quot;Photometrics&quot;.
Abra la ventana, si no se encuentra abierta, mediante un doble
&quot;click&quot; del rat&oacute;n y, mediante otro doble &quot;click&quot;,
inicie el programa PMIS. Consulte el manual de Windows si no tiene
experiencia en su uso.
<P>
Aparecer&aacute; la ventana principal cuyo t&iacute;tulo es &quot;PMIS
Image Processing Software&quot;, a la que en lo sucesivo nos referiremos
como &quot;Ventana Principal&quot;. En ella se encuentra la opci&oacute;n
&quot;Help&quot;, que podr&aacute; consultar siempre que tenga
dudas.
<P>
Antes de iniciar el proceso de adquisici&oacute;n, revise la configuraci&oacute;n
del sistema para asegurarse de que los par&aacute;metros son correctos.
Para esto, seleccione la opci&oacute;n &quot;Image | Camera&quot;
de la ventana principal. Los datos correctos para el CCD TH 7882
deben ser los siguientes:
<P>
- Camera Type: TH 7883.
<P>
- Camera Speed: 50 KHz.
<P>
- Data Bits: 14.
<P>
- Controller ID: 2.
<P>
- Continuous Clear Mode <U><B>debe</B></U> estar marcado.
<P>
- Frame Transfer Mode <U><B>no debe</B></U> estar marcado.
<P>
- MPP mode <U><B>no debe</B></U> estar marcado.
<P>
Los dem&aacute;s datos no son modificables.
<HR>

<P>
<B>III Adquisici&oacute;n de Datos.</B>
<P>
En el men&uacute; de la ventana principal, seleccione la opci&oacute;n
&quot;Image&quot;; del correspondiente submen&uacute;, seleccione
la opci&oacute;n &quot;New Image&quot;. Aparecer&aacute; una ventana
con el t&iacute;tulo &quot;Image_1&quot;. A esta ventana secundaria
la denominaremos &quot;ventana de imagen&quot;. 
<P>
Del men&uacute; de esta ventana seleccione la opci&oacute;n &quot;Acquire&quot;,
de cuyo submen&uacute; podr&aacute; seleccionar la opci&oacute;n
que considere pertinente.
<P>
<B>III.1 Bias.</B>
<P>
La unidad electr&oacute;nica s&oacute;lo puede digitalizar voltajes
positivos. Para asegurar que s&oacute;lo se obtienen se&ntilde;ales
positivas, el sistema electr&oacute;nico agrega una componente
de DC o bias a todos los paquetes de carga del CCD. Una adquisici&oacute;n
de bias proporciona, entonces, una medida de esta componente.
Al seleccionar la opci&oacute;n &quot;Bias&quot; del submen&uacute;
&quot;Acquire&quot;, el programa leer&aacute; el bias del sistema
y lo desplegar&aacute; en una ventana con el t&iacute;tulo &quot;Bias&quot;.
Para guardarla, v&eacute;ase la secci&oacute;n IV.
<P>
<B>III.2 Dark.</B>
<P>
Con esta opci&oacute;n puede obtenerse una imagen de corriente
obscura, la cual proporciona una medida de la cantidad de carga
acumulada en la superficie del CCD en ausencia de luz. La imagen
obtenida se despliega en una ventana con el t&iacute;tulo &quot;Dark&quot;.
Al restar la imagen de corriente obscura de una exposici&oacute;n
normal se corrige tanto por corriente obscura como por la componente
de bias. Al seleccionar la opci&oacute;n &quot;Dark&quot; se desplegar&aacute;
una ventana de di&aacute;logo en la que se podr&aacute; asignar
el tiempo de integraci&oacute;n.
<P>
<B>III.3 Flat Field.</B>
<P>
La obtenci&oacute;n de &quot;flat-fields&quot; o campos planos
tiene como prop&oacute;sito la correcci&oacute;n de las peque&ntilde;as
variaciones de ganancia de pixel a pixel en el CCD, as&iacute;
como las variaciones espaciales de baja frecuencia. Al seleccionar
esta opci&oacute;n, la imagen obtenida se almacenar&aacute; con
el nombre de &quot;Flat field&quot;.
<P>
<B>III.4 Expose.</B>
<P>
<B>Expose n.</B>
<P>
Estas opciones iniciar&aacute;n el proceso de adquirir una imagen
y la almacenar&aacute;n en la memoria destinada a la imagen actual.
El proceso consiste en limpiar el CCD cierto n&uacute;mero de
veces (opcional; v&eacute;ase la secci&oacute;n &quot;Ganancia
y Prelimpieza del CCD&quot;), abrir el obturador el tiempo de
exposici&oacute;n indicado, cerrar el obturador y transferir la
imagen de la c&aacute;mara a la memoria. Si la ventana de imagen
est&aacute; visible y la bandera de redespliegue autom&aacute;tico
est&aacute; puesta, la imagen recientemente adquirida se desplegar&aacute;
usando el modo de despliegue activo. <I>Expose n</I> ejecuta la
exposici&oacute;n usando el &uacute;ltimo tiempo de exposici&oacute;n
seleccionado; <I>Expose</I> mostrar&aacute; una ventana de di&aacute;logo
que permite al usuario seleccionar el tiempo de exposici&oacute;n
deseado. Para tiempos de exposici&oacute;n largos (mayores que
20 s) se desplegar&aacute; en ambos casos una ventana adicional
titulada &quot;Abort&quot; que mostrar&aacute; el progreso de
la exposici&oacute;n, al mismo tiempo que permitir&aacute; al
usuario cancelar la exposici&oacute;n antes de que termine.
<P>
<U><B>NOTA:</B></U> Cuando una exposici&oacute;n se cancela antes
de que termine por s&iacute; sola, <B>el obturador se queda abierto</B>.
En este caso, deber&aacute; tenerse el cuidado de cerrar el obturador
tecleando el mando en l&iacute;nea &quot;CSHUT&quot; en la ventana
principal. Para esto, active la ventana principal y despu&eacute;s
del prompt &quot;Cli&gt;&quot; teclee <B>CSHUT</B> seguido de
&lt;Return&gt;.
<P>
<B>III.5 Focus.</B>
<P>
Esta opci&oacute;n realiza la exposici&oacute;n continua de un
&aacute;rea rectangular de la superficie del CCD; se detiene hasta
que el usuario oprime la tecla &lt;Esc&gt; o hasta que oprime
el bot&oacute;n derecho del rat&oacute;n. Para iniciar el procedimiento,
primero seleccione el tiempo de exposici&oacute;n correcto mediante
la opci&oacute;n Expose, descrita en el p&aacute;rrafo anterior.
Luego, seleccione la opci&oacute;n &quot;ROI&quot; del men&uacute;
principal y del correspondiente submen&uacute; seleccione &quot;New&quot;.
Ahora coloque el cursor del rat&oacute;n en el punto donde estar&aacute;
la esquina superior izquierda del rect&aacute;ngulo deseado, oprima
el bot&oacute;n izquierdo del rat&oacute;n y, sin soltar el bot&oacute;n,
arr&aacute;strelo hasta que se dibuje el rect&aacute;ngulo deseado.
Suelte entonces el bot&oacute;n y el rect&aacute;ngulo habr&aacute;
quedado dibujado. Seleccione la opci&oacute;n &quot;Focus&quot;
del submen&uacute; &quot;Acquire&quot; y el sistema iniciar&aacute;
la exposici&oacute;n continua, transfiriendo s&oacute;lo los pixeles
de la zona seleccionada; los datos obtenidos se sobreescribir&aacute;n
en los anteriores. Esto permitir&aacute; al usuario enfocar el
objeto de inter&eacute;s. El usuario deber&aacute; haber realizado
la adquisici&oacute;n de una imagen completa con anterioridad,
para tener un marco de referencia para la selecci&oacute;n del
rect&aacute;ngulo de inter&eacute;s.
<P>
<U><B>NOTA:</B></U><B> </B>Si el usuario no selecciona un rect&aacute;ngulo
dentro de la imagen completa antes de seleccionar &quot;Focus&quot;,
el sistema realizar&aacute; la exposici&oacute;n continua de la
imagen completa, lo cual puede resultar muy tardado para un proceso
de enfoque.
<HR>

<P>
<B>IV Almacenamiento de las im&aacute;genes.</B>
<P>
Es posible almacenar las im&aacute;genes en cuatro formatos diferentes:
PMI, FITS, TIFF y BMP. 
<P>
<B>a) PMI. </B>El formato PMI es un formato nativo de Photometrics
y s&oacute;lo deber&aacute; usarse en caso de que las im&aacute;genes
vayan a seguirse usando con el programa PMIS. Para guardar las
im&aacute;genes en este formato, &uacute;sese las opciones &quot;Save&quot;
o &quot;Save as&quot; del submen&uacute; &quot;File&quot; de las
ventanas de imagen.
<P>
<B>b) FITS.</B> Este formato es el m&aacute;s recomendable para
im&aacute;genes astron&oacute;micas, ya que pueden importarse
f&aacute;cilmente despu&eacute;s con IRAF y otras utiler&iacute;as
de estaciones UNIX. Las im&aacute;genes se guardan en formato
de 16 bits por pixel. Para guardar las im&aacute;genes en formato
FITS, seleccione la opci&oacute;n &quot;Export&quot; del submen&uacute;
&quot;File&quot; y, en seguida, seleccione &quot;FITS 16&quot;.
En la ventana de di&aacute;logo que aparece despu&eacute;s, as&iacute;gnele
el nombre que desee. Para leer despu&eacute;s las im&aacute;genes
con IRAF, use el mando &quot;rfits&quot; de IRAF.
<P>
<B>c) BMP </B>y <B>TIFF</B>. Estos formatos no son recomendables
ya que guardan las im&aacute;genes comprimiendo los pixeles en
8 bits. S&oacute;lo deber&aacute;n usarse si se trabajar&aacute;n
las im&aacute;genes despu&eacute;s con alguna utiler&iacute;a
de PC que emplee alguno de estos formatos como el &quot;Paintbrush&quot;.
<P>
<U><B>NOTA:</B></U><B> </B>Antes de guardar la imagen, p&oacute;ngale
un comentario para que la pueda identificar posteriormente. Esto
es posible hacerlo, seleccionando &quot;File | Image info&quot;
y escribiendo el comentario en el lugar identificado como &quot;Image
comment&quot; en la ventana de di&aacute;logo que se presenta.
Pueden escribirse hasta 100 caracteres como comentario.
<P>
<B>IV.1 El proceso de almacenamiento.</B>
<P>
Actualmente pueden almacenarse algunas im&aacute;genes en el disco
duro de la PC, pero lo m&aacute;s recomendable es almacenarlas
en el disco remoto declarado como la unidad &quot;L:&quot;. Este
en realidad es un directorio en la SUN &quot;estopa&quot;, que
lleva el nombre de &quot;ccd1_5&quot;. Para escribir las im&aacute;genes
s&oacute;lo basta con elegir como unidad a &quot;L:&quot; en la
ventana de di&aacute;logo que aparece despu&eacute;s de elegir
&quot;File | Export | FITS 16&quot; y no es necesario iniciar
ninguna sesi&oacute;n en &quot;estopa&quot;. Despu&eacute;s podr&aacute;n
trabajarse con IRAF si se desea o almacenarse en una cinta &quot;exabyte&quot;,
para lo cual s&iacute; se necesitar&aacute; iniciar una sesi&oacute;n
en &quot;estopa&quot;. La clave es &quot;ccd1_5&quot; y la contrase&ntilde;a
(password) tambi&eacute;n es &quot;ccd1_5&quot;.
<P>
Si se almacenan las im&aacute;genes en el disco duro de la PC
y se desea guardarlas en cintas &quot;exabyte&quot;, deber&aacute;n
transferirse primero a la SUN mediante la utiler&iacute;a &quot;FTP&quot;,
en modo binario, o mediante el mando &quot;copy&quot; en la PC,
poniendo como destino la unidad &quot;L:&quot;. Existe lugar para
guardar c&oacute;modamente unas 300 im&aacute;genes en la unidad
&quot;L:&quot; (cada imagen ocupa un total de 446400 bytes en
formato FITS), pero para esto es necesario que cada usuario borre
las im&aacute;genes adquiridas despu&eacute;s de haberlas respaldado.
As&iacute;, si el usuario anterior no borr&oacute; sus im&aacute;genes
de &quot;L:&quot;, si&eacute;ntase en libertad de borrarlas. En
el futuro cercano existir&aacute; una unidad de respaldo (exabyte
o compatible) conectada a la PC.
<P>
Existe en el directorio &quot;ccd1_5&quot; de la SUN un programa
llamado tambi&eacute;n &quot;ccd1_5&quot; que permite ir numerando
de manera autom&aacute;tica las im&aacute;genes. Para hacer uso
de esto, es necesario el siguiente procedimiento: inicie una sesi&oacute;n
en la SUN usando el &quot;telnet&quot;, accesando la clave &quot;ccd1_5&quot;;
ejecute el programa &quot;ccd1_5&quot;; responda con un prefijo
que sea representativo de la serie de im&aacute;genes que se guardar&aacute;n
(se sugiere un prefijo de a lo m&aacute;s 5 caracteres si se piensa
leer de nuevo las im&aacute;genes en una PC). El programa quedar&aacute;
corriendo esperando a que se guarden los archivos con las im&aacute;genes.
<P>
C&aacute;mbiese a la ventana que desee en el PMIS y, cuando necesite
guardar una imagen, gu&aacute;rdela con el nombre &quot;imagen.fit&quot;
en la unidad &quot;L:&quot;. Las im&aacute;genes que se guarden
con cualquier otro nombre quedar&aacute;n con el nombre inalterado;
s&oacute;lo se renombrar&aacute;n las que se guarden como &quot;imagen.fit&quot;.
<P>
Ejemplo: Despu&eacute;s de ejecutar &quot;ccd1_5&quot; se responde
con el prefijo &quot;jul7_&quot;. Entonces, al guardar un archivo
como &quot;imagen .fit&quot;, se renombrar&aacute; como &quot;jul7_001.fit&quot;.
El siguiente archivo que se reciba con el nombre de &quot;imagen.fit&quot;
llevar&aacute; el nombre de &quot;jul7_002.fit&quot; y as&iacute;
sucesivamente.
<P>
<U><B>NOTA:</B></U> Este procedimiento es opcional y puede trabajarse
sin necesidad de utilizarlo. De hecho, si la sesi&oacute;n en
la SUN se inicia desde la PC, todos los procesos se har&aacute;n
lentos, ya que habr&aacute; que mantener abierta la sesi&oacute;n
de <I>telnet</I>.
<HR>

<P>
<B>V Utiler&iacute;as de despliegue.</B>
<P>
En el submen&uacute; &quot;display&quot; existen varias opciones
que son autoexplicativas y s&oacute;lo haremos &eacute;nfasis
en algunas de ellas.
<P>
<B>V.1 Scaling.</B>
<P>
Los valores de los pixeles obtenidos de una c&aacute;mara pueden
tener hasta 16 bits significativos, lo cual implica 65536 niveles
(en el caso del sistema TH 7882, se obtienen 14 bits significativos,
o sean 16384 niveles). Sin embargo, los sistemas de despliegue
de video com&uacute;nmente no despliegan m&aacute;s de 256 colores
o 64 niveles de gris simult&aacute;neamente. Por lo tanto, es
necesario elegir un m&eacute;todo para traducir la intensidad
de la imagen en &iacute;ndices de despliegue. Existen, en este
caso, 8 elecciones.
<P>
<B>a.- Optimal non-linear.</B> Este m&eacute;todo usa el histograma
de niveles de grises para determinar una funci&oacute;n no lineal
que optimiza el contraste de la imagen. F&iacute;sicamente, los
valores de los pixeles de entrada se asocian a una intensidad
de salida para producir un histograma de intensidades lo m&aacute;s
parecido a una l&iacute;nea recta.
<P>
<B>b. - Dynamic Min/Max. </B>Este m&eacute;todo calcula una funci&oacute;n
lineal para desplegar todos los valores de pixeles comprendidos
entre los valores m&iacute;nimo y m&aacute;ximo calculados para
toda la imagen. Cabe hacer notar nuevamente que, en el caso del
sistema TH 7882, se obtienen 14 bits significativos, por lo que
la cuenta m&aacute;xima ser&iacute;a 16383.
<P>
<B>c.- Gamma Function. </B>En este caso el programa asocia una
funci&oacute;n gamma, con el &iacute;ndice indicado por el usuario.
Si el &iacute;ndice es igual a 1 la funci&oacute;n coincide con
una funci&oacute;n lineal. Este m&eacute;todo no est&aacute; documentado
y, aparentemente, la funci&oacute;n gamma toma en cuenta s&oacute;lo
los valores de pixeles comprendidos entre los valores m&iacute;nimo
y m&aacute;ximo calculados para toda la imagen.
<P>
<B>d.- Fixed Min/Max. </B>Este m&eacute;todo permite al usuario
desplegar un intervalo de valores fijado de manera arbitraria
usando una funci&oacute;n lineal. Esto es necesario muchas veces
para evitar los problemas de escalamiento asociados con valores
m&iacute;nimo o m&aacute;ximo de pixeles en zonas no deseables
de la imagen. Este m&eacute;todo permite un despliegue m&aacute;s
r&aacute;pido que los anteriores.
<P>
<B>e.- Shift n bits. </B>Este m&eacute;todo puede usarse para
desplegar cualquier cualquier campo consecutivo de 8 bits dentro
de los 16 bits asociados al pixel.
<P>
<B>f.- High Byte.</B>
<P>
<B>g.- Low Byte.</B> Estos dos m&eacute;todos son similares y
usan directamente el byte alto o el byte bajo, respectivamente,
como &iacute;ndice de despliegue.
<P>
<B>h.- Frozen. </B>Este no es un m&eacute;todo de escalamiento
para despliegue. Es un estado que evita que se modifiquen los
arreglos de despliegue para permitir que se carguen arreglos de
escalamiento definidos por el usuario. Tambi&eacute;n indica al
usuario que ninguno de los m&eacute;todos internos disponibles
se encuentra activo. V&eacute;ase en el manual el mando en l&iacute;nea
&quot;LOAD SCALE&quot;.
<P>
<B>V.2 Show Cursor/Hide Cursor.</B>
<P>
Esta opci&oacute;n permite ver u ocultar, en la parte inferior
de la ventana de imagen, las coordenadas relativas en pixeles
asociadas al cursor del rat&oacute;n con respecto a la imagen
desplegada, as&iacute; como el valor de la intensidad del pixel
correspondiente.
<P>
<B>V.3 Show Status/Hide Status.</B>
<P>
Esta opci&oacute;n controla la visibilidad de la ventana de status
de la imagen correspondiente, la cual se despliega a la derecha
de la ventana de imagen. Los elementos que es posible desplegar
son los siguientes:
<P>
-<B> Flag</B>: Este rengl&oacute;n puede desplegar alguno de los
siguientes caracteres:
<P>
U El despliegue de la imagen es inv&aacute;lido; se requiere una
actualizaci&oacute;n.
<P>
F El escalamiento de datos en &quot;Focus&quot; est&aacute; activo.
<P>
R Una regi&oacute;n de inter&eacute;s (ROI) en la imagen est&aacute;
activa.
<P>
Y Un pol&iacute;gono est&aacute; activo.
<P>
S Datos salvados autom&aacute;ticamente en un archivo.
<P>
P Datos protegidos.
<P>
-<B> Imin</B>: Despliega el valor m&iacute;nimo de intensidades
en la imagen.
<P>
- <B>Imax</B>: Despliega el valor m&aacute;ximo de intensidades
en la imagen.
<P>
-<B> Iavg</B>: Despliega el valor promedio de intensidades en
la imagen.
<P>
- <B>Istd</B>: Despliega la desviaci&oacute;n est&aacute;ndar
de las intensidades de la imagen.
<P>
-<B> Iamd</B>: Despliega la desviaci&oacute;n media absoluta de
las intensidades de la imagen.
<P>
- <B>Dist</B>: Despliega la distancia entre dos puntos en la imagen,
determinados por la opci&oacute;n &quot;Process | Measure | Distance&quot;
(v&eacute;ase la secci&oacute;n &quot;Procesamiento b&aacute;sico&quot;).
<P>
- <B>Angl</B>: Despliega el &aacute;ngulo de la l&iacute;nea que
une dos puntos en la imagen, determinados por la opci&oacute;n
&quot;Process | Measure | Distance&quot;.
<P>
-<B> Ival</B>:
<P>
- <B>Xpos</B>:
<P>
- <B>Ypos</B>: Despliegan los valores de las coordenadas y de
intensidad del punto determinado por la opci&oacute;n &quot;Process
| Measure | Intensity&quot;.
<HR>

<P>
<B>VI Procesamiento B&aacute;sico.</B>
<P>
Existen varias funciones de procesamiento bajo el submen&uacute;
&quot;Process&quot;. A continuaci&oacute;n se describen las m&aacute;s
&uacute;tiles.
<P>
<B>VI.1 Measure. </B>
<P>
Permite hacer alguna estad&iacute;stica elemental de la imagen
bajo las opciones &quot;Image Min/Max&quot;, &quot;Image Avg/Std&quot;,
&quot;Image Stats&quot;, &quot;Intensity&quot; y &quot;Distance&quot;,
desplegando los resultados en la ventana de status. Las tres primeras
opciones son inmediatas. La opci&oacute;n &quot;Intensity&quot;
requiere de que se marque el punto deseado colocando el cursor
del rat&oacute;n y oprimiendo el bot&oacute;n izquierdo del mismo.
Para la opci&oacute;n &quot;Distance&quot;, deber&aacute; colocarse
el cursor del rat&oacute;n en el primer punto deseado, oprimirse
el bot&oacute;n izquierdo del mismo y, sin soltarlo, arrastrar
el cursor hasta el segundo punto; en la ventana de status se ir&aacute;n
desplegando los valores para la distancia y el &aacute;ngulo.
Al soltar el bot&oacute;n se quedar&aacute;n fijos tales valores.
<P>
<B>VI.2 Pixel &lt;op&gt;...</B>
<P>
Realiza operaciones en cada pixel de la imagen. (Inversi&oacute;n,
Negaci&oacute;n, Rotaci&oacute;n l&oacute;gica, Desplazamiento
l&oacute;gico y Valor absoluto).
<P>
<B>VI.3 Image &lt;op&gt;...</B>
<P>
Ejecuta operaciones en la imagen misma como rotaciones positivas
o negativas, inversiones a espejo en X o en Y y desplazamiento
de cierto n&uacute;mero de renglones o de columnas, as&iacute;
como copias de una imagen.
<P>
<B>VI.4 Image &lt;op&gt; pixel...</B>
<P>
Bajo esta opci&oacute;n es posible realizar operaciones sobre
cada pixel de la imagen, con una constante como operando. Entre
las operaciones posibles est&aacute;n Suma, Resta, Multiplicaci&oacute;n,
Divisi&oacute;n, And l&oacute;gico, Or l&oacute;gico y Xor l&oacute;gico,
as&iacute; como acotaciones superior o inferior (Minimum o Maximum).
<P>
<B>VI.5 Image &lt;op&gt; Image...</B>
<P>
En este caso es posible realizar operaciones entre dos im&aacute;genes,
pixel a pixel. Entre las operaciones posibles est&aacute;n Suma,
Resta, Multiplicaci&oacute;n, Divisi&oacute;n, And l&oacute;gico,
Or l&oacute;gico y Xor l&oacute;gico, as&iacute; como acotaciones
superior o inferior (Minimum o Maximum).
<P>
<B>VI.6 Image Filters...</B>
<P>
El programa tiene implementados algunos filtros (Sobel, Laplace,
Mediana) que no se consideran de mucho inter&eacute;s, sobre todo
si se piensa hacer el an&aacute;lisis de los datos a trav&eacute;s
de IRAF.
<P>
<B>VI.7 Data Scaling...</B>
<P>
Esta opci&oacute;n es id&eacute;ntica a &quot;Display | Scaling&quot;,
con la diferencia de que en este caso los datos s&iacute; son
alterados y convertidos en datos de 8 bits y no s&oacute;lo reescalados
para el despliegue.
<P>
<B>VI.8 Data Correction.</B>
<P>
Bajo esta opci&oacute;n es posible realizar una de cuatro posibles
correcciones: Flat Field, Subtract Dark, Subtract Bias y Subtract
Reference. Para realizar la correcci&oacute;n es necesario haber
adquirido la imagen correspondiente (Flat field, dark, bias o
reference) y tenerla en su propia ventana, as&iacute; como la
imagen a corregir.
<HR>

<P>
<B>VII Graficado.</B>
<P>
Bajo el submen&uacute; &quot;Plot&quot; existen varias opciones
para obtener representaciones gr&aacute;ficas de los datos de
la imagen. Es posible copiar la gr&aacute;fica obtenida usando
la opci&oacute;n &quot;Copy&quot; de la ventana de gr&aacute;ficas.
Esta opci&oacute;n transfiere una tabla con los datos al &quot;Clipboard&quot;
del Windows y puede recuperarse con cualquier editor de texto
(NotePad, Word, Write, etc.) o con cualquier hoja de c&aacute;lculo
(Qpro, Works, etc.) que trabaje bajo Windows, usando la opci&oacute;n
&quot;Paste&quot;. Las opciones de graficado son las siguientes:
<P>
<B>VII.1 Histogram.</B>
<P>
Produce un despliegue gr&aacute;fico de la distribuci&oacute;n
de los valores de intensidad de los pixeles.
<P>
<B>VII.2 Row.</B>
<P>
Produce una gr&aacute;fica de la intensidad de los pixeles a lo
largo del rengl&oacute;n especificado. Al seleccionar esta opci&oacute;n,
use el rat&oacute;n para seleccionar el rengl&oacute;n de inter&eacute;s.
Al oprimir el bot&oacute;n izquierdo del rat&oacute;n, los datos
para la gr&aacute;fica son transferidos y desplegados. 
<P>
<B>VII.3 Column.</B>
<P>
Funciona de igual manera que Row, pero para la columna correspondiente.
<P>
<B>VII.4 Line.</B>
<P>
Produce una gr&aacute;fica de intensidad de los pixeles a lo largo
de una l&iacute;nea recta arbitraria trazada sobre la imagen.
Para definir las coordenadas de los extremos de la l&iacute;nea,
oprima el bot&oacute;n izquierdo del rat&oacute;n y, sin soltar
el bot&oacute;n, arrastre el cursor al otro punto extremo. La
l&iacute;nea trazada indica el conjunto de datos que ser&aacute;n
graficados. Al soltar el bot&oacute;n se producir&aacute; la gr&aacute;fica
respectiva.
<P>
<B>VII.5 3D View.</B>
<P>
Esta opci&oacute;n permite obtener una representaci&oacute;n tridimensional
de la imagen. En este caso es posible cambiar el &aacute;ngulo
de rotaci&oacute;n alrededor del eje Z y alrededor del eje Y,
as&iacute; como la distancia al centro y el factor de reducci&oacute;n
de los datos. Como sugerencia, puede elegirse la rotaci&oacute;n
alrededor de Z entre -30 y +30 grados, la rotaci&oacute;n alrededor
de Y entre +10 y +60 grados y el factor de distancia entre 200
y 1000. Para el factor de reducci&oacute;n es necesario tener
en cuenta que factores altos producir&aacute;n gr&aacute;ficas
de baja resoluci&oacute;n, pero m&aacute;s r&aacute;pidamente.
<HR>

<P>
<B>VIII Binning y lectura de subarreglos.</B>
<P>
Binning es el proceso de combinar la carga de pixeles adyacentes
antes de la digitalizaci&oacute;n. Esto incrementa la relaci&oacute;n
se&ntilde;al/ruido, pero disminuye la resoluci&oacute;n espacial
en la superficie del CCD. Es posible hacer &quot;binning&quot;
en el CCD de manera independiente en las direcciones serie y paralela
(horizontal y vertical). Para esto, selecci&oacute;nese la opci&oacute;n
&quot;Acquire | CCD Format&quot; en la ventana de imagen o la
opci&oacute;n &quot;Image | CCD Format&quot; de la ventada principal.
Aparecer&aacute; entonces una ventana de di&aacute;logo en el
que es posible modificar los factores de binning serie y paralelo.
Al modificar cualquiera de estos factores, se sugiere oprimir
el bot&oacute;n &quot;Binned CCD&quot; para que el programa calcule
autom&aacute;ticamente los tama&ntilde;os m&aacute;ximos de los
subarreglos Serie y Paralelo. Una vez hecho esto, es posible modificar
los or&iacute;genes de lectura, siempre y cuando la suma del origen
m&aacute;s el factor de binning multiplicado por el tama&ntilde;o
del subarreglo no exceda las dimensiones f&iacute;sicas del CCD
en ninguna de las direcciones. 
<P>
<U><B>NOTA:</B></U><B> </B>El origen del subarreglo est&aacute;
dado en t&eacute;rminos de pixeles f&iacute;sicos en el CCD, mientras
que el tama&ntilde;o del subarreglo est&aacute; dado en t&eacute;rminos
de pixeles l&oacute;gicos (1 pixel l&oacute;gico es igual a tantos
pixeles f&iacute;sicos como indique el factor de binning).
<P>
Para regresar al estado normal (no &quot;binneado&quot;), s&oacute;lo
oprima el bot&oacute;n &quot;Unbinned CCD&quot; o cambie directamente
los valores de los factores de binning a 1, sin olvidar regresar
el tama&ntilde;o del subarreglo a los valores correctos. Si el
origen del subarreglo es 0,0 el tama&ntilde;o del subarreglo debe
coincidir con el tama&ntilde;o total del CCD (384 x 576 en el
caso del TH 7882).
<HR>

<P>
<B>IX Ganancia y prelimpieza del CCD.</B>
<P>
En la misma ventana de di&aacute;logo que se presenta para la
opci&oacute;n &quot;CCD Format&quot;, es posible seleccionar el
factor de ganancia. Los &uacute;nicos n&uacute;meros v&aacute;lidos
son 1 y 4. 
<P>
La siguiente tabla muestra los valores correspondientes para la
ganancia en electrones/ADU, el ruido de lectura y el nivel medio
del Bias:
<HR>

<P>
<TABLE FRAME=HSIDES RULES=COLS BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=4><COL ALIGN=CENTER><THEAD VALIGN=TOP><TR>
<P>
<TH><B> Ganancia (PMIS) <TH> Ganancia (e-/ADU) <TH> Ruido de lectura

<P>
<TD> 4 <TD> 5.4 <TD> 5.8 <TD> 397 <TR>
<P>
</TBODY></TABLE> 
<HR>

<P>
Tambi&eacute;n es posible cambiar en esta ventana el n&uacute;mero
de veces que debe limpiarse el CCD antes de cada adquisici&oacute;n
normal (pre-exposure clear count). Esta prelimpieza del CCD remueve
cualquier carga que pueda acumularse durante los per&iacute;odos
inactivos. Se han encontrado adecuados valores entre 3 y 5 aunque,
normalmente, este n&uacute;mero puede ponerse en 0, ya que se
ha activado el modo de limpieza continua (Continuous Clear Mode).
V&eacute;ase la secci&oacute;n &quot;Sugerencias Adicionales&quot;.
<P>
<U><B>NOTA:</B></U><B> </B>Al efectuar una exposici&oacute;n normal
deber&aacute; tenerse el cuidado de que las im&aacute;genes de
correcci&oacute;n (Flat Field, Dark, Reference) hayan sido tomadas
tambi&eacute;n con la misma ganancia. Si se adquieren con una
ganancia diferente a la de la imagen a corregir, se tendr&aacute;
una correcci&oacute;n err&oacute;nea.
<HR>

<P>
<B>X Sugerencias Adicionales.</B>
<P>
Como es posible que cada usuario tenga la curiosidad de ver qu&eacute;
pasa con las opciones que no sean muy obvias, podr&iacute;a cambiar
en el camino par&aacute;metros que son importantes para el buen
funcionamiento del sistema. Aqu&iacute; enumeramos algunos de
los datos que podr&iacute;an revisarse en caso de observar un
comportamiento no adecuado en la adquisici&oacute;n de las im&aacute;genes.
<P>
<B>a. Opci&oacute;n &quot;Image | Camera&quot; de la ventana principal.
</B>Aunque esta opci&oacute;n ya se mecion&oacute; en la secci&oacute;n
II, la mencionamos de nuevo a continuaci&oacute;n por completez.
En esta opci&oacute;n se definen par&aacute;metros que el usuario
no deber&iacute;a modificar. Los datos correctos para el CCD TH
7882 deben ser los siguientes:
<P>
- Camera Type: TH 7883.
<P>
- Camera Speed: 50 KHz.
<P>
- Data Bits: 14.
<P>
- Controller ID: 2.
<P>
- Continuous Clear Mode <U><B>debe</B></U> estar marcado.
<P>
- Frame Transfer Mode <U><B>no debe</B></U> estar marcado.
<P>
- MPP mode <U><B>no debe</B></U> estar marcado.
<P>
Los dem&aacute;s datos no son modificables.
<P>
<B>b. Opci&oacute;n &quot;Options | Pseudo-Color (Monochrome)&quot;
de la ventana principal. </B>El sistema se ha configurado para
que el modo de despliegue normal sea monocrom&aacute;tico. Sin
embargo, con esta opci&oacute;n es posible cambiarlo a &quot;pseudo-color&quot;.
Si el modo es monocrom&aacute;tico, es posible accesar la opci&oacute;n
&quot;Modify Lut&quot;, cuyo funcionamiento es en principio similar
a la opci&oacute;n &quot;Display | Scaling&quot; de la ventana
de imagen, aunque las posibilidades son diferentes. Esta opci&oacute;n
no est&aacute; accesible si el modo es &quot;pseudo-color&quot;.
En cualquiera de los dos modos, se tiene accesible la opci&oacute;n
&quot;Load LUT&quot;, la que permite al usuario traer una de las
diferentes tablas de color disponibles. Si la tabla cargada es
&quot;MDEFAULT.LUT&quot;, el despliegue se pone en modo monocrom&aacute;tico.
En cualquier otro caso, el modo sera &quot;pseudo-color&quot;.
<P>
<B>c. Submen&uacute; &quot;Options&quot; de la ventana de imagen.</B>
En este submen&uacute; se han marcado las opciones &quot;Display
Data&quot; y &quot;Auto-Display&quot; y se han dejado sin marcar
las opciones &quot;Auto-save&quot; y &quot;Protect Data&quot;,
por permitir una manera c&oacute;moda de trabajar. El usuario
podr&iacute;a configurar estas opciones a su gusto aunque marcaremos
algunos pros y contras: 
<P>
- Si &quot;Display Data&quot; se desactiva permite que el sistema
sea m&aacute;s din&aacute;mico al realizar una adquisici&oacute;n
o una operaci&oacute;n de procesamiento, pero no permite ver el
resultado sino hasta volver a activar esta opci&oacute;n.
<P>
- Si &quot;Auto-Display&quot; se desactiva, cuando una imagen
se modifique por cualquier m&eacute;todo, la imagen no se actualizar&aacute;
y el usuario tendr&aacute; que seleccionar la opci&oacute;n &quot;Display
| Refresh&quot; de la ventana de imagen. Una imagen no actualizada
se reconoce por el signo de admiraci&oacute;n (!) que antecede
al t&iacute;tulo de la ventana.
<P>
- Si se activa &quot;Auto-Save&quot;, la imagen se estar&aacute;
salvando continuamente en un archivo del disco con cada modificaci&oacute;n
que sufra. Esto puede ser conveniente en algunos casos, pero tiene
los siguientes inconvenientes: 
<P>
- la imagen se salva en formato &quot;PMI&quot;; 
<P>
- ocupa un lugar in&uacute;til en el disco y
<P>
- el tiempo que tarda el programa en guardar la imagen es tiempo
muerto para el usuario.
<P>
- &quot;Protect Data&quot; en estado activo permite que al sufrir
cualquier modificaci&oacute;n la imagen, la resultante forma una
imagen separada. Esto puede ser &uacute;til cuando se quiera comparar
el resultado de una operaci&oacute;n con la imagen original, pero,
si no se tiene el cuidado necesario, podr&iacute;a provocar la
saturaci&oacute;n del sistema con un exceso de ventanas.
<P>
<B>d. Si el sistema se nota lento. </B>Si no es estrictamente
necesario, procure no abrir m&aacute;s aplicaciones aparte de
PMIS cuando se est&eacute;n realizando adquisiciones. Aplicaciones
adicionales har&aacute;n m&aacute;s lento el despliegue as&iacute;
como varias de las otras operaciones. <U><B>NOTA:</B></U> Esto
no se aplica al proceso de adquisici&oacute;n, ya que &eacute;ste
es independiente de la computadora.
<P>
<B>e. Una nota para el personal t&eacute;cnico de mantenimiento
sobre el proceso de instalaci&oacute;n. </B>
<P>
- Instale la c&aacute;mara (botella criog&eacute;nica identificada
como &quot;ccd italiano&quot;) en el telescopio, cuidando la orientaci&oacute;n.

<P>
- Monte la unidad electr&oacute;nica CE200 en la celda del telescopio.

<P>
- Conecte el cable correspondiente (DB25) al controlador AT200,
previamente instalado en una PC. 
<P>
- Si no identifica el controlador o si no se encuentra instalado,
comun&iacute;quese con el coordinador de mantenimiento. 
<P>
- Conecte el otro extremo del cable (DB37) a la unidad electr&oacute;nica
CE200.
<P>
- Conecte ahora el cable que sale de la unidad CE200 a la botella
criog&eacute;nica (c&aacute;mara). 
<P>
- Conecte ahora el cable de alimentaci&oacute;n de la unidad CE200
y enci&eacute;ndala.
<P>
- Proceda ahora a llenar con nitr&oacute;geno l&iacute;quido.
<P>
<U><B>Precauciones:</B></U>
<P>
- Nunca conecte o desconecte ning&uacute;n cable si el sistema
no est&aacute; apagado.
<P>
- Instale el conector cortocircuitado en la c&aacute;mara siempre
que no tenga conectado su cable.
<P>
- El sistema ha sido configurado para funcionar con 110V AC a
60 Hz. No lo conecte a otro tipo de fuentes de alimentaci&oacute;n.
<P>
- No obstruya el libre flujo de aire, tanto a la unidad CE200
como a la PC que alberga al controlador AT200.
<P>
- Nunca ponga nitr&oacute;geno l&iacute;quido a la c&aacute;mara
si la unidad CE200 no est&aacute; encendida.

The coefficients may change with time, because of e.g. varying amount
of dust on the filter.  Therefore, if the neutral density filter is
used in connection with observations of primary standard stars,
accurate transmission coefficients should be determined on each night
by observing stars of suitable magnitudes with and without the filter.

<P><A NAME="depolarizer"><EM>2. Depolarizer </EM></A>

<P>As the reflectivity of the grating and the beamsplitter in the
H&#223; section depends on the direction of polarization of the light,
polarized stars may deviate systematically from unpolarized stars in
the measured indices.  For a star with a polarization degree of 0.10
mag the maximum deviation is of the order of 0.092 mag.  In order to
avoid this effect a depolarizer can be pushed into the beam before the
entrance slit.  It consists of a super achromatic lambda 2 retardation
plate, which rotates with a frequency of 1.5 Hz.  It causes a light
loss of about 10%.

<P><A NAME="grating"><EM>4.  Adjustment of grating tilt </EM></A>

<P> The grating-angle may be changed by turning a micrometer screw, the
position of which is shown on a meter.  Half a turn of the meter
-i.e. 0.1 units - corresponds to a wavelength shift of the spectrum of
10&Aring;.  Increasing number on the meter corresponds to increasing
wavelength for a given point on the exit-slot unit. 

<P> The long wavelength of the edge of the b-slot (4801&Aring;)
happens to be very close to the wavelength of a strong Cd line at
4799.9&Aring;.  This can be used to find the correct setting of the
grating.  Illuminate the dome wall with a Cd spectral lamp.  Wait 5
min for the lamp to heat up.  Point the telescope against the wall,
and measure the signal in the b-channel, while turning the grating
meter in steps of e.g. 0.02 units from 0.3 to 0.6.  Use the small
diaphragm No. 5.  The result of two scans is shown in Figure 3.  As
seen the Cd line is centred on the edge of the b-slot for a meter
position of 0.471.  The correct setting is then obtained by adding
0.011 units corresponding to the difference between 4801&Aring; and
4799.9&Aring;.  

<P> Alternatively the grating setting may be found by
inserting the narrow H&#223; slit in the v-band and scanning a star with
a suitable strength of the H&#223; absorption line.  The minimum in the
signal will then determine the grating setting.  This method, however,
requires good seeing and a very accurate traching of the telescope.

<P>It is recommended to determine the grating setting each time the
photometer is mounted on the telescope.  Normally the setting remains
the same for a whole observing period.  The effect of nightly
temperature variations is negligible small.

<P><A NAME="filters"><EM>5. Optical filters and exit slot</EM></A>

<P>The spectral response of the photometer is defined by the filters and
- in case of uvby - the exit slots.  The wavelengths of the slot edges
correspond to filter transmissions of 15%.  Table 1 gives effective
wavelengths, half-widths and peak transmissions of the filters as well
as the wavelengths of the slot edges.  Detailed transmission curves of
the filters are available on request.

</PRE> 

<P>The discriminators have been set at a level, where the dark count
is less than about 20 c/s at ambient temperature of 5&#176;C, and
where the signal is a slowly varying function discriminator setting.
A typical example of signal and dark count as a function of
discriminator setting is shown in Figure 3.  It should be noted that
the dark count rate increases quite significantly when the ambient
temperature raises above 10&#176;C.  At 15&#176;C the dark count rates
will be a factor 2-5 higher than the values listed in Table 2.
 
<P><A NAME="counts"><EM>7. Count rates </EM></A>

<P> The count rates of the photomultipliers can be checked by
measuring the signal of the standard light source through diaphragm
No. 1 and compare with the count rates listed in Table 2.  The
intensity of the standard source (a tritium H&#223; light source)
decreases slowly in time with about 10% per year.

<P> The expected count rates for the photometer mounted on the 1.5
meter telescope is given in Table 3.  The count rates have been
computed from measured count rates with the Swedish 60 cm telescope
on La Palma.

<PRE>

</PRE>

<P><A NAME="limits"><EM>8. Brightness limit</EM></A>

<P> The count rate for the photomultipliers must not exceed 106 c/s.
Higher count rates may damage the photocathodes.  It therefore follows
from Table 3 that the <I>brightness limit for the uvby is:</I>
<PRE>
     V = 5.3 for A and F stars  
 and V = 5.7 for B-type stars. 
</PRE>
<I>For H&#223; the brightness limit is:</I> V = 4.0 for all stars. 

<P>Furthermore, it is recommended that the count rate does not exceed
about 300 000 c/s in order to avoid large dead-time corrections.  It
means that none of the primary standard stars can be reached in uvby.
In H&#223; a few may be observed.
 
<P><A NAME="deadtime"><EM>9.  Dead-time correction</EM></A>
  
The observed count rate (No c/s) and the true count rate (Nt c/s) are
connected by the equation:
<PRE>
                   No
         Nt = ------------
               1 - No tD
</PRE>
where tD is the dead-time constant.  It has been determined by
measuring the transmission coefficient of the neutral density filter
for stars near the brightness limit and for fainter stars of the same
spectral type.  Individual values are given in Table 4.

<PRE>
               Table 4 

Dead-time constants in units of 10e-9s = 1 ns

	y		 70 &#177; 15 
	N		 70 &#177; 10 
	H&#223;W		 65 &#177; 10 

</PRE>

<P>The average value is 78&#215;10e-9 sec, but it seems that the value for
H&#223;W is significantly higher.
 
<P><A NAME="photon"><EM>10.  The photon counting system</EM></A>

<P>is described in a manual by D. Hiriart et al. December 1989,
Reporte T&eacute;cnico # 66, Instituto de Astronom&iacute;a, UNAM,
"Sistema de Fotometr&iacute;a Dan&eacute;s-PC".

<P><A NAME="standard"><EM>11.  Standard stars</EM></A>

<P> Most of the primary uvby and H&#223; standard stars may be observed
through the neutral density filter.  Accurate determination of the
transmission coefficient for that filter will then allow
transformation to the standard system.  

<P> For late A and F-type stars it is, however, recommended to select
well observed (nobs &gt; 3) stars from the recent "Catalog of
four-colour uvby and H&#223; photometry of A5 to G0 stars brighter than
8m. 3" by E.H. Olsen (Astron. Astrophys. Suppl.  54, p.55, 1983).
Some Population II stars should be included in order to get a good
transformation of the m1 index.

<P>     
La idea que motiv&oacute; la realizacion de este Taller fue la de analizar cuidadosamente cu&aacute;l es el estado actual que el Observatorio Astron&oacute;mico Nacional localizado en la Sierra de San Pedro M&aacute;rtir, Baja California (OAN-SPM) guarda, y qu&eacute; acciones deber&aacute;n seguirse para logra que su desarrollo sea el adecuado a las necesidades reales que los astr&oacute;nomos mexicanos tendr&aacute;n en los pr&oacute;ximos a&ntilde;os.
<P>     
En este contexto, una pl&aacute;tica sobre la historia del OAN-SPM pareciera no encajar en las actividades de esta reuni&oacute;n, pero considerando que para hablar del futuro es necesario tener claro el pasado, quisimos aprovechar la ocasi&oacute;n para dar a conocer algo de nuestra historia. Adem&aacute;s, en los &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os se han incorporado al Instituto de Astronom&iacute;a (IAUNAM) muchos j&oacute;venes, algunos de ellos incluso originarios de otros pa&iacute;ses, quienes en su mayor&iacute;a desconocen las ra&iacute;ces de esta instituci&oacute;n centenaria.
<P>     
La fundaci&oacute;n del Observatorio Astron&oacute;mico Nacional (OAN), antecedente directo e inmediato de nuestra instituto, tuvo lugar por un Decreto Presidencial emitido el 28 de diciembre de 1876 por el General Porfirio D&iacute;az, quien orden&oacute; la creaci&oacute;n un Observatorio Astron&oacute;mico, Metereol&oacute;gico y Magn&eacute;tico que habr&iacute;a de construirse en la parte alta del Castillo de Chapultepec
(Moreno C., M. A. Anuario del OAN, a&ntilde;o CV, pp 226-230, 1984). Dicha instituci&oacute;n comenz&oacute; sus actividades el 5 de mayo de 1878, raz&oacute;n por la que se considera esa como la fecha oficial de fundaci&oacute;n.
<P>     
Durante el tiempo transcurrido desde aquel d&iacute;a, el OAN ha experimentado diversas modificaciones, tanto en su estructura acad&eacute;mica como en su ubicaci&oacute;n. La Tabla I presenta informaci&oacute;n al respecto.
<P>

Tabla I. Algunos datos relevantes. 
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>28 Dic. 1876: Se emite el Decreto de Creaci&oacute;n.
<LI>5 de Mayo 1878: Se inician actividades.
<LI>1882: Se adquieren en Europa los primeros telescopios astron&oacute;micos 
profesionales que hubo en M&eacute;xico. 
<LI>1884-1909:Construcci&oacute;n del primer edificio del OAN, localizado en la 
Villa de Tacubaya del Distrito Federal.
<LI>1887: Debido al compromiso internacional adquirido por el Gobierno 
de M&eacute;xico de participar en la elaboraci&oacute;n de la Carta 
del Cielo, se adquiri&oacute; el telescopio correspondiente. 
<LI>1929: Al obtener la Universidad Nacional Aut&oacute;noma de M&eacute;xico
(UNAM) su autonom&iacute;a, el Gobierno Federal le entreg&oacute; el OAN. 
<LI>17 Feb. 1942: Inicio de labores del Obsertatorio Astrof&iacute;sico 
Nacional (OAT), situado en Tonantzintla, Puebla.
<LI>1952: El OAN traslada sus telescopios a Tonantzintla. Ese mismo a&ntilde;o
ocupa sus nuevas oficinas en los dos primeros pisos de la Torre
de Ciencias en la Ciudad Universitaria.
<LI>1960: La UNAM pone en operaci&oacute;n el primer telescopio reflector 
profesional del pa&iacute;s. Se lleva a cabo la demolici&oacute;n del
antiguo edificio del OAN en Tacubaya.
<LI>1967: El OAN es transformado en el IAUNAM.
<LI>1968: Se inician las labores de prospecci&oacute;n en la Sierra de San
Pedro M&aacute;rtir, B. C.
<LI>1970: Se instala el primer telescopio de investigaci&oacute;n en SPM.
<LI>Feb. 1971: Se comienza el trabajo regular de observaci&oacute;n 
fotom&eacute;trica en SPM, utilizando el telescopio de 1.5 mts.
<LI>1972: Se pone en operaci&oacute;n el segundo telescopio, que fue el 0.84
mts.
<LI>1974: Se inicia el proyecto de construcci&oacute;n e instalaci&oacute;n del
telescopio de 2.1 mts y de su infraestructura.
<LI>17 Sep 1979: Inaguraci&oacute;n oficial del OAN-SPM y del 2.1 mts.
<LI>17 Oct. 1980:Puesta en operaci&oacute;n de las instalaciones del OAN en 
Ensenada.
<P>
<P>
<P>     
Entre otras cosas, esta tabla muestra que hubo un largo periodo de 
73 a&ntilde;os en que no se renov&oacute; la planta de telescopios del OAN. 
Las causas 
de ese hecho tuvieron mucho que ver con la falta de apoyo econ&oacute;mico, 
pero 
tambi&eacute;n con la falta de una pol&iacute;tica clara de 
contrataci&oacute;n de personal 
acad&eacute;mico. Durante gran parte de ese prolongado periodo el 
&uacute;nico programa 
observacional serio que se tuvo fue el relativo al cumplimiento del compromiso 
internacional de la Carta del Cielo
(Moreno C., M. A. Anuario del OAN, a&ntilde;o CVII, pp 172-179, 1987). No es 
de extra&ntilde;ar entonces  que al finalizar la d&eacute;cada de los 40, las labores cient&iacute;ficas del OAN hubieran llegado a su m&iacute;nima expresi&oacute;n, y ello a pesar de que por esos 
a&ntilde;os la Direcci&oacute;n del OAN apoy&oacute; la salida al extranjero de Guido Munch 
para que obtuviera su doctorado. Las condiciones eran tan pobres acad&eacute;micamente, que cuando &eacute;ste regres&oacute; siendo el primer mexicano que 
obtuvo el grado de Doctor en la especialidad de Astrof&iacute;sica, realmente no
pudo hacer nada para cambiar esa situaci&oacute;n, lo que lo decidi&oacute; a emigrar a los Estados Unidos donde desarroll&oacute; su brillante carrera.
<P>     
Antes de seguir adelante, es importante comentar que al iniciar la 
d&eacute;cada de los 70 el panorama cient&iacute;fico en Ensenada era francamente desalentador, raz&oacute;n que oblig&oacute; al IAUNAM a promover la creaci&oacute;n de una infraestructura local. Ello ayud&oacute; al surgimiento del Centro de 
Investigaci&oacute;n Cient&iacute;fica y de Ense&ntilde;anza Superior de Ensenada (CICESE), as&iacute; como a la fundaci&oacute;n de la Facultad de Ciencias de la Universidad Aut&oacute;noma de Baja California (UABC). Tambi&eacute;n propici&oacute; el asentamiento 
de un grupo de f&iacute;sicos que han desarrollado el Laboratorio que el 
Instituto de F&iacute;sica de la UNAM ahora tiene en esta ciudad. Las 
inquietudes culturales del personal acad&eacute;mico de la UNAM que se ha venido
a radicar en Ensenada han servido para desarrollar un amplio espectro de
actividades, tales como la formaci&oacute;n  de escuelas, museos, grupos musicales, cineclubs y diversos ciclos de conferencias de divulgaci&oacute;n.
<P>     
Por otra parte, el esfuerzo de los astr&oacute;nomos residentes en la 
ciudad de Ensenada por captar estudiantes locales comienza a dar resultados, 
ya que recientemente el IAUNAM ha contratado al primero de ese grupo que ha 
obtenido su doctorado en Astronom&iacute;a, iniciando as&iacute; un proceso de 
retroalimentaci&oacute;n. A la fecha hay al menos otros dos j&oacute;venes egresados 
de la UABC que est&aacute;n por obtener ese grado en el extranjero. Tambi&eacute;n se 
espera que regresen al IAUNAM-Ensenada.
<P>     
Durante su historia, el OAN ha vivido diferentes etapas por lo que respecta a la inversi&oacute;n en infraestructura para la observaci&oacute;n. Diversos
factores, entre los que destacan los altibajos de la econom&iacute;a nacional han
impedido que esas inversiones puedan ser planeadas adecuadamente, lo que sin lugar a dudas ha ayudado a un crecimiento que no puede considerarse como el
m&aacute;s adecuado. El OAN ha contado en varias ocasiones con instrumentos muy modernos, e incluso algunos de vanguardia, pero como en general &eacute;sto ha ocurrido de forma circunstancial, no ha sido posible obtener todo el provecho que esos equipos pudieran dar. Ha sido frecuente contar con instrumentos que han sido desaprovechados por falta de personal, ya que se les adquiri&oacute; por lo que
eran y no porque estuvieran encuadrados dentro de las necesidades de los
proyectos de investigaci&oacute;n que se estaban o pod&iacute;an desarrollar en la fecha 
de compra. 
<P>     
La Tabla II presenta informaci&oacute;n sobre la adquisici&oacute;n y uso de los diversos equipos del OAN desde su fundaci&oacute;n. El comentario de subutilizado
se ha agregado a los equipos que no produjeron datos astron&oacute;micos que hayan sido publicados en n&uacute;mero significativo.

Tabla II. Principales telescopios e instrumentos del OAN.
</CENTER>
<P>          
<LI>1885: Gran Ecuatorial. Telescopio refractor construido por Grubb de 
Dubl&iacute;n. Lente de 38 cms. y distancia focal de 4.8 mts. Mala 
&oacute;ptica. Equipado con un espectroscopio de prismas. SUBUTILIZADO 
y finalmente destruido alrededor de 1960. 
<LI>1885: C&iacute;rculo Meridiano. Lente de 20 cms. y distancia focal de 
2 mts. SUBUTILIZADO. Se destruy&oacute; alrededor de 1960.
<LI>1887: Astr&oacute;grafo doble de la "Carta del Cielo". Uno de los 13 
instrumentos de ese tipo construidos por Grubb. Lente principal de 
30 cms. y distancia focal de 3 mts. Este instrumento sirvi&oacute; para 
introducir a M&eacute;xico las t&eacute;cnicas fotogr&aacute;ficas aplicadas 
a la investigaci&oacute;n  cient&iacute;fica. Utilizado para hacer el 
Cat&aacute;logo Fotogr&aacute;fico y la Carta del Cielo en la zona austral 
comprendida entre los 10 y los 16 grados de declinaci&oacute;n. 
Se CONCLUY&Oacute; 
ese proyecto y se public&oacute;  el cat&aacute;logo. EXISTE incompleto en 
Tonantzintla, Puebla. 
<LI>1960: Telescopio reflector de 1 mt. y raz&oacute;n focal f/15. Instalado en
Tonantzintla. Equipado originalmente con uno de los fot&oacute;metros de 
Johnson y un espectr&oacute;grafo nebular para el foco primario. Este 
segundo instrumento realmente no se utiliz&oacute;. Con este telescopio 
aprendieron a observar algunos de los actuales investigadores del 
IAUNAM. Existe y est&aacute; SUBUTILIZADO.
<LI>1965: Espectr&oacute;grafo Boller & Chivens fotogr&aacute;fico con rejillas 
de dispersi&oacute;n intercambiables. Equipo SUBUTILIZADO en la 
investigaci&oacute;n. Se le us&oacute; para entrenar observadores y para
probar equipos como el OMA (Analizador &Oacute;ptico Multicanal). En su 
estado actual este espectr&oacute;grafo es obsoleto.
<LI>1970: Telescopio reflector de 1.5 mts. Originalmente propiedad de la 
Universidad de Arizona. Su espejo principal era de aluminio y estaba 
equipado con los fot&oacute;metros de Johnson 5C y 13C. Se ha modernizado 
y reequipado. Este telescopio sigue produciendo datos novedosos.
<LI>1971-1972: Armado e instalaci&oacute;n del reflector de 0.84 mts. El espejo 
de este telescopio fue tallado en el Taller de &Oacute;ptica del IAUNAM. 
Originalmente estuvo equipado con fot&oacute;metros fotoel&eacute;ctricos 
de Johnson. En 1974 se le agreg&oacute; el espectr&oacute;grafo Boller & 
Chivens fotogr&aacute;fico modelo 26767 y en 1977 el Cuenta Pulsos. A 
pesar de ello, el telescopio y su equipo han sido SUBUTILIZADOS.
<LI>1972: Interfer&oacute;metro fotogr&aacute;fico tipo Fabry-Perot. Utilizado  
intensivamente durante la d&eacute;cada de los 70 para estudios de 
campos de velocidades en Regiones HII. Originalmente se acopl&oacute; 
al telescopio de 1 mt., aunque ocasionalmente fue utilizado en 
los de 0.84 y 2.1 mts. Actualmente es obsoleto y est&aacute; fuera de 
uso.
<LI>1974: Fot&oacute;pmetro Doble. Adquirido para el telescopio de 1 mt. Muy 
SUBUTILIZADO.
<LI>1974-1979: Construcci&oacute;n e instalaci&oacute;n del telescopio de 2.1 
mts. Instrumento originalmente sin equipo perif&eacute;rico propio.
<LI>1977: Espectr&oacute;grafo Echelle fotogr&aacute;fico para el telescopio 
de 2.1 mts. Ha sido modificado y actualmente se usa con detectores CCD.
<LI>1977: C&aacute;mara de Vac&iacute;o para el aluminizado de espejos de hasta 
2.1 mts. de di&aacute;metro. Operable.
<LI>1981: C&aacute;mara fotogr&aacute;fica con correctora de campo para el 
telescopio de 2.1 mts. SUBUTILIZADA. Actualmente es obsoleta.
<LI>1982: Fot&oacute;metro Infrarrojo y secundario oscilante para el 
telescopio de 2.1 mts.
<LI>1984: Fot&oacute;metro Dan&eacute;s para el telescopio de 1.5 mts. Se
adquiere en forma definitiva para el OAN en 1989.
<LI>1989: Espectr&oacute;grafo Boller & Chivens de propiedad italiana. Equipado
con detector CCD. Est&aacute; en SPM hasta que dure el acuerdo que hay 
con la gente de Mil&aacute;n.
<P>
<P>
<P>     
En los &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os el IAUNAM ha realizado un gran esfuerzo por 
desarrollar un grupo de instrumentistas que le ayuden a mejorar la dotaci&oacute;n instrumental de sus observatorios. Originalmente esta actividad 
se desarroll&oacute; en Ciudad Universitaria, pero en la actualidad se realiza de
manera muy importante en el OAN-Ensenada. En la actualidad hay
varios instrumentos en construcci&oacute;n o en etapa de pruebas definitivas. Destacan entre ellos el interfer&oacute;metro de barrido (PUMA) y las c&aacute;maras 
infrarrojas (CAMILA I y II).
<P>    
A lo largo del proceso que ha permitido consolidar el OAN-SPM mucho 
es lo que se ha aprendido, aunque tambi&eacute;n se han cometido errores de importancia. La experiencia as&iacute; obtenida deber&aacute; servir para normar las 
pol&iacute;ticas de desarrollo y adquisici&oacute;n de telescopios e instrumentos. Estas 
pol&iacute;ticas deber&aacute;n ser ampliamente discutidas por todos los miembros del 
IAUNAM, pues s&oacute;lo as&iacute; evitaremos volver a tener equipos mal aprovechados. 
Aunque de la Tabla II parece desprenderse la ense&ntilde;anza de que la historia del OAN ha sido negativa, &eacute;sto no es as&iacute;, pues durante el proceso de desarrollo de esta instituci&oacute;n tambi&eacute;n ha habido importantes logros, no siendo los menores la formaci&oacute;n de j&oacute;venes investigadores y de personal t&eacute;cnico altamente especializado.
<P>
<P>    
 De lo aqu&iacute; expuesto surgen los siguientes comentarios:
<P> 
I. No es casual que de las disciplinas cient&iacute;ficas cultivadas en M&eacute;xico, la Astronom&iacute;a sea una de las de mayor renombre. En buena medida se debe a que 
atr&aacute;s de ella hay un esfuerzo constante y sostenido que ha durado m&aacute;s de
100 a&ntilde;os.
<P> 
II. Aunque desde los inicios de la investigaci&oacute;n astron&oacute;mica en 
M&eacute;xico se ha contado con instrumentos razonablemente adecuados y 
competitivos en el contexto internacional, &eacute;stos han sido frecuentemente
subutilizados, b&aacute;sicamente por falta de personal calificado y por la ausencia 
de una pol&iacute;tica institucional clara,  que sirva para dirigir congruentemente 
los diferentes esfuerzos que se han realizado.
<P> 
III. Desde sus inicios, el OAN se ha caracterizado por ser una instituci&oacute;n que ha promovido e implantado en M&eacute;xico nuevas disciplinas y tecnolog&iacute;as,
coadyuvando de manera directa a la formaci&oacute;n de recursos humanos altamente 
calificados, lo que sin lugar a dudas justifica sobradamente la inversi&oacute;n que 
se ha hecho en el desarrollo de la Astronom&iacute;a.

La principal causa de subutilizaci&oacute;n de los observatorios astron&oacute;micos
es por nublados u otro efecto clim&aacute;tico (e.g. fuertes vientos). En menor
medida, se pierde tiempo de telescopio por problemas t&eacute;cnicos con
la instrumentaci&oacute;n y telescopios. Para el caso del telescopio de 2.1m,
Tapia (RMAA 24, 179, 1992) public&oacute; las estad&iacute;sticas relevantes para
el periodo julio 1982 a junio 1992. Aqu&iacute; se presentan estos mismos
n&uacute;meros para el periodo julio 1992 a junio 1995 (Tabla 1).
No se observa ninguna tendencia diferente respecto a los 10 a&ntilde;os
anteriores.

lluvias que deslavaron el camino.

En este aspecto, se hace una comparaci&oacute;n con otros observatorios.
En particular, el porcentaje de noches espectrosc&oacute;picas (aquellas
con nubosidad menor que 30%) en varios lugares se lista en la
Tabla 2. Es pertinente notar que todos estos datos son para periodos
largos, que van de 2 a 20 a&ntilde;os. San Pedro M&aacute;rtir, junto con
La Silla y Cerro Tololo, son los lugares mas ventajosos del punto
de vista clim&aacute;tico. Esto tambi&eacute;n es v&aacute;lido en cuanto a la
calidad de la imagen (seeing), como lo revela un estudio reciente
(Echevarr&iacute;a et al., por enviarse a RMAA).

2. Publicaci&oacute;n de resultados del OAN

<P>


Para darnos una idea de qu&eacute; tan competitivo es el OAN, se presenta
una compilaci&oacute;n del n&uacute;mero de art&iacute;culos (en revistas arbitradas
de circulaci&oacute;n internacional) basados total o parcialmente en datos 
obtenidos en nuestro observatorio. En el periodo 1974 a 1994 (21 a&ntilde;os),
se han publicado 223 art&iacute;culos, 206 de ellos con datos de los
telescopios de San Pedro M&aacute;rtir y el resto, del de 1m en Tonantzintla,
estos &uacute;ltimos hasta 1983. De 1982 a 1994, el telescopio de 2.1m
ha dado datos para 112 publicaciones y el de 1.5m, para 62. Una peque&ntilde;a
fracci&oacute;n de ellos son comunes, esto es, art&iacute;culos con datos de
ambos telescopios.
<P>
Se presenta tambi&eacute;n una comparaci&oacute;n
con otros observatorios, siguiendo lo mas fielmente posible, el estudio
de V. Trimble (PASP 107, 977, 1995). Para detalles, favor de consultar
el art&iacute;culo citado. Solo hago notar que para el OAN se 
han considerado todas
las publicaciones arbitradas en el periodo 1991 a 1993, dividiendo el
n&uacute;mero entre dos para igualar el periodo de 18 meses considerado por 
Trimble para otros observatorios. Las citas fueron consultadas para
el periodo enero 1994 a junio 1995 y divididas entre 1.5, por la misma
raz&oacute;n. Excepto por el hecho de que para los observatorios de EEUU
Trimble consider&oacute; solo ApJ, AJ y PASP, la metodolog&iacute;a es similar.
Los resultados se presentan en la Tabla 3, para ser comparada con los
datos de la Tabla 1 de Trimble (op. cit.). Podemos afirmar que el
n&uacute;mero de art&iacute;culos con datos del telescopio de 2.1m del OAN es
similar al de los telescopios de 2.2m de la Univ. de Texas (McDonald)
y de la Univ. de Hawaii (Mauna Kea). El n&uacute;mero de citas por art&iacute;culo,
sin embargo, es menor para los de nuestro telescopio (3.0) que el de 
los telescopios de 2 metros mencionados (promedio 4.5), pero es igual
al del telescopio de 2.1m de Kitt Peak (3.0).

3. Publicaciones del IAUNAM
 </B></U>
</H2>
<H3>
<P>
Usando como fuente los reportes anuales del IAUNAM (previamente sujetos
a cuidadosa revisi&oacute;n para corregir errores y omisiones), se ha hecho una
compilaci&oacute;n de los art&iacute;culos publicados por los investigadores del
IAUNAM, tanto en Ensenada como en Ciudad Universitaria. El n&uacute;mero
total de art&iacute;culos arbitrados entre 1981 y 1994 es de 575, 140 de
investigadores trabajando en Ensenada y 490 en CU. N&oacute;tese que la suma
es mayor que el n&uacute;mero total, ya que una fracci&oacute;n de ellos tiene
autores en com&uacute;n (de CU y de Ensenada). El cociente, No. de art&iacute;culos por a&ntilde;o
entre No. de investigadores ese a&ntilde;o, es de 1.05 para CU y 1.09 para 
Ensenada. Hay una diferencia fuerte, sin embargo en la distribuci&oacute;n 
de las poblaciones de investigadores muy productivos y poco productivos:
en CU hay algunos con enorme tasa de producci&oacute;n y otros con una 
muy pobre. En Ensenada los extremos son muy poco pronunciados,
comparativamente, aunque la media en ambas poblaciones (CU y
Ensenada) tienen una tasa similar.
<P>
Finalmente, se repiti&oacute; para los investigadores de la UNAM
un estudio id&eacute;ntico al publicado por Helmut
Abt (PASP 102, 1161, 1990) para compilar las caracter&iacute;sticas de
publicaci&oacute;n de los miembros de la American Astronomical Society
(AAS). Los a&ntilde;os del estudio fueron 
1984 a 1988 usando como base los &iacute;ndices de la publicaci&oacute;n
Astronomy and Astrophysics Abstracts (AAA), sin duda la mas completa
compilaci&oacute;n en el campo. Si bien en &eacute;sta se incluyen art&iacute;culos
publicados arbitrados y no arbitrados, as&iacute; como res&uacute;menes de
congresos y hasta errata, los resultados son muy ilustrativos (Abt
hace un interesante an&aacute;lisis). Es interesante que la MEDIANA de
la distribuci&oacute;n del n&uacute;mero de publicaciones anuales por cada
investigador entre los miembros &iacute;ntegros (full members) de la AAS
es 2.28, mientras que para la poblaci&oacute;n de investigadores del IAUNAM
(para el mismo periodo) es 3.05. Los PROMEDIOS (No. art. 
por a&ntilde;o / investigador) son 3.34
y 3.52 para la AAS y el IAUNAM, respectivamente. Abt calcul&oacute;, para
una muestra significativa de 14 investigadores con producci&oacute;n
intermedia y alta, que su n&uacute;mero de art&iacute;culos originales (arbitrados) 
entre el n&uacute;mero de publicaciones del AAA es de 2.2, mientras que 
para los investigadores del IAUNAM es de 2.6.

<B>ACTA DE LA REUNION DE USUARIOS DEL OAN CELEBRADA EN CU
<P>
Margarita Rosado
</B>
</CENTER>
</H2>
<H3>

<P>

Esta reunion se llevo a cabo en dos sesiones los dias 30 de octubre y 6 de
noviembre de 1995. Asistencia maxima: 20 usuarios.
<P>
Orden del dia:
<P>
<LI>1. Instrumentacion en y para el OAN.

<LI>2. Insercion de los astronomos residentes en el OAN.

<LI>3. Proyecto de reglamento de la CATT.
<P>
<CENTER>Instrumentacion en y para el OAN</CENTER>
<P>
1. Margarita Rosado presento informacion sobre el uso de los diferentes
 instrumentos en el OAN-SPM en los ultimos 3 semestres. En esta informacion 
destaca el creciente uso de CAMILA-Directa en el telescopio de 2.1m y el
uso de los diversos CCDs en el telescopio de 1.5m. Tambien se infiere de
estos datos, que los telescopios se usan cuando tienen la intrumentacion
apropiada.
<P>
2. Beatriz Sanchez, Jefa del OAN-Tonantzintla, informo de los planes que
tiene para habilitar el espectrografo B&CH y el fotometro cuentapulsos
para uso en el telescopio de 1m de Tonantzintla. Asimismo informo sobre
el CCD Sta. Barbara y el guiador del INAOE. Se piensa que este telescopio,
contando con buena instrumentacion, podria ser usado por los estudiantes
del posgrado de Astronomia de la UNAM e INAOE y para la realizacion de
proyectos institucionales que estarian por definirse.
<P>
3. Se informo que Camila-modo espectrografo no esta liberado pero el equipo
que lo esta desarrollando esta abierto a colaboraciones. Se piensa refrigerar
 para poder acceder a la banda K (hasta ahora limitada por la radiacion de
 fondo) y desarrollar la parte de espectro-polarimetria.

<P>
Se hicieron las recomendaciones siguientes:
<P>
<LI>1. Equipar a los telescopios de 2.1m y 1.5m con espectrografos tipo FOSC.

<LI>2. Explorar la posibilidad de usar CAMILA en el telescopio de 1.5m.

<LI>3. Que la nueva consola del 2.1m despliegue simultaneamente TU, TS y coordenadas
de los objetos observados y que estos datos se graben directamente en los
encabezados de los archivos de las observaciones.

<LI>4. Estudiar el problema de tiempo de transferencia de datos con el software
PMIS del CCD TEk pues se asegura, puede representar hasta un 13 % de tiempo
perdido durante las observaciones.

<LI>5. Corregir defectos del guiador mexicano del 2.1m (tales como una deriva
 sistematica de la estrella guia dentro del cuadrito, flexiones, etc.) e
 implementar el despliegue de posibles estrellas guia por catalogo.

<LI>6. Aumentar significativamente la sensibilidad de las camaras de los oculares
de los espectrografos. Una posibilidad sugerida es que tengan un frame-graber
que permita integraciones.

<LI>7. Caracterizar los filtros (de banda ancha y de interferencia) con que cuenta
el IA. Se considera importante hacer esta caracterizacion en el centro, un
punto intermedio y borde. Lorenzo Olguin y Anabel Arrieta se pondran en 
contacto con Oswaldo Harris para implementar esto.

<LI>8. Conocer el estado de los filtros usados para hacer fotometria de Stromgren
 con CCD y en caso de que algunos esten danados, reemplazarlos por nuevos
filtros. Si los costos lo permiten, que estos filtros nuevos tengan un 5% de
tolerancia en lugar del 10 % que se pidio para los actuales.

<LI>9. Tratar de disminuir la corriente obscura de los tubos del fotometro danes
(dejandolos prendidos durante mucho tiempo). Paralelamente, averiguar sobre
nuevos tubos que puedan reemplazar los EMI. Bill Schuster, Matilde Fernandez,
Margarita Rosado e Irene Cruz haran este trabajo e integraran a Luis Salas y
J.M. Murillo.

<LI>10. Que los instrumentos de uso general sean liberados contando ya con paqueteria
de reduccion de datos instalada en computadoras del IA. En particular, que
 Astronomia Observacional asesore a los usuarios de CAMILA sobre paqueteria de
 reduccion de datos.

<LI>11. Que el departamento de Computo actualice continuamente la paqueteria mas
 importante de reduccion de datos astronomicos. 

<LI>12. Corregir los defectos de la consola del 1.5m y el 84 cm (en particular, la
 perdida de la hora al pasar por el meridiano). 

<LI>13. Que los limites en declinacion de los telescopios esten dados por razones
mecanicas y no por problemas de software. Apoyar la peticion de la reunion de
usuarios en Ensenada de aumentar el limite de declinacion del telescopio de
1.5m a 62o.

<LI>14. Poner codificadores de foco en los telescopios de 1.5m y 84 cm.

<LI>15. Equipar con radios para comunicacion a los telescopios.

<LI>16. Poner (y llenar) bitacoras de observacion en los telescopios de 1.5m y
84 cm.

<P>
Se destaco la importancia que debe de tener el MANTENIMIENTO PREVENTIVO en
los instrumentos y telescopios del OAN. Se sugiere que este se haga de manera
regular y planeada y no solo cuando aparecen problemas. 

<P>
<CENTER>Insercion de los astronomos residentes en el OAN</CENTER>
<P>
Margarita Rosado informo sobre la contratacion de 3 astronomos residentes
 quienes trabajaran en SPM 120 dias al ano. La lista tentativa de sus
 funciones sera colgada en los pizarrones, asi como un instructivo para los
 astronomos residentes de Canarias (lo cual es ilustrativo del tipo de
trabajo que desempenan). Al momento, dependen directamente del JOAN (en
cuanto a su trabajo de apoyo). Irene Cruz sugirio explorar la posibilidad
de crear una jefatura de Astronomia Observacional en Ensenada y de que los
astronomos residentes dependan de ella.
<P>
Se recomienda lo siguiente:
<P>
<LI>1. Que los astronomos residentes  empiecen a trabajar desde el momento de 
su contratacion dando las labores de apoyo correspondientes, en el entendido
 de que al principio se les tendra que apoyar por parte de los observadores
 hasta que adquieran la experiencia suficiente.

<LI>. Que los astronomos residentes no observen durante sus periodos de apoyo
en el OAN, ya sea en proyectos propios o supliendo a algun astronomo en su
temporada.

<LI>3. Que tengan una comunicacion fluida entre ellos y que comuniquen todos
los cambios realizados a los otros astronomos residentes asi como a los 
usuarios interesados (que estaran en un alias particular).
<P>
<CENTER>Proyecto de reglamento de la CATT</CENTER>
<P>
Se informo que, 
en realidad no se trata de las reglas de la CATT sino de los lineamientos
que se deberan seguir para la asignacion y uso de los telescopios del OAN.
Existe un proyecto de este reglamento, elaborado por la CATT, que sera
difundido lo mas ampliamente posible. El procedimiento es que el Consejo
Interno es quien aprobara este reglamento. Se recomendo analizar cuidadosamente
el proyecto elaborado por la CATT y tratar de presentar unos lineamientos 
consensados entre la mayoria de los usuarios del OAN. Para esto se pidio,
por parte de Astronomia Observacional, que los puntos en que se este en
desacuerdo o bien que no hayan sido contemplados en el documento de la CATT,
se los hagan llegar por escrito a Margarita Rosado. Ella identificara si
existen puntos encontrados entre si y, si este fuera el caso, estos seran
 discutidos por los usuarios del OAN en reuniones convocadas para ello. Si
persisten las diferencias se votaran las diferentes propuestas.

A continuaci&oacute;n se presenta el presupuesto de operaci&oacute;n para
el OAN-SPM durante 1995. La n&oacute;mina incluye Ensenada.
No est&aacute;n los gastos de operaci&oacute;n en Ensenada.
Operaci&oacute;n SPM incluye gastos de importaci&oacute;n,
v&iacute;veres, ropa, refacciones, materiales, combustible, equipo, etc.
No est&aacute; incluido el gasto en talleres (electr&oacute;nica, 
&oacute;ptica y
precisi&oacute;n) ni el gasto en proyectos instrumentales (ya sea con
cargo al IA o a proyectos externos), ni pasajes y vi&aacute;ticos para 
desplazarse del DF al OAN (220,000 hasta octubre 1995).

<P>
Para 345 noches de observaci&oacute;n, con el 40% de la n&oacute;mina, y
alrededor de 20 publicaciones anuales con datos de SPM (ver el trabajo
de M. Tapia):
<P>
<LI>Presupuesto 1995 de SPM: 6,485,000 ( ~ 1 mill&oacute;n US)
<LI>Noche de observaci&oacute;n: 19,000 (~ 3,000 US) 
<LI>Costo por art&iacute;culo: 324,000 (~ 50,000 US) 
<LI>N&uacute;mero de noches para producir un art&iacute;culo: 18 
<P>
El n&uacute;mero de noches para producir un art&iacute;culo disminuye si
consideramos cerca de un 20% de p&eacute;rdidas por clima o fallas 
(ver M. Tapia), pero aumenta si consideramos los otros telescopios.
Considerando ambas cosas, resultan ~ 25-30 noches para generar
un art&iacute;culo. La eficiencia
del Observatorio (en t&eacute;rminos estrictamente econ&oacute;micos) puede
aumentar si se ponen al d&iacute;a los telescopios menores.

Hay que recordar que este edificio fu&eacute; producto de un proyecto presentado
desde noviembre de 1989, en donde se proyect&oacute; que para el a&ntilde;o 2000
podr&iacute;a haber 84 acad&eacute;micos en Ensenada, el doble de hoy, 
distribuidos del modo siguiente: 27 astr&oacute;nomos, 10 electr&oacute;nicos, 
6 &oacute;pticos, 7 en c&oacute;mputo, 6 mec&aacute;nicos, 20 estudiantes, 
4 visitantes y 4 de apoyo. Otro aspecto importante del 
proyecto fu&eacute; solicitar la construcci&oacute;n o ampliaci&oacute;n 
de areas de trabajo para instrumentaci&oacute;n.
La ampliaci&oacute;n ha sido fiel a este proyecto, y
posibilita la realizaci&oacute;n de un proyecto
acad&eacute;mico ambicioso.

Durante este a&ntilde;o se han servido un promedio de 22 comidas al 
d&iacute;a. En el caso mas extremo, es concebible llegar hasta 40 comidas, 
o 40 personas instaladas en el OAN en un cierto momento. La capacidad 
instalada exceder&aacute;, con mucho, las necesidades. Es primordial determinar 
el destino que se le dar&aacute; a las viejas instalaciones.

El costo por viaje ida y vuelta entre Ensenada y SPM es de 950 nuevos pesos
(20 de sept., 150US). En octubre de 1995 se realizaron 29 viajes. En una semana
se transporta lo siguiente:
<P>
<LI> Personal: 5 administrativos, 4 t&eacute;cnicos y 4 astr&oacute;nomos 
<LI> Obras: 1 viaje 
<LI> Refacciones: 2 por semana (con personal) 
<LI> Imperecederos: 1 por semana (con personal) 
<LI>
Una vez al mes se transportan perecederos (desde Ensenada) y combustible
(desde San Quint&iacute;n).

<P>

Es excesivo el n&uacute;mero de viajes. Los costos y los riesgos son altos.

<P>
Hasta el 20 de sept. (260 d&iacute;as) se sirvieron 5638 comidas en el OAN. 
Incluyendo desayunos y cenas, da un total de 19000 servicios. 
<P>
<LI> Presupuesto v&iacute;veres: 297,000 
<LI> Viajes: 50,000 
<LI> Sueldos cocineras: 100,000 
<P>
En consecuencia el costo por servicio es N$20-25, es decir,   
la comida no es particularmente cara, pero no es 
la mejor dieta y es demasiado sabrosa (lo que invita a la gula).

<CENTER>
<B>Relator&iacute;a de la primera sesi&oacute;n</B> 
<P>
<B>Manuel Alvarez</B>
</CENTER>
</H2>
<P>
 
<H3>
Lo que sigue NO es una relator&iacute;a, aunque podr&iacute;a ser un 
peque&ntilde;o ensayo .....
<P>
Para comenzar, el "nombramiento" de quien actuar&iacute;a 
como RELATOR, lo podemos ver como un ejemplo de lo que parece ser 
que necesita el futuro trabajo en nuestro observatorio: i.e. mano de
hierro, pero a trav&eacute;s de una orientaci&oacute;n y 
participaci&oacute;n de la mayor&iacute;a.
<P>

1) La sesi&oacute;n la inicia Marco Moreno con una 
exposici&oacute;n-relato del quehacer hist&oacute;rico del 
OBSERVATORIO ASTRONOMICO, 
haciendo &eacute;nfasis principalmente en los aspectos del trabajo, m&aacute;s 
que en el aspecto puramente anecd&oacute;tico del cual todos tenemos algo 
(algunas veces mucho) que aportar.
<P>

Marco se&ntilde;ala que el or&iacute;gen, las ra&iacute;ces profundas del OAN, 
est&aacute;n en la necesidad del gobierno del General Porfirio 
D&iacute;az, de hacer la  cartograf&iacute;a de M&eacute;xico. 
Esto es, surge de una necesidad
hist&oacute;rica, aunque posteriormente, los astr&oacute;nomos 
(desde aquella &eacute;poca) aprovechan la  coyuntura, para iniciar un trabajo 
profesional y de gran iniciativa.
<P>

Se&ntilde;ala durante su exposici&oacute;n, que del IA-UNAM, han salido un gran
n&uacute;mero de t&eacute;cnicos que han hecho de la astronom&iacute;a 
mexicana un ejemplo
a seguir por otras ramas del quehacer cient&iacute;fico. Se&ntilde;ala que
aunque esto es aceptado por algunos de nosotros, NO es ni conocido
ni aceptado por un numeroso grupo de personas; inclusive, esto a veces
NO es aceptado por nuestros propios colegas.
<P>

En los or&iacute;genes, la instrumentaci&oacute;n que se 
adquiri&oacute;, era de vanguardia, pero  NO hab&iacute;a ning&uacute;n  
proyecto, ni programa astron&oacute;micos.  
<P>

Como una de las propuestas se&ntilde;aladas por los asistentes, se indica
que son necesarios  programas de largo alcance, en los que queden
involucrados las tres componentes principales:  los INSTRUMENTOS,
los TELESCOPIOS y los RECURSOS HUMANOS, puesto que para "ganar una guerra
se necesitan muchos `soldados' y no s&oacute;lo `generales' ... "
<P>

Nuestro amigo Paco Cobos, le hace ver a Marco que su visi&oacute;n parece
ser muy pesimista, e indica el trabajo que se ha hecho en cuanto a 
los nuevos proyectos: telescopios, instrumentos, etc.
Entre otras cosas, se indica que en el IA-UNAM, se ha pasado de una
&eacute;poca en que se "compraban" instrumentos, a otra &eacute;poca en que una
buena parte de estos instrumentos se "hacen" en nuestras propias
instituciones.
<P>
     Otras  conclusiones que parecen ser de  "consenso" son las de
<P>
 a) trabajar m&aacute;s en la formaci&oacute;n de ``OBSERVADORES";  
<P>
 b) Recomendar a la Comisi&oacute;n de Posgrado, que se apoye 
y fomente el trabajo de tipo observacional.
<P>
<P>
2) Joaqu&iacute;n Bohigas en su exposici&oacute;n, se&ntilde;ala algunos
aspectos generales de la operaci&oacute;n del OAN, incluyendo los costos, el
tama&ntilde;o actual, as&iacute; como los planes y estado actual 
del crecimiento f&iacute;sico, tanto en Ensenada, como en el propio OAN.
<P>
De aqu&iacute; surgen un enorme n&uacute;mero de  inquietudes de 
muchos de los asistentes: 
<P>
del &aacute;rea de las  nuevas instalaciones (que es m&aacute;s del doble de 
lo que actualmente se tiene, tanto en CU, como en Ensenada y en SPM), se 
indica que habr&aacute; necesidad de contar con  mas personal 
acad&eacute;mico, tanto de residentes en Ensenada, como de astr&oacute;nomos; 
Se requerir&aacute; tanto de astr&oacute;nomos, como de t&eacute;cnicos: 
ingenieros, electr&oacute;nicos, expertos en c&oacute;mputo, etc.
<P>
Dentro de algunos  problemas puntuales, se trata el de la 
"producci&oacute;n de Nitr&oacute;geno" para enfriar los detectores, 
vi&eacute;ndose que se encuentra en este momento en el  "l&iacute;mite" 
de la capacidad de producci&oacute;n, de almacenaje y de 
administraci&oacute;n;  se hace la propuesta 
de que se requiere tener un  equipo "de repuesto" para asegurar el abasto.
<P>
se trata de explicar la funci&oacute;n de los astr&oacute;nomos 
residentes, e inclusive se cuestiona el hecho de que los tres  
astr&oacute;nomos residentes actuales NO SON mexicanos.  
Se indica que entre otras cosas est&aacute; el hecho de que a los mexicanos, 
de preferencia se les 
"contratar&aacute;" como investigadores;  adem&aacute;s, 
la convocatoria que se lanz&oacute; fu&eacute; abierta y al parecer, 
NO hubo solicitudes de mexicanos para estos puestos.
Esta discusi&oacute;n se ampli&oacute; mucho m&aacute;s durante la exposici&oacute;n de Margarita Rosado (ver m&aacute;s adelante).
<P>
Se hace una sugerencia a la CATT, para que se trate de dar prioridad a
temporadas m&aacute;s largas de observaci&oacute;n, con el fin de aprovechar 
m&aacute;s el recurso que significa tener el observatorio para nuestro beneficio.
Se sugiere que los astr&oacute;nomos permanezcan m&aacute;s tiempo en las
instalaciones, tanto de Ensenada, como de San Pedro M&aacute;rtir. Evitar
que los astr&oacute;nomos s&oacute;lo "pasen" por nuestras instalaciones, 
``aportando" poco a esta comunidad.
<P>
Se se&ntilde;ala que aunque los servicios de "comedor" son bastante 
buenos,se trate de ``cambiar" el men&uacute;, haci&eacute;ndolo 
m&aacute;s "saludable" (i.e., mas frutas, verduras, menos grasas, etc.)   
Sugerencia al personal del sindicato.
<P>

Se indica que, en promedio hay "casi un viaje diario", debido a una 
multitud de causas, se hace &eacute;nfasis en tratar de hacer mas eficiente 
el asunto de "subidas y bajadas" al/del observatorio. Se propone que
se haga una  revisi&oacute;n m&eacute;dica peri&oacute;dica, cuando menos a 
los choferes, puesto que est&aacute;n muy expuestos a cambios constantes e 
importantes de presi&oacute;n, con  posibles efectos fisiol&oacute;gicos.
<P>
Se trataron los problemas asociados con la  electricidad, al uso
eficiente de la energ&iacute;a, al aislamiento en el nuevo edificio, a la
situaci&oacute;n estructural del nuevo edificio, etc.
<P>
<P>
3) Mauricio Tapia, nos habl&oacute; de uno de sus temas  
preferidos como es el de las "estad&iacute;sticas". Una buena parte de 
estos datos y resultados han sido de hecho publicados y otros se 
incluir&aacute;n en el documento que se entregar&aacute; despu&eacute;s de 
esta reuni&oacute;n. Se recomienda ampliamente su lectura .....
<P>
A partir de sus notas y comentarios, se puede apreciar que el trabajo
del  OAN, es comparable con un gran n&uacute;mero de instituciones
del llamado  primer mundo; i.e. USA y quiz&aacute;s Europa.
<P>

Se propone e indica que es importante el que se trabaje mas ampliamente
en los telescopios de 0.84 m y 1.50 m. que actualmente est&aacute;n  sub-utilizados.
<P>

Se hace un se&ntilde;alamiento en el sentido de que hace falta mas trabajo
en el an&aacute;lisis y reducci&oacute;n de los datos adquiridos en todos los 
telescopios e instrumentos. Esto har&aacute; que nuestro trabajo sea 
m&aacute;s "productivo".
<P>

4) Margarita Rosado nos habla de una reuni&oacute;n reciente de la
CATT y de una Reuni&oacute;n de Usuarios, en donde se trataron 
principalmente los temas de: Instrumentaci&oacute;n para el OAN y los  
Astr&oacute;nomos Residentes.
<P>

Se&ntilde;ala que hay un problema en la eficiencia de uso 
de los telescopios;
<P>

faltan instrumentos para los telescopios (sobre todo para el 0.84 y el
1.5 m.). Esto hace que se sub-utilicen, pero tambi&eacute;n hace falta un
mayor n&uacute;mero de  astr&oacute;nomos observacionales, as&iacute; 
como fomentar que estos astr&oacute;nomos observacionales, encuentren instrumentos adecuados en los telescopios.
<P>

Indica que el telescopio de 2.12 m. tiene una demanda que es del orden
de 1.5, mientras que los otros est&aacute;s "sub-utilizados". 
<P> 

Se&ntilde;ala que en algunos proyectos, se limita el n&uacute;mero de noches 
de observaci&oacute;n, con el fin de permitir el acceso a este telescopio, 
aunque se menciona que estas acciones posiblemente hagan que la eficiencia de 
resultados baje en algunos casos.
<P>
Se indica que hay varios "proyectos de talacha" que son necesarios y en 
los que se espera tambi&eacute;n la participaci&oacute;n de los estudiantes, 
como por ejemplo: "caracterizaci&oacute;n de filtros"; "equipo de 
comunicaci&oacute;n entre los telescopios"; actualizaci&oacute;n en los 
programas de reducci&oacute;n de datos (IRAF, por ejemplo);  etc.
<P>

Se propuso que se forme un  grupo de trabajo de fotometr&iacute;a, con 
el fin de analizar las necesidades, las perspectivas y las posibilidades de
desarrollar el trabajo de este grupo de astr&oacute;nomos.
<P>

Se insiste en la importancia del  mantenimiento preventivo, 
se&ntilde;alando que se requiere m&aacute;s formalidad en la 
operaci&oacute;n y mantenimiento de la instrumentaci&oacute;n y de las reglas.
<P>

 Se se&ntilde;al&oacute; que hay que dar autorizaci&oacute;n a los t&eacute;cnicos del OAN para que puedan dar el mantenimiento y 
reparaci&oacute;n de los instrumentos que son de uso general;  
ha habido experiencias en el pasado de que esto NO ha sido permitido.
<P>
Se requiere  implementar el reglamento de la instrumentaci&oacute;n de uso 
com&uacute;n, separ&aacute;ndola de los  instrumentos "propios".
No ser&aacute; responsabilidad del personal t&eacute;cnico la atenci&oacute;n 
de los instrumentos "propios".
<P>

Se indic&oacute; que el espectr&oacute;grafo `Boller & Chivens' tiene algunos
problemas que posiblemente puedan ser resueltos con un  mejor conocimiento
de los  programas y sugerencias de uso y operaci&oacute;n.
<P>

Se di&oacute; una  muy rica discusi&oacute;n acerca de los  astr&oacute;nomos
residentes, puesto que aunque se dieron indicaciones de que exist&iacute;a ya
una cierta reglamentaci&oacute;n acerca de sus obligaciones y derechos, se vi&oacute; que hab&iacute;a "muchas lagunas", por lo que se espera que 
en el funcionamiento y en la operaci&oacute;n de esta "nueva, 
pero al mismo tiempo a&ntilde;eja" figura, se puedan corregir algunas de las deficiencias que hay en la operaci&oacute;n del OAN.
Se insisti&oacute; en la urgente necesidad de que estos "astr&oacute;nomos 
residentes" reciban un adiestramiento a la mayor brevedad posible y que su 
funci&oacute;n ir&aacute; adapt&aacute;ndose y mejorando a medida que se 
adquiera mas experiencia. Se mencion&oacute; que "aunque los astr&oacute;nomos 
residentes" est&eacute;n en operaci&oacute;n, es posible que existan fallas y 
problemas. Se indic&oacute; que hace falta una discusi&oacute;n mas 
&aacute;mplia para analizar la "situaci&oacute;n acad&eacute;mica" de estos astr&oacute;nomos residentes. Se insisti&oacute; en que estos 
astr&oacute;nomos residentes, pueden desarrollar un
trabajo propio, se&ntilde;al&aacute;ndose que primero deben de 
cumplir con su obligaci&oacute;n institucional.

<P>

Mauricio indica que el telescopio de 1.5 m. tiene problemas para su 
uso en "im&aacute;gen directa" y propone que se corrija y que NO se use hasta
que este problema quede corregido.  
Joaqu&iacute;n NO est&aacute; totalmente de
acuerdo con el primero.
<P>

Se insisti&oacute; en la necesidad de contar con "instrumentos propios" 
y no depender de los instrumentos de otros colegas. En particular, se 
se&ntilde;al&oacute; que habr&aacute; que "renegociar" con los 
astr&oacute;nomos italianos para el uso del espectr&oacute;grafo.
<P>

En cuanto a los lineamientos de la CATT, Margarita dijo que ya
hay una versi&oacute;n preliminar de estos en MOSAIC; que se est&aacute;n 
solicitando y se espera que haya propuestas para analizarlas; que
habr&aacute; una nueva reuni&oacute;n, probablemente a principios de 1996. 
Las propuestas ser&aacute;n analizadas y discutidas antes de que pasen a ser
aprobadas por el Consejo Interno.
<P>

Finalmente, se decidi&oacute; dar por concluida esta primera sesi&oacute;n
para re-comenzar a las 5 de la tarde con la discusi&oacute;n de TELESCOPIOS,
SITUACION ACTUAL Y FUTURA, incluyendo los aspectos de la OPTICA
asociada a ellos.

<P>
<P>
<B>Telescopio de 2m.</B>
</H2>
<H3>
<P>
Estado:
<P>
a) Consola.
<P>
La consola est&aacute; construida a base de tarjetas con circuitos
CMOS de tecnolog&iacute;a de los a&ntilde;os 70's, sin microprocesador,
esto limita el funcionamiento del telescopio al definido por el
hardware.
<P>
Los amplificadores de potencia fueron construidos en el Centro
de Instrumentos y son &uacute;nicos, cada vez que sufren un desperfecto
hay que repararlos. 
<P>
Los codificadores son de 12,000 pulsos/rev para guiado en AR y
DEC y de 120/300 pulsos/rev para apuntado en AR y DEC respectivamente.
<P>
 Los codificadores de guiado dependen del acoplamiento por fricci&oacute;n
con la pista del engrane, suelen presentarse  problemas debidos
a  la contaminaci&oacute;n de la pista y por desajustes en la
presi&oacute;n del mecanismo.
<P>
Mediante una PC que se comunica con la consola por una entrada
auxiliar se pueden hacer movimientos de offset.
<P>
Mediante el funcionamiento de los guiadores, OAN o Italiano, se
realiza la funci&oacute;n de autoguiado.
<P>
b) C&uacute;pula.
<P>
El posicionamiento de la c&uacute;pula se realiza manualmente
mediante dispositivos electromec&aacute;nicos, no se cuenta con
indicadores de su posici&oacute;n.
<P>
c) Cortina y gajos.
<P>
La apertura/cierre de la cortina y el posicionamiento de los gajos
se realiza manualmente mediante dispositivos electromec&aacute;nicos,
no se cuenta con indicadores de la posici&oacute;n.
<P>
d) Tapas.
<P>
La apertura/cierre de las tapas del espejo se realiza manualmente
mediante dispositivos electromec&aacute;nicos, no se cuenta con
indicadores de la posici&oacute;n.
<P>
e) Foco.
<P>
La posici&oacute;n del foco del telescopio se realiza manualmente
mediante dispositivos electromec&aacute;nicos. El operador cuenta
con un despliegue de la posici&oacute;n en el piso de c&oacute;mputo.
<P>
f) Contrapesos.
<P>
El balanceo del telescopio se efect&uacute;a manualmente mediante
dispositivos electromec&aacute;nicos, el operador cuenta con el
despliegue de las corrientes de los motores en el panel de consola.
Cada contrapeso tiene un reloj que indica la posici&oacute;n del
peso.
<P>
g) Guiador.
<P>
Para hacer posible periodos de exposici&oacute;n largos se cuenta
con dos guiadores.
<P>
1) Guiador OAN. Funciona basado en un espejo m&oacute;vil, con
una c&aacute;mara CCD sin intensificador. Esta implementado para
autoguiar, no hace offsets. Tiene problemas de flexiones mec&aacute;nicas.

<P>
2) Guiador Italiano. Funciona basado en un espejo con agujero
en el eje &oacute;ptico del telescopio. Puede autoguiar y  hacer
offsets. Adolece de una interfaz de usuario poco amigable, es
excesivamente pesado y voluminoso lo cual complica utilizarlo
con instrumentos como el puma, el mess.
<P>
h) Edificio.
<P>
Se ha instalado un conjunto de extractores en el techo del segundo
nivel los cuales detienen el flujo de los niveles inferiores hacia
el telescopio.
<P>
Perspectivas.
<P>
a) Se est&aacute; desarrollando una consola basada en computadoras
PC compatibles, amplificadores comerciales y codificadores de
mayor resoluci&oacute;n acoplados directamente al eje del motor.
<P>
Esto permitir&aacute; que el funcionamiento del telescopio est&eacute;
soportado mayormente por el software, lo cual le dar&aacute; versatilidad
para corregir por refracci&oacute;n, desalineaci&oacute;n al polo,
irregularidades de engranes, hacer offsets de mayor presici&oacute;n,
autoguiado, etc.
<P>
El grado de avance de esta hace previsible que se encuentre funcionando
para finales de 1996.
<P>
Se han implementado m&oacute;dulos para controlar de manera aut&oacute;noma
dispositivos accesorios al telescopio, estos formar&aacute;n parte
de la nueva consola de control. Se comunicar&aacute;n con la interfaz
de usuario via serie.
<P>
b) C&uacute;pula.
<P>
Se ha instalado el control para automatizar el movimiento de la
c&uacute;pula para que de manera aut&oacute;noma sepa su posici&oacute;n
y se mueva seg&uacute;n los comandos mediante comunicaci&oacute;n
serie de la interfaz de usuario. Actualmente los interruptores
manuales funcionan en paralelo con este sistema.
<P>
c) Cortina y gajos.
<P>
Se ha instalado un sistema de control aut&oacute;nomo que actualmente
funciona en paralelo con los interruptores manuales. Este sistema
se comunicar&aacute; via serie con la interfaz de usuario de la
consola para colocar autom&aacute;ticamente la posici&oacute;n
de la cortina y los gajos e informar al usuario de la posici&oacute;n
de estos.
<P>
d) Tapas.
<P>
Se han instalado actuadores (tornillos sinf&iacute;n acoplados
con motor) para permitir el movimiento de las tapas en cualquier
posici&oacute;n del telescopio y se ha implementado el control
para moverlas y leer su posici&oacute;n mediante comunicaci&oacute;n
serie desde la interfaz de usuario. Actualmente funciona en paralelo
con los conmutadores manuales del operador de la consola.
<P>
e) Foco.
<P>
Se ha instalado un sistema de control aut&oacute;nomo para mover
el foco y leer su posici&oacute;n por medio de comunicaci&oacute;n
serie desde la interfaz de usuario. Actualmente funciona en paralelo
con los interruptores manuales.
<P>
f) Contrapesos.
<P>
Se ha desarrollado un sistema para controlar la posici&oacute;n
de los contrapesos de manera autom&aacute;tica comunicado via
serie con la interfaz de usuario. El sistema se ha probado en
el telescopio y est&aacute; en proceso de fabricaci&oacute;n (
de 7 a 8 m&oacute;dulos ), para su instalaci&oacute;n. Funcionar&aacute;
en paralelo con el sistema manual.
<P>
g) Guiador.
<P>
Se tiene programado realizar mejoras al sistema mec&aacute;nico
durante el primer semestre del a&ntilde;o proximo. Se tiene pendiente
la renovaci&oacute;n del control de los movimientos ya que no
existen tarjetas de repuesto para este.
<P>
h) Edificio.
<P>
No se tiene idea de mejoras al edificio.

Estado.
<P>
a)Consola.
<P>
Su funcionamiento est&aacute; basado en una computadora PC, amplificadores
de potencia Galil, y una interfaz de usuario en C que permite
el cargar cat&aacute;logos de observaci&oacute;n, comunicaci&oacute;n
con el programa del guiador, correciones de diverso tipo. Con
la implementaci&oacute;n de esta consola se instal&oacute; un
engrane en el eje de declinaci&oacute;n para permitir el apuntado
autom&aacute;tico del telescopio.
<P>
Se tienen problemas con arranques aleatorios del telescopio a
velocidad de calaje.
<P>
Se tienen problemas con el corrimiento de la hora sideral al paso
por el meridiano.
<P>
Se tienen problemas con una componente err&aacute;tica del guiado
cuando no se usa el autoguiado.
<P>
Se tienen problemas con las tierras del telescopio ya que peri&oacute;dicamente
se sufren da&ntilde;os severos durante la temporada de tormentas
el&eacute;ctricas.

<B>RESUMEN: 
<P>
Se presentan los resultados, cuantitativos, de  la
evaluaci&oacute;n de la calidad de imagen, producida por  cada
uno  de  los  telescopios del observatorio  Astron&oacute;mico
Nacional.</B>
</H2>
<H3>
<P>
Introducci&oacute;n
<P>
     Los resultados que se presentan, fueron obtenidos con la
prueba  de  Bi-Ronchi,  aplicada a  cada  telescopio  durante
varios periodos de observaci&oacute;n.
<P>
     Hay,  al  menos, dos maneras de presentar los resultados
de  la  evaluaci&oacute;n de calidad de imagen de un sistema,
una  de  ellas  es  mediante  n&uacute;meros  y  la  otra  es
gr&aacute;ficamente. La primera tiene la  desventaja  de  que
los  n&uacute;meros podr&iacute;an no ser representativos  de
la  calidad  de imagen, si los resultados presentados  a  una
comunidad  que no esta familiarizada con las pruebas  de  los
sistemas, por otro lado, si los resultados son presentados de
manera   gr&aacute;fica,   esta   tendr&aacute;   una    mejor
comprensi&oacute;n, aun mas, si se presentan de manera en que
la    comunidad   est&aacute;   familiarizada,   por    esto,    las
gr&aacute;ficas que se presentan son las siguientes.  Primero
se  presenta  la respuesta al impulso puntual  (Point  Spread
Funtion), la cual es equivalente a la imagen de una  estrella
que  forma el telescopio. Una segunda gr&aacute;fica  muestra
las  curvas de nivel de la respuesta al impulso puntual, esta
gr&aacute;fica  es importante, pues nos da  una  idea  de  la
forma  de  la imagen, si es redonda, triangular con  detalle,
etc..  La tercera gr&aacute;fica nos muestra, finalmente,  las
capacidades y caracter&iacute;sticas del sistema y  de  medio
ambiente,  esta gr&aacute;fica es la concentraci&oacute;n  de
energ&iacute;a.

<P>  
Primero se presentaran los resultados para el telescopio
de  84 cm, luego para el de 1.5m, finalmente se muestran  los
resultados    para   el   telescopio   de    2.1m    en    su
configuraci&oacute;n   para   relaci&oacute;n   focal   f/7.5
comparando   estos  antes  y  despu&eacute;s  de   la   nueva
suspensi&oacute;n.   Se   omite  los   resultados   para   la
configuraci&oacute;n  de f/13.5, pues  se  carecen  de  datos
antes de la nueva suspensi&oacute;n.
<P>
</H3>
<P>
<H2>
<B>Conclusiones </B>
</H2>
<H3>
<P>

     Los  resultados  presentados, se pueden  resumir  de  la
siguiente manera:
Para  el telescopio de 84cm, el 80% de la energ&iacute;a  est&aacute;
en  un  circulo  de  radio  0.36 segundos de  arco.  Para  el
telescopio  de  1.5m,  el  80%  de  la  energ&iacute;a   est&aacute;
contenido  en un radio de de 0.7 segundos de arco, finalmente
para  el 2.1m con la nueva suspensi&oacute;n, el 80% est&aacute;  en
un  radio de 0.43 segundos de arco en comparaci&oacute;n  con
la  concentraci&oacute;n de energ&iacute;a antes de la  nueva
suspensi&oacute;n, en la cual el 80% estaba en un circulo  de
radio 0.93 segundos de arco.
<P>
      Para   los  telescopios  de  1.5m  y  2.1m   la   mayor
aberraci&oacute;n  detectada es el astigmatismo,  cabe  notar
que   el   telescopio  de  1.5m   present&oacute;  aberraci&oacute;n
esf&eacute;rica, debido  a  que  la
pareja primario secundario no es la adecuada.
<P>
      Finalmente,  es  importante  remarcar  que,  la   nueva
suspensi&oacute;n  del  espejo  primario  del  2.1m  est&aacute; en
per&iacute;odo de optimizaci&oacute;n, con lo cual  se  espera
lograr mejor calidad de imagen.

1) Jose M. Murillo. Telescopios
<P>
Habl&oacute; sobre el estado de la consola, perif&eacute;ricos, edificios y
perspectivas de cada telescopio. Se se&ntilde;alaron los siguientes
problemas y se hicieron varias sugerencias:
<P>
<LI>Mejorar el sistema de tierras, pararayos y apartarayos
<LI>Para el problema de tierras, instalar supresores de pico en puertos serie
<LI>Darle prioridad a la construcci&oacute;n de nuevos secundarios para los
telescopios de 1.5 y 0.84 mts
<LI>En obras, urgen mejoras en los edificios de los telescopios
(pintura de c&uacute;pulas, cuartos de observaci&oacute;n, gr&uacute;a
en el 0.84 mts, etc. etc. etc....). La direcci&oacute;n
y supervisi&oacute;n de las obras debe ser acad&eacute;mica
<LI>Se se&ntilde;al&oacute; que el telescopio de 0.84 mts vibra y se recomienda
revisar de inmediato la estructura y la cimentaci&oacute;n
<LI>Mejorar las consolas de los telescopios de 1.5 y 0.84 mts (arranques
aleatorios, seguridad, apuntado, corrimiento al paso por el meridiano)
<LI>Instalar sistemas de control remoto para c&uacute;pula, tapas, luces, 
secundario, etc. en los telescopios (se est&aacute; realizando en el 
2 mts y el el 0.84 mts)
<LI>Considerar la posibiliad de cambio de engranes en los ejes de AR
y DEC para el telescopio de 1.5 mts.
<LI>Considerar la posibilidad de que haya un asistente de c&uacute;pula
en los telescopios menores
<LI>Se sugiri&oacute; que, para todos los telescopios, se observe
desde la caba&ntilde;a azul. La idea no cuaj&oacute;
<LI>Considerar la posibilidad de hacer una montura totalmente nueva
en el 0.84 mts, en vez de continuar con gastos para "mejorarlo"
<LI>Darle mas importancia a la divulgaci&oacute;n
<LI>Instalar un peque&ntilde;o telescopio y un sal&oacute;n para atenci&oacute;n a visitantes
<LI>Considerar la posibilidad de contratar personal para atender a los
visitantes
<LI>Se dijo que deber&iacute;a considerar el traslado a SPM del telescopio de
1 mt que est&aacute; en Tonantzintla
<P>

<P>
2) Esteban Luna. Optica
<P>
Habl&oacute; sobre la calidad &oacute;ptica de nuestros tres telescopios. Mencion&oacute;
que a principios de a&ntilde;o el telescopio de 2 mts ten&iacute;a la peor calidad,
pero que con la instalaci&oacute;n del soporte activo, esta mejor&oacute; 
al menos
por un factor de 2, y hoy es tan buena como la del telescopio de 0.84 mts.
Se se&ntilde;alaron los siguientes problemas y se hicieron varias sugerencias:
<P>
<LI>Se se&ntilde;al&oacute; que los telescopios de 2.1 y 1.5 mts tienen 
problemas de astigamtismo
<LI>No hubo acuerdo respecto a que tipo de secundario conviene:
semiactivo, como el que se est&aacute; construyendo para el 1.5 mts,
o pasivo, como el que se piensa construir para el 0.84 mts
<LI>Se mencion&oacute; que no era notoria la mejora en la calidad de la
imagen &oacute;ptica con la instalaci&oacute;n del soporte activo
<LI>Se record&oacute; que la calidad de la &oacute;ptica es solo
una componente de la calidad de la im&aacute;gen
<LI>Se recomienda realizar medidas de seeing dentro y en la vecindad
de los telescopios, as&iacute; como medidas de microclima al interior de
los edificios, en la c&uacute;pula y en el propio telescopio (se hizo 
notar que hay turbulencia en el interior del tubo del 0.84 mts)

La instrumentaci&oacute;n en el Observatorio Astron&oacute;mico
Nacional y sus perspectivas. <BR>

</CENTER>
</H2>

<P>
El Observatorio Astron&oacute;mico Nacional cuenta actualmente
con tres telescopios, cuyos di&aacute;metros primarios son 2.12
m. 1.5m y 84 cm. A continuaci&oacute;n describo brevemente los
instrumentos asociados a cada uno, algunos de los cuales pueden
intercambiarse entre los telescopios.
<P>
<U><B>Telescopio de 2.12m. </B></U>
<P>
Este telescopio, con un dise&ntilde;o &oacute;ptico Ritchey-Chretien,
cuenta con tres <B>secundarios</B>: F/7.5, F/13.5 y F/30. Los
dos primeros fijos y el &uacute;ltimo oscilante.
<P>
<U><B>Guiadores:</B></U>
<P>
Cuenta con un <B>guiador exc&eacute;ntrico</B> que consta de un
espejo m&oacute;vil, dos semifijos y una c&aacute;mara con un
CCD TH7882, enfriada termoel&eacute;ctricamente a -45&#186;C.
El sistema se controla desde una PC y tiene capacidad de autoguiado.
Actualmente no permite el acceso al BSC ni permite el movimiento
en offset.
<P>
Existe otro <B>guiador</B>, desarrollado en el Observatorio de
Brera, en <B>Mil&aacute;n</B> que si permite el movimiento en
offset, pero produce vi&ntilde;eteo en campos mayores a 4' y no
permite rotar completamente los instrumentos en la platina; se
usa con una Macintosh.
<P>
<U><B>Espectr&oacute;grafos:</B></U>
<P>
Existe un <B>espectr&oacute;grafo Echelle</B>, fabricado en los
70's por REOSC, el cual cuenta ahora con una c&aacute;mara que
permite, con la rejilla echellette de 300 l/mm, una cobertura
espectral con traslape de &oacute;rdenes desde 4500 a 7000 &Aring;
(puede abarcarse desde 3000 &Aring; a 11000 &Aring; en tres o
cuatro intervalos). Existen dos rejillas echellette para este
espectr&oacute;grafo: 300 l/mm @ 4&#176; y 900 l/mm @ 14.3&#176;;
&eacute;sta &uacute;ltima era &oacute;ptima para observaciones
en placa fotogr&aacute;fica. La rejilla echelle principal est&aacute;
grabada en un &aacute;rea de 254mm &#215; 128mm con 79 lines/mm.
El &quot;blaze&quot; es de 63&#176;433 y el &aacute;ngulo de incidencia
es de 71&#176;. 
<P>
Recientemente se ha adquirido una rejilla adicional de 500 l/mm
optimizada en el azul y una l&aacute;mpara de comparaci&oacute;n
de Th-Ar. Este espectr&oacute;grafo est&aacute; equipado con una
c&aacute;mara intensificada en el ocular, que, dicho sea de paso,
ya ha sido &quot;quemada&quot; por alg&uacute;n(os) usuario(s).
Actualmente se est&aacute; trabajando para integrar varios cuadros
de video en un &quot;frame-grabber&quot;.
<P>
Un <B>espectr&oacute;grafo</B> adicional, un <B>Boller &amp; Chivens</B>,
propiedad del Observatorio de Brera, complementa la capacidad
espectrogr&aacute;fica del telescopio. Tambi&eacute;n est&aacute;
equipado con una c&aacute;mara intensificada en el ocular. Para
este espectr&oacute;grafo se tiene:

<P>
<B>CCDs:</B>
<P>
Existen tres c&aacute;maras operativas con CCDs, que se comparten
con los otros telescopios. Son las siguientes:
<P>
<B>- CcdMil (THX 31156, equivalente al TH7896A)</B>. Ccd criog&eacute;nico
(-90 &#176;C) iluminado frontalmente. Con 1024 x 1025 pixeles
de 19 &#181;m. Operable desde PC (PMIS) o desde SUN (elmil, desarrollado
en Ensenada). 
<P>
<B>- CcdItaliano (TH 7882)</B>. Ccd criog&eacute;nico (-100 &#176;C)
iluminado frontalmente. Con 384 x 576 Pixeles de 23 &#181;m. Operable
desde PC (PMIS). Modificado en Ensenada, ya que anteriormente
se operaba con una computadora Heurikon. 
<P>
<B>- CcdTek (TEK1024AB)</B>. Ccd criog&eacute;nico (-100 &#176;C)
adelgazado e iluminado por atr&aacute;s. Con 1024 x 1024 Pixeles
de 24 &#181;m. Operable desde PC (PMIS) o desde SUN (eltekmil,
desarrollado en Ensenada). Su eficiencia cu&aacute;ntica alcanza
el 67% a 6500 &Aring; y es del orden de 30 % en el azul (2600
&Aring;).
<P>
<B>Infrarojo: </B>
<P>
Para observaciones en el <B>infrarojo</B>, se tiene un <B>fot&oacute;metro</B>
en botella criog&eacute;nica con un InSb y filtros de banda ancha
JHKL. Recientemente se ha probado con una nueva tarjeta de adquisici&oacute;n
de datos y con un programa desarrollado en Ensenada (el MIR) y
otro desarrollado en Florencia (Lunoc). Se planea seguir us&aacute;ndolo
para analizar ocultaciones estelares.
<P>
Se cuenta tambi&eacute;n con el sistema <B>CAMILA</B>, pr&aacute;cticamente
liberado, tanto en su versi&oacute;n de imagen directa como en
su versi&oacute;n espectrogr&aacute;fica. Su detector es un NICMOS
III de 256 x 256 y permite observar desde 1 hasta 2.5 micras;
cubre un campo en imagen directa de 123&quot; x123&quot; .
<P>
<B>OTROS:</B>
<P>
A punto de liberarse, se tiene tambi&eacute;n el sistema <B>PUMA,
</B>que b&aacute;sicamente es un reductor focal, un interfer&oacute;metro
de Perot-Fabry y una rueda de filtros. El detector actualmente
utilizado es el CcdTek. 
<P>
Recientemente, el grupo de instrumentaci&oacute;n de Ensenada
ha desarrollado un sistema de <B>&oacute;ptica activa</B> que
consta de 18 bolsas de aire controladas de manera independiente
y que permiten modificar ligeramente la figura del espejo primario
del telescopio de 2.12 m. Se han conseguido excelentes resultados,
especialmente con el secundario F/13.5.
<P>
Este telescopio pronto estrenar&aacute; tambi&eacute;n un nuevo
<B>sistema de control,</B> que reemplazar&aacute; a la consola
que tan buen servicio ha dado ya por m&aacute;s de 15 a&ntilde;os.
<P>
<B>Telescopio de 1.5 m. </B>
<P>
Este telescopio cuenta con s&oacute;lo un <B>secundario</B>, un
<B>F/13.05</B>. 
<P>
Cuenta con un <B>guiador</B>, con capacidad de autoguiado y de
movimientos en offset. Cuenta con un espejo diagonal con un segmento
el&iacute;ptico insertable, un intensificador de imagen y una
c&aacute;mara Lynxx con un CCD de 192 x 165 pixeles, enfriado
termoel&eacute;ctricamente. El sistema se controla desde una PC.
<P>
Este telescopio cuenta con un <B>sistema de control</B> basado
en una PC.
<P>
El instrumento de batalla de este telescopio es un fot&oacute;metro
de seis canales, denominado &quot;dan&eacute;s&quot;, para fotometr&iacute;a
Str&ouml;mgren <I>ubvy-H&szlig;</I>, que usa tubos fotomultiplicadores
no enfriados con fotoc&aacute;todos bialcalinos EMI 9789QA.
<P>
Tambi&eacute;n se utiliza este telescopio para imagen directa
con cualquiera de los ccds mencionados antes, usando un portafiltros
manual y, en ocasiones, un reductor focal sencillo con reducci&oacute;n
0.4.
<P>
Actualmente se encuentra en desarrollo una montura para el secundario
con 5 grados de libertad que permitir&aacute; una m&aacute;s f&aacute;cil
colimaci&oacute;n y corregir&aacute; las desviaciones del enfoque.
<P>
Tambi&eacute;n se encuentra en desarrollo un sistema de control
para la c&uacute;pula y un mejor sistema de seguridad. 
<P>
<B>Telescopio de 84 cm. </B>
<P>
Este telescopio tambi&eacute;n cuenta s&oacute;lo con un <B>secundario</B>,
un <B>F/15.7</B>. 
<P>
Actualmente no cuenta con un <B>guiador</B>, pero &eacute;ste
se encuentra en su etapa final de desarrollo y, en unos dos meses
m&aacute;s, estar&aacute; instalado. Ser&aacute; similar al del
1.5 m. 
<P>
Este telescopio cuenta con un <B>sistema de control</B> basado
en una PC y acaba de estrenar una nueva interfaz de usuario en
Windows que permite un manejo m&aacute;s din&aacute;mico, as&iacute;
como un nuevo sistema de seguridad que proteger&aacute; mejor
al telescopio. 
<P>
El instrumento m&aacute;s usado en este telescopio es un fot&oacute;metro
de un solo canal, enfriado con hielo seco, denominado &quot;cuenta-pulsos&quot;,
para fotometr&iacute;a Johnson <I>UVBRI</I>. Cuenta con tubo fotomultiplicador
RCAC31034A-02 de 5 cm de di&aacute;metro con 11 etapas multiplicadoras
y fotoc&aacute;todo de GaAs. Se opera desde una PC. 
<P>
A este telescopio se le tiene asociado otro fot&oacute;metro,
el &quot;doble&quot; o &quot;r&aacute;pido&quot;, pero que ha
sido muy poco usado. Los fotomultiplicadores de este fot&oacute;metro
son un RCA8850 y un RCA4516 (&eacute;ste ha sido sustituido por
un Hammamatsu), que operan a temperatura ambiente. Tambi&eacute;n
se opera mediante una PC. 
<P>
<B>Perspectivas.</B>
<P>
En en base a las necesidades y a las pr&oacute;ximas adquisiciones,
podemos enunciar algunas acciones que deber&iacute;an tomarse.
<P>
- Pronto llegar&aacute; un nuevo <B>CCD de 2000 x 2000</B> que
quedar&iacute;a vi&ntilde;eteado con los filtros actuales. De
manera que deberemos pensar en <B>una rueda computarizada con
filtros</B> m&aacute;s grandes. Sugiero un sistema mec&aacute;nico
similar al de la &quot;Mexman&quot; con un sistema electr&oacute;nico
m&aacute;s inteligente, del tipo de la 'Italiana&quot;.
<P>
- Ya tenemos un <B>Perot-Fabry infrarojo</B> que no puede colocarse
en el espectr&oacute;grafo de CAMILA, por lo que deber&aacute;
pensarse en un nuevo dise&ntilde;o.
<P>
- El espectr&oacute;grafo Boller &amp; Chivens, obviamente, no
es del IAUNAM, por lo que su futuro con el Observatorio Astron&oacute;mico
Nacional en incierto. Por lo tanto, es necesario desarrollar un
espectr&oacute;grafo, que no necesariamente tiene que ser igual.
Puede ser un espectr&oacute;grafo de <B>rendija larga</B>, un
<B>efosc</B> y/o un <B>multifibra</B>. Creo que contamos con la
infraestructura material y humana para lograrlo. 
<P>
En el caso de un <B>efosc</B>, el dise&ntilde;o del <B>PUMA</B>
permite incorporar un grisma, pero la estructura mec&aacute;nica,
en su versi&oacute;n actual, considero que no es adecuada, por
lo que deber&iacute;a pensarse en una nueva mec&aacute;nica, conservando,
quiz&aacute;, la &oacute;ptica. Deber&iacute;a contar con ruedas
de filtros f&aacute;cilmente intercambiables y un carrousel de
l&aacute;mparas modificado.
<P>
- Existe una segunda versi&oacute;n, a medio acabar, del <B>fot&oacute;metro
cuentapulsos</B> y considero conveniente acabarlo, pero, m&aacute;s
a&uacute;n, si se piensa continuar haciendo fotometr&iacute;a
convencional, tal vez sea mejor desarrollar un nuevo fot&oacute;metro
con fototubos enfriados termoel&eacute;ctricamente, en vez de
con hielo seco, como en la actualidad, y optimizando la mec&aacute;nica
para eliminar flexiones.
<P>
- Ya se han visto las bondades de la <B>&oacute;ptica activa</B>,
por lo que habr&iacute;a que seguirle dando impulso, as&iacute;
como a la <B>&oacute;ptica adaptiva</B>. 
<P>
- La adquisici&oacute;n de datos mediante los CCDs comerciales
no es tan eficiente como uno quisiera, por lo que habr&iacute;a
que impulsar el desarrollo de <B>controladores de CCD</B> dise&ntilde;ados
para el Observatorio Astron&oacute;mico Nacional, que funcionen
de manera independiente de la computadora, con una interfaz SCSI
y transmisi&oacute;n de datos v&iacute;a fibra &oacute;ptica.
Tambi&eacute;n ser&iacute;a productivo hacer nuestros propias
c&aacute;maras con CCDs peque&ntilde;os para guiado o para adquisidores
de campo.
<P>
- Hasta donde tengo conocimiento, se est&aacute; adquiriendo un
nuevo NICMOS de 1024 x 1024, un sistema completo con un FPA (InSb)
de 256 x 256 para observaciones de 1 a 5 micras, un sistema completo
con un BIB (Si:As MF) de 128 x 128 para observaciones de 2 a 28
micras (ambos sistemas de Infrared Labs) y un detector IBC (Si:As
HF) de ingenier&iacute;a de 320 x 240, sensible tambi&eacute;n
de 2 a 28 micras. Todo esto nos dar&aacute; un gran potencial
en el infrarojo, por lo que se hace necesario pensar en un nuevo
secundario F/30. 
<P>
Y, haremos un nuevo telescopio de 6.5 m? En mi humilde opini&oacute;n,
el 2m estar&aacute; quedando sobreinstrumentado. Y como &quot;nos
sobran frijoles, hay que poner otra tortilla&quot;.

Leonel analiz&oacute; detalladamente el estado actual de cada telescopio del OAN en SPM y su instrumentaci&oacute;n as&iacute; como las perspectivas futuras. Aunque existe una copia de los acetatos que detallan todo esto, me voy a referir en particular a lo que cre&iacute;  mas importante y tratar&eacute; de plasmar los comentarios y preguntas mas interesantes de cada aspecto. La pl&aacute;tica de Leonel fu&eacute; organizada por telescopios y su instrumentaci&oacute;n. Seguir&eacute; la misma organizaci&oacute;n para lo expuesto por Leonel y pondr&eacute; en cada secci&oacute;n los comentarios que se presentaban. Al final pongo una parte de preguntas y comentarios generales.

<H3>
<LI>Secundarios.
<P>
Los secundarios son f/7.5, f/13.5 y el oscilante f/30. Los dos primeros son de dificil alineaci&oacute;n. Se podria seguir el ejemplo del telescopio de 1.5 y cosntruir un sistema de alineaci&oacute;n motorizada. Esta costar&iacute;a  30,000 US para cada secundario. El secundario f/30 no mantiene su posici&oacute;n con el voltaje aplicado. Se piensa construir otro nuevo secundario f/30, posiblemente
superligero.
<P>
<LI>Guiadores
<P>
Contamos actualmente con dos guiadores: el de Brera y el de M&eacute;xico. En este &uacute;ltimo no existen cat&aacute;logos como en los de Brera. El de Brera introduce vi&ntilde;eteo cuando los campos son mayores que 4' (para f/7.5).
<P>
<LI>Espectr&oacute;grafo Echelle REOSC
<P>
Con la c&aacute;mara actual y la rejilla echelette de 300 l/mm permite una cobertura espectral con traslape de &oacute;rdenes de 4500 a 7000 A.
Por secciones se puede acceder de 3000 a 11000 \AA. Recientemente se ha adquirido una rejilla adicional de 500 l/mm  optimizada en el azul y una l&aacute;mpara de comparaci&oacute;n
de Th-Ar. El espectr&oacute;grafo est&aacute; equipado con una c&aacute;mara intensificada en el ocular. Esta ya ha sido ``quemada" por algunos usuarios. Se trabaja actualmente para integrar varias imagenes de esta c&aacute;mara en un "frame grabber".

Preguntas y Comentarios Generales
</H2>
<P>
<H3>
<P>
O. Harris. Cambi&eacute; de opini&oacute;n sobre la forma de alinear la &oacute;ptica de los telescopios. Antes de pensar en el sistema de alineaci&oacute;n de los secundarios debemos entender como se hace la alineaci&oacute;n con el sistema de &oacute;ptica activa. Antes el primario era referencia. Ahora es el secundario del telescopio y es el primario que se alinea con respecto a aqu&eacute;l.
<P>
L. Salas. Monet me explic&oacute; que es as&iacute; como se hace en el CFHT. Esto confirma el comentario de Oswaldo.
<P>
G. Tovmassian. Se debe pensar en un fot&oacute;metro de 5 canales 
simult&aacute;neos y hacer polarimetria.
<P>
M. Rosado. Tengo dos comentarios: i) No he visto la espl&eacute;ndida imagen que dicen obtener los &oacute;pticos con el sistema de &oacute;ptica activa. Tengo mis reservas al respecto y quiero ver si la imagen buena es reproducible; ii) La fotometr&iacute;a era obsoleta seg&uacute;n cre&iacute;. Sin embargo hay muchos problemas astron&oacute;micos que se pueden resolver. Se debe formar un grupo de fotometristas que interact&uacute;e con los instrumentistas.
<P>
L. Guti&eacute;rrez. No habl&eacute; del fot&oacute;metro Franc&eacute;s. Ese lo utiliza s&oacute;lo Manolo. Hay que hacer nuevos fot&oacute;metros dobles.
<P>
L. Salas. Se deber&iacute;a pensar en hacer la fotometr&iacute;a con los CCD's.
<P>
L. Guti&eacute;rrez. Hay problemas de velocidad. Los fotometristas a veces miden variaciones r&aacute;pidas que para los CCD's ser&iacute;a dificil medir.
<P>
J. Bohigas. Yo creo que los fotometristas deben decidir.
<P>
S. Levine. Por que no tenemos perfeccionada la tecnica para hacer los 
campos planos?. Esto se debe hacer bien en el 2m y en el 1.5m.
<P>
M. Moreno. Hacer los planos es dificil en el 1.5m
<P>
S. Levine. Hay descripciones claras de como se hace esto en Kitt Peak.
<P>
J. Bohigas. 
El secundario del 1.5m debe ser prioritario. Por que el 1.5m no tiene bolsas?. R- Discusi&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica....
<P>
J. Valdez. Entiendo que el nuevo mecanismo del 1.5m podr&aacute; alinear la &oacute;ptica en posiciones extremas y mantener buena calidad de imagen.
<P>
J. Bohigas. No hay que confundir la calidad &oacute;ptica de la imagen
con la calidad total de la imagen. Falta en la lista de Leonel el manejo remoto de los telescopios como una prioridad. Se debe adem&aacute;s automatizar toda la instrumentaci&oacute;n. Lo que se destaca es que hay mucho trabajo y los esfuerzos no han sido iguales. La chamba no est&aacute; balanceada entre CU y Ensenada (Instrumentaci&oacute;n).

<P>

En los &uacute;ltimos 5 a&ntilde;os se han presentado 4 propuestas para 
situar un 
gran telescopio en el OAN: el proyecto Columbus, el TIM, la r&eacute;plica del 
Magallanes y la concesi&oacute;n del OAN al GTB. El que se hayan dado tantas 
propuestas de tal magnitud en tan poco tiempo, revela deficiencias en la
planeaci&oacute;n del IA. Por ello no extra&ntilde;a que los resultados 
no hayan 
sido los deseados. Si deseamos tener un gran telescopio es 
importante identificar y corregir las fallas en la estrategia 
seguida hasta ahora. En mi opini&oacute;n esta ha flaqueado en lo
siguiente:


<P>

1) No hay claridad respecto a los puntos que debemos considerar
irrenunciables, y ha faltado una definici&oacute;n expl&iacute;cita sobre las 
necesidades del OAN. Es por ello que carecemos de una estrategia
bien definida de desarrollo.

<P>

2) Las propuestas presentadas, de muy distintos alcances y significado, han 
llegado hasta las mas altas instancias sin que mediara una discusi&oacute;n
amplia sobre los posibles efectos que tendr&iacute;an en el OAN.

<P>

3) Se supedit&oacute; la pol&iacute;tica del IA a circunstancias externas. 
Las propuestas que se han presentado han sido, en mayor o menor 
grado, proyectos ``prestados", resultado de ``oportunidades" coyunturales.


<P>

4) Se prest&oacute; poca atenci&oacute;n al contexto socioecon&oacute;mico en el 
que se desarrolla el IA, y ha habido poca sensibilidad pol&iacute;tica 
para auspiciar la construcci&oacute;n de un gran telescopio en M&eacute;xico. 
En particular, se minimiz&oacute; la posibilidad de que el IA e instituciones 
nacionales (industria o centros de investigaci&oacute;n), pudieran dise&ntilde;ar 
y desarrollar partes sustanciales de un gran telescopio.

<U><B>I. Puntos b&aacute;sicos sobre la pol&iacute;tica de desarrollo del OAN </B></U>
</H2>
<H3>
<P>

En mi opini&oacute;n, la pol&iacute;tica de desarrollo del OAN debe descansar en
tres premisas b&aacute;sicas:

<P>
<LI> Preservar el control nacional del OAN 
<LI> Ser siempre propietarios y usuarios de la mayor y mejor
parte del OAN
<LI> Propiciar que el OAN sea el principal observatorio
instalado en M&eacute;xico
<P>

Para ello, hoy en d&iacute;a deber&iacute;amos seguir en conjunto las 
siguientes l&iacute;neas de desarrollo:

<P>

(1) A corto y mediano plazo, aumentar nuestros recursos humanos 
de alto nivel, en particular en las &aacute;reas t&eacute;cnica y 
observacional. 
Es necesario no dejar de impulsar proyectos tecnol&oacute;gicos,
y fortalecer el posgrado en lo referente a astronom&iacute;a
obsevacional, area que no ha recibido todo el cuidado que merece.

<P>

(2) Optimizar la utilizaci&oacute;n de los recursos instrumentales, y
modernizar continuamente la infraestructura existente a todos 
los niveles.

<P>

(3) Dada la proliferaci&oacute;n de nuevas tecnolog&iacute;as y &aacute;reas de 
investigaci&oacute;n, propiciar un men&uacute; instrumental variado y una 
amplia cobertura espectral.

<P>

(4) Desarrollar uno o mas telescopios de nueva tecnolog&iacute;a e
instrumentaci&oacute;n de vanguardia.

<P>

(5) Asegurar suficiente tiempo de observaci&oacute;n en un telescopio 
de gran di&aacute;metro.

<U><B>II. Efectos y posibilidades de las distintas alternativas para tener
un gran telescopio en el OAN </B></U>
</H2>
<H3>
<P>

La instalaci&oacute;n de cualquier gran telescopio debe estar condicionada
a no comprometer o arriesgar el control nacional del OAN. En todo momento 
debemos ser propietarios y potenciales usuarios de la mayor y mejor
parte de la capacidad instalada en el OAN. Y aunque ning&uacute;n proyecto 
debe ser rechazado o aceptado {\it a priori}, siempre 
debemos cuidar cuando y en que condiciones conviene
establecer compromisos espec&iacute;ficos. Hay un amplio abanico
de tipos de proyecto para instalar un gran telescpio en el OAN:
desde concesiones de partes del observatorio, hasta dise&ntilde;ar y
construir un telescopio con recursos propios, pasando por diversos
grados de colaboraci&oacute;n. Es instructivo detenerse en las posibilidades
mas extremas.


<P>
</H3>
<H2>
<U><B>Posibles efectos de una concesi&oacute;n (GTB)  </B></U>
</H2>
<H3>
<P>

El principal atractivo de concesionar parte del OAN a un gran telescopio
extranjero es que minimiza costos financieros y humanos. Dada la
situaci&oacute;n actual del pa&iacute;s, este es un argumento de mucho peso.
Pero hay otras consideraciones, tanto o mas importantes, que hay que 
tomar en cuenta: tiempo de observaci&oacute;n, desarrollo acad&eacute;mico,
y, sobre todo, posibles efectos a mediano y largo plazo sobre el 
control del OAN.

<P>

En una concesi&oacute;n (GTB) se podr&iacute;a obtener entre 10 y 20% de tiempo 
de telescopio (probablemente 13%), o sea entre 30 y 60 noches mexicanas al 
a&ntilde;o, distribuidas igualmente entre obscuras, grises y con luna. 
En 5 a&ntilde;os, cuando el GTB est&eacute; en operaci&oacute;n, es posible que haya 45 usuarios, distribuidos en 11 o 12 proyectos (4 personas por proyecto).
En condiciones realistas (13% de tiempo, con nubes o fallas), se
tendr&iacute;an 3 noches al a&ntilde;o por proyecto al instalarse el telescopio.
Es decir,  la instalaci&oacute;n del GTB en el OAN no satisface, 
por si sola, los requerimientos de tiempo en un gran telescopio.

<P>

Se ha mencionado que una de las posibles derramas de la instalaci&oacute;n
del GTB en el OAN ser&iacute;a auspiciar el desarrollo acad&eacute;mico.
En lo que toca a instrumentaci&oacute;n, cabe recordar que esta actividad crece 
con la pr&aacute;ctica, y en consecuencia podr&iacute;a beneficiarse si 
los instumentistas se involucraran en el desarrollo 
y construcci&oacute;n del GTB y su instrumentaci&oacute;n. El dise&ntilde;o
conceptual del GTB fu&eacute; concluido en 1988, y es probable que ya
est&eacute; desarrollado el grueso del dise&ntilde;o detallado. 
M&aacute;s a&uacute;n,
ya se han especificado las instituciones que desarrollan y construyen
las principales componentes del proyecto (espejos, telescopios,
c&uacute;pula). Es decir, las posibilidades para que podamos desarrollar 
instrumentaci&oacute;n parecen ser escasas. Por otra parte, cabe preguntarse 
hasta que punto conviene comprometer recursos humanos y financieros (que
probablemente saldr&iacute;an del pa&iacute;s) en un proyecto 
sobre el que tenemos poco control y, a lo sumo, un 20% del tiempo.
En lo que se refiere a investigaci&oacute;n b&aacute;sica, cabe preguntarse si
la intenci&oacute;n (e inter&eacute;s) del consorcio GTB es instalar una
estaci&oacute;n de apoyo y servicio o, adem&aacute;s, 
un centro acad&eacute;mico 
asociado. Dadas las caracter&iacute;sticas de las instituciones
asociadas al GTB, pienso que es m&aacute;s probable lo primero. 
Si es as&iacute;,
la presencia del GTB en el OAN tendr&aacute; un impacto acad&eacute;mico
siempre y cuando el IA en Ensenada sea atractivo. En otras palabras,
el desarrollo acad&eacute;mico de Ensenada no depende de esta variable
externa.

<P>

Finalmente cabe preguntarse cuales ser&iacute;an los posibles efectos
pol&iacute;ticos que tendr&iacute;a concesionar el OAN en estos momentos. 
La visi&oacute;n m&aacute;s optimista es que propiciar&iacute;a 
el financiamiento
para la construcci&oacute;n de un telescopio mayormente nacional, 
al demostrarse 
la calidad astron&oacute;mica de SPM con la instalaci&oacute;n de un telescopio 
extranjero (efecto Malinche). Asimismo, se podr&iacute;a pensar que el 
argumento de no dejar 
el OAN en manos extranjeras jugar&iacute;a a nuestro favor. En el otro extremo
estar&iacute;a el argumento de costos. Las concesiones son, sin duda,
la opci&oacute;n mas barata, por lo que la autoridades pol&iacute;ticas pueden
arg\"uir que el camino a seguir es el de otorgar un mayor n&uacute;mero de 
concesiones, en principio hasta disponer de suficiente tiempo de telescopio,
ya que as&iacute; se optimizar&iacute;a el uso de recursos destinados a
la astronom&iacute;a nacional. Desde esta otra perspectiva, perder&iacute;amos 
el control efectivo del observatorio, pues se dispersar&iacute;a en 
varios centros. Dado el clima econ&oacute;mico y la ideolog&iacute;a 
predominante 
(``globalizaci&oacute;n" tercermundista), me inclino a pensar que el escenario 
pesimista conviene y se adapta mejor a la clase pol&iacute;tica mexicana.

<P>

En conclusi&oacute;n, los beneficios que se derivan de concesionar el OAN 
a un telescopio extranjero no son sustanciales. En particular, la 
concesi&oacute;n al GTB solo resolver&iacute;a una peque&ntilde;a fracci&oacute;n de 
nuestras necesidades de tiempo, y de cualquier forma deber&iacute;amos
generar otros proyectos. De darse una concesi&oacute;n en estos momentos, no es 
improbable que inicie un proceso irreversible de p&eacute;rdida de control
del OAN, convertirti&eacute;ndolo en un prestador de servicios b&aacute;sicos, en
una especie de maquiladora cient&iacute;fica. A mi juicio, hoy en d&iacute;a 
una concesi&oacute;n entabla mas riesgos que beneficios, y por ello no es 
recomendable. 

<P>

<H2> 
<U><B>Proyectos Nativos </B></U>
</H2>
<H3>
<P>

Nuestra pol&iacute;tica de desarrollo debe partir de la
hip&oacute;tesis de que podemos concebir y desarrollar un proyecto de
gran telescopio, en tanto que esta ser&iacute;a la situaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s
ben&eacute;fica para el desarrollo acad&eacute;mico de la instituci&oacute;n, pero
con la condici&oacute;n de ``aterrizar" este marco &oacute;ptimo evaluando
los recursos humanos y materiales disponibles tanto en el IA como
en otras instituciones nacionales.

<P>

A partir de 1989 se ha operado un cambio muy positivo en el OAN.
El departamento de instrumentaci&oacute;n, con la participaci&oacute;n
de varios astr&oacute;nomos a distintos niveles, ha concluido o est&aacute;
por concluir (fase de construcci&oacute;n) entre 20 y 30 
<A HREF="jbb2ap1.html">proyectos</A> de muy
diversos grados de complejidad, que han tenido un fuerte impacto en la
investigaci&oacute;n que realizamos, subsanando a&ntilde;ejas deficiencias y 
limitaciones en la infraestructura del OAN. Ha sido 
particularmente satisfactorio el trabajo desarrollado en las areas
de mec&aacute;nica, electr&oacute;nica y programaci&oacute;n, pero es justo se&ntilde;alar
que tambien hay avances en el departamento de &oacute;ptica,
que ha contribuido con varios dise&ntilde;os e implementado m&eacute;todos
para mejorar la calidad de la imagen (soporte del primario del
2 metros, secundario del 1.5 metros). La mayor parte 
de estos proyectos se ha desarrollado en Ensenada, con un grupo de 
trabajo constituido hace no mas de 6 a&ntilde;os, y con muchos de sus
integrantes sin experiencia laboral previa. Este es un elemento
alentador en lo que se refiere a la factibilidad de realizar
partes sustanciales de un gran telescopio con recursos humanos
propios. Desgraciadamente el panorama no es alentador en referencia al
grupo de instrumentaci&oacute;n en CU, que ha tenido un bajo rendimiento
en los &uacute;ltimos 6 a&ntilde;os. A la luz de su historial, 
logros y experiencia, 
de los recursos humanos y materiales que dispone, del peso que tiene
en la definici&oacute;n de la pol&iacute;tica instrumental y de que 
no carga con la reponsabilidad de la operaci&oacute;n del OAN, ello
parece injustificable. Creo que este bajo rendimiento no es accidental, que
en gran medida es resultado de su distanciamiento del OAN. Mientras
ello sea as&iacute;, es dif&iacute;cil que el grupo de instrumentaci&oacute;n 
en CU 
tenga un papel importante en la construcci&oacute;n de un gran 
telescopio, situaci&oacute;n desafortunada dado que, con sus actuales
recursos humanos, el grupo en Ensenada dificilmente podr&aacute;
abarcar la multitud de tareas inherentes a un proyecto de esta
magnitud. En consecuencia deben tomarse varias medidas institucionales
en lo que se refiere a pol&iacute;tica instrumental, y sugiero las siguientes:
  
<P>

(a) En la medida en que la mayor parte de la instrumentaci&oacute;n se 
realiza y probablemente se seguir&aacute; realizando en 
Ensenada, trasladar el eje de la discusi&oacute;n y decisi&oacute;n sobre 
pol&iacute;tica y proyectos instrumentales a esta sede. En concreto 
propongo que la CAL, o una versi&oacute;n ampliada de la misma, asuma
las funciones hasta ahora asignadas a la CAPI y otras que, en
principio, deber&iacute;an ser responsabilidad del CI. 

<P>

(b) Que se analicen con detenimiento las razones por las cuales no se 
ha logrado desarrollar el potencial del grupo de instrumentaci&oacute;n 
en CU. El departamento de instrumentaci&oacute;n ha drenado una gran 
cantidad de energ&iacute;a institucional, y no ofrece el mejor ambiente
para el desarrollo profesional de sus integrantes. Dado su rendimiento
y condiciones de trabajo (lejan&iacute;a del OAN), hay un exceso 
de personal t&eacute;cnico en CU. Sugiero que se considere seriamente 
extender una invitaci&oacute;n para que algunos de ellos se reubiquen en Ensenada.

<P>

(c) Si el IA decide involucrarse en el desarrollo de un gran telescopio,
es indispensable ampliar la planta de personal t&eacute;cnico en Ensenada, tanto
en desarrollo como en mantenimiento.

<P>

Una de las derramas de los &uacute;ltimos 4 a&ntilde;os ha sido que el IA
pudo conocer de cerca varios de los proyectos de vanguardia para
grandes telescopios. Estos contactos se deben seguir cultivando
para seguir aprovechando su experiencia, pero tambien para explorar 
que instituciones nacionales son capaces de resolver problemas 
tecnol&oacute;gicos espec&iacute;ficos. En el pasado se ha dado por descontada
la incapacidad de la industria nacional, y se ha tachado de
``demag&oacute;gica" cualquier sugerencia de mencionarla como posible
contribuyente. Ello refleja nuestro aislamiento, no su incapacidad. 
Por ello creo que fu&eacute; un acierto la reciente decisi&oacute;n del 
CI de contratar al Ing. de la Herr&aacute;n, para que indague el potencial 
de las industrias nacionales. Un esfuerzo similar deber&iacute;a
realizarse con centros de investigaci&oacute;n afines, dentro y fuera de la 
UNAM (CICESE, CIO, INAOE, etc.).

<P>

El financiamiento es una variable externa sobre la que tenemos, 
hoy mas que nunca, muy poco control. Sin embargo debemos partir de la base 
de que, eventualmente y quiz&aacute; en varios plazos, acabaremos por haber
reunido los recursos necesarios. Lo que si est&aacute; en nuestras
manos es planear nuestras actividades para disminuir costos,
preveer un calendario de gastos en el marco de posibles futuros
econ&oacute;micos, y dise&ntilde;ar alternativas al proyecto ``id&oacute;neo".

<P>

Los costos se reducen en la medida que:
<P>
(a) El proceso de dise&ntilde;o, construcci&oacute;n e instalaci&oacute;n est&eacute; 
integrado en una sola unidad. La unidad obvia es el propio IA,
ampliado con recursos de otras instituciones nacionales de
investigaci&oacute;n.
<P>
(b) En donde no tengamos la capacidad de dise&ntilde;ar y/o construir,
contratemos industrias nacionales. Es mas factible obtener
recursos si este es el caso.
<P>
(c) Que exista mas de una instituci&oacute;n de investigaci&oacute;n asociada al
proyecto, nacional de preferencia. Ello sin sacrificar una fracci&oacute;n
apreciable de tiempo de telescopio y, por ning&uacute;n concepto, el
control sobre el OAN. Cabe mencionar que, en el caso de una instituci&oacute;n
extranjera, deber&iacute;amos determinar su nivel de participaci&oacute;n
en base al producto entregado, no al gasto realizado.

<P>

No comparto la opini&oacute;n sobre la disponibilidad autom&aacute;tica de 
los recursos del proyecto BID-CONACyT, y creo que es ilusorio pensar que en
los pr&oacute;ximos 5 a&ntilde;os haya un flujo masivo 
(20 millones de d&oacute;lares)
y sostenido de dinero. En el mejor de los casos podemos pensar en
una inyecci&oacute;n de 5 millones de d&oacute;lares en los pr&oacute;ximos 3 a
5 a&ntilde;os, suficiente para adquirir un espejo de 6 metros
o construir un telescopio de 3 a 4 metros (en E.U. est&aacute;n a la
venta telescopios de 2.5 metros por 1.2 millones de d&oacute;lares, sin
edificio y c&uacute;pula). En las mejores condiciones tendr&iacute;amos un 
telescopio de gran di&aacute;metro en 10 o 15 a&ntilde;os, 
o uno de di&aacute;metro
intermedio hacia el a&ntilde;o 2000. Si el financiamiento es inferior, 
la alternativa de un telescopio de di&aacute;metro intermedio es la 
&uacute;nica viable a mediano plazo. 

<P>

Para terminar, me parece que el instituto debe abocarse de inmediato
a dise&ntilde;ar, construir e instalar un telescopio de nueva tecnolog&iacute;a 
en el OAN. Debe hacerse con mayor seriedad, conscientes de que implica
mucho esfuerzo y tiempo, de que no se trata simplemente de hacer una
compra o pegarnos a un proyecto maduro. Por lo mismo, no podemos darnos el
lujo de enredarnos en mas discusiones en torno a ``productos de
oportunidad". A fines de 1996 habr&aacute; un exceso de 
<A HREF="jbb2ap2.html">instrumentaci&oacute;n</A>
en el OAN, en particular en el telescopio de 2 metros.
Esta instrumentaci&oacute;n de frontera ser&aacute; subutilizada.
El departamento de instrumentaci&oacute;n ha adquirido una gran madurez, y
estoy seguro que, con pol&iacute;ticas institucionales adecuadas, 
podr&aacute; responder al reto. Por otra parte, de no tener un proyecto
ambicioso, es concebible el estancamiento y eventual dispersi&oacute;n de
este grupo. Es necesario que, aunque fijemos nuestra meta
en un telescopio de 6 o mas metros, estemos conscientes y dispuestos
a involucrarnos, al menos a corto plazo, en un proyecto menos ambicioso.

Haciendo una revisi&oacute;n de la informaci&oacute;n que existe referente a las
coordenadas geogr&aacute;ficas del  Parque Nacional y Reserva Forestal de
San Pedro M&aacute;rtir, elaboramos la tabla de construccci&oacute;n 
revisada del Parque Nacional y determinamos el &aacute;rea de la misma que es 
de 63,000  hect&aacute;reas. Se presenta un plano topogr&aacute;fico con las 
coordenadas de los v&eacute;rtices que definen el pol&iacute;gono correspondiente, as&iacute; 
como las coordenadas geogr&aacute;ficas de los tres telescopios en operaci&oacute;n en 
el Observatorio Astron&oacute;mico Nacional que se encuentra en los terrenos de 
este Parque Nacional, desde el a&ntilde;o de 1967. Se indican algunas de las 
actividades y acciones que en relaci&oacute;n con la operaci&oacute;n del Parque Nacional ha hecho esta instituci&oacute;n de investigaci&oacute;n a lo largo de 
los casi treinta a&ntilde;os que lleva en este parque.

<P>
        La importancia del  Parque Nacional de San Pedro M&aacute;rtir
es sin lugar a dudas un hecho que en un foro como este, es pr&aacute;cticamente 
una  verdad pre-concebida; sin embargo, hay un sinn&uacute;mero de 
peque&ntilde;os cabos que requieren atarse en un momento u otro. En 
este caso, creo que es de singular importancia el tratar de amarrar 
algunos de ellos.      
<P>
    Tenemos la intenci&oacute;n de se&ntilde;alar cu&aacute;les son los l&iacute;mites 
geogr&aacute;ficos del Parque Nacional, con el fin de que los grupos que de
alguna manera est&aacute;n involucrados en los asuntos relacionados con el
Parque Nacional, tengan los elementos necesarios para su utilizaci&oacute;n.

<P>
   Revisando la documentaci&oacute;n de que disponemos citamos en primer lugar
la siguiente:    
   <P>
    En el  decreto presidencial de fecha 21 de febrero de 1947, 
expedido por el Lic. Miguel Alem&aacute;n Vald&eacute;s, se 
declara Parque Nacional a las monta&ntilde;as que forman la Sierra de San 
Pedro M&aacute;rtir, ubicada en Ensenada, Distrito Norte de la Baja California.
En dicho documento, se destina este parque a la  conservaci&oacute;n 
perenne de la flora y fauna comarcanas.  
Asimismo, se se&ntilde;alan los l&iacute;mites al Parque Nacional que 
reproducimos en la  Tabla I.  Se requiere de un segmento 
adicional  (8*-0)} para cerrar el pol&iacute;gono topogr&aacute;fico correspondiente, 
como lo se&ntilde;alamos en dicha Tabla I. Con estos valores, calculamos la
superficie del Parque Nacional que resulta de 69,400 hect&aacute;reas.

Se requiere a&ntilde;adir el segmento que une el punto 8* 
con un &aacute;ngulo de N 8g 55'W y una distancia de 3,780.00, para alcanzar 
el punto 0-San Pedro. Este pol&iacute;gono nos d&aacute; un
&aacute;rea total de 69,400 has. 
</H4>

<P> 
<H3>

     El 25 de abril de 1951, se emite otro  decreto, el cual es 
publicado el 27 de julio de 1951 declarando reserva 
forestal nacional a la Sierra de San Pedro M&aacute;rtir, estableciendo
veda definitiva e indefinida en los bosques de la regi&oacute;n. Se 
presentan algunos argumentos donde se se&ntilde;ala la importancia del bosque 
desde varios puntos de vista, incluyendo la climatolog&iacute;a, la hidrolog&iacute;a, 
la conservaci&oacute;n de las especies, etc. Adem&aacute;s, se cancelan los 
derechos que hab&iacute;an sido otorgados con anterioridad a unos particulares 
para la explotaci&oacute;n forestal de esta regi&oacute;n.
  
  
Un tercer documento es el  decreto presidencial de fecha 12 de 
febrero de 1975 (publicado el 17 de febrero), en el que se declara que 
 es de  INTERES  PUBLICO la conservaci&oacute;n y restauraci&oacute;n de la 
riqueza forestal de las monta&ntilde;as de San Pedro M&aacute;rtir, 
en Ensenada, B.Cfa., 
para ASEGURAR EL DESARROLLO NORMAL DE LA INVESTIGACION ASTRONOMICA, 
geogr&aacute;fica y dem&aacute;s disciplinas afines.
Adem&aacute;s, se le proporcion&oacute; a la UNAM, una superficie dentro de 
la Reserva Forestal y Parque Nacional de San Pedro M&aacute;rtir, para la 
instalaci&oacute;n de un Observatorio Astron&oacute;mico,  ..... (para) la 
investigaci&oacute;n astron&oacute;mica y la divulgaci&oacute;n de estos conocimientos
para integrarlos con las dem&aacute;s ramas de la geof&iacute;sica, geograf&iacute;a,
geolog&iacute;a, biolog&iacute;a e ingenier&iacute;a y otras disciplinas afines.
Tambi&eacute;n, para cumplir con los objetivos, se estima conveniente 
la integraci&oacute;n de una  Comisi&oacute;n integrada por las Secretar&iacute;as 
de Agricultura y Ganader&iacute;a, del Patrimonio Nacional, de Hacienda y Cr&eacute;dito
P&uacute;blico y la UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL AUTONOMA DE MEXICO, se&ntilde;al&aacute;ndose 
que se invitar&aacute; a formar parte de ella al Gobierno del Estado de Baja 
California.

<P>
Otro documento que existe es una copia de una carta 
topogr&aacute;fica hecha por la compa&ntilde;ia PROPIEDADES y DERECHOS, S.A. 
en el a&ntilde;o de 1975. El cuadro de construcci&oacute;n del plano 
del PARQUE 
NACIONAL y RESERVA FORESTAL, fu&eacute; elaborado con datos gr&aacute;ficos tomados en 
agosto y septiembre de 1953, por personal de la Direcci&oacute;n General Forestal y 
de Caza. En dicho plano, se marcan los l&iacute;mites del PARQUE NACIONAL y 
RESERVA FORESTAL de SAN PEDRO MARTIR.
<P>
La Tabla II corresponde al  cuadro de construcci&oacute;n 
de este documento. En esta tabla hemos hecho una correcci&oacute;n a los &aacute;ngulos 
de los puntos  6 y PG, as&iacute; como al segmento de recta  6-PG que 
los une, para reducir al m&iacute;nimo el error de cierre de dicho pol&iacute;gono.
Encontramos adem&aacute;s que se requiere hacer una  rotaci&oacute;n de
6g 36' en este  cuadro de construcci&oacute;n, para poder replicar 
las coordenadas de los puntos se&ntilde;alados en dicho plano topogr&aacute;fico.

  Se se&ntilde;ala en el mismo documento, que:  "Para la localizaci&oacute;n 
geogr&aacute;fica de este plano fue tomado como v&eacute;rtice LA ENCANTADA",
el 
punto m&aacute;s alto de la sierra. Las coordenadas de este punto sobre la 
carta topogr&aacute;fica CETENAL H11B55 escala 1:50,000 del CETENAL (1974), 
(actualmente INEGI) son:
 <P>
30g 59' 30" de latitud NORTE y 115g 22' 25"
de longitud OESTE (este punto tambi&eacute;n es conocido como
 el Picacho del Diablo), con 3,100 metros de altura]. Existe 
una peque&ntilde;a diferencia de 36.5" en latitud y 11.8" en longitud 
(equivalentes a 1.13 y 0.36 km. aproximadamente) entre el punto se&ntilde;alado 
y el reportado en el mencionado documento. 
<P>

 Con la correcci&oacute;n aqu&iacute; se&ntilde;alada, procedimos a calcular las coordenadas 
de cada uno de los v&eacute;rtices indicados en las tablas anteriores, mismas 
que se encuentran en la Tabla III. Hicimos tambi&eacute;n el 
c&aacute;lculo de la superficie del PARQUE NACIONAL y RESERVA FORESTAL 
obteniendo un total de 62,986.6 Hect&aacute;reas.
 <P>
Para concluir con esta secci&oacute;n, reproducimos tambi&eacute;n un 
<A HREF="alv1.gif">plano</A> (Alvarez, 1983, Contrib. 123, IA-UNAM), 
en donde se indican 
los l&iacute;mites del Parque Nacional y Reserva Forestal de San Pedro

   Para algunas de las investigaciones astron&oacute;micas que se han hecho en el 
OAN, se requiere conocer con gran precisi&oacute;n, la posici&oacute;n geogr&aacute;fica de 
los tres telescopios que existen en nuestras instalaciones,  por lo que 
recientemente Alvarez y Moreno (Reporte T&eacute;cnico CI-95-01. 
IA-UNAM, 1995), efectuaron mediciones 
con un Sistema de Posicionamiento Global (GPS). Se presentan en 
la Tabla IV.  Las mediciones fueron hechas en la
explanada que se localiza a la entrada de cada uno de los tres instrumentos
que se nombran por el tama&ntilde;o de su espejo principal, por lo que las
coordenadas correspondea a la posici&oacute;n de los telescopios cuyo espejo 
principal tiene un di&aacute;metro de 2.12 metros; de 1.50 metros y 0.84 m. 
respectivamente. Adem&aacute;s, se hicieron medidas de otro lugar identificado 
como "torre de seeing".
<P>
Con el mismo tipo de instrumentaci&oacute;n ser&aacute; posible marcar dentro 
del propio bosque, las coordenadas del Parque, de manera que se pueda delimitar 
con exactitud sus l&iacute;mites. Esta ser&aacute; sin duda una de las 
pr&oacute;ximas tareas a efectuarse en el bosque.

</H2>
<H3>
<P>

   Quiero terminar mi intervenci&oacute;n con los aspectos que m&aacute;s 
importancia tienen en una reuni&oacute;n como en la que nos encontramos.  
Esto es, queremos  se&ntilde;alar algunas de las acciones en las que el  
Observatorio Astron&oacute;mico Nacional (OAN) ha participado en el Parque 
Nacional de San Pedro M&aacute;rtir desde su instalaci&oacute;n en estos lugares.
El propio  OAN tiene una historia y una trayectoria mucho m&aacute;s 
rica de lo que aqu&iacute; se&ntilde;alar&eacute;.
<P>
El  Observatorio Astron&oacute;mico Nacional}, depende del
Instituto de Astronom&iacute;a de la Universidad Aut&oacute;noma de M&eacute;xico (UNAM),
y mantiene sus instalaciones de investigaci&oacute;n astron&oacute;mica en el Parque
Nacional de San Pedro M&aacute;rtir. 

<P>
Las principales caracter&iacute;sticas que han hecho de la Sierra de San Pedro 
M&aacute;rtir el lugar id&oacute;neo para la instalaci&oacute;n del observatorio son
las siguientes: a) las condiciones climatol&oacute;gicas que aseguran un 
gran n&uacute;mero de noches y d&iacute;as despejados; b) bajo contenido de 
vapor de agua en la atm&oacute;sfera superior, que permite la observaci&oacute;n desde 
la Tierra en las frecuencias de la luz infraroja; c) es un sitio 
con un cielo sumamente obscuro que favorece la observaci&oacute;n de fuentes
luminosas de poca intensidad; d) muy bajo contenido de contaminantes
(polvo, humo, aerosoles, etc.), lo que tambi&eacute;n contribuye a la buena 
calidad de las observaci&oacute;nes astron&oacute;micas; e) muy baja 
contaminaci&oacute;n por ondas de radiofrecuencias que permite trabajar con 
equipos electr&oacute;nicos sofisticados para la detecci&oacute;n en nuestros programas 
de investigaci&oacute;n; f) muy bajo nivel de turbulencia atmosf&eacute;rica, 
lo que tambi&eacute;n representa una ventaja invaluable para nuestro trabajo 
astron&oacute;mico.
<P>
     Todos estos aspectos hacen que en el Parque Nacional se encuentren 
las instalaciones de la principal infraestructura de investigaci&oacute;n 
astron&oacute;mica del pa&iacute;s. Estas mismas condiciones excepcionales 
hacen 
que M&eacute;xico tenga una gran responsabilidad a nivel mundial para 
protegerlo 
y desarrollarlo sin perturbar sus caracter&iacute;sticas id&oacute;neas.
<P>
    Desde el a&ntilde;o de 1967, en que los primeros astr&oacute;nomos de la UNAM 
llegaron a estos importantes bosques, han sido de hecho, y de 
derecho desde que se expidi&oacute; el DECRETO del a&ntilde;o de 1975, 
los responsables no s&oacute;lo de que el observatorio haya desarollado un 
magn&iacute;fico trabajo de investigaci&oacute;n astron&oacute;mica, sino que han tomado 
bajo su responsabilidad la protecci&oacute;n del bosque en muchos aspectos.  
<P>
   Han participado, junto con la poblaci&oacute;n local que apoya en estas 
acciones, con los guardias forestales y con el Ej&eacute;rcito Mexicano, en el 
control de m&aacute;s de doce incendios relativamente importantes desde 1978 
hasta el incendio que acaba de ser controlado hace apenas pocas semanas.
<P>
   Debido a la presencia del  OAN en la zona, se ha apoyado de manera 
sistem&aacute;tica, los esfuerzos de reforestaci&oacute;n, tanto planeada por  la
creaci&oacute;n de un vivero por los responsables del bosque en 1988, como de 
manera casi aleatoria, como podemos apreciar a lo largo de la carretera que 
 tiene un gran n&uacute;mero de peque&ntilde;os arboles que crecieron al removerse 
la tierra durante su construcci&oacute;n.  
<P>
  Por la permanencia del  OAN en el lugar, la fauna silvestre, en 
particular el Venado y el Borrego Cimarr&oacute;n, han sido tambi&eacute;n protegidos, 
aunque por supuesto, la presencia y el crecimiento que ha tenido este 
observatorio, ha hecho que algunos de estos animales hayan desplazado su 
lugar de vivienda a otros sitios mas alejados;  sin embargo, los astr&oacute;nomos 
y visitantes ocasionales que nos encontramos en la zona, podemos disfrutar 
con frecuencia de la presencia de peque&ntilde;os grupos de estos graciosos 
animales en los alrededores de nuestras instalaciones.
<P>
A lo largo de los a&ntilde;os, el  OAN ha recibido la visita de diversos
grupos de investigadores, estudiantes y t&eacute;cnicos de varias instituciones
como la propia UNAM, el CICESE, la UABC, la SARH, la SCT, etc. entre otros, 
quienes han hecho estudios acerca de la plaga existente en los pinos del 
bosque, tambi&eacute;n han estudiado la fauna silvestre del Parque Nacional, as&iacute; 
como la importancia que tiene el  balance del agua desde el punto de 
vista hidrol&oacute;gico y meteorol&oacute;gico;  varios de los picos 
cercanos a 
nuestras instalaciones tienen antenas de comunicaci&oacute;n que enlazan nuestras 
poblaciones.  
<P>   
   Con regularidad se atiende a peque&ntilde;os grupos de visitantes, 
incluyendo 
escuelas de varios niveles que recorren nuestras instalaciones para conocer
el trabajo de investigaci&oacute;n que se lleva a cabo en el observatorio.
<P>
Los deportistas, en especial los monta&ntilde;istas que recorren el Parque, han 
encontrado en nuestras instalaciones un apoyo en caso de necesidad.
<P>
     Tambi&eacute;n han estado presentes en el bosque, en diversas ocasiones, 
varios grupos de estudiosos extranjeros quienes en colaboraci&oacute;n con 
nuestras propias instituciones contribuyen al conocimiento y cuidado de 
esta interesante e importante reserva. 
  
  <P>
  El propio OAN recibe alrededor de 200 astr&oacute;nomos nacionales y 
extranjeros cada a&ntilde;o quienes llevan a cabo con &eacute;xito cerca de 100
programas de investigaci&oacute;n astron&oacute;mica de trascendental importancia
para la investigaci&oacute;n b&aacute;sica a la que se dedican ese grupo de 
especialistas. 
 <P>
    Los planes de crecimiento del mismo  OAN, requieren que las 
especiales condiciones por las que fu&eacute; cuidadosamente seleccionado
para su instalaci&oacute;n hace ya cerca de treinta a&ntilde;os, sean mantenidas
en su integridad. Por ello, quiero terminar   recalcando la 
importancia que desde su origen se le ha dado al cuidado y desarrollo 
adecuado del lugar, manteniendo el equilibrio entre:  a)  
el crecimiento, tan necesario en esta regi&oacute;n y en las actuales condiciones, 
 b) el cuidado no s&oacute;lo de los recursos naturales  tangibles, 
(como ser&iacute;a el bosque y la fauna de la regi&oacute;n):, sino tambi&eacute;n, 
 c) aquellos otros recursos particulares (climatolog&iacute;a, cielos 
limpios y despejados, bajos niveles de contaminaci&oacute;n por polvo, humo y
radio-frecuencias, etc.) que hemos se&ntilde;alado a lo largo de esta 
exposici&oacute;n

<P>My office view is of Bahia de Todos Santos, and Punta Banda, in the
port city of Ensenada, Baja California, M&eacute;xico, so I have got
an office with a view (though I do not have an on-line image).  Because 
of the recent and on-going construction of several new buildings just 
down hill from the 
<A HREF="http://www.astrosen.unam.mx/Gifs/edif.gif"> observatory </A>,
I am driven to aspire to an office higher up in the building so that I
will once again have a clear view of the cruise ships as they leave
the harbor.

<P>This is me just at sunset stretching my horizons on the middle spire of
Phantom Spires (near Lake Tahoe, CA).  If memory serves aright, the
climb is called <FONT color="#ff00ff">Overeasy</FONT>.

<A HREF = "draft.ps"> One of my last papers</A> on SU UMa's outburst.<br>
SU UMa is the prototype of a subgroup of dwarf novae, which display superhumps in superoutbursts. It was observed during an international campaign dedicated to the observation of the first day of outburst of dwarf novae during February 1986. After the start of a brightening was reported, the star was monitored by IUE, ground-based photometry and spectrophotometry, IR-photometry and Radio observations by VLA. The paper is accepted in Ap.J.

Recently I observed several <A HREF="mailto:elma@astroscu.unam.mx">  nebulae from Parsamian-Petrosian list </A>. Click below the images to retrieve them in full size.<BR>
I'm going to make available up to five different objects. They are in process of preparation. Check it later!!!!

Esta P&aacute;gina Hogar nace, en cierta manera, de tener en un
sitio cosas que me son de inter&eacute;s y que deseo compartir con
una comunidad creciente que tiene aceso a la Red - no entrare aqu&iacute;
en la sicolog&iacute;a o sociolog&iacute;a de tal asunto. Esta 
p&aacute;gina no pretende ser pasiva, en el sentido de ser una larga lista de ligas a otros lugares, que suelen ser solo de inter&eacute;s personal
y reducido, sino que pueda contribuir en el desarrollo 
de quienes la visitan y en el de nuestros pueblos. Se hace innecesario notar el impacto de lo anterior en el mejoramiento de la vida social de nuestras comunidades - especialmente en Latino-am&eacute;rica.

"http://bufadora.astrosen.unam.mx/~aceves/Hceh/indice.html">
Hip&eacute;r-Centro de Educaci&oacute;n Hisp&aacute;no</a></h1>
   </ul>
</ul>


<p>

Si bien en nuestros paises el acceso a la Red por la gran mayor&iacute;a 
de la poblaci&oacute;n esta lejos de realizarse siento que debemos
comenzar a poner a la disposici&oacute;n de los hisp&aacute;no-parlantes 
material en espa&ntilde;ol.  Los materiales a poner tendr&aacute;n
un caracter educativo, desde la escuela elemental hasta el
postgrado.
&Eacute;stos siendo desde cuentos para ni&ntilde;os hasta escritos pol&iacute;ticos, desde como realizar una conserva de alimentos o constru&iacute;r una modesta vivienda hasta el dise&ntilde;o de un receptor de radio, desde el cultivo de trigo y
soya y la crianza de ganado hasta cuestiones modernas de 
agronom&iacute;a, pesca y ganaderia, desde como hacer una protesis
para una pierna o silla de ruedas hasta un tratado de 
fisiolog&iacute;a celular, o desde ense&ntilde;ar a sumar y restar hasta las intrincadas cuestiones de la f&iacute;sica cu&aacute;ntica o de las ecu&aacute;ciones de Einstein.

<p>

 El contribuidor se vera en la responsabilidad moral 
de contestar preguntas y dudas sobre su aporte; al igual que
recibir cr&iacute;ticas constructivas sobre como mejorar su
contribuci&oacute;n.  No se aceptar&aacute;n materiales que
lleven pornograf&iacute;a; es obvio que el cierto tipo de arte
conlleva desnudos -- pero cre&eacute;mos que el sentido moral de nuestros pueblos nos indicar&aacute; qu&eacute; no poner.  Tampoco el 
Hip&eacute;r-Centro contara con una secci&oacute;n de chistes, charras,
o picardias (hay demasiado de eso en las tiendas de libros y
revistas de nuestros Pueblos!).
Dado que 
la intenci&oacute;n y caracter de este Hip&eacute;r-Centro no es la de 
una <i>Lista de Discusi&oacute;n</i> se min&iacute;mizaran las 
aluciones a otros contribuidores de manera personal; usense mejor
referencias al final del documento. El lector es quien
debera ejercitar su juicio en lo que lee; esto especialmente en
el area de las ciencias sociales.
No se impondr&aacute;n
cuestiones de <i>Derechos Reservados</i> a la utilizaci&oacute;n del 
material contribu&iacute;do; aunque se podra solicitar el merecido
reconocimiento. 
Cuestiones de &iacute;ndole tecnol&oacute;gicas deben 
ser acompa&ntilde;adas de orientaciones claras, figuras o planos, lugares donde es posible conseguir los materiales, etc. Es obvio que para evitar que gente usurera lucre con ciertas ideas tecnol&oacute;gicas de otros, sobre todo si son en el aspecto
alimenticio y m&eacute;dico, es menester que se intente patentarlas primero y luego donarnos una version "popular" que sea accesible a todos.

<p>

Es claro que intentar tal empresa un solo
individuo es cosa de locos, pero se nos presenta ahora una oportunidad
no antes aparecida en la historia del hombre; la posibilidad real
de una inter-comunicaci&oacute;n global. Claro, tener la informaci&oacute;n es solo una parte en la educaci&oacute;n de nuestras naciones.

<p>

<i>Estamos solicitando que comienzen 
a contribuir documentos para tal empresa, y nos den la direcci&oacute;n
de acceso a ellas. As&iacute; que adelante!</i>

<p>

Hay en lo anterior hay obviamente varios problemas log&iacute;sticos, que
si d&oacute;nde hacer el dep&oacute;sito de tales documentos? qu&eacute; c&oacute;mo poner documentos extensos? qu&eacute; tipo de formato usar que tenga mayor generalidad? etc, etc. 
Aprovechando las caracter&iacute;sticas de la Red los documentos
se pueden tener en los servidores personales.
Para documentos extensos, creo que lo mejor ser&iacute;a hacer un
barrido electronico y luego pasarlo a texto con algun tipo de paqueter&iacute;a (OCR). El formato dependeria
de lo que se vaya a digitalizar, si es puro texto, ecu&aacute;ciones, 
imag&eacute;nes, etc,- bueno, eso se los dejo a su buen juicio.
Con respecto a qu&eacute; poner, pues definamos algunas areas generales como:

	<ul>
	<li><b>Ciencias Sociales :</b> pol&iacute;tica, econom&iacute;a, historia, filosof&iacute;a, religi&oacute;n, etc.
	<li><b>Ciencias "Exactas":</b> matem&aacute;ticas, f&iacute;sica,
astronom&iacute;a, qu&iacute;mica, biolog&iacute;a, etc.
	<li><b>Ingenier&iacute;as:</b> el&eacute;ctrica,
agropec&uacute;aria, c&iacute;vil, alimentaria, computacional, etc. 
	<li> <b>Literatura:</b> cl&aacute;sica, romantica, moderna,
contempor&aacute;nea, etc.
	<li> <b>Arte:</b> pintura, m&uacute;sica, escultura, teatro, cine
experimental, arquitectura, etc.
	</ul>
Ah&iacute; tienen pues. Y que cada uno empieze a escribir o transcribir su contribuci&oacute;n.
Por lo pronto, pueden mandarme la direcci&oacute;n electronica de 
tal p&aacute;gina y una breve descripci&oacute;n de la misma - unas 
cuantas oraciones bastar&aacute; - recuerden que estamos en 
los primeros pasos de esto!

<p>

Una de nuestros objetivos es que una gran mayor&iacute;a de educadores
en Latino-Am&eacute;rica y Espa&ntilde;a se interesen en participar
en tal proyecto, tanto contribuyendo como beneficiand&oacute;se del
m&iacute;smo. Esperemos que en unos a&ntilde;os exista una gran cantidad de bibliotecas p&uacute;blicas en nuestros pa&iacute;ses tengan acceso al servicio que pretendemos ofrecer. <i> <a href=

Por lo pronto pase a lo  que tenemos!</i></a>.
